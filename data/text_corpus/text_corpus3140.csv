15700,microplastics mps pollution has become one of our time s most consequential issue these micropolymeric particles are ubiquitously distributed across all natural and urban ecosystems current filtration systems in wastewater treatment plants wwtps rely on non biodegradable fossil based polymeric filters whose maintenance procedures are environmentally damaging and unsustainable following the need to develop sustainable filtration frameworks for mps water removal years of r d lead to the conception of bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers these bacterial based naturally secreted polymers display unique features for biotechnological applications such as straightforward production large surface areas nanoporous structures biodegradability and utilitarian circularity diligently techniques such as flow cytometry scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were used to evaluate the feasibility and characterise the removal dynamics of highly concentrated mps polluted water by bc biopolymers results show that bc biopolymers display removal efficiencies of mps of up to 99 maintaining high performance for several continuous cycles the polymer s characterisation showed that mps were both adsorbed and incorporated in the 3d nanofibrillar network the use of more economically and logistics favourable dried bc biopolymers preserves their physicochemical properties while maintaining high efficiency 93 96 these polymers exhibited exceptional structural preservation conserving a high water uptake capacity which drives microparticle retention in sum this study provides clear evidence that bc biopolymers are high performing multifaceted and genuinely sustainable circular alternatives to synthetic water treatment mps removal

on request 1 introduction plastic is everywhere given its high durability stability economic viability and applicability in several economic sectors predominantly in industrial constructional electronic medical and retail plasticseurope 2018 despite concerns plastic production has been exponentially increasing to meet the escalating demand of societal consumerism it has been estimated that 10 of all human generated waste is plastic un environment 2018 despite estimates that the total amount of plastic ever produced exceeds 8000 million metric tons mt geyer et al 2017 global plastic production is projected to double in the next 10 15 years un environment 2018 as plastic production incessantly increases plastic pollution has become a major concern since these polymers tend to accumulate in the environment in fact from the 6300 mt of plastic waste generated as of 2015 roughly 79 4977 mt was accumulated in the natural environment geyer et al 2017 with approximately 13 mt of plastic being leaked to aquatic environments in 2018 alone through indiscriminate disposal un environment 2018 at the current rate the environment is estimated to become home to roughly 12 000 mt of plastic waste by 2050 geyer et al 2017 with plastic debris already comprising 80 of the total waste found in aquatic ecosystems venghaus and barjenbruch 2017 alongside several other critical environmental concerns plastic waste is profiling itself as one of the biggest generational challenges of our time accordingly recent years have sparked another concern within the scientific community microplastics mps pollution mps are defined by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa as small scale plastic debris of all shapes and sizes with a diameter inferior to 5 mm noaa 2020 mps are divided by their origin into two major categories primary and secondary primary mps are intentionally manufactured as small microbeads microspheres and synthetic microparticles aimed at cosmetic medical and general applications galloway et al 2017 on the other hand secondary mps are smaller sized low molecular weight polymer fragments derived from macroplastics undergoing biological chemical and mechanical degradation substantially driven by uv induced photooxidation gewert et al 2015 consequently sites like wastewater treatment plants wwtps have converged a lot of notice in recent times central to urban water distribution these infrastructures have been documented to be massive focal points of mp release ben david et al 2021 edo et al 2020 gatidou et al 2019 horton et al 2021 kay et al 2018 li et al 2018 mintenig et al 2017 ngo et al 2019 ou and zeng 2018 rolsky et al 2020 sun et al 2019 turan et al 2021 xu et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2017 previous studies have reported that despite the use of both filtration and mechano biochemical removal processes an average of 2 million mp particles with less of 300 μm are discharged to urban networks per day verschoor et al 2014 mintenig et al 2017 sun et al 2019 consequently mps have been documented in both raw and treated drinking water koelmans et al 2019 na et al 2021 pivokonsky et al 2018 with polystyrene being one of the most commonly used and hazardous plastic polymers detected in wwtps sun et al 2019 and in the environment alimi et al 2018 sharma et al 2021 aside from the widely documented deleterious effects of mps in aquatic and terrestrial biota hale et al 2020 rezania et al 2018 sun et al 2021 a growing body of evidence has strongly hinted at the direct implication of mps in human health campanale et al 2020 carbery et al 2018 chen et al 2020 cox et al 2019 gupta et al 2019 jin et al 2019 lehner et al 2019 li et al 2020 lu et al 2019 2018 prata 2018 prata et al 2020 schwabl 2020 smith et al 2018 accordingly the first direct evidence of mps in the human placenta of unborn babies has surfaced ragusa et al 2021 these findings were followed by the discovery of mps in the human blood sending shockwaves throughout the world the fact that mps are also vectors for the transport of hazardous chemicals and organic pollutants wang et al 2020 but still represent emerging contaminants with unknown health significance raises extreme concern regarding their potential health risks to permanently exposed humans dick vethaak and legler 2021 gruber et al 2022 it is therefore imperative to find sustainable and environmental fit solutions to tackle this issue most studies on the removal of mps from waters focus on technologies such as coagulation ultrafiltration membranes dynamic membranes or more advanced technological approaches such as membrane bioreactors mbrs poerio et al 2019 unfortunately techniques such as coagulation and ultrafiltration have demonstrated poor removal efficiencies ma et al 2019 more recently approaches such as surface functionalised microbubbles have shown promise in removing mps but present considerable applicability and sustainability hurdles zhang et al 2021 poerio et al have argued that the water and wastewater treatment industries still lack experience and technological expertise to efficiently separate mps from effluents poerio et al 2019 despite mbrs representing the current most promising technology far outperforming conventional hazardous wwtp applied mp removal methods its membranes still represent a focal point of concern poerio et al 2019 these synthetic and organic membranes are non biodegradable fossil based polymers whose fouling and high costs represent major obstacles for the broader adoption of mbrs meng et al 2009 aside both in situ and ex situ fouling removal mechanisms are economically energetically and environmentally unsustainable wang et al 2014 recent data suggest that membrane filtration systems might also be acting as sources of nano and microplastics given their polymeric composition alongside problems raised by the wear stress aging and harsh cleaning cycles throughout the membrane s life cycle the authors emphasise the need to accelerate the development of biomembranes as solutions to this problem ding et al 2021 appropriately bacterial cellulose bc is a polysaccharide produced by specific bacteria genera such as acetobacter spp agrobacterium spp azotobacter rhizobium spp sarcina alcaligenes and pseudomonas lahiri et al 2021 more recently the genus komagataeibacter has garnered considerable interest regarding bc production chen et al 2018 he et al 2020 raiszadeh jahromi et al 2020 singhsa et al 2018 these bc producing bacteria have been shown to produce characteristically similar bc using alternative and sustainable carbon sources vazquez et al 2013 highlighting the fact that production costs can be immensely reduced in industrial setups this exopolymer has been attracting a lot of scientific and industrial interest given its wide range of morphologies physicochemical properties and applications wang et al 2019 structurally bc consists of hydrogen bond c6h10o5 n β 1 4 glucan chains ul islam et al 2012 further the process of bc synthesis is centred around the exocytosis of glucose chains through small pores in the bacterial cell wall these glucose chains form nano and microfibrils that aggregate to form a porous three dimensional network esa et al 2014 shah et al 2013 resulting in the formation of hydrogel matrixes with large surface area and high porosity esa et al 2014 when compared to the cellulose produced by other organisms its high purity peculiar physical properties biocompatibility biodegradability and renewable character makes bc extremely attractive for industrial use wang et al 2019 particularly in the food biomedical pharmaceutical cosmetic and electronic industries portela et al 2019 shah et al 2013 nevertheless it was the absorbent nature of bc that has recently attracted the interest of specialists in the wastewater treatment field regarding its potential use in the removal of contaminants such as dyes and heavy metals isik et al 2018 kurniawan and yamamoto 2013 mohite and patil 2014 wanichapichart et al 2002 given the theoretical physicochemical properties of bc regarding organic micropolymeric particles such as mps these biopolymers were investigated as potential solutions to mps pollution accordingly this laboratory scale work aims to assess the viability of previously unexplored bc biopolymers as removal matrixes of mps from contaminated waters to the best of our knowledge this is the first time bacterial cellulose biopolymers have been explored concerning its remediation potential of microplastics the quantification of several differently treated bc biopolymers regarding removal efficiency and mps retention was determined using flow cytometry to characterise the physicochemical properties of the biopolymer and understand the mechanisms driving the retention of mps techniques such as infrared spectroscopy atr ftir x ray diffraction xrd inverse gas chromatography igc atomic force microscopy afm fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem were used 2 materials and methods 2 1 bc production bc biopolymers were produced by growing komagataeibacter saccharivorans in static conditions in hestrin and schramm hs liquid medium 2 w v glucose g7021 sigma aldrich 0 5 w v peptone 84616 0500 vwr chemicals 0 5 w v yeast extract

6300 pc double beam hs medium was sterilized at 121 c for 15 min after incubation to remove adsorbed cells and culture medium components retained the bc biopolymers were treated with 0 5 m naoh 80 c for 45 min and washed with distilled water until neutral ph bc biopolymers exhibited a wet weight of 22 715 1 519 g and a dry weight of 0 055 0 003 g 99 76 of water bc membrane thickness was measured with a calliper rule electronic digital calliper and the dry weight was determined through a moisture balance gibertini eurotherm at 105 c for 45 min the bc biopolymers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem fluorescence microscopy atomic force microscopy afm inverse gas chromatography igc x ray diffraction xrd and infrared spectroscopy atr ftir the used experimental methodology was described in supplementary material s1 2 2 bc biopolymer treatment bc biopolymers were treated in this study in five different forms to evaluate its effect on filtration efficiency i wet biopolymer w bc ii oven dried 40 2 c biopolymer od bc iii freeze dried savant rt 400 refrigerated condensation trap biopolymer fd bc iv filtered 80 of water content removed under vacuum filtration biopolymer f bc and v drained 80 of water content removed under compression biopolymer d bc a porous plate glass crucible was used to support bc biopolymers in the filtration system during the filtration procedure the mps contaminated water was inserted into the filtration system and passed to a pressure of 7 mbar vacuubrand mz 2c an aliquot of the filtered solution was collected for flow cytometry analysis 2 3 microplastics specimens spherical polystyrene microplastics ps mps with a diameter of 10 µm were purchased from thermo scientific g1000 as a 1 w v suspension with excitation and emission wavelengths of 468 and 508 nm respectively a high concentration mps stock solution was prepared at 10 mg l 1 and stored at 4 c until further use all solutions were prepared in glass flasks to minimize the establishment of electrostatic interactions with their walls also solutions were vortexed before use to guarantee homogeneity 2 4 microplastics removal the mps in the mps contaminated water and the not retained mps in the bc biopolymer were quantified using flow cytometry cytoflex beckman coulter with a blue laser excitation radiation of 488 nm based on recent methodologies kaile et al 2020 tse et al 2022 the ps mps were characterized according to forward scatter fsc side scatter ssc and fluorescein isothiocyanate ftic 525 550 nm emission detection filter the cytexpert software beckman coulter was used to analyze the output data the calibration line was obtained using 0 2 5 5 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 of mps and applied to calculate the concentration of mps in pre and post filtrated water samples 2 5 biopolymer efficiency and flux analysis biopolymer efficiency and continued water absolute and relative fluxes of bc biopolymer were evaluated the biopolymer efficiency assessment was carried out as follows 20 cycles filtration number of 25 ml of mps contaminated water were passed through the bc biopolymers filtered solution aliquots were collected for flow cytometry analysis every two filtration cycles the efficiency was calculated following the eq 1 were n i is the initial number of mps and n f is the number of mps after filtration 1 e f f i c i e n c y n i n f n i 100 the absolute and relative water fluxes were calculated according to kim et al with some adjustments and following eqs 2 and 3 where t f is the filtration time of each cycle v f

where t f is the initial filtration time and t i is the filtration time of each cycle 4 r e s i s t a n c e t f 100 t i 100 2 7 microscopy characterisation 2 7 1 scanning electron microscopy dry bc biopolymers od bc and fd bc were coated with a thin layer of carbon using emitech k950x turbo evaporator and deposited on a steel plate sem micrographs were obtained using the hr fesem su 70 hitachi scanning electron microscopy equipment operating with a 5 kv beam at a 15 6 mm working distance in the field emission mode images were collected at several magnifications from x500 to x30 000 2 7 2 fluorescence microscopy the retention incorporation of mps in the bc network was observed using epifluorescence microscopy on a leica dm2700 p device coupled with a leica dfc450 c digital camera and a coolled pe 300 lite lighting system the fluorescent signal was captured using the i3 450 490 nm 515 565 nm excitation emission filter bc biopolymers were stained with calcofluor white 18909 sigma aldrich for enhanced observation 2 8 data and statistical analysis data representation and statistics were carried out using graphpad prism 8 the d agostino pearson omnibus and kolmogorov smirnov normality tests were used to assess the gaussian distribution of data parametric unpaired t tests or one way anova were applied for normally distributed data while non parametric unpaired mann whitney or kruskal wallis tests were applied for non gaussian distributed data statistical analysis was performed in at least three independent experiments 3 results and discussion in recent years severe environmental and health related concerns have been raised regarding an invisible but highly abundant ubiquitous and still poorly characterized pollutant microplastics mps despite technological advances in mps removal in locations such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps synthetic membrane filtration systems still represent the major point of contention and inviability therefore it is critical to develop solutions that align with biosustainability and circularity expectations here several types of semi or fully dried bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers produced by komagataeibacter saccharivorans were studied to not only to understand its potential as a raw mps removing biopolymer but also in forms that would enable and facilitate industrial adoption and scaling these include wet bc w bc biopolymers oven dried bc od bc biopolymers freeze dried bc fd bc biopolymers filtered bc f bc biopolymers and drained bc d bc biopolymers section 2 2 for details it is important to note that technique applicability is always selectively dependent on the wet or dried nature of the bc biopolymer highlighting that some techniques cannot be applied to wet forms of the biopolymer 3 1 bc biopolymer production and characterization 3 1 1 bc biopolymer production important for understanding its interactions with microplastics mps and industrial applicability scalability assessing a wide range of physicochemical properties regarding bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers is crucial accordingly the optimal culturing conditions of bc biopolymers produced by komagataeibacter saccharivorans were evaluated it was concluded that 2 glucose ph of 3 25 and 7 days of cultivation yielded a maximised time efficient concentration of roughly 2 95 g l 1 fig s1 in line with the literature revin et al 2018 volova et al 2018 the raw wet bc w bc biopolymers exhibited an averaged thickness of 11 583 0 685 mm where 99 76 of the biopolymer s net weight was water given these values and considering the potential industrial applicability of these biopolymers logistics facilitating drying processes were extensively characterised 3 1 2 bc characterization attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir analysis fig s2 showed that structurally both oven drying od and freeze dried fd bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers displayed the expected absorption bands of cellulose around 3347 cm 1 oh stretching vibrations 2899 1434 1373 and 1312 cm 1 ch and ch2 stretching vibrations 1632 and 666 cm 1 ch or oh bending vibration and 1064 cm 1 co stretching vibration of ether groups which is often found within the glucopyranose ring and between the glucose monomers alonso et al 2018 fan et al 2012 faria et al 2019 the sharper peaks observed on the atr ftir spectra corresponding to fd bc biopolymers suggest a more regular structure preserved during the freeze drying process both dried bc biopolymers od bc and fd bc showed similar x ray diffraction profiles fig s3 of cellulose type i with characteristic peaks found at 14 5 16 73 and 22 7 corresponding to the 100 010 and 110 planes respectively despite both exhibiting similar crystallinity levels fd bc biopolymers exhibited considerably larger surface areas table 1 determined by inverse gas chromatography igc igc showed linear adsorption isotherms for both the bc biopolymers corresponding to a type i isotherm typically associated with microporous materials this is strengthened by a high degree of permeability values 76 78 vs 58 10 cm2 min 1 which indicates that the fd bc biopolymers exhibit a higher number of smaller structurally conserved pores consistently the 78 79 crystallinity values registered here are roughly in line with the ones reported in the literature lowest to highest 63 2 ul islam et al 2012 75 2 phisalaphong and jatupaiboon 2008 86 9 andritsou et al 2018 88 0 tsouko et al 2015 and 88 4 jia et al 2017 while od bc biopolymers sbet was considerably higher than the values reported in the literature castro et al 2015 faria et al 2019 mohammadkazemi et al 2017 moreover atomic force microscopy afm was used to characterize the surface topography of the bc biopolymers this ultra high resolution technique highlighted that od bc biopolymers exhibit a rougher surface than fd bc biopolymers fig s4 table 1 also the hypothesis that fd bc biopolymers would present greater preservation of their structural network is confirmed a more substantial pore collapse during oven drying compared to freeze drying is observed these morphological characteristics underscore that the drying process plays a critical role in modulating structural integrity furthermore considering that the bc biopolymers are immersed in water during the filtration process studying the water uptake capacity swelling becomes critical to understanding their behavior during remediation cycles od bc and fd bc biopolymers manifested considerably different swelling behaviors fd bc biopolymers displayed an inflated swelling performance from 659 to 1011 compared to od bc biopolymers taking 3 h to saturate while their oven dried counterparts took 8 h to achieve statistically constant saturation fig s5 this greatly enhanced water uptake ability is likely observed due to the structural conservation of pores during freeze drying unlike their collapse during oven drying effectively corroborating previous data 3 2 removal efficiency of microplastics first the ability of bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers to remove polystyrene microplastics ps mps from contaminated water was evaluated given the venture style nature of the research well characterized and homogeneous spherical ps mps were used in order to focus and streamline the characterization of the biopolymer s remediation potential even macroscopically it was easily discernible to the naked eye that bc biopolymers removed virtually all mps post filtration as schematised in fig s6 flow cytometry was used to quantify the removal efficiency and the concentration of mps retained in the bc biopolymer fig 1 illustrates the removal efficiency of the wet bc w bc biopolymer and each of its treatment variations oven dried od bc freeze dried fd bc filtered f bc and drained d bc after a single filtration cycle the w bc biopolymer displayed the highest removal efficiency at 98 63 0 39 being able to retain 9 47 0 03 mg l 1 of 10 µm ps mps fig 1b respectively moreover the dried od bc and fd bc biopolymers exhibited removal efficiencies of 93 04 2 07 and 96 45 2 22 equating to a retained concentration of 9 05 0 16 and 9 31 0 17 mg l 1 fig 1b correspondingly the semi dried f bc and d bc biopolymers revealed lower removal efficiencies of 92 49 1 69 and 84 15 1 91 retaining 9 01 0 13 and 8 38 0 14 mg l 1 fig 1b respectively despite field studies generally presenting mp concentrations in particles l making the transition to laboratory scale studies difficult concentrations around 9 10 mg l 1 are far higher than those expected at any treatment stage in wwtps blair et al 2019 sun et al 2019 this highlights that bc biopolymers have gigantic mps aggregating capacity and would not act as the limiting factor in the removal of mps still it is important to acknowledge that more complex water matrixes present different challenges regarding the multiplicity of particles and pollutants that might interplay to change the remediation potential of any filter or biopolymer unfortunately this is an issue that is yet to be addressed in different experimental designs to provide critical knowledge before the translation of any environmental friendly biotechnologically enabled solution to real wastewater settings be that as it may representative scattering profiles of ps mps in pre and post filtrated water by od bc biopolymers are shown in fig 1c d exhibiting the exceptionally high retention of mps by and in the biopolymers w bc biopolymers are highly hydrated as the abundance of hydroxyl groups available in cellulose interact with water molecules occupying the entirety of the pores within the bc matrix portela et al 2019 accordingly these characteristics are highly favourable for the interaction and aggregation of mps on and within the hydrogel matrix in view of the industrial applicability and economic scalability that would most likely benefit from dry rather than wet biopolymers the focus was put on the potential use of dry biopolymeric biopolymers hence it was noted that od bc biopolymers exhibited a significantly decreased removal efficiency p 0 0001 compared to w bc biopolymers however no statistical differences were found when comparing w bc to fd bc biopolymers p 0 2439 statistical differences between both dried bc biopolymers od bc and fd bc were reported p 0 0211 these are still highly robust numbers despite statistically lower removal efficiencies around the 95 mark from a microscopical viewpoint fd bc biopolymers are expected to present a more porous structure than an od bc biopolymer given the collapse of the cellulosic fibers due to the oven drying process however as discussed previously these dried biopolymers can swell and re hydrate rapidly to recuperate their complete structural integrity during the filtration process further particle retention is known to result from swelling behaviors typical of hydrogel biopolymers such as bc hamidi et al 2008 these results highlight that water content indeed influences the retention capability of mps in the bc network the superior water uptake capacity exhibited by both od bc and fd bc biopolymers enhances membrane hydration due to high affinity with water molecules effectively potentiating the retention of particles such as mps within the bc matrix in an aqueous solution the preservation of the dried bc microporous structure likely acts as the trap allowing for the retention of water polluting mps therefore and even though drying the bc biopolymers decreased removal efficiencies by 2 18 5 59 this would most likely be outweighed by logistics and economic advantages as they can be more easily transported and stored semi dried bc biopolymers were tested where 80 of their water content was removed by vacuum filtration f bc or mechanical draining d bc the f bc biopolymers presented significantly lower removal efficiencies compared to fully dried w bc p 0 0001 and fd bc biopolymers p 0 0060 but not to od bc biopolymers p 0 9835 on the other hand d bc biopolymers display considerably lower removal efficiencies less 8 34 14 48 compared to every other biopolymer p 0 0001 the vacuum filtration process is only likely to remove the unbound water molecules which play a critical role in maintaining proper hydration levels in the biopolymer these unbound molecules also act as stabilizing intermediates of the pore structure within the network given the establishment of hydrogen bonds with cellulose portela et al 2019 stanisławska et al 2020 removing these molecules results in a spatial narrowing between microfibrils suggesting a decrease in membrane porosity and a lower retention capacity of mps similar to the structural changes observed in the od bc biopolymers it is noteworthy that water affects the polymer s charge which can also affect the adsorption absorption of particles due to electrostatic interactions that is likely to result in the repulsion of particles that settle into the first layers of the polymer despite presenting a more favourable economic and least resource intensive outlook the compression process is the most likely to physically damage the tightly structured porous network of the bc effectively compromising its utility as a filter thus the d bc biopolymers were no longer taken into consideration moving forward overall and to the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating the potential of bc biopolymers as removal filters for ubiquitous water polluting mps still bc biopolymers have been successfully applied to other remediation ends particularly bc has shown promise as a bioadsorbent matrix for removing dyes proteins and heavy metals kurniawan and yamamoto 2013 mohite and patil 2014 wanichapichart et al 2002 this biopolymer has also been shown to be a suitable candidate as an environmental friendly ultrafiltration membrane hassan et al 2017 isik et al 2018 hassan et al documented that bc acts as an exquisite ultrafiltration membrane to remove oil emulsions from water yielding a removal efficiency of 98 3 and 99 3 for stabilized and non stabilized oil emulsions respectively hassan et al 2017 moreover isik et al successfully implemented bc membranes to filter water dyes from the textile industry achieving a 90 9 removal rate isik et al 2018 all these data highlight that bc biopolymers exhibit several other remediation purposes aside from the novel removal of mps shown here these biopolymeric membranes demonstrate a considerable promise as multifaceted genuinely sustainable and circular alternatives to synthetic membrane separation technologies in which membrane bioreactors mbrs stand out as the most prolific scientific solution to date poerio et al 2019 the extremely high removal efficiency numbers coupled with the biosustainable nature and easy economic scalability places bc biopolymers as the best solution to the numerous central issues with fossil based polymeric membranes meng et al 2009 poerio et al 2019 wang et al 2014 that have now called for the urgent development of biomembranes ding et al 2021 this follows reports from our laboratory of similarly effective microalgal based extracellular polymeric substances in aggregating and removing mps cunha et al 2019 2020 highlighting that a multitude of biocompatible alternatives are still in the infancy stages of research and development despite tremendous promise 3 3 bc biopolymers efficiency the implementation viability of new biopolymers is tightly correlated with their resistance and consequent longevity the water uptake ability has been shown to be an important material property to determine hydraulic resistance which is a measure of filtration performance of the bacterial cellulose bc biopolymer kim et al 2017 so to evaluate the hydraulic resistance and removal efficiency of the wet w bc oven dried od bc freeze dried fd bc and filtered f bc biopolymers throughout several 20 filtration cycles a microplastics mps contaminated water solution was continuously passed through the biopolymers with the results summarized in fig 2 given that both od bc and fd bc biopolymers showed remarkably similar behaviors the od bc biopolymer was chosen as the benchmark going forward due to its lower input costs the absolute flux and relative flux were also assessed throughout the 20 filtration cycles fig 3 both the absolute fig 3a and relative fig 3b fluxes were shown to decrease across all biopolymers interestingly the w bc and f bc biopolymers exhibit a flux decrease of 15 22 and 14 57 respectively from the first 1 to the last cycle 20 unlike the od bc biopolymers that exhibit a decrease of 88 30 however this massive decrease is due to comparatively high initial flux values hydrated biopolymer at the end of the 20 cycles the absolute flux value sits at 2 34 ml min 1 between the 1 50 and 3 99 ml min 1 exhibited by the w bc and f bc biopolymers accordingly these results are reflected in fig 3b as the relative flux decreases as described therefore it is logical that initial hydration levels play an essential role in the flux registered here with the effect normalizing as the dried od bc or partially dried filtered f bc biopolymers re hydrate one of the likely reasons is that lower negative zeta potential on the membrane surface acts as an electrostatic barrier against the negatively charged mps particles which results in the repulsion of particles settling in the first layers of the biopolymer kim et al 2017 it is also noteworthy that biopolymers did not present any signs of degradation throughout the 20 filtration cycles the w bc biopolymer maintained the flux constant for 50 cycles 3 4 bc biopolymer resistance the bacterial cellulose bc biopolymer s resistance was assessed throughout 50 filtration cycles to evaluate its permeability to polystyrene microplastics ps mps in the long term fig 4 a since all bc biopolymers behaved very similarly only the w bc biopolymers data is shown here it turns out that the pore clogging is shown to increase more rapidly until the 25th cycle after which the increase is less marked after 50 filtration cycles the membrane showed no deformation or signs of destruction effectively preserving its structural integrity in correlation with previously presented data it is shown that despite membrane resistance pore clogging hitting 43 5 after 50 filtration cycles fig 4a the flux remains stable during 16 cycles it indicates that these bc biopolymers enable an efficient re utilization for several filtration cycles maintaining an extremely high removal efficiency of mps fig 2 despite flux reduction fig 3 and pore clogging fig 4a this highlights that despite clogging roughly half of the bc biopolymer s pores after 50 cycles a large network area within the membrane is still available to capture and remove mps these results underline that membrane fouling is somewhat negligible to the biopolymer s mps removal performance still it is important to acknowledge that these results still represent an experimental laboratory scale studies that will require further testing with more complex water matrixes relative to the release of mps it was noted that after 20 filtration cycles only a small portion of mps were organically released 7 30 with od bc biopolymers displaying the best retention 99 32 fig 4b this means that bc biopolymers are able not only to capture mps but to firmly imprison these micropolymeric particles on and within the network this raises a critical question regarding the application scalability of these biopolymeric membranes after reaching its end of life a close to harmless and environmental undamaging solution for mp saturated membranes must be delineated several solutions would be suggested 1 the compression moulding into high density pellets which could be melt processed or used in composites 2 the carbonization in inert atmosphere to obtain active carbon absorbers since cellulose can be easily carbonized 3 the melt or electrospinning into a new type of secondary filters 3 5 mps retention in bc biopolymers to characterize the retention of microplastics mps in the nanoporous bacterial cellulose bc biopolymeric network scanning electron sem and fluorescence microscopy were employed w bc biopolymers were analyzed using sem from both the cross section fig 5 a and top view fig 5b of the polymers these biopolymeric membranes presented a characteristic three dimensional nanofibrillar network and laminar microstructure with a dense and fibrillar microporous structure in ultra fine detail 1 5 μm fig s7a d as expected and predicted during the bc characterization severe structural changes in the oven dried od bc and freeze dried fd bc biopolymers are observed the od bc biopolymers exhibited a compact structure constituted by ribbon shaped fibrils providing a larger surface area and high water absorption ability fig 5c on the other hand fd bc biopolymers displayed an increase in the number of fibril networks resulting in an increasingly porous matrix and greater structural preservation fig 5d e this structural conservation is likely the reason the removal efficiency is closer to the one observed in wet w bc biopolymers fig 1a b with equally preserved membrane efficiency across a great number of cycles fig 2 nevertheless if the input and economic scalability costs of fd bc biopolymers would be massively different from od bc biopolymers the latter still presents an excellent and far superior alternative to current solutions the adsorption of ps microplastic particles across the polymer s surface was confirmed as observable in fig 5g h in finer detail 1 10 μm the interaction between the ps mps and the dried hydrogel matrix of the bc hydrogel fig s7e h was clear additionally fluorescence microscopy revealed that aside from adsorbing on the surface of the bc biopolymers mps were also thoroughly incorporated fig s7e1 g1 3 6 call for research the next years are expected to surface even more data reinforcing the concerns surrounding the health hazards of microplastics mps following the reports of their presence in human placenta and blood ragusa et al 2021 leslie et al 2022 despite environmental pollution being a more considerable ramification of the whole plastic issue the urban and more human correlated contamination outgrowth are still tremendously troubling as the demand for biosustainable and circular alternatives grows across all industrial and technological sectors of the economy a novel bacterial based alternative for the remediation of mp polluted waters is shown here the discovery of this biopolymer follows other microorganismal based biopolymers pioneered by our laboratory such as microalgal based exopolymers extracellular polymeric substances in aggregating and removing mps from contaminated waters cunha et al 2020 2019 this highlights that a wide array of environmentally compatible biotechnologically advanced alternatives are still in early stages of r d despite enormous potential this experimental design focuses on characterizing and analysing the effectiveness of the biopolymers in an accurate and controlled manner by focusing on a simpler water matrix composed of clean water spiked with microplastics more complex water matrixes including real wastewater samples present severe analytical challenges that would inherently defeat the purpose of trying to accurately measure the removal efficiency of mps a wide range of pollutants might synergistically influence the effectiveness of the biopolymer in removing other types of pollutants artificially recreated wastewater matrixes should be developed before transitioning any type of biotechnological development to real wastewaters or any other industrial setting is that it is completely unknown how different compounds would interact within real wastewaters to promote compound degradation and stability the experimental setup required to understand these synergistic effects serves a different purpose from the one employed in the present work and requires intricate scientific thinking going forward we are working towards identifying the knowledge gaps regarding particle and compound interactions and urge others to do the same the fact that no one has been able to recreate and understand these dynamics are reflective of the analytical intricacy of the experimental design however that should act as a catalyst for decoding the last step of the chain from the bench to industrial application noticeably the results presented here are extremely encouraging but several whole new research avenues still need to be explored on the biotechnological front it is now important to understand the cake layer fouling and cleaning behaviors of the bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers under the filtration of more complex water matrixes on the financial front it is now necessary to calculate the capex capital expenditure to achieve economies of scale it would be inherently inaccurate to calculate and compare the costs of current inorganic and synthetic polymeric membranes against bc biopolymers given the lack of data and the multitude of factors involved in production and scaling costs that are ultimately very specific to each operation it is however important to understand how to optimize culture conditions at an industrial scale to produce bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers at cost efficiency still it is vital to understand that the economic framework is only one of the many constants of the equation it cannot outweigh or outshine the principal issue the development of biodegradable biosustainable and truly circular biomembrane alternatives to current water treatment applications the fact that bc biopolymers can be easily morphed to create all types of custom size membranes further strengthens its application narrative all and all we have to realize that this is not just another human prompted issue this is one of our biggest generational issues and should be addressed as such and turning a blind eye is not an option anymore 4 conclusion the focus of this experimental laboratory scale study was to evaluate the potential of bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers as biosustainable and ecologically inert alternatives to conventional fossil based polymeric membranes used in water treatment sites such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps for microplastics mps removal results show that wet bc w bc oven dried bc od bc and freeze dried bc fd bc biopolymers display the best compromise between efficiency and applicability both wet and dried bc biopolymers present removal efficiencies ranging from 93 to 99 however drying the biopolymers greatly increases logistics and implementation practicality with removal efficiencies reduced by only 2 6 these membranes re hydrate rapidly and show no signs of degradation throughout filtration cycles preserving exceptionally high removal efficiencies despite flux reduction and pore clogging the extensive surface area available for mps particle interaction in these biopolymeric networks enables a sustainable re utilization throughout several filtration cycles bc biopolymers exhibit exceedingly high levels of mps retention not only by capturing micropolymeric particles but by also firmly imprisoning them within the laminar 3d microstructure nanofibrillar matrix altogether this study shows that bc biopolymers have a massive

15700,microplastics mps pollution has become one of our time s most consequential issue these micropolymeric particles are ubiquitously distributed across all natural and urban ecosystems current filtration systems in wastewater treatment plants wwtps rely on non biodegradable fossil based polymeric filters whose maintenance procedures are environmentally damaging and unsustainable following the need to develop sustainable filtration frameworks for mps water removal years of r d lead to the conception of bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers these bacterial based naturally secreted polymers display unique features for biotechnological applications such as straightforward production large surface areas nanoporous structures biodegradability and utilitarian circularity diligently techniques such as flow cytometry scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were used to evaluate the feasibility and characterise the removal dynamics of highly concentrated mps polluted water by bc biopolymers results show that bc biopolymers display removal efficiencies of mps of up to 99 maintaining high performance for several continuous cycles the polymer s characterisation showed that mps were both adsorbed and incorporated in the 3d nanofibrillar network the use of more economically and logistics favourable dried bc biopolymers preserves their physicochemical properties while maintaining high efficiency 93 96 these polymers exhibited exceptional structural preservation conserving a high water uptake capacity which drives microparticle retention in sum this study provides clear evidence that bc biopolymers are high performing multifaceted and genuinely sustainable circular alternatives to synthetic water treatment mps removal

on request 1 introduction plastic is everywhere given its high durability stability economic viability and applicability in several economic sectors predominantly in industrial constructional electronic medical and retail plasticseurope 2018 despite concerns plastic production has been exponentially increasing to meet the escalating demand of societal consumerism it has been estimated that 10 of all human generated waste is plastic un environment 2018 despite estimates that the total amount of plastic ever produced exceeds 8000 million metric tons mt geyer et al 2017 global plastic production is projected to double in the next 10 15 years un environment 2018 as plastic production incessantly increases plastic pollution has become a major concern since these polymers tend to accumulate in the environment in fact from the 6300 mt of plastic waste generated as of 2015 roughly 79 4977 mt was accumulated in the natural environment geyer et al 2017 with approximately 13 mt of plastic being leaked to aquatic environments in 2018 alone through indiscriminate disposal un environment 2018 at the current rate the environment is estimated to become home to roughly 12 000 mt of plastic waste by 2050 geyer et al 2017 with plastic debris already comprising 80 of the total waste found in aquatic ecosystems venghaus and barjenbruch 2017 alongside several other critical environmental concerns plastic waste is profiling itself as one of the biggest generational challenges of our time accordingly recent years have sparked another concern within the scientific community microplastics mps pollution mps are defined by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa as small scale plastic debris of all shapes and sizes with a diameter inferior to 5 mm noaa 2020 mps are divided by their origin into two major categories primary and secondary primary mps are intentionally manufactured as small microbeads microspheres and synthetic microparticles aimed at cosmetic medical and general applications galloway et al 2017 on the other hand secondary mps are smaller sized low molecular weight polymer fragments derived from macroplastics undergoing biological chemical and mechanical degradation substantially driven by uv induced photooxidation gewert et al 2015 consequently sites like wastewater treatment plants wwtps have converged a lot of notice in recent times central to urban water distribution these infrastructures have been documented to be massive focal points of mp release ben david et al 2021 edo et al 2020 gatidou et al 2019 horton et al 2021 kay et al 2018 li et al 2018 mintenig et al 2017 ngo et al 2019 ou and zeng 2018 rolsky et al 2020 sun et al 2019 turan et al 2021 xu et al 2019 ziajahromi et al 2017 previous studies have reported that despite the use of both filtration and mechano biochemical removal processes an average of 2 million mp particles with less of 300 μm are discharged to urban networks per day verschoor et al 2014 mintenig et al 2017 sun et al 2019 consequently mps have been documented in both raw and treated drinking water koelmans et al 2019 na et al 2021 pivokonsky et al 2018 with polystyrene being one of the most commonly used and hazardous plastic polymers detected in wwtps sun et al 2019 and in the environment alimi et al 2018 sharma et al 2021 aside from the widely documented deleterious effects of mps in aquatic and terrestrial biota hale et al 2020 rezania et al 2018 sun et al 2021 a growing body of evidence has strongly hinted at the direct implication of mps in human health campanale et al 2020 carbery et al 2018 chen et al 2020 cox et al 2019 gupta et al 2019 jin et al 2019 lehner et al 2019 li et al 2020 lu et al 2019 2018 prata 2018 prata et al 2020 schwabl 2020 smith et al 2018 accordingly the first direct evidence of mps in the human placenta of unborn babies has surfaced ragusa et al 2021 these findings were followed by the discovery of mps in the human blood sending shockwaves throughout the world the fact that mps are also vectors for the transport of hazardous chemicals and organic pollutants wang et al 2020 but still represent emerging contaminants with unknown health significance raises extreme concern regarding their potential health risks to permanently exposed humans dick vethaak and legler 2021 gruber et al 2022 it is therefore imperative to find sustainable and environmental fit solutions to tackle this issue most studies on the removal of mps from waters focus on technologies such as coagulation ultrafiltration membranes dynamic membranes or more advanced technological approaches such as membrane bioreactors mbrs poerio et al 2019 unfortunately techniques such as coagulation and ultrafiltration have demonstrated poor removal efficiencies ma et al 2019 more recently approaches such as surface functionalised microbubbles have shown promise in removing mps but present considerable applicability and sustainability hurdles zhang et al 2021 poerio et al have argued that the water and wastewater treatment industries still lack experience and technological expertise to efficiently separate mps from effluents poerio et al 2019 despite mbrs representing the current most promising technology far outperforming conventional hazardous wwtp applied mp removal methods its membranes still represent a focal point of concern poerio et al 2019 these synthetic and organic membranes are non biodegradable fossil based polymers whose fouling and high costs represent major obstacles for the broader adoption of mbrs meng et al 2009 aside both in situ and ex situ fouling removal mechanisms are economically energetically and environmentally unsustainable wang et al 2014 recent data suggest that membrane filtration systems might also be acting as sources of nano and microplastics given their polymeric composition alongside problems raised by the wear stress aging and harsh cleaning cycles throughout the membrane s life cycle the authors emphasise the need to accelerate the development of biomembranes as solutions to this problem ding et al 2021 appropriately bacterial cellulose bc is a polysaccharide produced by specific bacteria genera such as acetobacter spp agrobacterium spp azotobacter rhizobium spp sarcina alcaligenes and pseudomonas lahiri et al 2021 more recently the genus komagataeibacter has garnered considerable interest regarding bc production chen et al 2018 he et al 2020 raiszadeh jahromi et al 2020 singhsa et al 2018 these bc producing bacteria have been shown to produce characteristically similar bc using alternative and sustainable carbon sources vazquez et al 2013 highlighting the fact that production costs can be immensely reduced in industrial setups this exopolymer has been attracting a lot of scientific and industrial interest given its wide range of morphologies physicochemical properties and applications wang et al 2019 structurally bc consists of hydrogen bond c6h10o5 n β 1 4 glucan chains ul islam et al 2012 further the process of bc synthesis is centred around the exocytosis of glucose chains through small pores in the bacterial cell wall these glucose chains form nano and microfibrils that aggregate to form a porous three dimensional network esa et al 2014 shah et al 2013 resulting in the formation of hydrogel matrixes with large surface area and high porosity esa et al 2014 when compared to the cellulose produced by other organisms its high purity peculiar physical properties biocompatibility biodegradability and renewable character makes bc extremely attractive for industrial use wang et al 2019 particularly in the food biomedical pharmaceutical cosmetic and electronic industries portela et al 2019 shah et al 2013 nevertheless it was the absorbent nature of bc that has recently attracted the interest of specialists in the wastewater treatment field regarding its potential use in the removal of contaminants such as dyes and heavy metals isik et al 2018 kurniawan and yamamoto 2013 mohite and patil 2014 wanichapichart et al 2002 given the theoretical physicochemical properties of bc regarding organic micropolymeric particles such as mps these biopolymers were investigated as potential solutions to mps pollution accordingly this laboratory scale work aims to assess the viability of previously unexplored bc biopolymers as removal matrixes of mps from contaminated waters to the best of our knowledge this is the first time bacterial cellulose biopolymers have been explored concerning its remediation potential of microplastics the quantification of several differently treated bc biopolymers regarding removal efficiency and mps retention was determined using flow cytometry to characterise the physicochemical properties of the biopolymer and understand the mechanisms driving the retention of mps techniques such as infrared spectroscopy atr ftir x ray diffraction xrd inverse gas chromatography igc atomic force microscopy afm fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy sem were used 2 materials and methods 2 1 bc production bc biopolymers were produced by

6300 pc double beam hs medium was sterilized at 121 c for 15 min after incubation to remove adsorbed cells and culture medium components retained the bc biopolymers were treated with 0 5 m naoh 80 c for 45 min and washed with distilled water until neutral ph bc biopolymers exhibited a wet weight of 22 715 1 519 g and a dry weight of 0 055 0 003 g 99 76 of water bc membrane thickness was measured with a calliper rule electronic digital calliper and the dry weight was determined through a moisture balance gibertini eurotherm at 105 c for 45 min the bc biopolymers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem fluorescence microscopy atomic force microscopy afm inverse gas chromatography igc x ray diffraction xrd and infrared spectroscopy atr ftir the used experimental methodology was described in supplementary material s1 2 2 bc biopolymer treatment bc biopolymers were treated in this study in five different forms to evaluate its effect on filtration efficiency i wet biopolymer w bc ii oven dried 40 2 c biopolymer od bc iii freeze dried savant rt 400 refrigerated condensation trap biopolymer fd bc iv filtered 80 of water content removed under vacuum filtration biopolymer f bc and v drained 80 of water content removed under compression biopolymer d bc a porous plate glass crucible was used to support bc biopolymers in the filtration system during the filtration procedure the mps contaminated water was inserted into the filtration system and passed to a pressure of 7 mbar vacuubrand mz 2c an aliquot of the filtered solution was collected for flow cytometry analysis 2 3 microplastics specimens spherical polystyrene microplastics ps mps with a diameter of 10 µm were purchased from thermo scientific g1000 as a 1 w v suspension with excitation and emission wavelengths of 468 and 508 nm respectively a high concentration mps stock solution was prepared at 10 mg l 1 and stored at 4 c until further use all solutions were prepared in glass flasks to minimize the establishment of electrostatic interactions with their walls also solutions were vortexed before use to guarantee homogeneity 2 4 microplastics removal the mps in the mps contaminated water and the not retained mps in the bc biopolymer were quantified using flow cytometry cytoflex beckman coulter with a blue laser excitation radiation of 488 nm based on recent methodologies kaile et al 2020 tse et al 2022 the ps mps were characterized according to forward scatter fsc side scatter ssc and fluorescein isothiocyanate ftic 525 550 nm emission detection filter the cytexpert software beckman coulter was used to analyze the output data the calibration line was obtained using 0 2 5 5 10 50 and 100 mg l 1 of mps and applied to calculate the concentration of mps in pre and post filtrated water samples 2 5 biopolymer efficiency and flux analysis biopolymer efficiency and continued water absolute and relative fluxes of bc biopolymer were evaluated the biopolymer efficiency assessment was carried out as follows 20 cycles filtration number of 25 ml of mps contaminated water were passed through the bc biopolymers filtered solution aliquots were collected for flow cytometry analysis every two filtration cycles the efficiency was calculated following the eq 1 were n i is the initial number of mps and n f is the number of mps after filtration 1 e f f i c i e n c y n i n f n i 100 the absolute and relative water fluxes were calculated according to kim et al with some adjustments and following eqs 2 and 3 where t f is the filtration time of each cycle v f

where t f is the initial filtration time and t i is the filtration time of each cycle 4 r e s i s t a n c e t f 100 t i 100 2 7 microscopy characterisation 2 7 1 scanning electron microscopy dry bc biopolymers od bc and fd bc were coated with a thin layer of carbon using emitech k950x turbo evaporator and deposited on a steel plate sem micrographs were obtained using the hr fesem su 70 hitachi scanning electron microscopy equipment operating with a 5 kv beam at a 15 6 mm working distance in the field emission mode images were collected at several magnifications from x500 to x30 000 2 7 2 fluorescence microscopy the retention incorporation of mps in the bc network was observed using epifluorescence microscopy on a leica dm2700 p device coupled with a leica dfc450 c digital camera and a coolled pe 300 lite lighting system the fluorescent signal was captured using the i3 450 490 nm 515 565 nm excitation emission filter bc biopolymers were stained with calcofluor white 18909 sigma aldrich for enhanced observation 2 8 data and statistical analysis data representation and statistics were carried out using graphpad prism 8 the d agostino pearson omnibus and kolmogorov smirnov normality tests were used to assess the gaussian distribution of data parametric unpaired t tests or one way anova were applied for normally distributed data while non parametric unpaired mann whitney or kruskal wallis tests were applied for non gaussian distributed data statistical analysis was performed in at least three independent experiments 3 results and discussion in recent years severe environmental and health related concerns have been raised regarding an invisible but highly abundant ubiquitous and still poorly characterized pollutant microplastics mps despite technological advances in mps removal in locations such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps synthetic membrane filtration systems still represent the major point of contention and inviability therefore it is critical to develop solutions that align with biosustainability and circularity expectations here several types of semi or fully dried bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers produced by komagataeibacter saccharivorans were studied to not only to understand its potential as a raw mps removing biopolymer but also in forms that would enable and facilitate industrial adoption and scaling these include wet bc w bc biopolymers oven dried bc od bc biopolymers freeze dried bc fd bc biopolymers filtered bc f bc biopolymers and drained bc d bc biopolymers section 2 2 for details it is important to note that technique applicability is always selectively dependent on the wet or dried nature of the bc biopolymer highlighting that some techniques cannot be applied to wet forms of the biopolymer 3 1 bc biopolymer production and characterization 3 1 1 bc biopolymer production important for understanding its interactions with microplastics mps and industrial applicability scalability assessing a wide range of physicochemical properties regarding bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers is crucial accordingly the optimal culturing conditions of bc biopolymers produced by komagataeibacter saccharivorans were evaluated it was concluded that 2 glucose ph of 3 25 and 7 days of cultivation yielded a maximised time efficient concentration of roughly 2 95 g l 1 fig s1 in line with the literature revin et al 2018 volova et al 2018 the raw wet bc w bc biopolymers exhibited an averaged thickness of 11 583 0 685 mm where 99 76 of the biopolymer s net weight was water given these values and considering the potential industrial applicability of these biopolymers logistics facilitating drying processes were extensively characterised 3 1 2 bc characterization attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir analysis fig s2 showed that structurally both oven drying od and freeze dried fd bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers displayed the expected absorption bands of cellulose around 3347 cm 1 oh stretching vibrations 2899 1434 1373 and 1312 cm 1 ch and ch2 stretching vibrations 1632 and 666 cm 1 ch or oh bending vibration and 1064 cm 1 co stretching vibration of ether groups which is often found within the glucopyranose ring and between the glucose monomers alonso et al 2018 fan et al 2012 faria et al 2019 the sharper peaks observed on the atr ftir spectra corresponding to fd bc biopolymers suggest a more regular structure preserved during the freeze drying process both dried bc biopolymers od bc and fd bc showed similar x ray diffraction profiles fig s3 of cellulose type i with characteristic peaks found at 14 5 16 73 and 22 7 corresponding to the 100 010 and 110 planes respectively despite both exhibiting similar crystallinity levels fd bc biopolymers exhibited considerably larger surface areas table 1 determined by inverse gas chromatography igc igc showed linear adsorption isotherms for both the bc biopolymers corresponding to a type i isotherm typically associated with microporous materials this is strengthened by a high degree of permeability values 76 78 vs 58 10 cm2 min 1 which indicates that the fd bc biopolymers exhibit a higher number of smaller structurally conserved pores consistently the 78 79 crystallinity values registered here are roughly in line with the ones reported in the literature lowest to highest 63 2 ul islam et al 2012 75 2 phisalaphong and jatupaiboon 2008 86 9 andritsou et al 2018 88 0 tsouko et al 2015 and 88 4 jia et al 2017 while od bc biopolymers sbet was considerably higher than the values reported in the literature castro et al 2015 faria et al 2019 mohammadkazemi et al 2017 moreover atomic force microscopy afm was used to characterize the surface topography of the bc biopolymers this ultra high resolution technique highlighted that od bc biopolymers exhibit a rougher surface than fd bc biopolymers fig s4 table 1 also the hypothesis that fd bc biopolymers would present greater preservation of their structural network is confirmed a more substantial pore collapse during oven drying compared to freeze drying is observed these morphological characteristics underscore that the drying process plays a critical role in modulating structural integrity furthermore considering that the bc biopolymers are immersed in water during the filtration process studying the water uptake capacity swelling becomes critical to understanding their behavior during remediation cycles od bc and fd bc biopolymers manifested considerably different swelling behaviors fd bc biopolymers displayed an inflated swelling performance from 659 to 1011 compared to od bc biopolymers taking 3 h to saturate while their oven dried counterparts took 8 h to achieve statistically constant saturation fig s5 this greatly enhanced water uptake ability is likely observed due to the structural conservation of pores during freeze drying unlike their collapse during oven drying effectively corroborating previous data 3 2 removal efficiency of microplastics first the ability of bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers to remove polystyrene microplastics ps mps from contaminated water was evaluated given the venture style nature of the research well characterized and homogeneous spherical ps mps were used in order to focus and streamline the characterization of the biopolymer s remediation potential even macroscopically it was easily discernible to the naked eye that bc biopolymers removed virtually all mps post filtration as schematised in fig s6 flow cytometry was used to quantify the removal efficiency and the concentration of mps retained in the bc biopolymer fig 1 illustrates the removal efficiency of the wet bc w bc biopolymer and each of its treatment variations oven dried od bc freeze dried fd bc filtered f bc and drained d bc after a single filtration cycle the w bc biopolymer displayed the highest removal efficiency at 98 63 0 39 being able to retain 9 47 0 03 mg l 1 of 10 µm ps mps fig 1b respectively moreover the dried od bc and fd bc biopolymers exhibited removal efficiencies of 93 04 2 07 and 96 45 2 22 equating to a retained concentration of 9 05 0 16 and 9 31 0 17 mg l 1 fig 1b correspondingly the semi dried f bc and d bc biopolymers revealed lower removal efficiencies of 92 49 1 69 and 84 15 1 91 retaining 9 01 0 13 and 8 38 0 14 mg l 1 fig 1b respectively despite field studies generally presenting mp concentrations in particles l making the transition to laboratory scale studies difficult concentrations around 9 10 mg l 1 are far higher than those expected at any treatment stage in wwtps blair et al 2019 sun et al 2019 this highlights that bc biopolymers have gigantic mps aggregating capacity and would not act as the limiting factor in the removal of mps still it is important to acknowledge that more complex water matrixes present different challenges regarding the multiplicity of particles and pollutants that might interplay to change the remediation potential of any filter or biopolymer unfortunately this is an issue that is yet to be addressed in different experimental designs to provide critical knowledge before the translation of any environmental friendly biotechnologically enabled solution to real wastewater settings be that as it may representative scattering profiles of ps mps in pre and post filtrated water by od bc biopolymers are shown in fig 1c d exhibiting the exceptionally high retention of mps by and in the biopolymers w bc biopolymers are highly hydrated as the abundance of hydroxyl groups available in cellulose interact with water molecules occupying the entirety of the pores within the bc matrix portela et al 2019 accordingly these characteristics are highly favourable for the interaction and aggregation of mps on and within the hydrogel matrix in view of the industrial applicability and economic scalability that would most likely benefit from dry rather than wet biopolymers the focus was put on the potential use of dry biopolymeric biopolymers hence it was noted that od bc biopolymers exhibited a significantly decreased removal efficiency p 0 0001 compared to w bc biopolymers however no statistical differences were found when comparing w bc to fd bc biopolymers p 0 2439 statistical differences between both dried bc biopolymers od bc and fd bc were reported p 0 0211 these are still highly robust numbers despite statistically lower removal efficiencies around the 95 mark from a microscopical viewpoint fd bc biopolymers are expected to present a more porous structure than an od bc biopolymer given the collapse of the cellulosic fibers due to the oven drying process however as discussed previously these dried biopolymers can swell and re hydrate rapidly to recuperate their complete structural integrity during the filtration process further particle retention is known to result from swelling behaviors typical of hydrogel biopolymers such as bc hamidi et al 2008 these results highlight that water content indeed influences the retention capability of mps in the bc network the superior water uptake capacity exhibited by both od bc and fd bc biopolymers enhances membrane hydration due to high affinity with water molecules effectively potentiating the retention of particles such as mps within the bc matrix in an aqueous solution the preservation of the dried bc microporous structure likely acts as the trap allowing for the retention of water polluting mps therefore and even though drying the bc biopolymers decreased removal efficiencies by 2 18 5 59 this would most likely be outweighed by logistics and economic advantages as they can be more easily transported and stored semi dried bc biopolymers were tested where 80 of their water content was removed by vacuum filtration f bc or mechanical draining d bc the f bc biopolymers presented significantly lower removal efficiencies compared to fully dried w bc p 0 0001 and fd bc biopolymers p 0 0060 but not to od bc biopolymers p 0 9835 on the other hand d bc biopolymers display considerably lower removal efficiencies less 8 34 14 48 compared to every other biopolymer p 0 0001 the vacuum filtration process is only likely to remove the unbound water molecules which play a critical role in maintaining proper hydration levels in the biopolymer these unbound molecules also act as stabilizing intermediates of the pore structure within the network given the establishment of hydrogen bonds with cellulose portela et al 2019 stanisławska et al 2020 removing these molecules results in a spatial narrowing between microfibrils suggesting a decrease in membrane porosity and a lower retention capacity of mps similar to the structural changes observed in the od bc biopolymers it is noteworthy that water affects the polymer s charge which can also affect the adsorption absorption of particles due to electrostatic interactions that is likely to result in the repulsion of particles that settle into the first layers of the polymer despite presenting a more favourable economic and least resource intensive outlook the compression process is the most likely to physically damage the tightly structured porous network of the bc effectively compromising its utility as a filter thus the d bc biopolymers were no longer taken into consideration moving forward overall and to the best of our knowledge this is the first study evaluating the potential of bc biopolymers as removal filters for ubiquitous water polluting mps still bc biopolymers have been successfully applied to other remediation ends particularly bc has shown promise as a bioadsorbent matrix for removing dyes proteins and heavy metals kurniawan and yamamoto 2013 mohite and patil 2014 wanichapichart et al 2002 this biopolymer has also been shown to be a suitable candidate as an environmental friendly ultrafiltration membrane hassan et al 2017 isik et al 2018 hassan et al documented that bc acts as an exquisite ultrafiltration membrane to remove oil emulsions from water yielding a removal efficiency of 98 3 and 99 3 for stabilized and non stabilized oil emulsions respectively hassan et al 2017 moreover isik et al successfully implemented bc membranes to filter water dyes from the textile industry achieving a 90 9 removal rate isik et al 2018 all these data highlight that bc biopolymers exhibit several other remediation purposes aside from the novel removal of mps shown here these biopolymeric membranes demonstrate a considerable promise as multifaceted genuinely sustainable and circular alternatives to synthetic membrane separation technologies in which membrane bioreactors mbrs stand out as the most prolific scientific solution to date poerio et al 2019 the extremely high removal efficiency numbers coupled with the biosustainable nature and easy economic scalability places bc biopolymers as the best solution to the numerous central issues with fossil based polymeric membranes meng et al 2009 poerio et al 2019 wang et al 2014 that have now called for the urgent development of biomembranes ding et al 2021 this follows reports from our laboratory of similarly effective microalgal based extracellular polymeric substances in aggregating and removing mps cunha et al 2019 2020 highlighting that a multitude of biocompatible alternatives are still in the infancy stages of research and development despite tremendous promise 3 3 bc biopolymers efficiency the implementation viability of new biopolymers is tightly correlated with their resistance and consequent longevity the water uptake ability has been shown to be an important material property to determine hydraulic resistance which is a measure of filtration performance of the bacterial cellulose bc biopolymer kim et al 2017 so to evaluate the hydraulic resistance and removal efficiency of the wet w bc oven dried od bc freeze dried fd bc and filtered f bc biopolymers throughout several 20 filtration cycles a microplastics mps contaminated water solution was continuously passed through the biopolymers with the results summarized in fig 2 given that both od bc and fd bc biopolymers showed remarkably similar behaviors the od bc biopolymer was chosen as the benchmark going forward due to its lower input costs the absolute flux and relative flux were also assessed throughout the 20 filtration cycles fig 3 both the absolute fig 3a and relative fig 3b fluxes were shown to decrease across all biopolymers interestingly the w bc and f bc biopolymers exhibit a flux decrease of 15 22 and 14 57 respectively from the first 1 to the last cycle 20 unlike the od bc biopolymers that exhibit a decrease of 88 30 however this massive decrease is due to comparatively high initial flux values hydrated biopolymer at the end of the 20 cycles the absolute flux value sits at 2 34 ml min 1 between the 1 50 and 3 99 ml min 1 exhibited by the w bc and f bc biopolymers accordingly these results are reflected in fig 3b as the relative flux decreases as described therefore it is logical that initial hydration levels play an essential role in the flux registered here with the effect normalizing as the dried od bc or partially dried filtered f bc biopolymers re hydrate one of the likely reasons is that lower negative zeta potential on the membrane surface acts as an electrostatic barrier against the negatively charged mps particles which results in the repulsion of particles settling in the first layers of the biopolymer kim et al 2017 it is also noteworthy that biopolymers did not present any signs of degradation throughout the 20 filtration cycles the w bc biopolymer maintained the flux constant for 50 cycles 3 4 bc biopolymer resistance the bacterial cellulose bc biopolymer s resistance was assessed throughout 50 filtration cycles to evaluate its permeability to polystyrene microplastics ps mps in the long term fig 4 a since all bc biopolymers behaved very similarly only the w bc biopolymers data is shown here it turns out that the pore clogging is shown to increase more rapidly until the 25th cycle after which the increase is less marked after 50 filtration cycles the membrane showed no deformation or signs of destruction effectively preserving its structural integrity in correlation with previously presented data it is shown that despite membrane resistance pore clogging hitting 43 5 after 50 filtration cycles fig 4a the flux remains stable during 16 cycles it indicates that these bc biopolymers enable an efficient re utilization for several filtration cycles maintaining an extremely high removal efficiency of mps fig 2 despite flux reduction fig 3 and pore clogging fig 4a this highlights that despite clogging roughly half of the bc biopolymer s pores after 50 cycles a large network area within the membrane is still available to capture and remove mps these results underline that membrane fouling is somewhat negligible to the biopolymer s mps removal performance still it is important to acknowledge that these results still represent an experimental laboratory scale studies that will require further testing with more complex water matrixes relative to the release of mps it was noted that after 20 filtration cycles only a small portion of mps were organically released 7 30 with od bc biopolymers displaying the best retention 99 32 fig 4b this means that bc biopolymers are able not only to capture mps but to firmly imprison these micropolymeric particles on and within the network this raises a critical question regarding the application scalability of these biopolymeric membranes after reaching its end of life a close to harmless and environmental undamaging solution for mp saturated membranes must be delineated several solutions would be suggested 1 the compression moulding into high density pellets which could be melt processed or used in composites 2 the carbonization in inert atmosphere to obtain active carbon absorbers since cellulose can be easily carbonized 3 the melt or electrospinning into a new type of secondary filters 3 5 mps retention in bc biopolymers to characterize the retention of microplastics mps in the nanoporous bacterial cellulose bc biopolymeric network scanning electron sem and fluorescence microscopy were employed w bc biopolymers were analyzed using sem from both the cross section fig 5 a and top view fig 5b of the polymers these biopolymeric membranes presented a characteristic three dimensional nanofibrillar network and laminar microstructure with a dense and fibrillar microporous structure in ultra fine detail 1 5 μm fig s7a d as expected and predicted during the bc characterization severe structural changes in the oven dried od bc and freeze dried fd bc biopolymers are observed the od bc biopolymers exhibited a compact structure constituted by ribbon shaped fibrils providing a larger surface area and high water absorption ability fig 5c on the other hand fd bc biopolymers displayed an increase in the number of fibril networks resulting in an increasingly porous matrix and greater structural preservation fig 5d e this structural conservation is likely the reason the removal efficiency is closer to the one observed in wet w bc biopolymers fig 1a b with equally preserved membrane efficiency across a great number of cycles fig 2 nevertheless if the input and economic scalability costs of fd bc biopolymers would be massively different from od bc biopolymers the latter still presents an excellent and far superior alternative to current solutions the adsorption of ps microplastic particles across the polymer s surface was confirmed as observable in fig 5g h in finer detail 1 10 μm the interaction between the ps mps and the dried hydrogel matrix of the bc hydrogel fig s7e h was clear additionally fluorescence microscopy revealed that aside from adsorbing on the surface of the bc biopolymers mps were also thoroughly incorporated fig s7e1 g1 3 6 call for research the next years are expected to surface even more data reinforcing the concerns surrounding the health hazards of microplastics mps following the reports of their presence in human placenta and blood ragusa et al 2021 leslie et al 2022 despite environmental pollution being a more considerable ramification of the whole plastic issue the urban and more human correlated contamination outgrowth are still tremendously troubling as the demand for biosustainable and circular alternatives grows across all industrial and technological sectors of the economy a novel bacterial based alternative for the remediation of mp polluted waters is shown here the discovery of this biopolymer follows other microorganismal based biopolymers pioneered by our laboratory such as microalgal based exopolymers extracellular polymeric substances in aggregating and removing mps from contaminated waters cunha et al 2020 2019 this highlights that a wide array of environmentally compatible biotechnologically advanced alternatives are still in early stages of r d despite enormous potential this experimental design focuses on characterizing and analysing the effectiveness of the biopolymers in an accurate and controlled manner by focusing on a simpler water matrix composed of clean water spiked with microplastics more complex water matrixes including real wastewater samples present severe analytical challenges that would inherently defeat the purpose of trying to accurately measure the removal efficiency of mps a wide range of pollutants might synergistically influence the effectiveness of the biopolymer in removing other types of pollutants artificially recreated wastewater matrixes should be developed before transitioning any type of biotechnological development to real wastewaters or any other industrial setting is that it is completely unknown how different compounds would interact within real wastewaters to promote compound degradation and stability the experimental setup required to understand these synergistic effects serves a different purpose from the one employed in the present work and requires intricate scientific thinking going forward we are working towards identifying the knowledge gaps regarding particle and compound interactions and urge others to do the same the fact that no one has been able to recreate and understand these dynamics are reflective of the analytical intricacy of the experimental design however that should act as a catalyst for decoding the last step of the chain from the bench to industrial application noticeably the results presented here are extremely encouraging but several whole new research avenues still need to be explored on the biotechnological front it is now important to understand the cake layer fouling and cleaning behaviors of the bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers under the filtration of more complex water matrixes on the financial front it is now necessary to calculate the capex capital expenditure to achieve economies of scale it would be inherently inaccurate to calculate and compare the costs of current inorganic and synthetic polymeric membranes against bc biopolymers given the lack of data and the multitude of factors involved in production and scaling costs that are ultimately very specific to each operation it is however important to understand how to optimize culture conditions at an industrial scale to produce bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers at cost efficiency still it is vital to understand that the economic framework is only one of the many constants of the equation it cannot outweigh or outshine the principal issue the development of biodegradable biosustainable and truly circular biomembrane alternatives to current water treatment applications the fact that bc biopolymers can be easily morphed to create all types of custom size membranes further strengthens its application narrative all and all we have to realize that this is not just another human prompted issue this is one of our biggest generational issues and should be addressed as such and turning a blind eye is not an option anymore 4 conclusion the focus of this experimental laboratory scale study was to evaluate the potential of bacterial cellulose bc biopolymers as biosustainable and ecologically inert alternatives to conventional fossil based polymeric membranes used in water treatment sites such as wastewater treatment plants wwtps for microplastics mps removal results show that wet bc w bc oven dried bc od bc and freeze dried bc fd bc biopolymers display the best compromise between efficiency and applicability both wet and dried bc biopolymers present removal efficiencies ranging from 93 to 99 however drying the biopolymers greatly increases logistics and implementation practicality with removal efficiencies reduced by only 2 6 these membranes re hydrate rapidly and show no signs of degradation throughout filtration cycles preserving exceptionally high removal efficiencies despite flux reduction and pore clogging the extensive surface area available for mps particle interaction in these biopolymeric networks enables a sustainable re utilization throughout several filtration cycles bc biopolymers exhibit exceedingly high levels of mps retention not only by capturing micropolymeric particles but by also firmly imprisoning them within the laminar 3d microstructure nanofibrillar matrix altogether this study shows that bc biopolymers have a massive

15701,this work systematically examined the capability of ferrate fe vi for ammonia oxidation revealing for the first time that bromide ions br played an important role in promoting the removal of ammonia in fe vi system in the presence of 10 0 mm br the removal efficiency of ammonia was nearly 3 4 times that of the control and 1 0 mm ammonia was almost completely removed after two rounds addition of 1 0 mm fe vi in 60 min pmso probe test electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and radical quenching experiments were employed to interpret the underlying promotion mechanism of br and it was proposed that the formation of active bromine hobr obr played a dominant role in the enhanced oxidative removal of ammonia by fe vi further kinetic model simulations revealed that hobr obr and fe vi were the two major reactive species in fe vi br system accounting for 66 7 and 33 0 of ammonia removal respectively as the target contaminant ammonia could quickly consume the generated hobr obr thereby suppressing the formation of brominated disinfection byproducts finally no3 was identified as the dominant transformation product of ammonia and density functional theory dft calculations revealed that six reaction stages were involved in ammonia oxidation with the first step as the rate limiting step this work would enable the full use of coexisting bromides for effective removal of ammonia from natural waters or wastewaters by in situ fe vi oxidation method graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia ferrate vi bromide ions active bromine species dft calculations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ammonia is a common inorganic contaminant which is ubiquitous in surface water groundwater and wastewater and has potential environmental risks zhang et al 2019a tang et al 2021 as a typical organic wastewater coking wastewater has been reported to contain high concentrations of ammonia which can even reach up to hundreds of mg l zheng et al 2020 since the wastewater treatment plants wwtps could not remove ammonia completely residual ammonia in wwtps effluents may enter into the aqueous environment a survey on the state of the environment in china found that the concentration of ammonia in natural waters could reach more than 10 mg l zhang et al 2019a ammonia can cause the problem of water eutrophication threatening the health of aquatic organisms zhang et al 2019b thus developing strategy for efficient removal of ammonia is highly desirable many researchers have examined the removal of ammonia by conventional water treatment methods such as biological treatment mal et al 2017 jantarakasem et al 2020 breakpoint chlorination pressley et al 1972 electrochemical and photocatalytic processes etc zhang et al 2019b zhao et al 2018 unfortunately the intrinsic drawbacks of these technologies limit their potential application for instance the efficiency of biological treatment is relatively low which is highly dependent on the environmental conditions such as ph temperature and content of total organic carbon toc yang et al 2021 breakpoint chlorination is unfavorable due to its high cost and complexity in operation zhang et al 2019b electrochemical and photocatalytic technology would consume a large amount of energy doekhi bennani et al 2021 in order to overcome these shortcomings it is of great significance to explore other treatment technologies to remove ammonia from water due to its powerful oxidation performance together with sterilization and flocculation functions fe vi is being increasingly used as a multifunctional oxidant for water treatment which has drawn wide concern he et al 2021 liu et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 so far fe vi has been successfully applied in the removal of various organic contaminants such as phenolic compounds aromatic organoarsenic compounds and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps wang et al 2020 huang et al 2021 huang et al 2018 yang et al 2018 however at present most studies focus on the removal of organic pollutants by fe vi which makes that very limited information is available on fe vi oxidation of inorganic pollutants it has been reported by sharma et al 1998 that fe vi could oxidize ammonia to nitrate in water which significantly reduced the aquatic toxicity bellezi et al 2015 daam et al 2020 however the reaction rate constant of ammonia with fe vi is significantly low as compared with most organic compounds thus it is important to explore how to improve the removal efficiency of ammonia in fe vi oxidation system if this problem is solved this fe vi oxidation technology may become a promising alternative to the nitrification treatment of the traditional a o process then nitrate generated from ammonia oxidation could be refluxed to the anoxic reactor for the denitrification reaction sun et al 2010 bromide ions are ubiquitous in various industrial wastewaters from the manufacture of leaded gasoline pesticides flame retardants pharmaceuticals and photographic papers grebel et al 2010 shi et al 2020 and their presence has been shown to affect a variety of water treatment processes such as photolysis zhang et al 2020 electrochemical system ma et al 2014 and advanced oxidation processes aops liu et al 2018 according to previous studies bromide ions are likely to be converted to active bromine species br bro and hobr bro etc in the above mentioned treatment processes exerting an promotion or inhibition effect on the removal of pollutants wang et al 2014 moreover jiang et al 2016 have revealed that fe vi could slowly oxidize br to form active bromine species hobr obr and the formation amount of bromate did not exceed the usepa maximum contaminant level mcl 10 μg l according to the literature the reaction constants of nh4 nh3 with hobr obr 7 6 104 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 were much higher than that with fe vi 3 7 10 1 m 1 s 1 sharma et al 1998 heeb et al 2017 thus active bromine species are more efficient oxidants for ammonia oxidation than fe vi given the frequent coexistence of br and ammonia in the industrial wastewaters e g petrochemical industrial wastewater it is of great importance to investigate whether the presence of bromide ions could enhance the removal of ammonia in fe vi system hydroxylamine nh2oh and nitrite no2 are two important intermediates during the transformation process of ammonia to nitrate wang et al 2017 nenov et al 2004 however the interaction between ammonia and oxidants has not been fully addressed and more importantly the stepwise oxidation mechanism remains to be clearly elucidated such information could be obtained from quantum chemical theoretical calculations where the energy barriers of all elementary reactions are determined according to calculations based on transition state theory yue et al 2020 in summary the objectives of this study are to i investigate the feasibility of the oxidation of ammonia by fe vi and explore practical method to increase the utilization efficiency of fe vi ii examine the influences of coexisting bromide ions on ammonia oxidation with emphasis on the related promoting mechanisms iii evaluate the application potential of the fe vi br method for ammonia removal in water and wastewater treatment through the experiments in real water samples and the analysis of disinfection byproducts dbps formed iv apply density functional theory dft based calculations to elucidate the oxidation mechanism of ammonia by fe vi this work can give some new insights into the effect of coexisting bromides on ammonia oxidation which may provide a new approach to remove ammonia efficiently from natural waters or wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples source of chemicals and details of water samples are given in text s1 2 2 oxidation experiment a series of experiments was performed in 100 ml conical flasks at 25 c reaction solutions containing 1 0 mm ammonia were prepared in 20 mm borate buffer solution which were added with 1 0 m h2so4 or naoh to offset the ph fluctuations caused by subsequent addition of oxidant then the reaction was initiated with the addition of a certain amount of freshly prepared fe vi solution under rapid stirring 500 rpm at the defined time intervals 5 ml of sample was withdrawn and terminated by 50 μl of 0 2 m na2s2o3 after passing through 0 22 μm nylon syringe filter scaa 104 anpel shanghai china the filtrate was collected for the following ion chromatography analysis the samples for detection of disinfection byproducts dbps were collected after 12 h of reaction all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analysis methods the concentrations of nh4 nh3 no2 no3 and bro3 were measured by ion chromatography dionex sunnyvale usa equipped with a dionex ionpac as20 analytical column 4 mm 250 mm and an ag20 guard column 4 mm 40 mm the effluent used to detect anions and cations were 15 0 mm koh and 10 0 mm ch3so3h respectively and the flow rate was set at 1 0 ml min the injection volume was 25 μl and the column temperature was 30 the limit of detection for nh4 no2 no3 and bro3 were 0 04 mg l 0 03 mg l 0 10 and 0 01 mg l respectively halomethanes and haloacetic acids in the reaction solution were extracted with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe using a modified epa method 551 1 and epa method 552 2 respectively and analyzed on a gas chromatograph agilent 7820a instrument equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd according to previously well established methods benanou et al 1998 detailed information on the gc and other analysis methods is given in text s2 2 4 theoretical calculations the dft based calculations were conducted by gaussian 09 program gaussian inc usa at the m062x lanl2dz level frisch et al 2009 qi et al 2021 and the solvent effect of water was considered by polarizable continuum model pcm in the framework of self consistent reaction field scrf luque et al 1996 transition states tss were calculated by pseudo reaction coordinate method and intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analysis was performed to confirm the structure of ts yu et al 2017 zou et al 2021 all tss met the criteria that only one imaginary frequency appeared initial guess structure of reactant complexes res and product complexes prs were also obtained from irc curves which was then fully optimized to obtain precise geometrical structures with associated vibration analysis to ensure no imaginary frequency xiao et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the gibbs free energies g and total energies e were directly obtained from the gaussian output files 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of ammonia by fe vi 3 1 1 effect of solution ph and addition mode of fe vi in this work ammonia was used to represent the total amount of nh4 and nh3 h2o in the reaction solution the degradation of ammonia by 2 0 mm fe vi was enhanced with increasing ph values which was related to changes in nh3 fraction and fe vi stability text s3 meanwhile multiple addition mode could realize the complete removal of 1 0 mm ammonia by improving the utilization efficiency of the oxidant text s4 3 1 2 promoting effect of br on the removal of ammonia in fe vi system according to previous studies the coexistence of halide ions in wastewater and natural waters may affect the degradation efficiency and transformation pathway of pollutants berne et al 2004 cheng et al 2018 xiang et al 2019 hofmann et al 2001 have demonstrated that bromide would form free bromine to further react with ammonia in the ozonation process in this work a series of experiments was performed to explore the influence of bromide ions br on the removal of ammonia by fe vi according to their actual concentrations in petrochemical industrial wastewaters shi et al 2020 four concentration levels of br i e 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 10 0 mm were used in batch experiments as shown in fig 1 a the presence of br significantly promoted the conversion of ammonia in the presence of 1 0 mm br the removal efficiency of ammonia increased from 11 1 1 2 to 14 7 1 8 moreover the promotion effect on ammonia removal was more obvious with the increasing concentration of br the removal efficiency of ammonia reached 37 4 1 7 in the presence of 10 0 mm br nearly 3 4 times that of the control different concentrations of br in the form of sodium salts were used which could result in a large difference in the ionic strength i and na concentration of reaction solutions whereas additional analysis has demonstrated that ionic strength i and na were not the cause see text s5 for more details and the enhanced removal of ammonia should be attributed to the br itself 3 1 3 accelerated removal of ammonia by br in multiple addition mode the removal efficiencies of ammonia were further examined in the presence of br using multiple addition method fe vi was added at intervals of 30 min and the addition dosage was 2 0 mm each time the results were shown in fig 1 b after adding fe vi for 4 rounds i e with a total of 8 0 mm fe vi addition 1 0 mm ammonia could be completely removed in 120 min in the control group as discussed above the presence of br could enhance the oxidation of ammonia when 1 mm br was present the 90 min removal efficiency of ammonia increased by 8 5 as compared with the control group at higher bromide concentrations of 2 and 4 mm the removal efficiency of ammonia was further improved almost 100 conversion was achieved within 90 min in the presence of 2 mm br and the total fe vi dosage required was 6 0 mm when the concentration of br was 10 mm only 4 0 mm fe vi was needed to achieve nearly complete removal of ammonia in 60 min because of the ubiquitous occurrence of br in ammonia containing wastewater the catalytic effect of br during fe vi treatment of ammonia is extremely important which can shorten the treatment time save economic costs and greatly reduce the generation of iron sludge shi et al 2020 3 2 exploration of the mechanism for accelerated removal of ammonia in fe vi br system as for the underlying mechanisms it was reported that the reaction of fe vi with br could lead to the generation of active bromine species hobr obr which have strong reactivity with nh4 nh3 and thus may contribute to the enhanced ammonia removal jiang et al 2016 heeb et al 2017 hofmanm et al 2001 in addition the promoted generation of oh by br may be another reason for the enhanced ammonia oxidation previously zhu et al 2020 has demonstrated that the self decomposition of fe vi produced the fe iv species and h2o2 eq 1 with the thermodynamic parameters of each species calculated by density functional theory dft method table s3 the reaction enthalpy change h and gibbs free energy change g of eq 1 was determined as 922 328 and 1015 400 kj mol respectively indicating that the formation of h2o2 was thermodynamically feasible subsequently the generated fe iv and h2o2 could quickly react with each other to form fe ii and fe iii via eqs 2 3 luo et al 2020 which then catalyzed the decomposition of h2o2 to produce oh via fenton and fenton like reaction the generation of oh from the self decay of fe vi was also observed in aqueous solution of fe vi with a yield of less than 5 lee et al 2014 with the increase of br concentration the self decay of fe vi is accelerated thus promoting the generation of oh jiang et al 2016 in summary due to their stronger reactivity than fe vi the newly generated active bromine hobr obr and oh would enhance the removal of ammonia wang et al 2017 hofmanm et al 2001 this mechanism was proposed in scheme 1 which was further verified by experiments below 1 fe vi o 4 2 2 h 2 o h h 3 fe iv o 4 h 2 o 2 2 h 3 fe iv o 4 h 2 o 2 h fe ii oh 2 aq o 2 2 h 2 o 3 h 3 fe iv o 4 fe ii oh 2 aq h 2 o 2 fe iii oh 3 aq oh 3 2 1 examination of the role of fe v fe iv species very recently several studies have proposed that the high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv formed in situ from the electron transfer reaction between fe vi and hso3 had stronger reactivity and could improve the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants zhu et al 2020 according to previous study the self decay of fe vi could also lead to the generation of fe v fe iv species in order to examine the possible contribution of fe v fe iv species to ammonia oxidation quenching experiments was conducted using pmso as a scavenger fig s8 moreover we also measured the yield of pmso2 in fe vi and fe vi br system using pmso as a probe compound li et al 2021 the results showed that the generation of fe v and fe iv could not be the reason for the enhanced ammonia removal text s6 3 2 2 epr detection of hydroxyl radicals with the presence of br to explore the active radicals produced in fe vi br system electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were performed using 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the trapping reagent el asmar et al 2021 the presence of br was found to enhance the generation of oh in fe vi solution fig s11 which was partially responsible for the promoted oxidation of ammonia text s7 3 2 3 the contribution of hydroxyl radicals and active bromine species as we discussed above the oxidants in fe vi br system that could contribute to the conversion of ammonia were ferrate hobr obr and oh to confirm the generation of reactive species quenching experiments were performed using nitrobenzene nb and phenol phoh as scavengers both nb and phoh can act as a scavenger for oh and the rate constants were 3 9 109 and 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively kochany et al 1991 zhang et al 2019b moreover phoh is also a trapping agent for hobr obr with the apparent rate constant of 6 34 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 0 gallard et al 2003 thus the contribution of each reactive species could be distinguished by addition of these two scavengers as shown in fig s13 nb showed little effect on the oxidation of ammonia while significant inhibition was observed for phoh when 0 2 mm nb and phoh was individually introduced into the fe vi br system the removal efficiency of ammonia at 10 min was decreased from 57 2 to 54 9 and 20 1 respectively these results indicated that oh and especially hobr obr were involved in the oxidation of ammonia in fe vi br system considering that these quenching agents could also consume fe vi additional experiments together with model simulations were also performed to further verify the involvement of these reactive species and estimate the contributions of all oxidizing species in fe vi br system according to linear fitting of kinetic data in fig s14 the second order reaction rate constant of nb and phoh with fe vi was 4 7040 10 1 and 3 4509 10 m 1 s 1 respectively on the basis of these second order rate constant k fe vi com values we could estimate the elimination of nb and phoh from the exposure doses of fe vi by measuring fe vi concentrations in the fe vi br system eq 4 as shown in fig 2 a b the actual degradation of nb and phoh in fe vi br system were all faster than the simulated degradation by fe vi suggesting that some new reactive species were indeed generated after the addition of br due to the strong reactivity with these species the degradation of nb and phoh would become faster than that only considers the role of fe vi from the characteristics of the probe compounds the observed degradation of nb in fe vi br system was ascribed to the contribution of fe vi and newly generated oh eq 5 thus the concentration of oh could be approximately calculated according to eq 6 by considering the following two factors i the difference between the simulated and experimental values of the degradation rate of nb ii the second order rate constant between nb and oh k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 similarly the measured degradation efficiency of phoh was obviously higher than that predicted from eq 4 fig 2 b indicating that other oxidants than fe vi participated in the degradation of phoh in this system due to its reaction with oh and hobr obr the enhanced removal of phoh should be attributed to the combined role of the two oxidants eq 7 since the contribution of oh to phoh degradation could be quantified using the calculated oh concentration and the k oh phoh value k oh phoh 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 the concentration of hobr obr was approximately calculated according to eq 8 the calculated concentrations of oh and hobr obr newly generated in fe vi br system were presented in fig 2 c as seen the concentration of hobr obr was always higher than the oh concentration it reached the maximum of 6 05 10 10 m at 15 s and then gradually decreased due to further reaction the variation trend of oh was similar to that of hobr obr and its largest concentration was 2 38 10 13 m 4 in com t com 0 k

generated when br was present in fe vi system the reaction rate constant of oh with ammonia was reported to be 8 9 107 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2019b according to eq 9 the apparent second order rate constant k app of ammonia with hobr obr was calculated to be 1 12 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 in which k hobr and knh4 represent the dissociation constant of hobr 10 8 8 and ammonia 10 9 2 respectively and k hobr and k obr were the species specific rate constant for the reaction of hobr and obr with ammonia respectively k hobr 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 k obr 7 6 104 m 1 s 1 heeb et al 2017 wajon et al 1982 thus the reaction rate constants of both oh and hobr obr with ammonia were much higher than that of fe vi 3 385 10 1 m 1 s 1 fig s3 based on the estimated concentrations of oh and hobr obr and measured fe vi concentration the removal of ammonia in fe vi br system was simulated under different scenarios as shown in fig 2 d the numerical simulation from the model that considered the roles of fe vi and newly generated reactive species oh and hobr obr was more consistent with the experimental data the linear fitting equation of the remaining ammonia ct c0 was obtained as yexp 1 0059 xcal r² 0 905 the slope of the fitting line was much close to 1 suggesting that these in situ formed reactive species were mainly responsible for the enhanced transformation of ammonia in fe vi br system previous studies have shown that active bromine hobr obr could react with phenolic compounds easily resulting in the formation of brominated degradation byproducts heeb et al 2014 qiang et al 2012 therefore p chlorophenol was used as a probe compound to check the presence of active bromine indirectly by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis of brominated byproducts see text s8 for more details according to the lc ms ms results active bromine hobr obr were present in fe vi br system in addition the relative contribution of each oxidative species was calculated as the ratio of simulated removal efficiency by each oxidant to the total removal efficiency of ammonia from all the available data the contribution of hobr obr fe vi and oh to ammonia removal in fe vi br system was estimated to be 66 7 33 0 and 0 3 respectively 3 3 practical application prospect of the fe vi br method for ammonia removal 3 3 1 removal of ammonia in bromide containing real waters as shown in fig s19 ammonia removal was also enhanced in br containing real water samples after 60 min of oxidation 31 6 of ammonia could be removed by 2 0 mm fe vi in borate buffer solution bbs and the removal efficiencies increased to 35 7 38 6 42 3 and 59 6 in river water rw secondary clarifier effluent sce petrochemical wastewater pw and bromination wastewater bw respectively interestingly the br concentrations in these waters were in the same order of the removal efficiencies of ammonia table s1 moreover the percentage of ammonia removed in pw and bw was lower than that in bbs with similar concentrations of br addition the possible reason is that the co existing dissolved organic matter competes with ammonia for oxidant which to some extent counters the positive effect of br zheng et al 2021 from these results fe vi showed excellent performance for the elimination of ammonia in real waters especially those containing high levels of br thus fe vi oxidation could be used as a promising method for ammonia removal in water and wastewater treatment 3 3 2 inhibited formation of brominated byproducts during ammonia oxidation in fe vi br system monobromoacetic acid mbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa tribromethane tbm and bromate bro3 are common brominated dbps that have received considerable health concern and they can be generated during water treatment process involving br wang et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 to pretect human health usepa has regulated mcl value of 10 80 and 60 μg l for bro3 tbm and two bromoacetic acid mbaa and dbaa respectively benson et al 2017 in this study the concentrations of dbps formed were determined to evaluate the ecological risk of bromide containing waters after fe vi oxidative treatment the cumulative amount of these dbps was detected after 12 h of reaction which was sufficient to completely consume fe vi for the formation of active bromine species fig s20 fig 3 a compared the concentrations of organic dbps formed in br rich wastewaters with and without the presence of ammonia the concentrations of br in petrochemical wastewater and bromination wastewater were approximately 1 00 and 4 05 mm respectively except for the two real wastewater samples phenol phoh and benzoic acid ba were selected as model compounds to simulate the reaction of br 10 mm with low molecular weight organic compounds that are ubiquitously present in wastewaters during fe vi treatment in all cases mbaa were not detected in the reaction solution probably due to their further transformation into higher brominated products as shown in fig 3 a the formation of dbaa and tbaa were both observed in the two br rich wastewaters moreover tbm was detected in bromination wastewater however the concentration of these dbps were all reduced in the presence of 1 mm ammonia for example the concentration of dbaa tbaa and tbm formed in bw was reduced from 29 10 53 58 and 5 13 μg l to 21 34 36 17 and 2 80 μg l respectively this result suggested that ammonia could inhibit the formation of tbm and baas during fe vi oxidation besides the conversion potential of phoh to dbps is greater than that of ba which may be related to the high reactivity of hobr obr towards phoh k 6 34 106 m 1 s 1 in the absence of ammonia dbaa tbaa and tbm were detected in phoh and ba solution at concentrations of 5 24 61 35 38 06 48 88 and 11 97 34 46 μg l respectively it is noteworthy that the concentration of dbaa 61 35 5 39 μg l formed in phoh solution has exceeded the mcl of usepa 60 μg l when 1 mm ammonia was added into the solution the risk of dbps formation was significantly decreased in this case the formation of tbm was completely blocked and the concentration of dbaa and tbaa was reduced to 3 51 36 48 and 33 49 41 07 μg l respectively all of which were within the limits of usepa moreover bro3 was generated at 0 44 3 42 mg l during fe vi oxidation of br 1 10 mm but its concentration became undetectable less than 10 μg l when ammonia was present fig 3 b suggesting that ammonia could significantly inhibit the formation of bro3 in this fe vi oxidation system the reaction mechanism for the inhibited formation of dbps by ammonia was proposed in fig 3 c due to the larger reaction rate constant with ammonia than with many organic compounds table s4 hobr obr would preferentially attack ammonia thus the presence of ammonia significantly suppressed the generation of baas and tbm meanwhile since the reaction between hobr obr and fe vi is very slow jiang et al 2016 hobr obr will be immediately consumed by ammonia k ammonia hobr 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 k ammonia obr 7 6 104 m 1 s 1 as soon as it is generated leaving little chance for its further oxidation to bromate therefore the addition of ammonia has become one of the most feasible methods to inhibit dbps and bromate formation during oxidation processes wu et al 2020 koo et al 2021 ding et al 2021 in summary given the simultaneous control of brominated dbps this fe vi br treatment method is promising for the removal of ammonia in wastewater treatment 3 4 oxidation mechanism of ammonia by fe vi 3 4 1 analysis of reaction products during the removal of ammonia the reaction products of ammonia during multiple addition of fe vi were measured using ic analysis it could be seen from fig 4 that nh4 nh3 was mainly transformed into nitrate no3 in fe vi oxidation process although nitrite no2 was also detected during the oxidation process the amount was negligible because no2 was very easy to undergo further oxidation to generate no3 in the oxidizing environment mass balance analysis showed that the total amount of nh4 no2 no3 was always close to 1 mm suggesting that no other existing form of nitrogen was available in the current reaction system moreover nitrated byproducts including 4 chloro nitrosophenol and 4 chloro dinitrophenol were detected by lc ms ms technology in the fe vi oxidation process of coexisting ammonia and p chlorophenol further verifying the presence of no2 as an oxidation intermediate text s8 3 4 2 theoretical analysis for the proposed reaction mechanism density functional theory dft calculations were performed to explore the reaction steps for the generation of no3 during the oxidation of nh3 by hfevio4 the detailed mechanism could be divided into six stages scheme s2 including oxygen transfer hydrogen abstraction and nucleophilic substitution reaction accompanied with the formation of adducts the gibbs free energy profiles of all reactions involved were elucidated in fig 5 initially an o atom of the fe o bond in hfevio4 gradually approached the h atom of nh3 along the irc determined reaction path as the o h distance decreased from 2 0 å to 1 8 å the transition state was reached with the occurrence of h atom transfer the central nitrogen atom was attracted to the electron withdrawing o atom of another fe o bond to generate an fe iv o nh2 adduct pr1 as shown in stage i of scheme s2 the activation energy δg and the gibbs free energy change δg of this reaction was calculated to be 26 62 kj mol and 288 71 kj mol respectively next under the attack of oh the fe iv o nh2 adduct pr1 could undergo nucleophilic substitution reaction to generate deprotonated hydroxylamine nh2o and tetravalent iron species h3feivo4 specifically the fe o bond length increased from 1 8 å to 2 0 å indicating that nh2o was successfully dissociated from pr1 as the leaving group meanwhile the distance between o atom of oh and the central fe atom decreased from 2 0 å to 1 9 å suggesting the addition of oh to form h3feivo4 the gibbs free energy of product pr2 was significantly lower than the reactant re2 g 213 79 kj mol and no transition state was found in the process in stage iii abstraction of two h atoms from nh2o by hfevio4 occurred resulting in the formation of nitroxyl anion no and tetravalent iron h3feivo4 in theory this reaction was also barrierless and could happen spontaneously g 254 87 kj mol which was the reason for the high reaction rate constant of fe vi and nh2oh k app 9 39 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 0 sharma et al 2011 in stage iv no could donate an electron to the high valent fe vi through direct interaction with the ferrate oxygen atoms to form fe iv o n o adduct pr4 as shown in fig 5 the distance between n atom of no and the o atom of hfevio4 decreased from 2 0 å to 1 3 å which fully proved that a new bond was formed between the two atoms this reaction had a g value of 234 52 kj mol requiring no activation energy in stage v an effective nucleophilic substitution reaction occurred spontaneously in the presence of strong nucleophile oh and h2feivo4 2 and nitrite ions no2 was generated as result similar to stage ii as oh attacked the central fe atom of pr4 in this process the bond length of the original fe o bond was increased from 1 9 å to 2 1 å in this way no2 was generated from pr4 as an important intermediate during ammonia oxidation by fe vi with the presence of a water molecule oxygen transfer occurred between no2 and hfevio4 and then no3 and h3feivo4 were produced spontaneously in the final stage the gibbs free energy of pr6 decreased by 628 70 kj mol as compared with re6 fig 5 therefore the generated no2 was prone to be immediately oxidized into no3 by fe vi with the reaction rate constant of 1 10 103 m 1 s 1 sharma et al 2011 which was in agreement with our experimental result that no3 was the final product of ammonia oxidation in summary all reactions were thermodynamically spontaneous and the first reaction that had to overcome an energy barrier was considered the rate limiting step moreover oh acted as a nucleophile to participate in the nucleophilic substitution reaction of stage ii and stage v suggesting that alkaline conditions were more favorable for ammonia oxidation which was consistent with the observed phenomenon that the oxidation efficiency of ammonia was improved with the increasing solution ph 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that br exerted a significant promoting effect on ammonia oxidation by fe vi and the reaction time and the oxidant dose for nearly complete removal of 1 0 mm ammonia could be reduced by half by 10 mm br in multiple fe vi addition mode the in situ generated active bromine hobr obr was found as the dominant species contributing to the accelerated removal of ammonia based on the second order kinetics model the concentrations of reactive species were calculated to evaluate the respective contribution of each reactive species to ammonia oxidation in fe vi br system from the model estimation hobr obr and fe vi were the two major reactive species accounting for 66 7 and 33 0 of ammonia removal respectively although hobr obr could be transformed into bro3 and other organic dbps in fe vi oxidation system the formation potential of these toxic byproducts was significantly inhibited in the presence of 1 mm ammonia and the concentrations detected were all within the safe levels specified by the usepa density functional theory calculations were performed together with the identified nitrogen intermediates to reveal the stepwise reaction mechanism of ammonia oxidation by hfeo4 all six reactions involved could occur spontaneously sometimes in the presence of oh and the first reaction to generate an fe iv o nh2 adduct was identified as the rate limiting step because br is ubiquitously present in natural waters and industrial wastewaters its promoting effect on ammonia removal during fe vi oxidation process is crucial and should be highly valued in summary these findings would provide some insights into the in situ fe vi oxidation of pollutants by making full use of naturally occurring ions in real waters declaration of competing

15701,this work systematically examined the capability of ferrate fe vi for ammonia oxidation revealing for the first time that bromide ions br played an important role in promoting the removal of ammonia in fe vi system in the presence of 10 0 mm br the removal efficiency of ammonia was nearly 3 4 times that of the control and 1 0 mm ammonia was almost completely removed after two rounds addition of 1 0 mm fe vi in 60 min pmso probe test electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and radical quenching experiments were employed to interpret the underlying promotion mechanism of br and it was proposed that the formation of active bromine hobr obr played a dominant role in the enhanced oxidative removal of ammonia by fe vi further kinetic model simulations revealed that hobr obr and fe vi were the two major reactive species in fe vi br system accounting for 66 7 and 33 0 of ammonia removal respectively as the target contaminant ammonia could quickly consume the generated hobr obr thereby suppressing the formation of brominated disinfection byproducts finally no3 was identified as the dominant transformation product of ammonia and density functional theory dft calculations revealed that six reaction stages were involved in ammonia oxidation with the first step as the rate limiting step this work would enable the full use of coexisting bromides for effective removal of ammonia from natural waters or wastewaters by in situ fe vi oxidation method graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonia ferrate vi bromide ions active bromine species dft calculations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ammonia is a common inorganic contaminant which is ubiquitous in surface water groundwater and wastewater and has potential environmental risks zhang et al 2019a tang et al 2021 as a typical organic wastewater coking wastewater has been reported to contain high concentrations of ammonia which can even reach up to hundreds of mg l zheng et al 2020 since the wastewater treatment plants wwtps could not remove ammonia completely residual ammonia in wwtps effluents may enter into the aqueous environment a survey on the state of the environment in china found that the concentration of ammonia in natural waters could reach more than 10 mg l zhang et al 2019a ammonia can cause the problem of water eutrophication threatening the health of aquatic organisms zhang et al 2019b thus developing strategy for efficient removal of ammonia is highly desirable many researchers have examined the removal of ammonia by conventional water treatment methods such as biological treatment mal et al 2017 jantarakasem et al 2020 breakpoint chlorination pressley et al 1972 electrochemical and photocatalytic processes etc zhang et al 2019b zhao et al 2018 unfortunately the intrinsic drawbacks of these technologies limit their potential application for instance the efficiency of biological treatment is relatively low which is highly dependent on the environmental conditions such as ph temperature and content of total organic carbon toc yang et al 2021 breakpoint chlorination is unfavorable due to its high cost and complexity in operation zhang et al 2019b electrochemical and photocatalytic technology would consume a large amount of energy doekhi bennani et al 2021 in order to overcome these shortcomings it is of great significance to explore other treatment technologies to remove ammonia from water due to its powerful oxidation performance together with sterilization and flocculation functions fe vi is being increasingly used as a multifunctional oxidant for water treatment which has drawn wide concern he et al 2021 liu et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 so far fe vi has been successfully applied in the removal of various organic contaminants such as phenolic compounds aromatic organoarsenic compounds and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps wang et al 2020 huang et al 2021 huang et al 2018 yang et al 2018 however at present most studies focus on the removal of organic pollutants by fe vi which makes that very limited information is available on fe vi oxidation of inorganic pollutants it has been reported by sharma et al 1998 that fe vi could oxidize ammonia to nitrate in water which significantly reduced the aquatic toxicity bellezi et al 2015 daam et al 2020 however the reaction rate constant of ammonia with fe vi is significantly low as compared with most organic compounds thus it is important to explore how to improve the removal efficiency of ammonia in fe vi oxidation system if this problem is solved this fe vi oxidation technology may become a promising alternative to the nitrification treatment of the traditional a o process then nitrate generated from ammonia oxidation could be refluxed to the anoxic reactor for the denitrification reaction sun et al 2010 bromide ions are ubiquitous in various industrial wastewaters from the manufacture of leaded gasoline pesticides flame retardants pharmaceuticals and photographic papers grebel et al 2010 shi et al 2020 and their presence has been shown to affect a variety of water treatment processes such as photolysis zhang et al 2020 electrochemical system ma et al 2014 and advanced oxidation processes aops liu et al 2018 according to previous studies bromide ions are likely to be converted to active bromine species br bro and hobr bro etc in the above mentioned treatment processes exerting an promotion or inhibition effect on the removal of pollutants wang et al 2014 moreover jiang et al 2016 have revealed that fe vi could slowly oxidize br to form active bromine species hobr obr and the formation amount of bromate did not exceed the usepa maximum contaminant level mcl 10 μg l according to the literature the reaction constants of nh4 nh3 with hobr obr 7 6 104 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 were much higher than that with fe vi 3 7 10 1 m 1 s 1 sharma et al 1998 heeb et al 2017 thus active bromine species are more efficient oxidants for ammonia oxidation than fe vi given the frequent coexistence of br and ammonia in the industrial wastewaters e g petrochemical industrial wastewater it is of great importance to investigate whether the presence of bromide ions could enhance the removal of ammonia in fe vi system hydroxylamine nh2oh and nitrite no2 are two important intermediates during the transformation process of ammonia to nitrate wang et al 2017 nenov et al 2004 however the interaction between ammonia and oxidants has not been fully addressed and more importantly the stepwise oxidation mechanism remains to be clearly elucidated such information could be obtained from quantum chemical theoretical calculations where the energy barriers of all elementary reactions are determined according to calculations based on transition state theory yue et al 2020 in summary the objectives of this study are to i investigate the feasibility of the oxidation of ammonia by fe vi and explore practical method to increase the utilization efficiency of fe vi ii examine the influences of coexisting bromide ions on ammonia oxidation with emphasis on the related promoting mechanisms iii evaluate the application potential of the fe vi br method for ammonia removal in water and wastewater treatment through the experiments in real water samples and the analysis of disinfection byproducts dbps formed iv apply density functional theory dft based calculations to elucidate the oxidation mechanism of ammonia by fe vi this work can give some new insights into the effect of coexisting bromides on ammonia oxidation which may provide a new approach to remove ammonia efficiently from natural waters or wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and water samples source of chemicals and details of water samples are given in text s1 2 2 oxidation experiment a series of experiments was performed in 100 ml conical flasks at 25 c reaction solutions containing 1 0 mm ammonia were prepared in 20 mm borate buffer solution which were added with 1 0 m h2so4 or naoh to offset the ph fluctuations caused by subsequent addition of oxidant then the reaction was initiated with the addition of a certain amount of freshly prepared fe vi solution under rapid stirring 500 rpm at the defined time intervals 5 ml of sample was withdrawn and terminated by 50 μl of 0 2 m na2s2o3 after passing through 0 22 μm nylon syringe filter scaa 104 anpel shanghai china the filtrate was collected for the following ion chromatography analysis the samples for detection of disinfection byproducts dbps were collected after 12 h of reaction all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analysis methods the concentrations of nh4 nh3 no2 no3 and bro3 were measured by ion chromatography dionex sunnyvale usa equipped with a dionex ionpac as20 analytical column 4 mm 250 mm and an ag20 guard column 4 mm 40 mm the effluent used to detect anions and cations were 15 0 mm koh and 10 0 mm ch3so3h respectively and the flow rate was set at 1 0 ml min the injection volume was 25 μl and the column temperature was 30 the limit of detection for nh4 no2 no3 and bro3 were 0 04 mg l 0 03 mg l 0 10 and 0 01 mg l respectively halomethanes and haloacetic acids in the reaction solution were extracted with methyl tert butyl ether mtbe using a modified epa method 551 1 and epa method 552 2 respectively and analyzed on a gas chromatograph agilent 7820a instrument equipped with an electron capture detector gc ecd according to previously well established methods benanou et al 1998 detailed information on the gc and other analysis methods is given in text s2 2 4 theoretical calculations the dft based calculations were conducted by gaussian 09 program gaussian inc usa at the m062x lanl2dz level frisch et al 2009 qi et al 2021 and the solvent effect of water was considered by polarizable continuum model pcm in the framework of self consistent reaction field scrf luque et al 1996 transition states tss were calculated by pseudo reaction coordinate method and intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analysis was performed to confirm the structure of ts yu et al 2017 zou et al 2021 all tss met the criteria that only one imaginary frequency appeared initial guess structure of reactant complexes res and product complexes prs were also obtained from irc curves which was then fully optimized to obtain precise geometrical structures with associated vibration analysis to ensure no imaginary frequency xiao et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 the gibbs free energies g and total energies e were directly obtained from the gaussian output files 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of ammonia by fe vi 3 1 1 effect of solution ph and addition mode of fe vi in this work ammonia was used to represent the total amount of nh4 and nh3 h2o in the reaction solution the degradation of ammonia by 2 0 mm fe vi was enhanced with increasing ph values which was related to changes in nh3 fraction and fe vi stability text s3 meanwhile multiple addition mode could realize the complete removal of 1 0 mm ammonia by improving the utilization efficiency of the oxidant text s4 3 1 2 promoting effect of br on the removal of ammonia in fe vi system according to previous studies the coexistence of halide ions in wastewater and natural waters may affect the degradation efficiency and transformation pathway of pollutants berne et al 2004 cheng et al 2018 xiang et al 2019 hofmann et al 2001 have demonstrated that bromide would form free bromine to further react with ammonia in the ozonation process in this work a series of experiments was performed to explore the influence of bromide ions br on the removal of ammonia by fe vi according to their actual concentrations in petrochemical industrial wastewaters shi et al 2020 four concentration levels of br i e 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 10 0 mm were used in batch experiments as shown in fig 1 a the presence of br significantly promoted the conversion of ammonia in the presence of 1 0 mm br the removal efficiency of ammonia increased from 11 1 1 2 to 14 7 1 8 moreover the promotion effect on ammonia removal was more obvious with the increasing concentration of br the removal efficiency of ammonia reached 37 4 1 7 in the presence of 10 0 mm br nearly 3 4 times that of the control different concentrations of br in the form of sodium salts were used which could result in a large difference in the ionic strength i and na concentration of reaction solutions whereas additional analysis has demonstrated that ionic strength i and na were not the cause see text s5 for more details and the enhanced removal of ammonia should be attributed to the br itself 3 1 3 accelerated removal of ammonia by br in multiple addition mode the removal efficiencies of ammonia were further examined in the presence of br using multiple addition method fe vi was added at intervals of 30 min and the addition dosage was 2 0 mm each time the results were shown in fig 1 b after adding fe vi for 4 rounds i e with a total of 8 0 mm fe vi addition 1 0 mm ammonia could be completely removed in 120 min in the control group as discussed above the presence of br could enhance the oxidation of ammonia when 1 mm br was present the 90 min removal efficiency of ammonia increased by 8 5 as compared with the control group at higher bromide concentrations of 2 and 4 mm the removal efficiency of ammonia was further improved almost 100 conversion was achieved within 90 min in the presence of 2 mm br and the total fe vi dosage required was 6 0 mm when the concentration of br was 10 mm only 4 0 mm fe vi was needed to achieve nearly complete removal of ammonia in 60 min because of the ubiquitous occurrence of br in ammonia containing wastewater the catalytic effect of br during fe vi treatment of ammonia is extremely important which can shorten the treatment time save economic costs and greatly reduce the generation of iron sludge shi et al 2020 3 2 exploration of the mechanism for accelerated removal of ammonia in fe vi br system as for the underlying mechanisms it was reported that the reaction of fe vi with br could lead to the generation of active bromine species hobr obr which have strong reactivity with nh4 nh3 and thus may contribute to the enhanced ammonia removal jiang et al 2016 heeb et al 2017 hofmanm et al 2001 in addition the promoted generation of oh by br may be another reason for the enhanced ammonia oxidation previously zhu et al 2020 has demonstrated that the self decomposition of fe vi produced the fe iv species and h2o2 eq 1 with the thermodynamic parameters of each species calculated by density functional theory dft method table s3 the reaction enthalpy change h and gibbs free energy change g of eq 1 was determined as 922 328 and 1015 400 kj mol respectively indicating that the formation of h2o2 was thermodynamically feasible subsequently the generated fe iv and h2o2 could quickly react with each other to form fe ii and fe iii via eqs 2 3 luo et al 2020 which then catalyzed the decomposition of h2o2 to produce oh via fenton and fenton like reaction the generation of oh from the self decay of fe vi was also observed in aqueous solution of fe vi with a yield of less than 5 lee et al 2014 with the increase of br concentration the self decay of fe vi is accelerated thus promoting the generation of oh jiang et al 2016 in summary due to their stronger reactivity than fe vi the newly generated active bromine hobr obr and oh would enhance the removal of ammonia wang et al 2017 hofmanm et al 2001 this mechanism was proposed in scheme 1 which was further verified by experiments below 1 fe vi o 4 2 2 h 2 o h h 3 fe iv o 4 h 2 o 2 2 h 3 fe iv o 4 h 2 o 2 h fe ii oh 2 aq o 2 2 h 2 o 3 h 3 fe iv o 4 fe ii oh 2 aq h 2 o 2 fe iii oh 3 aq oh 3 2 1 examination of the role of fe v fe iv species very recently several studies have proposed that the high valent metal oxo intermediates fe v fe iv formed in situ from the electron transfer reaction between fe vi and hso3 had stronger reactivity and could improve the degradation efficiency of organic pollutants zhu et al 2020 according to previous study the self decay of fe vi could also lead to the generation of fe v fe iv species in order to examine the possible contribution of fe v fe iv species to ammonia oxidation quenching experiments was conducted using pmso as a scavenger fig s8 moreover we also measured the yield of pmso2 in fe vi and fe vi br system using pmso as a probe compound li et al 2021 the results showed that the generation of fe v and fe iv could not be the reason for the enhanced ammonia removal text s6 3 2 2 epr detection of hydroxyl radicals with the presence of br to explore the active radicals produced in fe vi br system electron paramagnetic resonance epr experiments were performed using 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline n oxide dmpo as the trapping reagent el asmar et al 2021 the presence of br was found to enhance the generation of oh in fe vi solution fig s11 which was partially responsible for the promoted oxidation of ammonia text s7 3 2 3 the contribution of hydroxyl radicals and active bromine species as we discussed above the oxidants in fe vi br system that could contribute to the conversion of ammonia were ferrate hobr obr and oh to confirm the generation of reactive species quenching experiments were performed using nitrobenzene nb and phenol phoh as scavengers both nb and phoh can act as a scavenger for oh and the rate constants were 3 9 109 and 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 respectively kochany et al 1991 zhang et al 2019b moreover phoh is also a trapping agent for hobr obr with the apparent rate constant of 6 34 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 0 gallard et al 2003 thus the contribution of each reactive species could be distinguished by addition of these two scavengers as shown in fig s13 nb showed little effect on the oxidation of ammonia while significant inhibition was observed for phoh when 0 2 mm nb and phoh was individually introduced into the fe vi br system the removal efficiency of ammonia at 10 min was decreased from 57 2 to 54 9 and 20 1 respectively these results indicated that oh and especially hobr obr were involved in the oxidation of ammonia in fe vi br system considering that these quenching agents could also consume fe vi additional experiments together with model simulations were also performed to further verify the involvement of these reactive species and estimate the contributions of all oxidizing species in fe vi br system according to linear fitting of kinetic data in fig s14 the second order reaction rate constant of nb and phoh with fe vi was 4 7040 10 1 and 3 4509 10 m 1 s 1 respectively on the basis of these second order rate constant k fe vi com values we could estimate the elimination of nb and phoh from the exposure doses of fe vi by measuring fe vi concentrations in the fe vi br system eq 4 as shown in fig 2 a b the actual degradation of nb and phoh in fe vi br system were all faster than the simulated degradation by fe vi suggesting that some new reactive species were indeed generated after the addition of br due to the strong reactivity with these species the degradation of nb and phoh would become faster than that only considers the role of fe vi from the characteristics of the probe compounds the observed degradation of nb in fe vi br system was ascribed to the contribution of fe vi and newly generated oh eq 5 thus the concentration of oh could be approximately calculated according to eq 6 by considering the following two factors i the difference between the simulated and experimental values of the degradation rate of nb ii the second order rate constant between nb and oh k oh nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 similarly the measured degradation efficiency of phoh was obviously higher than that predicted from eq 4 fig 2 b indicating that other oxidants than fe vi participated in the degradation of phoh in this system due to its reaction with oh and hobr obr the enhanced removal of phoh should be attributed to the combined role of the two oxidants eq 7 since the contribution of oh to phoh degradation could be quantified using the calculated oh concentration and the k oh phoh value k oh phoh 1 4 1010 m 1 s 1 the concentration of hobr obr was approximately calculated according to eq 8 the calculated concentrations of oh and hobr obr newly generated in fe vi br system were presented in fig 2 c as seen the concentration of hobr obr was always higher than the oh concentration it reached the maximum of 6 05 10 10 m at 15 s and then gradually decreased due to further reaction the variation trend of oh was similar to that of hobr obr and its largest concentration was 2 38 10 13 m 4 in com t com 0 k

generated when br was present in fe vi system the reaction rate constant of oh with ammonia was reported to be 8 9 107 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2019b according to eq 9 the apparent second order rate constant k app of ammonia with hobr obr was calculated to be 1 12 107 m 1 s 1 at ph 9 in which k hobr and knh4 represent the dissociation constant of hobr 10 8 8 and ammonia 10 9 2 respectively and k hobr and k obr were the species specific rate constant for the reaction of hobr and obr with ammonia respectively k hobr 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 k obr 7 6 104 m 1 s 1 heeb et al 2017 wajon et al 1982 thus the reaction rate constants of both oh and hobr obr with ammonia were much higher than that of fe vi 3 385 10 1 m 1 s 1 fig s3 based on the estimated concentrations of oh and hobr obr and measured fe vi concentration the removal of ammonia in fe vi br system was simulated under different scenarios as shown in fig 2 d the numerical simulation from the model that considered the roles of fe vi and newly generated reactive species oh and hobr obr was more consistent with the experimental data the linear fitting equation of the remaining ammonia ct c0 was obtained as yexp 1 0059 xcal r² 0 905 the slope of the fitting line was much close to 1 suggesting that these in situ formed reactive species were mainly responsible for the enhanced transformation of ammonia in fe vi br system previous studies have shown that active bromine hobr obr could react with phenolic compounds easily resulting in the formation of brominated degradation byproducts heeb et al 2014 qiang et al 2012 therefore p chlorophenol was used as a probe compound to check the presence of active bromine indirectly by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc ms ms analysis of brominated byproducts see text s8 for more details according to the lc ms ms results active bromine hobr obr were present in fe vi br system in addition the relative contribution of each oxidative species was calculated as the ratio of simulated removal efficiency by each oxidant to the total removal efficiency of ammonia from all the available data the contribution of hobr obr fe vi and oh to ammonia removal in fe vi br system was estimated to be 66 7 33 0 and 0 3 respectively 3 3 practical application prospect of the fe vi br method for ammonia removal 3 3 1 removal of ammonia in bromide containing real waters as shown in fig s19 ammonia removal was also enhanced in br containing real water samples after 60 min of oxidation 31 6 of ammonia could be removed by 2 0 mm fe vi in borate buffer solution bbs and the removal efficiencies increased to 35 7 38 6 42 3 and 59 6 in river water rw secondary clarifier effluent sce petrochemical wastewater pw and bromination wastewater bw respectively interestingly the br concentrations in these waters were in the same order of the removal efficiencies of ammonia table s1 moreover the percentage of ammonia removed in pw and bw was lower than that in bbs with similar concentrations of br addition the possible reason is that the co existing dissolved organic matter competes with ammonia for oxidant which to some extent counters the positive effect of br zheng et al 2021 from these results fe vi showed excellent performance for the elimination of ammonia in real waters especially those containing high levels of br thus fe vi oxidation could be used as a promising method for ammonia removal in water and wastewater treatment 3 3 2 inhibited formation of brominated byproducts during ammonia oxidation in fe vi br system monobromoacetic acid mbaa dibromoacetic acid dbaa tribromoacetic acid tbaa tribromethane tbm and bromate bro3 are common brominated dbps that have received considerable health concern and they can be generated during water treatment process involving br wang et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 to pretect human health usepa has regulated mcl value of 10 80 and 60 μg l for bro3 tbm and two bromoacetic acid mbaa and dbaa respectively benson et al 2017 in this study the concentrations of dbps formed were determined to evaluate the ecological risk of bromide containing waters after fe vi oxidative treatment the cumulative amount of these dbps was detected after 12 h of reaction which was sufficient to completely consume fe vi for the formation of active bromine species fig s20 fig 3 a compared the concentrations of organic dbps formed in br rich wastewaters with and without the presence of ammonia the concentrations of br in petrochemical wastewater and bromination wastewater were approximately 1 00 and 4 05 mm respectively except for the two real wastewater samples phenol phoh and benzoic acid ba were selected as model compounds to simulate the reaction of br 10 mm with low molecular weight organic compounds that are ubiquitously present in wastewaters during fe vi treatment in all cases mbaa were not detected in the reaction solution probably due to their further transformation into higher brominated products as shown in fig 3 a the formation of dbaa and tbaa were both observed in the two br rich wastewaters moreover tbm was detected in bromination wastewater however the concentration of these dbps were all reduced in the presence of 1 mm ammonia for example the concentration of dbaa tbaa and tbm formed in bw was reduced from 29 10 53 58 and 5 13 μg l to 21 34 36 17 and 2 80 μg l respectively this result suggested that ammonia could inhibit the formation of tbm and baas during fe vi oxidation besides the conversion potential of phoh to dbps is greater than that of ba which may be related to the high reactivity of hobr obr towards phoh k 6 34 106 m 1 s 1 in the absence of ammonia dbaa tbaa and tbm were detected in phoh and ba solution at concentrations of 5 24 61 35 38 06 48 88 and 11 97 34 46 μg l respectively it is noteworthy that the concentration of dbaa 61 35 5 39 μg l formed in phoh solution has exceeded the mcl of usepa 60 μg l when 1 mm ammonia was added into the solution the risk of dbps formation was significantly decreased in this case the formation of tbm was completely blocked and the concentration of dbaa and tbaa was reduced to 3 51 36 48 and 33 49 41 07 μg l respectively all of which were within the limits of usepa moreover bro3 was generated at 0 44 3 42 mg l during fe vi oxidation of br 1 10 mm but its concentration became undetectable less than 10 μg l when ammonia was present fig 3 b suggesting that ammonia could significantly inhibit the formation of bro3 in this fe vi oxidation system the reaction mechanism for the inhibited formation of dbps by ammonia was proposed in fig 3 c due to the larger reaction rate constant with ammonia than with many organic compounds table s4 hobr obr would preferentially attack ammonia thus the presence of ammonia significantly suppressed the generation of baas and tbm meanwhile since the reaction between hobr obr and fe vi is very slow jiang et al 2016 hobr obr will be immediately consumed by ammonia k ammonia hobr 7 5 107 m 1 s 1 k ammonia obr 7 6 104 m 1 s 1 as soon as it is generated leaving little chance for its further oxidation to bromate therefore the addition of ammonia has become one of the most feasible methods to inhibit dbps and bromate formation during oxidation processes wu et al 2020 koo et al 2021 ding et al 2021 in summary given the simultaneous control of brominated dbps this fe vi br treatment method is promising for the removal of ammonia in wastewater treatment 3 4 oxidation mechanism of ammonia by fe vi 3 4 1 analysis of reaction products during the removal of ammonia the reaction products of ammonia during multiple addition of fe vi were measured using ic analysis it could be seen from fig 4 that nh4 nh3 was mainly transformed into nitrate no3 in fe vi oxidation process although nitrite no2 was also detected during the oxidation process the amount was negligible because no2 was very easy to undergo further oxidation to generate no3 in the oxidizing environment mass balance analysis showed that the total amount of nh4 no2 no3 was always close to 1 mm suggesting that no other existing form of nitrogen was available in the current reaction system moreover nitrated byproducts including 4 chloro nitrosophenol and 4 chloro dinitrophenol were detected by lc ms ms technology in the fe vi oxidation process of coexisting ammonia and p chlorophenol further verifying the presence of no2 as an oxidation intermediate text s8 3 4 2 theoretical analysis for the proposed reaction mechanism density functional theory dft calculations were performed to explore the reaction steps for the generation of no3 during the oxidation of nh3 by hfevio4 the detailed mechanism could be divided into six stages scheme s2 including oxygen transfer hydrogen abstraction and nucleophilic substitution reaction accompanied with the formation of adducts the gibbs free energy profiles of all reactions involved were elucidated in fig 5 initially an o atom of the fe o bond in hfevio4 gradually approached the h atom of nh3 along the irc determined reaction path as the o h distance decreased from 2 0 å to 1 8 å the transition state was reached with the occurrence of h atom transfer the central nitrogen atom was attracted to the electron withdrawing o atom of another fe o bond to generate an fe iv o nh2 adduct pr1 as shown in stage i of scheme s2 the activation energy δg and the gibbs free energy change δg of this reaction was calculated to be 26 62 kj mol and 288 71 kj mol respectively next under the attack of oh the fe iv o nh2 adduct pr1 could undergo nucleophilic substitution reaction to generate deprotonated hydroxylamine nh2o and tetravalent iron species h3feivo4 specifically the fe o bond length increased from 1 8 å to 2 0 å indicating that nh2o was successfully dissociated from pr1 as the leaving group meanwhile the distance between o atom of oh and the central fe atom decreased from 2 0 å to 1 9 å suggesting the addition of oh to form h3feivo4 the gibbs free energy of product pr2 was significantly lower than the reactant re2 g 213 79 kj mol and no transition state was found in the process in stage iii abstraction of two h atoms from nh2o by hfevio4 occurred resulting in the formation of nitroxyl anion no and tetravalent iron h3feivo4 in theory this reaction was also barrierless and could happen spontaneously g 254 87 kj mol which was the reason for the high reaction rate constant of fe vi and nh2oh k app 9 39 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 0 sharma et al 2011 in stage iv no could donate an electron to the high valent fe vi through direct interaction with the ferrate oxygen atoms to form fe iv o n o adduct pr4 as shown in fig 5 the distance between n atom of no and the o atom of hfevio4 decreased from 2 0 å to 1 3 å which fully proved that a new bond was formed between the two atoms this reaction had a g value of 234 52 kj mol requiring no activation energy in stage v an effective nucleophilic substitution reaction occurred spontaneously in the presence of strong nucleophile oh and h2feivo4 2 and nitrite ions no2 was generated as result similar to stage ii as oh attacked the central fe atom of pr4 in this process the bond length of the original fe o bond was increased from 1 9 å to 2 1 å in this way no2 was generated from pr4 as an important intermediate during ammonia oxidation by fe vi with the presence of a water molecule oxygen transfer occurred between no2 and hfevio4 and then no3 and h3feivo4 were produced spontaneously in the final stage the gibbs free energy of pr6 decreased by 628 70 kj mol as compared with re6 fig 5 therefore the generated no2 was prone to be immediately oxidized into no3 by fe vi with the reaction rate constant of 1 10 103 m 1 s 1 sharma et al 2011 which was in agreement with our experimental result that no3 was the final product of ammonia oxidation in summary all reactions were thermodynamically spontaneous and the first reaction that had to overcome an energy barrier was considered the rate limiting step moreover oh acted as a nucleophile to participate in the nucleophilic substitution reaction of stage ii and stage v suggesting that alkaline conditions were more favorable for ammonia oxidation which was consistent with the observed phenomenon that the oxidation efficiency of ammonia was improved with the increasing solution ph 4 conclusions this study demonstrated that br exerted a significant promoting effect on ammonia oxidation by fe vi and the reaction time and the oxidant dose for nearly complete removal of 1 0 mm ammonia could be reduced by half by 10 mm br in multiple fe vi addition mode the in situ generated active bromine hobr obr was found as the dominant species contributing to the accelerated removal of ammonia based on the second order kinetics model the concentrations of reactive species were calculated to evaluate the respective contribution of each reactive species to ammonia oxidation in fe vi br system from the model estimation hobr obr and fe vi were the two major reactive species accounting for 66 7 and 33 0 of ammonia removal respectively although hobr obr could be transformed into bro3 and other organic dbps in fe vi oxidation system the formation potential of these toxic byproducts was significantly inhibited in the presence of 1 mm ammonia and the concentrations detected were all within the safe levels specified by the usepa density functional theory calculations were performed together with the identified nitrogen intermediates to reveal the stepwise reaction mechanism of ammonia oxidation by hfeo4 all six reactions involved could occur spontaneously sometimes in the presence of oh and the first reaction to generate an fe iv o nh2 adduct was identified as the rate limiting step because br is ubiquitously present in natural waters and industrial wastewaters its promoting effect on ammonia removal during fe vi oxidation process is crucial and should be highly valued in summary these findings would provide some insights into the in situ fe vi oxidation of pollutants by making full use of naturally occurring ions in real waters declaration of competing

15702,the groundwater environment often undergoes the transition from anoxic to oxic due to natural processes or human activities but the influence of this transition on the fate of groundwater contaminates are not entirely understood in this work the degradation of tribromophenol tbp in the presence of environmentally relevant iron oxyhydr oxides green rust gr and trace metal ions cu ii under anoxic oxic alternating conditions was investigated under anoxic conditions gr cu ii reduced tbp to 4 bp completely within 7 h while gr only had an adsorption effect on tbp under oxic conditions gr cu ii could generate oh via dioxygen activation which resulted in the oxidative transformation of tbp sixty five percentage of tbp mineralization was achieved via a sequential reduction oxidation process which was not achieved through single reduction or oxidation process the produced cu i in gr cu ii enhanced not only the reductive dehalogenation under anoxic conditions but also the o2 activation under oxic conditions thus the fate of tbp in anoxic oxic alternating groundwater environment is greatly influenced by the presence of gr cu ii the sequential reduction oxidation degradation of tbp by gr cu ii is promising for future remediation of tbp contaminated groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords green rust copper ii ions anoxic to oxic transition tribromophenol dioxygen activation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction green rust gr has been identified as a mixed valent iron hydroxide mineral in anoxic groundwater environment christiansen et al 2009 huang et al 2017 gr has the chemical formula of feii 1 x feiii x oh 2 a n x n nh2o where a represents the interlayer anions and x is the molar fraction of fe iii gr shows a strong reductive activity towards many oxidant pollutants such as chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons chen et al 2022 lee and batchelor 2002 and high valent heavy metals beck et al 2008 zhao et al 2022 recently the environmental relevance of gr interacting with dissolved trace metals in anoxic environments has been realized elzinga 2021 cu is a relatively abundant trace metal in subsurface environments due to its use in water pipes fertilizers pesticides and so on arenas lago et al 2014 cu could be adsorbed onto environmentally relevant fe iii oxyhydr oxides gadde 1974 komarek et al 2018 whose reductive dissolution under reducing subsurface environments may result in gr formation and the concurrent release of cu ii borch et al 2010 kirk 2004 ponnamperuma 1972 taylor 1980 the presence of cu ii significantly enhances the reductive reactivity of gr due to the galvanic effect with gr as a corrosion anode and the formed cu 0 or cu i as cathode fang et al 2019b huang et al 2018 thus the cu dopped gr gr cu ii is hypothesized to accelerate the reductive transformation of various reducible organic pollutants under anoxic conditions however even complete reduction products of some organic pollutants such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons hahs are still toxic due to the persistence of aromatic hydrocarbons towards reductive degradation chang et al 2012 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp as a hahs is a typical brominated flame retardant which is widely used in epoxy resin polyurethane and other polymer materials halden et al 2010 tbp has a low natural attenuation rate may disperse or leach into the environment from relevant product applications ronen et al 2005 sim et al 2009 specifically the concentrations of tbp found in the subsurface environment range from 0 3 to 3690 μg kg zhang et al 2019 tbp is highly toxic carcinogenic and has adverse effects on the thyroid hormone system in animals and humans suzuki et al 2008 the complete dehalogenated product of tbp i e phenol is still toxic although its oxidative bio degradation in the soil is well known ekpe et al 2022 studies show that the sequential reduction oxidation process is effective for complete mineralization of hahs since the formed aromatic hydrocarbons in the reduction process can be effectively degraded in the subsequent oxidation process luo et al 2011 wu et al 2019 luo et al employed a two stage reduction subsequent oxidation of tbbpa using fe ag bimetallic nanoparticles however this process required energy intensive ultrasound radiation to enhance the reaction and the addition of h2o2 chemicals to initiate the oxic step wu et al studied the continuous degradation of tbbpa by sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron s nzvi in a dynamic two step anoxic oxic process however the reaction mechanism and degradation pathways of tbbpa under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic conditions was not compared the reported materials in these previous studies are mostly synthetic nanomaterials rather than natural occurring materials but the gr cu ii studied in this work is of highly environmental relevance because the presence of gr and cu ii has been documented in a variety of natural and engineered environments borch et al 2010 christiansen et al 2009 kirk 2004 swietlik et al 2012 whether this sequential reduction oxidation of hahs can be achieved by gr cu ii in groundwater environments has not been studied the groundwater environment often undergoes the transition from anoxic to oxic due to natural processes or human activities such as the fluctuations of groundwater level artificial recharge of groundwater and air sparging etc bass et al 2000 hester and gooseff 2010 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 the process of anoxic to oxic transition may provide nature occurring conditions for possible sequential reduction oxidation of hahs which may lead to their complete detoxification however the reductive reactivity of pristine gr is lower than engineered iron based reductants such as zero valent iron thus non complete reductive dehalogenation has usually been observed for gr fang et al 2019a 2019b also the effect of cu ii on reductive dehalogenation of hahs by gr has not been studied so far on the other hand we recently found that the oxygenation of gr can produce hydroxyl radicals oh leading to the oxidation of typical organic contaminants in subsurface environments fang et al 2021 however the influence of trace metals such as cu ii on oh production during the oxygenation of gr has been seldom studied zhao et al 2018 cu ii amendment can improve the reductive reactivity of gr for the reduction of hahs which is beneficial for further oxidative degradation and mineralization of hahs also the low valent cu produced by gr in anoxic environment can activate dioxygen when the environment changes from anoxic to oxic previous studies on gr or gr cu ii were limited to single anoxic or oxic environment although the interaction between gr and tbp under anoxic to oxic transition conditions was studied in our previous study zhang et al 2022 it was found that gr only has adsorption and oxidation effect on tbp under anoxic oxic conditions in this work the possible sequential reduction oxidation of tbp by gr cu ii at anoxic oxic boundaries in the subsurface environment has been explored the interaction of tbp with gr cu ii under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic transition conditions has been investigated for the first time in addition the pathways for the reductive and oxidative degradation of tbp were revealed via radical quenching experiment intermediate product analysis and density functional theory dft calculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals fecl2 fecl3 6h2o naoh hcl cucl2 benzoic acid ba 1 10 phenanthroline and tbp were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all chemicals were analytical reagents aqueous reagents were prepared using oxygen free ultrapure water electrical conductivity 18 25 mω cm 2 2 preparation of gr and gr cu ii the gr was synthesized according to our previous work yin et al 2017 and the details were described in text s1 prior to use the as synthesized gr was washed with n2 bubbled water the fe ii content and the ratio of fe ii fe iii of the gr suspension were determined which was 150 mm and 3 respectively the predetermined amount of gr was added into reaction vials according to the fe ii concentration of gr fe ii gr for the synthesis of gr cu ii cu ii aqueous solution with a ph of 8 was prepared followed by the addition of gr suspensions under magnetic stirring 2 3 tbp degradation under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic conditions tbp degradation experiments under anoxic conditions were conducted in 100 ml airtight glass vials containing a 50 ml reaction solution in darkness sample preparations were performed in a glovebox filled with n2 99 999 the reaction solution was prepared by adding 0 5 ml of 1 mm tbp stock solution followed by 0 5 ml of 100 mm cucl2 stock solution subsequently a predetermined volume of gr suspensions was added to obtain a 50 ml of reaction suspensions and 10 mm of fe ii gr the initial ph of the reaction suspensions was adjusted to 8 using 0 1 m naoh and not controlled along the reaction course the reaction was initiated by magnetically stirring the reaction suspensions at 550 rpm one ml of suspensions was sampled at predetermined time intervals filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe filter and immediately analyzed the concentrations of tbp and its debromination products including 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 dbp 4 bromophenol 4 bp and bromide ion were determined the concentrations of the fe and cu species such as fe ii fe iii cu i and cu ii were measured for comparison the tbp degradation by gr or cu ii alone was performed using the same procedures as gr cu ii for the experiment under oxic conditions the reaction suspensions were prepared in the same procedure as that under anoxic conditions except that the headspace of the reaction vials was filled with air the oh capture experiments were conducted using 10 mm benzoic acid ba to verify the contribution of oh to tbp degradation 1 m ethanol an effective oh scavenger was added before oxygenation for the anoxic to oxic transition experiments the solution was exposed to air for 5 h after the 7 h anoxic treatment the experimental procedures are the same as the anoxic or oxic treatment alone expect for a combined treatment the degradation and mineralization of tbp by gr cu ii in real groundwater under anoxic to oxic transition conditions were also investigated the parameters of the groundwater are shown in supplementary table s1 the ph of the real groundwater was adjusted to 8 prior to experiment all the experiments were carried out at least in duplicate 2 4 analytical methods and solid state characterizations the analysis details concerning the concentrations of tbp and its intermediate products bromine ions oh produced during the oxygenation of gr or gr cu ii are all shown in text s2 fe ii and fe iii in the gr and the reaction solutions were determined by a modified phenanthroline spectrophotometric method at 510 nm method text s3 huang et al 2013 cu ii and cu i in the gr cu ii were determined using a 2 9 dimethyl 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometric method at 457 nm zhang et al 2018 total cu concentration was determined after the reduction of cu ii to cu i by excess hydroxylamine hydrochloride and cu ii concentration was calculated by subtraction the structural cu was calculated by subtracting the cu in solution from the total cu gr cu ii before and after anoxic oxic reaction were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps xrd data were collected using a malvern x ray diffractometer xpert pro in the range of 5 70 xps were obtained using a kratos axis ultradld instrument and all binding energies were calibrated to adventitious c 284 8 ev total organic carbon toc analysis was performed using a toc tn analyzer multi n c 2100 analytik jena germany and the detailed experimental procedures are shown in text s2 electrochemical analyses including cyclic voltammetry cv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were performed on an electrochemical workstation chi 600e ch instruments usa the electrochemical experimental details are shown in text s4 2 5 dft calculation analysis the computational calculations based on dft were carried out using gaussian 09 program package tobin and foresman 2011 condensed fukui function was calculated to predict the regioselectivity of reactive species for tbp molecule attacking liu et al 2019 details on dft calculation are shown in text s5 3 results and discussion 3 1 reduction of tbp under anoxic conditions 3 1 1 tbp reduction by gr cu ii about 80 of tbp was removed by gr after 7 h of reaction but no degradation products were detected fig 1 a demonstrating the tbp removal was resulted from the adsorption of gr tbp is negatively charged at ph 8 pka 6 3 gr has a positively charged trioctahedral iron hydroxide layer which results in the adsorption of tbp by gr via electrostatic interaction zhang et al 2022 cu ii cannot reduce tbp but 14 of tbp was removed in the cu ii system that may be because copper ions exist in the forms of cu2 and cuoh at ph 7 8 lee et al 2002 which could complex with organic molecules such as tbp pei et al 2011 the complexation between copper ions and tbp affect its retention and peak area during hplc separation flieger et al 2006 surowiec et al 2008 in contrast tbp was completely reduced to debromination products 2 4 dbp and 4 bp by gr cu ii within 3 h fig 1b the tbp concentrations gradually decreased along the reaction course the concentration of 2 4 dbp first increased to a peak value and then dropped gradually the 4 bp concentrations in the solution steadily increased as the reaction proceeded and reached 8 8 μm within 7 h the carbon balance was relatively constant at 0 9 along the reaction time suggesting all the debromination products were recovered during the reaction fig 1b thus tbp underwent a sequential debromination pathway tbp 2 4 dbp 4 bp with br released into the reaction solution the br gradually increased to 20 µm after 7 h reaction by gr cu ii while no br was observed for gr fig 1c the amount of released br was in line with the fact that the debromination of 10 µm tbp to 4 bp was accompanied by the release of 20 µm br gr has only adsorption rather than reductive reactivity towards tbp under anoxic conditions since no br was observed after reaction the enhanced reductive reactivity of gr via cu ii doping can be explained by the formation of a galvanic couple consisting of gr anode and low valent cu as cathode fang et al 2019b in which electrons are transferred from gr to cu noted that gr cu ii can completely reduce 2 4 dbp to 4 bp within 7 h but has no reductive reactivity towards 4 bp supplementary fig s1 it further verified that tbp was debrominated to 4 bp by gr cu ii but no further degradation can be achieved under anoxic conditions 3 1 2 characterization of gr cu ii the xrd patterns of gr cu ii before and after reaction with tbp were shown in fig 2 a the addition of cu ii led to the partial transformation of gr to lepidocrocite and magnetite the intensity of gr characteristic peaks was significantly weakened after the reaction between gr cu ii and tbp in anoxic conditions for 7 h furthermore the cu and fe species were identified via xps analysis fig 2b c since the binding energies of cu i and cu 0 are very close the formation of cu species was further examined by the auger spectra fig 2d cu lmm auger spectra confirmed the reduction of cu ii to cu ⅰi by gr and cu 0 was not detected which was consistent with our previous studies huang et al 2018 cu i could still be detected after 7 h anoxic reaction fig 2c indicating that cu i was sufficient in the process of reducing tbp compared to the intensity of cu i xps peak before reaction it increased after 7 h anoxic reaction that is because the sample before reaction was collected immediately after cu ii was added to gr suspensions the reaction time of gr with cu ii was short and only parts of cu ii was reduced to cu i although cu i was consumed for the reductive debromination of tbp it continuously regenerated through the reduction of cu ii by gr as the reaction went on resulting in the increased intensity of cu i xps peak after 7 h of anoxic reaction no characteristic peaks from cuo or cu2o particles were observed in xrd which may be attributed to the detection limitation of xrd for components with content less than 2 3 1 3 effect of gr dosage on tbp reduction the kinetic curves of tbp removal were well fitted with the pseudo first order reaction model supplementary fig s2a the removal efficiency of tbp with 5 mm fe ii gr was almost the same for that with 10 mm fe ii gr meanwhile the production of 2 4 dbp and 4 bp also showed a similar trend with the dosages of fe ii gr increasing from 5 to 10 mm however the extent of tbp debromination decreased when the dosage of fe ii gr increased to 20 mm the pseudo first order reaction rate decreased from 1 84 h 1 to 0 87 h 1 with the dosages of fe ii gr increasing from 10 mm to 20 mm in addition 2 4 dbp as an intermediate had not been completely reduced to 4 bp within 7 h reaction with the fe ii gr dosages of 15 mm and 20 mm supplementary fig s2b c the reason for this phenomenon is that gr played two roles in the removal of tbp an electron donator for tbp reduction and an adsorbent for tbp although gr cannot reduce tbp it can reduce cu ii to cu i and then reduces tbp the adsorption sites for tbp increase with the increase of the gr content and more tbp was adsorbed by gr however the gr adsorbed tbp may not diffuse to the reductive active cu i sites therefore the carbon balance in the reaction solution dropped from 100 to 78 when the dosage of gr increased from 5 mm to 20 mm due to the adsorption of tbp by gr supplementary fig s2d correspondingly the degradation extent calculated by the sum of 2 4 dbp and 4 bp was decreased supplementary fig s2d insert moreover the adsorption rate of tbp by gr is slower than the reduction rate of tbp by gr cu ii fig 1a b thus the removal rate of tbp decreased with the dosages of fe ii gr increasing to 20 mm 3 1 4 effect of cu ii dosage on tbp reduction the dosage of cu ii has a significant effect on the reductive debromination of tbp by gr cu ii when the cu ii dosage was 0 5 mm and 1 mm tbp can be completely reduced within 3 h supplementary fig s3a the degradation efficiency of tbp was almost the same but the reduction of 2 4 dbp intermediate to 4 bp was enhanced when cu ii dosage increased from 0 5 mm to 1 mm supplementary fig s3b c when the cu ii dosage further increased to 2 mm and 3 mm the removal efficiency of tbp decreased from 100 to 52 and 31 respectively also only 2 4 dbp was determined as the degradation intermediate and no 4 bp was observed it demonstrates that cu ii at high concentrations was unfavorable for the reduction of tbp by gr cu ii the reason for this phenomenon may be that more cu ii consumed more electrons of gr which impeded the cu i mediated electron transfer from gr to tbp furthermore increasing the concentration of cu ii resulted in the release of more protons because more fe ii was oxidized to fe iii consequently the ph was dropped and the oxidation reduction potential orp was increased supplementary fig s3d decreasing the reductive reactivity of gr cu ii 3 1 5 effect of ph on tbp reduction when the initial ph increased from 6 to 8 the pseudo first order removal rate of tbp increased from 0 83 h 1 to 1 84 h 1 however the removal rate was decreased to 1 07 h 1 when the ph was further increased to 9 supplementary fig s4a the production of 2 4 dbp 4 bp was also enhanced when ph increased from 6 to 8 but inhibited when ph further increased to 9 supplementary fig s4b c this phenomenon demonstrated that the reactivity of gr cu ii is the highest at a slightly alkaline environment maithreepala and doong 2005 the iron hydroxide layers of gr are greatly affected by environmental ph and only remain stable under near neutral or weakly alkaline conditions gr can transform into more stable iron hydr oxides with lower reduction reactivity under alkaline conditions and the generation of reactive low valence cu may also be inhibited maithreepala and doong 2005 in addition due to the zero point charge of the gr being 8 5 guilbaud et al 2013 gr is negatively charged at ph 9 resulting in repelling the negatively charged tbp molecules on the other hand gr may dissolve in an acidic or neutral environment genin et al 2001 which leads to a decrease in the reductive reactivity of gr 3 1 6 electrochemical analysis the free corrosion potential of gr determined from the tafel scan was shifted negatively from 0 18 to 0 21 upon cu ii addition fig 3 a the corrosion current of gr increased from 1 013 10 7a to 6 656 10 7a after the addition of cu ii indicating that gr cu ii has a greater electron donating ability than gr because of the galvanic effect compared with gr mono valent cu has a stronger reduction strength due to its lower reduction potentials huang et al 2018 the corrosion potential of gr cu ii shifted positively after its reaction with tbp for 7 h under anoxic conditions fig 3a indicating a decreased electron donating capability of gr cu ii after reductive debromination reaction 3 2 oxidative degradation of tbp under oxic conditions 3 2 1 oxidative degradation of tbp by gr cu ii the removal efficiency of tbp by gr alone reached 60 after 7 h oxygenation and cu ii had no reactivity towards tbp removal fig 4 a after the addition of cu ii into gr suspensions to form gr cu ii the removal efficiency of tbp increased to 73 within 7 h oxygenation br was detected in both gr and gr cu ii systems fig 5 d indicating that the removal of tbp under oxic conditions was due to degradation rather than adsorption xrd patterns showed gr cu ii was transformed rapidly to magnetite and lepidocrocite upon exposure to oxygen fig 2a it was reported that gr coupled with cu ii could activate dioxygen to generate oh in oxic conditions zhao et al 2018 although the role of cu ii has not been fully understood 3 2 2 identification of oh the cumulative concentration of oh produced from the oxygenation of gr and gr cu ii was quantified using the hydroxylation of benzoic acid ba to p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba as a probe reaction fig 4b showed that 30 µm of oh was gradually produced by gr and gr cu ii which was in line with the oxidative degradation of tbp in comparison the concentration of oh dropped to 6 3 μm decreased by 80 with the addition of 1 m ethanol further confirming the generation of oh from gr cu ii oxygenation moreover the degradation of tbp was significantly inhibited when 1 m ethanol was added into the reaction suspensions fig 4c which demonstrated that the produced oh was responsible for the oxidative degradation of tbp by gr cu ii the rate of oh generation in the early stage by gr cu ii was higher than gr but slowed down in the later stage fig 4b the final cumulative amount of oh from the oxygenation of gr cu ii was lower than that of gr upon air exposure gr was rapidly transformed to magnetite which may activate dioxygen fig 2a ardo et al have reported that magnetite can activate dioxygen to produce oh and dissolved and structural fe ii are both responsible for oh generation ardo et al 2015 the reaction rate of fe ii with cu ii is tens of thousands of times faster than that with o2 reactions 1 and 4 supplementary table s2 in addition both cu i and fe ii are capable of reducing o2 to h2o2 but cu i is more reactive in activating o2 reactions 5 6 supplementary table s2 than fe ii reactions 1 2 supplementary table s2 that is why the rate of oh generation in the early stage by gr cu ii was higher than gr in the later stage cu i was consumed and its re generation may be very slow thus the o2 activation by fe ii which is less reactive than cu i lead to a declined oh generation rate in the later stage the electrons used for oh production is donated by fe ii in gr or gr cu ii system the added cu ii consumed part of fe ii and less fe ii was reacted with h2o2 although the reaction between cu i and h2o2 produces oh as well the reaction rate between fe ii and h2o2 4 79 103 m 1 s 1 is much higher than that between cu i and h2o2 100 m 1 s 1 reactions 3 and 8 supplementary table s2 therefore the presence of 1 mm cu ii in the reaction suspensions slightly decreased the final accumulative concentration of oh by 4 µm the amount of br produced by gr cu ii was slightly lower than gr fig 5d which was consistent with the lower amount of produced oh this phenomenon also confirmed the important role of oh in the oxidative debromination of tbp 3 2 3 effects of reaction parameters when the concentration of fe ii gr in gr cu ii increased from 5 mm to 10 mm the tbp degradation efficiency under oxic conditions increased from 48 to 74 supplementary fig s5a however further increasing the concentration of gr did not result in an increase of the degradation efficiency increasing the concentration of gr within a certain range can produce more cu i for dioxygen activation but the content of cu i cannot increase further once gr is in great excess with cu ii no more cu ii can be reduced to cu i due to the limited dosage of cu ii and the reduction rate of o2 to h2o2 by gr is slow supplementary table s2 therefore the degradation efficiency of tbp cannot be improved significantly when the content of gr is higher than 10 mm the removal efficiency of tbp was slightly increased when the dosage of cu ii increased from 0 5 mm to 1 mm however a further increase in cu ii concentration decreased the degradation efficiency of tbp from 74 at 1 mm cu ii to 39 at 3 mm cu ii supplementary fig s5b since more fe ii was oxidized by cu ii less fe ii was involved in the fenton reaction with h2o2 to generate oh although the h2o2 can be reduced to oh by cu i as well its rate is much slower than that by fe ii supplementary table s2 thus more cu ii inhibited the degradation efficiency of tbp when the dosage of cu was higher than 1 mm the effect of initial ph on the oxidative degradation of tbp by gr cu ii is negligible supplementary fig s5c this is because the ph of the gr cu ii system was decreased rapidly to 4 in the initial 1 h and changed slightly in the later 6 h upon exposure to dioxygen supplementary fig s5d the ph decrease of the system is due to the release of protons caused by the oxidation of structural or aqueous fe ii to magnetite and lepidocrocite fig 2a eq 1 1 fe 2 1 5 o 2 2 5 o h 4 5 h 2 o 1 5 f e 3 o 4 2 5 feo oh 8 5 h 3 3 mineralization of tbp during anoxic to oxic transition 3 3 1 tbp degradation by gr cu ii since tbp was completely reduced to 4 bp by gr cu ii under anoxic conditions further degradation of 4 bp under oxic conditions was investigated nearly 81 of 4 bp was degraded within 5 h after the anoxic to oxic transition fig 5a in contrast only 21 of 4 bp was removed within 5 h in the presence of 1 m ethanol fig 5b confirming the contribution of oh to the oxidative degradation of 4 bp the oxidative degradation of 4 bp was not completely inhibited by 1 m ethanol because the production of oh could not be completely inhibited by 1 m ethanol as shown in the oh quenching experiment fig 4b the br that was released into the reaction solution increased gradually to 26 9 µm fig 5c equivalent to 89 debromination of tbp in contrast no br was produced by gr in the anoxic process and only 4 4 µm of br was produced in the oxic process in addition only 10 µm of br anions were detected after the oxygenation of gr cu ii fig 5d indicating that the reductive debromination process under anoxic conditions was essential for the subsequent oxidative degradation of tbp also the reduction of 4 bp did not occur under anoxic conditions fig 1b supplementary fig s1b suggesting that the production of oh under oxic conditions was essential for 4 bp degradation gr cu ii achieved sequential reductive oxidative debromination of tbp as the condition changing from anoxic to oxic leading to effective degradation of tbp the characteristic xrd peaks of gr were still present although weakened after 7 h of anoxic reaction with tbp fig 2a furthermore xps analysis showed that fe ii and cu i were still present after 7 h of anoxic reaction fig 2b c supplementary table s3 these results suggest that gr cu ii had the ability for dioxygen activation after reacting with tbp under anoxic conditions after the subsequent 5 h of oxic reaction fe ii and cu i content on the solid surface decreased compared with the results after anoxic reaction supplementary table s3 demonstrating that fe ii and cu i were consumed under oxic conditions the samples collected for xps analysis consist of aqueous copper and iron ions deposited on the sample surface during the drying process in the glovebox the changes of dissolved and structural copper and iron ions detected by spectrophotometric method are discussed in detail later the reaction between dioxygen and anoxic treated gr cu ii under oxic conditions was confirmed by the transformation of gr to magnetite and lepidocrocite fig 2a the corrosion potential of gr cu ii after its reaction with tbp under anoxic conditions is negative fig 3a confirming that gr cu ii still has reductive reactivity after the tbp reduction process compared with tafel curve of gr cu ii after 7 h of anoxic reaction the position of tafel curve of gr cu ii after 0 5 h of oxic reaction with tbp shifted negatively the reason is that the anodic and cathodic reactions changed due to the introduction of o2 holmes and crundwell 2000 meanwhile gr was also transformed to other iron oxy hydroxides when the environment changed from anoxic to oxic the tafel curve of gr cu ii shifted positively after 4 h of oxic reaction with tbp indicating a decreased electron donating capability of gr cu ii the reduction of o2 on gr cu ii was characterized by cv under oxic conditions a cathodic peak at 0 8 v was observed as a result of o2 reduction while no cathodic peak was observed in the o2 free electrolyte fig 3b a similar o2 reduction peak was observed in the cv of a fe cu tip electrode zhang et al 2020b further supporting that gr cu ii still has the activity for o2 reduction after the tbp reduction process 3 3 2 mineralization of tbp the mineralization was examined by the analysis of toc the toc basically remained constant at 90 during the anoxic conditions but decreased significantly to 35 under the subsequent oxic conditions fig 6 a it is speculated that the hydroxylation breakage of the benzene ring of tbp occurs under oxic conditions which is followed by the oxidative degradation of the as generated organic fragments about 65 mineralization of tbp was achieved via the sequential reductive oxidative debromination of tbp while the toc value was almost unchanged under oxic conditions fig 6b toc values were basically constant under anoxic conditions and oxic conditions indicating that the adsorption of reductive and oxidative products of tbp did not occur it further confirmed that the decrease of toc under anoxic to oxic conditions was due to mineralization thus the combination of reductive and oxidative debromination is effective for mineralization of tbp by gr cu ii 3 3 3 change of fe ii and cu i during the reaction the changes of fe ii and cu i content during the anoxic to oxic transition were analyzed supplementary fig s6 structural fe ii was gradually decreasing while dissolved fe ii was increasing within 7 h of anoxic reaction supplementary fig s6a b however the decrease of structural fe ii 1 4 mm is greater than the increase of dissolved fe ii 0 7 mm demonstrating that the total fe ii in the system was depleted structural fe ii was the electron donor for cu ii reduction under anoxic conditions cu ii could oxidize gr resulting in a decreased ph value of the reaction suspensions and the dissolution of structural fe ii occurred subsequently no dissolved cu ions including cu ii and cu i supplementary fig s6c were detected under anoxic conditions that was because the ph of the solution was only slightly dropped from 8 to 7 8 within 7 h and the cu existed as a solid form in this ph range it was found that structural cu i first increased and then decreased during the reaction under anoxic conditions the reduction of cu ii produces structural cu i which at the same time was consumed for the reductive debromination of tbp fe ii was sufficient in the early stage of anoxic reaction resulting in a faster production of cu i than the consumption the peak of structural cu i concentration located within 2 5 h when 2 4 dbp was gradually reduced to 4 bp indicating the consumption rate of cu i by the reduction of 2 4 dbp was slower than by the reduction of tbp at earlier stage however the structural cu i decreased in the later stage supplementary fig s6c the reason was that the production rates of cu i may decrease with the consumption of fe ii but cu i was still consumed by 2 4 dbp as the reaction went on in the subsequent oxic reaction the concentration of structural fe ii decreased rapidly within 1 h and dissolved fe ii also decreased supplementary fig s6a b the fe ii in gr was rapidly oxidized to fe iii once exposed to dioxygen which was also supported by the xrd data fig 2a the diffraction peaks of gr disappeared and only magnetite and lepidocrocite were observed after 0 5 h of oxygenation the oxidation rate of structural fe ii iron was faster than that of dissolved fe ii during the oxic reaction the concentration of structural cu i was rapidly dropped to 0 within 1 h of oxygenation supplementary fig s6c which is likely due to that structural cu i was oxidized or dissolved as seen from the increased concentration of cu i ions in solution the ph dropped to 5 during the oxidation of gr to magnetite which may lead to the dissolution and release of structural cu i into solution the dissolved cu i first increased rapidly and then decreased slowly since cu i was gradually consumed during the oxic reaction process therefore it can be inferred that the structural fe ii and cu i are the main species for dioxygen activation in the early stage of the tbp oxidation process while the dissolved fe ii and cu i are the continuous driving force for dioxygen activation cu ii plays a very important role in reductive debromination and oxidative degradation of tbp for the reductive debromination of tbp cu ii is a redox mediator for enhancing the reductive reactivity of gr the reductive debromination was enhanced because cu i is a more reactive reductant than gr for the oxidative degradation of tbp cu ii changed the pathway of dioxygen activation by gr cu ii is reduced to cu i by fe ii gr and cu i is involved in the activation of dioxygen the reduction of o2 to h2o2 by cu i is faster compared with fe ii gr the oxidative degradation rate of tbp is enhanced in the early stage when the concentration of cu i is high under anoxic to oxic transition conditions gr cu ii lead to sequential reduction oxidation of tbp that gr alone cannot achieve 3 3 4 mineralization pathways of tbp hplc ms was employed to identify the tbp degradation products under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic conditions supplementary fig s7a c the molecule with an m z of 172 9 corresponded to 4 bp was detected under anoxic and anoxic to oxic conditions two intermediates m z of 266 8 and 184 8 were identified as 2 6 dibromo p benzoquinone and 2 bromo 1 4 benzoquinon which were the hydroxylated derivatives of tbp under oxic conditions the main peaks at an m z of 116 9 were derived from the short chain fatty acids resulted from the opening of phenol ring during anoxic to oxic transition dft calculations were employed to further elucidate the degradation pathway the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo are commonly used to depict the reactive sites of an organic molecule to lose and obtain electrons respectively zhang et al 2020a the lumo of the tbp is mainly concentrated on c br bonds fig 7 a thus these sites are susceptible to accepting electrons resulting in reductive debromination of tbp moreover fig 7 shows the homo orbitals predominantly surround the electron rich atoms br10 of tbp and br12 of 4 bp respectively oh is an electrophilic species and is also capable of causing radical attacks chen et al 2019 gao et al 2021 noted that oh is the dominant reactive species under oxic conditions in this work according to the radical quenching results fig 4b c thus br10 of tbp and br12 of 4 bp are the major hydroxylation reaction sites leading to the formation of 2 6 dibromo p benzoquinone and p hydroquinone in addition the charge distribution natural population analysis npa and fukui index f f f0 in prediction of nucleophilic electrophilic and radical attacks were calculated to further elucidate the regioselectivity of reactive species supplementary table s4 gao et al 2021 liu et al 2019 the sites with higher f values are vulnerable to be attacked by electrons owing to their capability of stabilizing additional electrons ona et al 2016 as a result the br9 and br11 atoms of tbp with the highest f 0 09401 are easy to be attacked by electrons leading to the formation of 2 4 dbp also the br10 atom of 2 4 dbp has the highest f 0 08315 supplementary table s5 which readily undergoes nucleophilic attack by electrons resulting in the formation of 4 bp during reductive debromination it is consistent with the results of hplc and hplc ms that tbp was sequentially debrominated to 4 bp under anoxic conditions moreover the atoms with higher f0 values are the sites which are more easily attacked by oh gao et al 2021 br10 on tbp and br12 on 4 bp are the most active sites with high f0 values of 0 13291 and 0 5077 respectively supplementary table s4 supplementary table s6 therefore these sites are easily hydroxylated during the oxidation process on the other hand the c2 and c4 atoms of 4 bp with high f0 values of 0 111525 and 0 1026 are highly vulnerable to oh resulting in ring opening and mineralization of 4 bp these results are consistent with the oxidation products detected by hplc ms under oxic conditions and anoxic to oxic conditions according to hplc ms data and dft calculation the possible tbp degradation pathway was proposed fig 8 which outlined both reductive and oxidative debromination of tbp under anoxic conditions tbp can undergo reductive debromination by gr cu ii to produce 4 bp under oxic conditions the c br10 bond of tbp was broken under the attack of oh to form 2 6 dibromo p benzoquinone and further degraded to 2 bromo 1 4 benzoquinon upon anoxic to oxic transition the reduction of tbp to 4 bp in the anoxic stage led to an increase in the electron cloud density on the benzene ring which is beneficial to the subsequent oh attack and ring opening process of 4 bp in the oxic stage the br12 of 4 bp was firstly hydroxylated followed by ring opening reactions due to further attack on polyhydroxy compound products by oh subsequently short chain carboxylic acids were yielded which were further oxidized to co2 and h2o by oh the degradation products of tbp observed in the process of reduction or oxidation alone were not completely debrominated which were still toxic thus the combination of reduction and oxidation was a superior approach for the full detoxification of tbp 4 mineralization of tbp in real groundwater the sequential reduction and oxidation of tbp by gr cu ii occurred in real groundwater matrices and the mineralization of tbp was also achieved fig 9 the removal rate of tbp was slightly decreased and the final mineralization efficiency was 55 less than 65 in ultrapure water the so4 2 in groundwater may compete with tbp for gr cu ii reactive sites inhibiting the tbp degradation by gr cu ii fang et al 2019a the concentrations of cu ii in real groundwater environments is in the range from 0 to 0 3 µm but is high in seawater intrusion areas industrial and urban areas and tailing mines al hossainy 2015 kargar et al 2012 montlucon and sanudo wilhelmy 2001 concentrated cu ii often occur in the wastewater of smelters and leakage of tailings due to the discharge and infiltration of industrial wastewater the cu ii concentration in groundwater can be up to 0 3 mm al hossainy 2015 especially for the stations surrounding and downward the copper tailings dam the cu ii concentration in groundwater even reach 0 6 mm and max to 8 mm due to the gradual penetration of heavy metals originated from tailings dam into downstream groundwater resources kargar et al 2012 thus the results reported in this study has environmental significance on groundwater with high concentrations of copper ions such as downstream of tailings dam and sewage area 5 conclusion the presence of cu ii enhanced the reductive reactivity of gr towards tbp under anoxic conditions changing the tbp removal mechanism from adsorption to reductive dehalogenation tbp was reduced to 4 bp by gr cu ii within 7 h both gr and gr cu ii can activate dioxygen to generate oh under oxic conditions which lead to the oxidative degradation of tbp the presence of cu ii increases the production rate of oh in the initial 2 h during gr oxygenation but slightly reduces the final accumulative concentration of oh the reductive dehalogenation product 4 bp under anoxic conditions can be further degraded by gr cu ii under subsequent oxic conditions the complete degradation and 65 mineralization of tbp were achieved by gr cu ii in a sequential reduction oxidation process demonstrating that gr cu ii can effectively degrade tbp under the anoxic oxic alternating subsurface environment this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between tbp and gr cu ii in anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic conditions which highlight the role of combining reduction and oxidation processes for the mineralization of tbp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15702,the groundwater environment often undergoes the transition from anoxic to oxic due to natural processes or human activities but the influence of this transition on the fate of groundwater contaminates are not entirely understood in this work the degradation of tribromophenol tbp in the presence of environmentally relevant iron oxyhydr oxides green rust gr and trace metal ions cu ii under anoxic oxic alternating conditions was investigated under anoxic conditions gr cu ii reduced tbp to 4 bp completely within 7 h while gr only had an adsorption effect on tbp under oxic conditions gr cu ii could generate oh via dioxygen activation which resulted in the oxidative transformation of tbp sixty five percentage of tbp mineralization was achieved via a sequential reduction oxidation process which was not achieved through single reduction or oxidation process the produced cu i in gr cu ii enhanced not only the reductive dehalogenation under anoxic conditions but also the o2 activation under oxic conditions thus the fate of tbp in anoxic oxic alternating groundwater environment is greatly influenced by the presence of gr cu ii the sequential reduction oxidation degradation of tbp by gr cu ii is promising for future remediation of tbp contaminated groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords green rust copper ii ions anoxic to oxic transition tribromophenol dioxygen activation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction green rust gr has been identified as a mixed valent iron hydroxide mineral in anoxic groundwater environment christiansen et al 2009 huang et al 2017 gr has the chemical formula of feii 1 x feiii x oh 2 a n x n nh2o where a represents the interlayer anions and x is the molar fraction of fe iii gr shows a strong reductive activity towards many oxidant pollutants such as chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons chen et al 2022 lee and batchelor 2002 and high valent heavy metals beck et al 2008 zhao et al 2022 recently the environmental relevance of gr interacting with dissolved trace metals in anoxic environments has been realized elzinga 2021 cu is a relatively abundant trace metal in subsurface environments due to its use in water pipes fertilizers pesticides and so on arenas lago et al 2014 cu could be adsorbed onto environmentally relevant fe iii oxyhydr oxides gadde 1974 komarek et al 2018 whose reductive dissolution under reducing subsurface environments may result in gr formation and the concurrent release of cu ii borch et al 2010 kirk 2004 ponnamperuma 1972 taylor 1980 the presence of cu ii significantly enhances the reductive reactivity of gr due to the galvanic effect with gr as a corrosion anode and the formed cu 0 or cu i as cathode fang et al 2019b huang et al 2018 thus the cu dopped gr gr cu ii is hypothesized to accelerate the reductive transformation of various reducible organic pollutants under anoxic conditions however even complete reduction products of some organic pollutants such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons hahs are still toxic due to the persistence of aromatic hydrocarbons towards reductive degradation chang et al 2012 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp as a hahs is a typical brominated flame retardant which is widely used in epoxy resin polyurethane and other polymer materials halden et al 2010 tbp has a low natural attenuation rate may disperse or leach into the environment from relevant product applications ronen et al 2005 sim et al 2009 specifically the concentrations of tbp found in the subsurface environment range from 0 3 to 3690 μg kg zhang et al 2019 tbp is highly toxic carcinogenic and has adverse effects on the thyroid hormone system in animals and humans suzuki et al 2008 the complete dehalogenated product of tbp i e phenol is still toxic although its oxidative bio degradation in the soil is well known ekpe et al 2022 studies show that the sequential reduction oxidation process is effective for complete mineralization of hahs since the formed aromatic hydrocarbons in the reduction process can be effectively degraded in the subsequent oxidation process luo et al 2011 wu et al 2019 luo et al employed a two stage reduction subsequent oxidation of tbbpa using fe ag bimetallic nanoparticles however this process required energy intensive ultrasound radiation to enhance the reaction and the addition of h2o2 chemicals to initiate the oxic step wu et al studied the continuous degradation of tbbpa by sulfidated nanoscale zerovalent iron s nzvi in a dynamic two step anoxic oxic process however the reaction mechanism and degradation pathways of tbbpa under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic conditions was not compared the reported materials in these previous studies are mostly synthetic nanomaterials rather than natural occurring materials but the gr cu ii studied in this work is of highly environmental relevance because the presence of gr and cu ii has been documented in a variety of natural and engineered environments borch et al 2010 christiansen et al 2009 kirk 2004 swietlik et al 2012 whether this sequential reduction oxidation of hahs can be achieved by gr cu ii in groundwater environments has not been studied the groundwater environment often undergoes the transition from anoxic to oxic due to natural processes or human activities such as the fluctuations of groundwater level artificial recharge of groundwater and air sparging etc bass et al 2000 hester and gooseff 2010 kumar and riyazuddin 2012 the process of anoxic to oxic transition may provide nature occurring conditions for possible sequential reduction oxidation of hahs which may lead to their complete detoxification however the reductive reactivity of pristine gr is lower than engineered iron based reductants such as zero valent iron thus non complete reductive dehalogenation has usually been observed for gr fang et al 2019a 2019b also the effect of cu ii on reductive dehalogenation of hahs by gr has not been studied so far on the other hand we recently found that the oxygenation of gr can produce hydroxyl radicals oh leading to the oxidation of typical organic contaminants in subsurface environments fang et al 2021 however the influence of trace metals such as cu ii on oh production during the oxygenation of gr has been seldom studied zhao et al 2018 cu ii amendment can improve the reductive reactivity of gr for the reduction of hahs which is beneficial for further oxidative degradation and mineralization of hahs also the low valent cu produced by gr in anoxic environment can activate dioxygen when the environment changes from anoxic to oxic previous studies on gr or gr cu ii were limited to single anoxic or oxic environment although the interaction between gr and tbp under anoxic to oxic transition conditions was studied in our previous study zhang et al 2022 it was found that gr only has adsorption and oxidation effect on tbp under anoxic oxic conditions in this work the possible sequential reduction oxidation of tbp by gr cu ii at anoxic oxic boundaries in the subsurface environment has been explored the interaction of tbp with gr cu ii under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic transition conditions has been investigated for the first time in addition the pathways for the reductive and oxidative degradation of tbp were revealed via radical quenching experiment intermediate product analysis and density functional theory dft calculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals fecl2 fecl3 6h2o naoh hcl cucl2 benzoic acid ba 1 10 phenanthroline and tbp were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china all chemicals were analytical reagents aqueous reagents were prepared using oxygen free ultrapure water electrical conductivity 18 25 mω cm 2 2 preparation of gr and gr cu ii the gr was synthesized according to our previous work yin et al 2017 and the details were described in text s1 prior to use the as synthesized gr was washed with n2 bubbled water the fe ii content and the ratio of fe ii fe iii of the gr suspension were determined which was 150 mm and 3 respectively the predetermined amount of gr was added into reaction vials according to the fe ii concentration of gr fe ii gr for the synthesis of gr cu ii cu ii aqueous solution with a ph of 8 was prepared followed by the addition of gr suspensions under magnetic stirring 2 3 tbp degradation under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic conditions tbp degradation experiments under anoxic conditions were conducted in 100 ml airtight glass vials containing a 50 ml reaction solution in darkness sample preparations were performed in a glovebox filled with n2 99 999 the reaction solution was prepared by adding 0 5 ml of 1 mm tbp stock solution followed by 0 5 ml of 100 mm cucl2 stock solution subsequently a predetermined volume of gr suspensions was added to obtain a 50 ml of reaction suspensions and 10 mm of fe ii gr the initial ph of the reaction suspensions was adjusted to 8 using 0 1 m naoh and not controlled along the reaction course the reaction was initiated by magnetically stirring the reaction suspensions at 550 rpm one ml of suspensions was sampled at predetermined time intervals filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe filter and immediately analyzed the concentrations of tbp and its debromination products including 2 4 dibromophenol 2 4 dbp 4 bromophenol 4 bp and bromide ion were determined the concentrations of the fe and cu species such as fe ii fe iii cu i and cu ii were measured for comparison the tbp degradation by gr or cu ii alone was performed using the same procedures as gr cu ii for the experiment under oxic conditions the reaction suspensions were prepared in the same procedure as that under anoxic conditions except that the headspace of the reaction vials was filled with air the oh capture experiments were conducted using 10 mm benzoic acid ba to verify the contribution of oh to tbp degradation 1 m ethanol an effective oh scavenger was added before oxygenation for the anoxic to oxic transition experiments the solution was exposed to air for 5 h after the 7 h anoxic treatment the experimental procedures are the same as the anoxic or oxic treatment alone expect for a combined treatment the degradation and mineralization of tbp by gr cu ii in real groundwater under anoxic to oxic transition conditions were also investigated the parameters of the groundwater are shown in supplementary table s1 the ph of the real groundwater was adjusted to 8 prior to experiment all the experiments were carried out at least in duplicate 2 4 analytical methods and solid state characterizations the analysis details concerning the concentrations of tbp and its intermediate products bromine ions oh produced during the oxygenation of gr or gr cu ii are all shown in text s2 fe ii and fe iii in the gr and the reaction solutions were determined by a modified phenanthroline spectrophotometric method at 510 nm method text s3 huang et al 2013 cu ii and cu i in the gr cu ii were determined using a 2 9 dimethyl 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometric method at 457 nm zhang et al 2018 total cu concentration was determined after the reduction of cu ii to cu i by excess hydroxylamine hydrochloride and cu ii concentration was calculated by subtraction the structural cu was calculated by subtracting the cu in solution from the total cu gr cu ii before and after anoxic oxic reaction were characterized by x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron

discussion 3 1 reduction of tbp under anoxic conditions 3 1 1 tbp reduction by gr cu ii about 80 of tbp was removed by gr after 7 h of reaction but no degradation products were detected fig 1 a demonstrating the tbp removal was resulted from the adsorption of gr tbp is negatively charged at ph 8 pka 6 3 gr has a positively charged trioctahedral iron hydroxide layer which results in the adsorption of tbp by gr via electrostatic interaction zhang et al 2022 cu ii cannot reduce tbp but 14 of tbp was removed in the cu ii system that may be because copper ions exist in the forms of cu2 and cuoh at ph 7 8 lee et al 2002 which could complex with organic molecules such as tbp pei et al 2011 the complexation between copper ions and tbp affect its retention and peak area during hplc separation flieger et al 2006 surowiec et al 2008 in contrast tbp was completely reduced to debromination products 2 4 dbp and 4 bp by gr cu ii within 3 h fig 1b the tbp concentrations gradually decreased along the reaction course the concentration of 2 4 dbp first increased to a peak value and then dropped gradually the 4 bp concentrations in the solution steadily increased as the reaction proceeded and reached 8 8 μm within 7 h the carbon balance was relatively constant at 0 9 along the reaction time suggesting all the debromination products were recovered during the reaction fig 1b thus tbp underwent a sequential debromination pathway tbp 2 4 dbp 4 bp with br released into the reaction solution the br gradually increased to 20 µm after 7 h reaction by gr cu ii while no br was observed for gr fig 1c the amount of released br was in line with the fact that the debromination of 10 µm tbp to 4 bp was accompanied by the release of 20 µm br gr has only adsorption rather than reductive reactivity towards tbp under anoxic conditions since no br was observed after reaction the enhanced reductive reactivity of gr via cu ii doping can be explained by the formation of a galvanic couple consisting of gr anode and low valent cu as cathode fang et al 2019b in which electrons are transferred from gr to cu noted that gr cu ii can completely reduce 2 4 dbp to 4 bp within 7 h but has no reductive reactivity towards 4 bp supplementary fig s1 it further verified that tbp was debrominated to 4 bp by gr cu ii but no further degradation can be achieved under anoxic conditions 3 1 2 characterization of gr cu ii the xrd patterns of gr cu ii before and after reaction with tbp were shown in fig 2 a the addition of cu ii led to the partial transformation of gr to lepidocrocite and magnetite the intensity of gr characteristic peaks was significantly weakened after the reaction between gr cu ii and tbp in anoxic conditions for 7 h furthermore the cu and fe species were identified via xps analysis fig 2b c since the binding energies of cu i and cu 0 are very close the formation of cu species was further examined by the auger spectra fig 2d cu lmm auger spectra confirmed the reduction of cu ii to cu ⅰi by gr and cu 0 was not detected which was consistent with our previous studies huang et al 2018 cu i could still be detected after 7 h anoxic reaction fig 2c indicating that cu i was sufficient in the process of reducing tbp compared to the intensity of cu i xps peak before reaction it increased after 7 h anoxic reaction that is because the sample before reaction was collected immediately after cu ii was added to gr suspensions the reaction time of gr with cu ii was short and only parts of cu ii was reduced to cu i although cu i was consumed for the reductive debromination of tbp it continuously regenerated through the reduction of cu ii by gr as the reaction went on resulting in the increased intensity of cu i xps peak after 7 h of anoxic reaction no characteristic peaks from cuo or cu2o particles were observed in xrd which may be attributed to the detection limitation of xrd for components with content less than 2 3 1 3 effect of gr dosage on tbp reduction the kinetic curves of tbp removal were well fitted with the pseudo first order reaction model supplementary fig s2a the removal efficiency of tbp with 5 mm fe ii gr was almost the same for that with 10 mm fe ii gr meanwhile the production of 2 4 dbp and 4 bp also showed a similar trend with the dosages of fe ii gr increasing from 5 to 10 mm however the extent of tbp debromination decreased when the dosage of fe ii gr increased to 20 mm the pseudo first order reaction rate decreased from 1 84 h 1 to 0 87 h 1 with the dosages of fe ii gr increasing from 10 mm to 20 mm in addition 2 4 dbp as an intermediate had not been completely reduced to 4 bp within 7 h reaction with the fe ii gr dosages of 15 mm and 20 mm supplementary fig s2b c the reason for this phenomenon is that gr played two roles in the removal of tbp an electron donator for tbp reduction and an adsorbent for tbp although gr cannot reduce tbp it can reduce cu ii to cu i and then reduces tbp the adsorption sites for tbp increase with the increase of the gr content and more tbp was adsorbed by gr however the gr adsorbed tbp may not diffuse to the reductive active cu i sites therefore the carbon balance in the reaction solution dropped from 100 to 78 when the dosage of gr increased from 5 mm to 20 mm due to the adsorption of tbp by gr supplementary fig s2d correspondingly the degradation extent calculated by the sum of 2 4 dbp and 4 bp was decreased supplementary fig s2d insert moreover the adsorption rate of tbp by gr is slower than the reduction rate of tbp by gr cu ii fig 1a b thus the removal rate of tbp decreased with the dosages of fe ii gr increasing to 20 mm 3 1 4 effect of cu ii dosage on tbp reduction the dosage of cu ii has a significant effect on the reductive debromination of tbp by gr cu ii when the cu ii dosage was 0 5 mm and 1 mm tbp can be completely reduced within 3 h supplementary fig s3a the degradation efficiency of tbp was almost the same but the reduction of 2 4 dbp intermediate to 4 bp was enhanced when cu ii dosage increased from 0 5 mm to 1 mm supplementary fig s3b c when the cu ii dosage further increased to 2 mm and 3 mm the removal efficiency of tbp decreased from 100 to 52 and 31 respectively also only 2 4 dbp was determined as the degradation intermediate and no 4 bp was observed it demonstrates that cu ii at high concentrations was unfavorable for the reduction of tbp by gr cu ii the reason for this phenomenon may be that more cu ii consumed more electrons of gr which impeded the cu i mediated electron transfer from gr to tbp furthermore increasing the concentration of cu ii resulted in the release of more protons because more fe ii was oxidized to fe iii consequently the ph was dropped and the oxidation reduction potential orp was increased supplementary fig s3d decreasing the reductive reactivity of gr cu ii 3 1 5 effect of ph on tbp reduction when the initial ph increased from 6 to 8 the pseudo first order removal rate of tbp increased from 0 83 h 1 to 1 84 h 1 however the removal rate was decreased to 1 07 h 1 when the ph was further increased to 9 supplementary fig s4a the production of 2 4 dbp 4 bp was also enhanced when ph increased from 6 to 8 but inhibited when ph further increased to 9 supplementary fig s4b c this phenomenon demonstrated that the reactivity of gr cu ii is the highest at a slightly alkaline environment maithreepala and doong 2005 the iron hydroxide layers of gr are greatly affected by environmental ph and only remain stable under near neutral or weakly alkaline conditions gr can transform into more stable iron hydr oxides with lower reduction reactivity under alkaline conditions and the generation of reactive low valence cu may also be inhibited maithreepala and doong 2005 in addition due to the zero point charge of the gr being 8 5 guilbaud et al 2013 gr is negatively charged at ph 9 resulting in repelling the negatively charged tbp molecules on the other hand gr may dissolve in an acidic or neutral environment genin et al 2001 which leads to a decrease in the reductive reactivity of gr 3 1 6 electrochemical analysis the free corrosion potential of gr determined from the tafel scan was shifted negatively from 0 18 to 0 21 upon cu ii addition fig 3 a the corrosion current of gr increased from 1 013 10 7a to 6 656 10 7a after the addition of cu ii indicating that gr cu ii has a greater electron donating ability than gr because of the galvanic effect compared with gr mono valent cu has a stronger reduction strength due to its lower reduction potentials huang et al 2018 the corrosion potential of gr cu ii shifted positively after its reaction with tbp for 7 h under anoxic conditions fig 3a indicating a decreased electron donating capability of gr cu ii after reductive debromination reaction 3 2 oxidative degradation of tbp under oxic conditions 3 2 1 oxidative degradation of tbp by gr cu ii the removal efficiency of tbp by gr alone reached 60 after 7 h oxygenation and cu ii had no reactivity towards tbp removal fig 4 a after the addition of cu ii into gr suspensions to form gr cu ii the removal efficiency of tbp increased to 73 within 7 h oxygenation br was detected in both gr and gr cu ii systems fig 5 d indicating that the removal of tbp under oxic conditions was due to degradation rather than adsorption xrd patterns showed gr cu ii was transformed rapidly to magnetite and lepidocrocite upon exposure to oxygen fig 2a it was reported that gr coupled with cu ii could activate dioxygen to generate oh in oxic conditions zhao et al 2018 although the role of cu ii has not been fully understood 3 2 2 identification of oh the cumulative concentration of oh produced from the oxygenation of gr and gr cu ii was quantified using the hydroxylation of benzoic acid ba to p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba as a probe reaction fig 4b showed that 30 µm of oh was gradually produced by gr and gr cu ii which was in line with the oxidative degradation of tbp in comparison the concentration of oh dropped to 6 3 μm decreased by 80 with the addition of 1 m ethanol further confirming the generation of oh from gr cu ii oxygenation moreover the degradation of tbp was significantly inhibited when 1 m ethanol was added into the reaction suspensions fig 4c which demonstrated that the produced oh was responsible for the oxidative degradation of tbp by gr cu ii the rate of oh generation in the early stage by gr cu ii was higher than gr but slowed down in the later stage fig 4b the final cumulative amount of oh from the oxygenation of gr cu ii was lower than that of gr upon air exposure gr was rapidly transformed to magnetite which may activate dioxygen fig 2a ardo et al have reported that magnetite can activate dioxygen to produce oh and dissolved and structural fe ii are both responsible for oh generation ardo et al 2015 the reaction rate of fe ii with cu ii is tens of thousands of times faster than that with o2 reactions 1 and 4 supplementary table s2 in addition both cu i and fe ii are capable of reducing o2 to h2o2 but cu i is more reactive in activating o2 reactions 5 6 supplementary table s2 than fe ii reactions 1 2 supplementary table s2 that is why the rate of oh generation in the early stage by gr cu ii was higher than gr in the later stage cu i was consumed and its re generation may be very slow thus the o2 activation by fe ii which is less reactive than cu i lead to a declined oh generation rate in the later stage the electrons used for oh production is donated by fe ii in gr or gr cu ii system the added cu ii consumed part of fe ii and less fe ii was reacted with h2o2 although the reaction between cu i and h2o2 produces oh as well the reaction rate between fe ii and h2o2 4 79 103 m 1 s 1 is much higher than that between cu i and h2o2 100 m 1 s 1 reactions 3 and 8 supplementary table s2 therefore the presence of 1 mm cu ii in the reaction suspensions slightly decreased the final accumulative concentration of oh by 4 µm the amount of br produced by gr cu ii was slightly lower than gr fig 5d which was consistent with the lower amount of produced oh this phenomenon also confirmed the important role of oh in the oxidative debromination of tbp 3 2 3 effects of reaction parameters when the concentration of fe ii gr in gr cu ii increased from 5 mm to 10 mm the tbp degradation efficiency under oxic conditions increased from 48 to 74 supplementary fig s5a however further increasing the concentration of gr did not result in an increase of the degradation efficiency increasing the concentration of gr within a certain range can produce more cu i for dioxygen activation but the content of cu i cannot increase further once gr is in great excess with cu ii no more cu ii can be reduced to cu i due to the limited dosage of cu ii and the reduction rate of o2 to h2o2 by gr is slow supplementary table s2 therefore the degradation efficiency of tbp cannot be improved significantly when the content of gr is higher than 10 mm the removal efficiency of tbp was slightly increased when the dosage of cu ii increased from 0 5 mm to 1 mm however a further increase in cu ii concentration decreased the degradation efficiency of tbp from 74 at 1 mm cu ii to 39 at 3 mm cu ii supplementary fig s5b since more fe ii was oxidized by cu ii less fe ii was involved in the fenton reaction with h2o2 to generate oh although the h2o2 can be reduced to oh by cu i as well its rate is much slower than that by fe ii supplementary table s2 thus more cu ii inhibited the degradation efficiency of tbp when the dosage of cu was higher than 1 mm the effect of initial ph on the oxidative degradation of tbp by gr cu ii is negligible supplementary fig s5c this is because the ph of the gr cu ii system was decreased rapidly to 4 in the initial 1 h and changed slightly in the later 6 h upon exposure to dioxygen supplementary fig s5d the ph decrease of the system is due to the release of protons caused by the oxidation of structural or aqueous fe ii to magnetite and lepidocrocite fig 2a eq 1 1 fe 2 1 5 o 2 2 5 o h 4 5 h 2 o 1 5 f e 3 o 4 2 5 feo oh 8 5 h 3 3 mineralization of tbp during anoxic to oxic transition 3 3 1 tbp degradation by gr cu ii since tbp was completely reduced to 4 bp by gr cu ii under anoxic conditions further degradation of 4 bp under oxic conditions was investigated nearly 81 of 4 bp was degraded within 5 h after the anoxic to oxic transition fig 5a in contrast only 21 of 4 bp was removed within 5 h in the presence of 1 m ethanol fig 5b confirming the contribution of oh to the oxidative degradation of 4 bp the oxidative degradation of 4 bp was not completely inhibited by 1 m ethanol because the production of oh could not be completely inhibited by 1 m ethanol as shown in the oh quenching experiment fig 4b the br that was released into the reaction solution increased gradually to 26 9 µm fig 5c equivalent to 89 debromination of tbp in contrast no br was produced by gr in the anoxic process and only 4 4 µm of br was produced in the oxic process in addition only 10 µm of br anions were detected after the oxygenation of gr cu ii fig 5d indicating that the reductive debromination process under anoxic conditions was essential for the subsequent oxidative degradation of tbp also the reduction of 4 bp did not occur under anoxic conditions fig 1b supplementary fig s1b suggesting that the production of oh under oxic conditions was essential for 4 bp degradation gr cu ii achieved sequential reductive oxidative debromination of tbp as the condition changing from anoxic to oxic leading to effective degradation of tbp the characteristic xrd peaks of gr were still present although weakened after 7 h of anoxic reaction with tbp fig 2a furthermore xps analysis showed that fe ii and cu i were still present after 7 h of anoxic reaction fig 2b c supplementary table s3 these results suggest that gr cu ii had the ability for dioxygen activation after reacting with tbp under anoxic conditions after the subsequent 5 h of oxic reaction fe ii and cu i content on the solid surface decreased compared with the results after anoxic reaction supplementary table s3 demonstrating that fe ii and cu i were consumed under oxic conditions the samples collected for xps analysis consist of aqueous copper and iron ions deposited on the sample surface during the drying process in the glovebox the changes of dissolved and structural copper and iron ions detected by spectrophotometric method are discussed in detail later the reaction between dioxygen and anoxic treated gr cu ii under oxic conditions was confirmed by the transformation of gr to magnetite and lepidocrocite fig 2a the corrosion potential of gr cu ii after its reaction with tbp under anoxic conditions is negative fig 3a confirming that gr cu ii still has reductive reactivity after the tbp reduction process compared with tafel curve of gr cu ii after 7 h of anoxic reaction the position of tafel curve of gr cu ii after 0 5 h of oxic reaction with tbp shifted negatively the reason is that the anodic and cathodic reactions changed due to the introduction of o2 holmes and crundwell 2000 meanwhile gr was also transformed to other iron oxy hydroxides when the environment changed from anoxic to oxic the tafel curve of gr cu ii shifted positively after 4 h of oxic reaction with tbp indicating a decreased electron donating capability of gr cu ii the reduction of o2 on gr cu ii was characterized by cv under oxic conditions a cathodic peak at 0 8 v was observed as a result of o2 reduction while no cathodic peak was observed in the o2 free electrolyte fig 3b a similar o2 reduction peak was observed in the cv of a fe cu tip electrode zhang et al 2020b further supporting that gr cu ii still has the activity for o2 reduction after the tbp reduction process 3 3 2 mineralization of tbp the mineralization was examined by the analysis of toc the toc basically remained constant at 90 during the anoxic conditions but decreased significantly to 35 under the subsequent oxic conditions fig 6 a it is speculated that the hydroxylation breakage of the benzene ring of tbp occurs under oxic conditions which is followed by the oxidative degradation of the as generated organic fragments about 65 mineralization of tbp was achieved via the sequential reductive oxidative debromination of tbp while the toc value was almost unchanged under oxic conditions fig 6b toc values were basically constant under anoxic conditions and oxic conditions indicating that the adsorption of reductive and oxidative products of tbp did not occur it further confirmed that the decrease of toc under anoxic to oxic conditions was due to mineralization thus the combination of reductive and oxidative debromination is effective for mineralization of tbp by gr cu ii 3 3 3 change of fe ii and cu i during the reaction the changes of fe ii and cu i content during the anoxic to oxic transition were analyzed supplementary fig s6 structural fe ii was gradually decreasing while dissolved fe ii was increasing within 7 h of anoxic reaction supplementary fig s6a b however the decrease of structural fe ii 1 4 mm is greater than the increase of dissolved fe ii 0 7 mm demonstrating that the total fe ii in the system was depleted structural fe ii was the electron donor for cu ii reduction under anoxic conditions cu ii could oxidize gr resulting in a decreased ph value of the reaction suspensions and the dissolution of structural fe ii occurred subsequently no dissolved cu ions including cu ii and cu i supplementary fig s6c were detected under anoxic conditions that was because the ph of the solution was only slightly dropped from 8 to 7 8 within 7 h and the cu existed as a solid form in this ph range it was found that structural cu i first increased and then decreased during the reaction under anoxic conditions the reduction of cu ii produces structural cu i which at the same time was consumed for the reductive debromination of tbp fe ii was sufficient in the early stage of anoxic reaction resulting in a faster production of cu i than the consumption the peak of structural cu i concentration located within 2 5 h when 2 4 dbp was gradually reduced to 4 bp indicating the consumption rate of cu i by the reduction of 2 4 dbp was slower than by the reduction of tbp at earlier stage however the structural cu i decreased in the later stage supplementary fig s6c the reason was that the production rates of cu i may decrease with the consumption of fe ii but cu i was still consumed by 2 4 dbp as the reaction went on in the subsequent oxic reaction the concentration of structural fe ii decreased rapidly within 1 h and dissolved fe ii also decreased supplementary fig s6a b the fe ii in gr was rapidly oxidized to fe iii once exposed to dioxygen which was also supported by the xrd data fig 2a the diffraction peaks of gr disappeared and only magnetite and lepidocrocite were observed after 0 5 h of oxygenation the oxidation rate of structural fe ii iron was faster than that of dissolved fe ii during the oxic reaction the concentration of structural cu i was rapidly dropped to 0 within 1 h of oxygenation supplementary fig s6c which is likely due to that structural cu i was oxidized or dissolved as seen from the increased concentration of cu i ions in solution the ph dropped to 5 during the oxidation of gr to magnetite which may lead to the dissolution and release of structural cu i into solution the dissolved cu i first increased rapidly and then decreased slowly since cu i was gradually consumed during the oxic reaction process therefore it can be inferred that the structural fe ii and cu i are the main species for dioxygen activation in the early stage of the tbp oxidation process while the dissolved fe ii and cu i are the continuous driving force for dioxygen activation cu ii plays a very important role in reductive debromination and oxidative degradation of tbp for the reductive debromination of tbp cu ii is a redox mediator for enhancing the reductive reactivity of gr the reductive debromination was enhanced because cu i is a more reactive reductant than gr for the oxidative degradation of tbp cu ii changed the pathway of dioxygen activation by gr cu ii is reduced to cu i by fe ii gr and cu i is involved in the activation of dioxygen the reduction of o2 to h2o2 by cu i is faster compared with fe ii gr the oxidative degradation rate of tbp is enhanced in the early stage when the concentration of cu i is high under anoxic to oxic transition conditions gr cu ii lead to sequential reduction oxidation of tbp that gr alone cannot achieve 3 3 4 mineralization pathways of tbp hplc ms was employed to identify the tbp degradation products under anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic conditions supplementary fig s7a c the molecule with an m z of 172 9 corresponded to 4 bp was detected under anoxic and anoxic to oxic conditions two intermediates m z of 266 8 and 184 8 were identified as 2 6 dibromo p benzoquinone and 2 bromo 1 4 benzoquinon which were the hydroxylated derivatives of tbp under oxic conditions the main peaks at an m z of 116 9 were derived from the short chain fatty acids resulted from the opening of phenol ring during anoxic to oxic transition dft calculations were employed to further elucidate the degradation pathway the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo are commonly used to depict the reactive sites of an organic molecule to lose and obtain electrons respectively zhang et al 2020a the lumo of the tbp is mainly concentrated on c br bonds fig 7 a thus these sites are susceptible to accepting electrons resulting in reductive debromination of tbp moreover fig 7 shows the homo orbitals predominantly surround the electron rich atoms br10 of tbp and br12 of 4 bp respectively oh is an electrophilic species and is also capable of causing radical attacks chen et al 2019 gao et al 2021 noted that oh is the dominant reactive species under oxic conditions in this work according to the radical quenching results fig 4b c thus br10 of tbp and br12 of 4 bp are the major hydroxylation reaction sites leading to the formation of 2 6 dibromo p benzoquinone and p hydroquinone in addition the charge distribution natural population analysis npa and fukui index f f f0 in prediction of nucleophilic electrophilic and radical attacks were calculated to further elucidate the regioselectivity of reactive species supplementary table s4 gao et al 2021 liu et al 2019 the sites with higher f values are vulnerable to be attacked by electrons owing to their capability of stabilizing additional electrons ona et al 2016 as a result the br9 and br11 atoms of tbp with the highest f 0 09401 are easy to be attacked by electrons leading to the formation of 2 4 dbp also the br10 atom of 2 4 dbp has the highest f 0 08315 supplementary table s5 which readily undergoes nucleophilic attack by electrons resulting in the formation of 4 bp during reductive debromination it is consistent with the results of hplc and hplc ms that tbp was sequentially debrominated to 4 bp under anoxic conditions moreover the atoms with higher f0 values are the sites which are more easily attacked by oh gao et al 2021 br10 on tbp and br12 on 4 bp are the most active sites with high f0 values of 0 13291 and 0 5077 respectively supplementary table s4 supplementary table s6 therefore these sites are easily hydroxylated during the oxidation process on the other hand the c2 and c4 atoms of 4 bp with high f0 values of 0 111525 and 0 1026 are highly vulnerable to oh resulting in ring opening and mineralization of 4 bp these results are consistent with the oxidation products detected by hplc ms under oxic conditions and anoxic to oxic conditions according to hplc ms data and dft calculation the possible tbp degradation pathway was proposed fig 8 which outlined both reductive and oxidative debromination of tbp under anoxic conditions tbp can undergo reductive debromination by gr cu ii to produce 4 bp under oxic conditions the c br10 bond of tbp was broken under the attack of oh to form 2 6 dibromo p benzoquinone and further degraded to 2 bromo 1 4 benzoquinon upon anoxic to oxic transition the reduction of tbp to 4 bp in the anoxic stage led to an increase in the electron cloud density on the benzene ring which is beneficial to the subsequent oh attack and ring opening process of 4 bp in the oxic stage the br12 of 4 bp was firstly hydroxylated followed by ring opening reactions due to further attack on polyhydroxy compound products by oh subsequently short chain carboxylic acids were yielded which were further oxidized to co2 and h2o by oh the degradation products of tbp observed in the process of reduction or oxidation alone were not completely debrominated which were still toxic thus the combination of reduction and oxidation was a superior approach for the full detoxification of tbp 4 mineralization of tbp in real groundwater the sequential reduction and oxidation of tbp by gr cu ii occurred in real groundwater matrices and the mineralization of tbp was also achieved fig 9 the removal rate of tbp was slightly decreased and the final mineralization efficiency was 55 less than 65 in ultrapure water the so4 2 in groundwater may compete with tbp for gr cu ii reactive sites inhibiting the tbp degradation by gr cu ii fang et al 2019a the concentrations of cu ii in real groundwater environments is in the range from 0 to 0 3 µm but is high in seawater intrusion areas industrial and urban areas and tailing mines al hossainy 2015 kargar et al 2012 montlucon and sanudo wilhelmy 2001 concentrated cu ii often occur in the wastewater of smelters and leakage of tailings due to the discharge and infiltration of industrial wastewater the cu ii concentration in groundwater can be up to 0 3 mm al hossainy 2015 especially for the stations surrounding and downward the copper tailings dam the cu ii concentration in groundwater even reach 0 6 mm and max to 8 mm due to the gradual penetration of heavy metals originated from tailings dam into downstream groundwater resources kargar et al 2012 thus the results reported in this study has environmental significance on groundwater with high concentrations of copper ions such as downstream of tailings dam and sewage area 5 conclusion the presence of cu ii enhanced the reductive reactivity of gr towards tbp under anoxic conditions changing the tbp removal mechanism from adsorption to reductive dehalogenation tbp was reduced to 4 bp by gr cu ii within 7 h both gr and gr cu ii can activate dioxygen to generate oh under oxic conditions which lead to the oxidative degradation of tbp the presence of cu ii increases the production rate of oh in the initial 2 h during gr oxygenation but slightly reduces the final accumulative concentration of oh the reductive dehalogenation product 4 bp under anoxic conditions can be further degraded by gr cu ii under subsequent oxic conditions the complete degradation and 65 mineralization of tbp were achieved by gr cu ii in a sequential reduction oxidation process demonstrating that gr cu ii can effectively degrade tbp under the anoxic oxic alternating subsurface environment this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between tbp and gr cu ii in anoxic oxic and anoxic to oxic conditions which highlight the role of combining reduction and oxidation processes for the mineralization of tbp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

which has enormous potentials for beneficial effects and is more cost and time saving than the strategy of genetic manipulation li et al 2020 predictably abiotic elicitation by exogenous materials could open up versatile approaches to acclimate natural creatures for the benefit of mankind microalga is an important group of photosynthetic organisms that plays a critical role in the material and energy cycle of the global ecosystem chai et al 2021 over the past decades tremendous material microalgae nanohybrids nguyen et al 2019 lau et al 2022 tamayo belda et al 2021 have been explored which served a wide range of sectors most of these studies are central to the detrimental effects of nanomaterials on microalgae suppressing or destroying the microalgae proliferation for the purpose of environmental remediation chen et al 2020 qi et al 2020 differently some recent studies have revealed that specific nanomaterials could enhance the metabolic function of microalgae for positive effects in these examples extracellular polymeric substances eps as the major component of biofilms can bind with microalgae cells to form a 3 d gel like matrix you et al 2015 the interactions between algae and material is highly dependent on the components of eps specifically the soluble tightly bound and loosely bound eps affect the aggregation flocculation efficiency and biosorption of nanomaterials respectively tang et al 2017 as formed eps can protect microalgae aggregates against nanomaterials tang et al 2018 in addition due to the improved relative electron transport rate microalgae can produce more high valuable bioproducts after the integration with nanomaterials li et al 2020 however the application of nanomaterials in up regulating physiological function of algae for environmental remediation has been rarely investigated previous investigations have demonstrated that aspects of the chemical nature of nanomaterials could affect the microalgae outcomes li et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 ma et al 2015 tang et al 2018 thus it is theoretically possible to regulate the material algae interactions through surface engineering of nanomaterials polymeric carbon nitride g

extraction of eps to evaluate the biological stress caused by carbon nitride eps originated from microalgae was extracted yang et al 2020 in details 20 ml of algae suspension 3 106 cells ml was centrifuged at 4000 g for 5 min at 4 ºc the centrifugal liquid was collected and labeled as slime eps the precipitates were added into 0 05 nacl solution at 70 c which was then centrifuged at 4000 g

regarded as statistically significant principal component analysis pca and heat maps were performed by using metabo analyst 5 0 all treatments were conducted three times and the error bars were displayed as the mean standard deviation sd 2 8 extracellular o2 analysis of algae the chemiluminescence probe mcla was used to determine the extracellular production of o2 by algae godrant et al 2009 specifically the algae solution was divided into two groups and numbered a and b 250 μl of algae solution from a and b groups were added to 96 well plates respectively and then 5 μl sod sod 50 ku l 1 was added in a group so that all the o2 produced by the algae cells was scavenged before reacting with the mcla probes subsequently 15 μl mcla mcla 10 μm was dispensed into a and b groups to chelate with o2 the fluorescence difference between groups a and b represented the change in superoxide intensity 3 results and discussion concerning polymeric g c3n4 its neighboring layers are weakly bounded by van der waals interactions while the strands of melon units are interconnected by hydrogen bonds between nh nh2 groups the p π conjugated aromatic framework and intralayer hydrogen bond provide ample possibility of precisely tuning its final morphology and functionality zhou et al 2018 therefore tailoring the molecular structure of g c3n4 could indirectly affect the biological counterparts providing a new approach to regulate the environmental function of biotic abiotic systems to validate this assumption polymorphous g c3n4 samples were synthesized and used to hybridize with microcystis aeruginosa and scenedesmus typical microalgas that exist widely in nature and are sensitive to aquatic toxicity structure tailoring of carbon nitride was conducted by changing precursors melamine and urea physical exfoliation surface protonation solubilization treatment and defect creation the corresponding samples were denoted as m c3n4 u c3n4 e c3n4 p c3n4 s c3n4 and d c3n4 respectively the preparation of carbon nitride with defective structure lamellar structure or protonated structure might affect the charge transfer and hydrophilicity between carbon nitride and microalgae material characterizations suggested that all these samples were comprised of homologous poly tri s triazine units fig 1a the xps survey spectrum revealed that the surface chemical states of synthesized m c3n4 contained o n and c elements fig 1b while structure tailoring significantly changed material morphology and size different from the irregular particle aggregates of bulk m c3n4 curled nanosheets thin lamellas small nanoparticles quantum dots and porous nanosheets were observed for u c3n4 e c3n4 p c3n4 s c3n4 and d c3n4 respectively fig 2 these diverse g c3n4 architectures were thereafter used to acclimate algae for eliminating harmful compounds from water fig 3a as shown in fig 3b the decontamination performance of as developed biotic abiotic systems was highly dependent on the structure of carbon nitride microcystis aeruginosa could remove a small amount of aniline through biological acclimation and cometabolism xiong et al 2018 the promotion effect was obviously observed for p c3n4 and e c3n4 especially p c3n4 tremendously improved the decontamination efficiency of algae according to the time series analysis there should be a synergistic effect between p c3n4 and algae as blank p c3n4 could hardly decompose aniline molecules fig s1 the decontamination of aniline over the p c3n4 algae hybrid system followed pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0 14 h 1 which was 5 8 times higher than that of microcystis aeruginosa 0 024 h 1 fig 3c to demonstrate the superiority of the p c3n4 elicitor several benchmarks of functional materials were employed to construct semi biological systems as shown in fig 3d p c3n4 even stood out from these artificial substances suggesting the vast potential of structure tailored carbon nitride for metabolic regulation cycling experiments convinced that this promotion effect was durable fig s2 due to the gradual physiological adaptation of algae to the reaction environment a surprisingly accelerated removal rate of aniline was achieved sheng et al 2018 this improvement should not be ascribed to the photocatalytic degradation by p c3n4 since all experiments were carried out under dark conditions even though alternating light dark cycles satisfied the actual culture environment of photosynthetic algae further enhanced the environmental function of the synergistic system fig 3e the adaptability of our protonation strategy was thereafter investigated encouragingly the integration of p c3n4 with microcystis aeruginosa also remarkably enhanced the decomposition of toxic phenol another widespread ecotoxin in water that may cause serious environmental problems fig s3 the promoted function of scenedesmus by p c3n4 further evidenced the significant role of protonated carbon nitride for metabolic regulation of microorganisms fig 3f x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to fundamentally understand the interfacial interplay between p c3n4 and algae according to the deconvolution results of high resolution n 1s spectra fig 4a the content of nhx groups increased from 15 5 of pristine g c3n4 to 19 8 of p c3n4 indicating the occurence of protonation by acid treatment zhou et al 2015 du et al 2015 the peaks for c 1s fig s4 at 288 5 and 285 1 ev are assigned to n c n and sp2 bonded carbon in c c of g c3n4 bu et al 2016 respectively after protonation a new peak appeared at 286 1 ev which indicated the existence of c oh bond in p c3n4 shi et al 2020 protonation treatment remarkably changed the chemical environment of component elements in p c3n4 which was validated by the solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique as shown in fig 4b compared to pristine g c3n4 the peak of bridging n n4 of the intrapolymer chain li et al 2018 in the 15n spectrum of p c3n4 decreased while the peak of nh2 n1 groups increased confirming the successful intercalation of hydrogen into carbon nitride polymers moreover the electron donating nature of hydrogen changed the bonding environment caused the shift of n2 n3 and n1 peaks toward higher fields 1h nmr spectra were also collected to investigate the hydrogen bonding environment of protonated samples fig 4c peak differencing analysis indicated that the protonation process indeed increased the content of nh2 groups in p c3n4 as the 1h peak around 5 ppm significantly increased after protonation hydrogen bonds should not be formed between these emerged nh2 groups the variation of chemical bonds before and after protonation was checked by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy the strengthened n h stretching vibration around 3300 cm 1 together with the appearance of c o stretching vibration at 1100 cm 1 were consistent with the above discussions fig s5 the typical breathing vibration peak of s triazine units at 808 1 cm 1 was associated with hydrogen bonding interactions in g c3n4 fig 4d yu et al 2021 in the spectrum of p c3n4 the absorption peak of s triazine units was blue shifted to 812 2 cm 1 indicating the broken hydrogen bonding between as formed amino groups lan et al 2017 however this peak slightly recovered in the biotic abiotic hybrids suggesting that new hydrogen bonds formed between protonated carbon nitride and algae the formation of hydroxyl and amido groups caused by surface protonation improved the hydrophilicity of carbon nitride contributed to the good dispersion of nanoarchitectures in water fig 4e based on the zeta potential curves protonated amino groups also increased isoelectric point from 3 4 to 4 3 fig s6 abated the charge repel with negatively charged microorganisms profited from the enhanced interfacial contact the cellular surface of algae was tightly encapsulated by carbon nitride nanoarchitectures as confirmed by microscopic observations fig 4f the cellular uptake of our protonated carbon nitride was not seen in the tem observation fig s7 furthermore no promotion effect was observed for s c3n4 with a much smaller size which should be more favorable for cellular uptake thus in vivo metabolism should not be the reason for performance improvement for the microorganisms in a biotic abiotic system any change in the environment might induce their physiological genetic or epigenetic adaptive response as abiotic stress carbon nitride exposure would induce the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros to neutralize the excess ros algae would up regulate the antioxidant system meanwhile algae cells would secrete more extracellular polymeric substances eps to resist the physiological damage aken et al 2015 tang et al 2018 the variation of eps in our system was measured to evaluate the physiological adaptation of the biological milieu to environmental stress you et al 2015 based on the fluorescence excitation emission matrices spectra in fig s8a and s8b aniline decreased the fluorescence intensity of algae ni et al 2009 indicating that toxic aniline affected algae metabolism and impeded eps secretion however the addition of p c3n4 remarkably increased the fluorescence intensity and slightly shifted the peak locations this suggested the facilitated formation of extracellular matrix in the presence of p c3n4 as external stimuli fig s8c the enhanced biosynthesis of eps by p c3n4 elicitation was further confirmed by total organic carbon toc analysis in which acclimated biological entities possessed the highest content of organic compounds fig s9 the encapsulation of algae by eps could certainly alleviate the damage of cellular ultrastructure by toxic substances based on the tem observations normal algae cells possessed intact cell membranes and walls with regularly arranged thylakoid membrane and uniformly dispersed cytoplasm fig 5a toxic aniline had adverse effects on the growth of algae cells as the distortion and collapse of organelles caused cell vacuolation fig 5b however the co cultivation of algae with p c3n4 ensured their normal growth and biological functionality fig 5c it indicated that p c3n4 could effectively trigger metabolic adaptation which played a significant role in ameliorating undesirable damage of algae under environmental stress the survival condition of algae under different conditions was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis with annexin v fluorescein isothiocyanate propidium iodide as displayed in fig s10 the regions of q1 q2 q3 q4 represented early late necrotic and healthy cells respectively the total number of apoptotic cells was estimated by summing q1 and q2 for cultured algae the natural apoptotic cells were determined to be 4 42 fig s10a the toxicity of aniline accelerated the apoptosis of algae cells with a high apoptosis ratio of 5 76 as expected p c3n4 factually improved the metabolic activity of algae leading to an apoptosis ratio of 3 42 which was smaller than treated with aniline alone all these results proved that p c3n4 could up regulate cell survival of algae microorganisms for synergistic applications we next tried to investigate the critical role of acclimated algae for water decontamination superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat were adopted as biological indexes to assess the formation of ros which is often correlated with the biodegradation of organic molecules marchi et al 2018 according to figs 5d and s1 both foreign aniline and p c3n4 triggered the cellular response of algae while co addition superimposed this effect it seems that p c3n4 acted as a unique elicitor to induce moderate oxidative stress which facilitated the secretion of eps for resisting cell damage as such the acclimated algae could vigorously generate oxidative ros for harmful substances degradation herein the contribution of ros to aniline removal was evaluated by radical scavenging experiments 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidinooxy tempo and sorbic acid were used as radical scavengers for o2 and 3dom which were derived from oxidative stress and dissolved organic matters dom respectively liu et al 2016 grebel et al 2011 as shown in fig 5e o2 was determined to be the dominant radical for aniline degradation while 3dom played a minor role this was consistent with the extracellular superoxide production results that p c3n4 algae hybrids yielded a high concentration of o2 over the reaction duration for harmful substances removal fig 5f in addition the photocatalysis of p c3n4 did not happen since the reactions were carried out under dark conditions therefore it was speculated that the o2 was mainly derived from the metabolic secretion of algae metabolomics analyses were carried out to clarify the metabolic changes of algae under different acclimation conditions the identified metabolites were shown in tables s1 s4 the cell membrane contains a large number of lipid structures which might be damaged by lipid peroxidation when sustained to oxidative stress yuan et al 2018 based on the lipidomics analysis fig 6a the apparent separation of principal component analysis pca score plots indicated the distinctions in lipid metabolic profiles of different samples similarly the pca of untargeted metabolomics showed an obvious separation between the two comparison groups implying the changed intracellular metabolites fig 6b qian et al 2018 chen et al 2020 the results of identified metabolites by lipid metabolic analysis were summarized and shown in the heatmap of fig 6c for algae exposed to aniline the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine pe and phosphatidylcholine pc were much lower than those of cultivated algae since pe and pc had the function of maintaining the fluidity of the cell membrane their down regulation implied that aniline seriously affected the fluidity of the cell membrane sheng et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 du et al 2015 an opposite tendency was observed for the levels of lyso phosphatidylglycerol lpg and docosahexaenoic acid dha phosphatidylglycerol pg is associated with photosynthetic pigment protein complexes song et al 2018 the up regulation of lpg biomarkers suggested that the toxicity of aniline affected the photosynthetic activity of algae furthermore the level of dha was increased to maintain the fluidity of cell membranes stillwell et al 2003 the detrimental effects of aniline on the cell membrane and photosynthetic system of algae were dramatically alleviated by p c3n4 since an unnoticeable change of metabolites was observed for the algae aniline p c3n4 group the clustering result of untargeted metabolomics analysis further demonstrated a satisfactory discriminatory power among the groups of pristine algae algae aniline and algae aniline p c3n4 fig s14 a total of 110 types of differential biochemical compounds were distinguished across the algae samples which could be classified into six metabolite categories lipids amino acid organic amine nucleotides organic acid and carbohydrates among them amino acids such as glutamate n acetylornithine and arginine presented significant differences p 0 05 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to clarify the crucial metabolic pathways of algae for physiological improvement by artificial acclimation in fig 6d glutamate n acetylornithine and arginine were enriched in the urea metabolic pathway of algae the amount of these species was down regulated for the algae aniline group while the introduction of protonated c3n4 resulted in a contrary trend arginine is a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide due to its highest nitrogen to carbon ratio among the 21 types of proteinogenic amino acids vanetten et al 1963 winter et al 2015 both nitric oxide and arginine had the effects of adjusting developmental processes as well as responding to abiotic and biotic stress in plants furthermore many kinds of amino acids have earlier been implied to be involved in stress response hasler sheetal et al 2015 the down regulated arginine in the algae aniline group indicated that aniline could seriously interfere with the metabolic activities and reduced the defense ability of algae nevertheless the up regulation of these metabolites suggested that p c3n4 could recover the metabolic system and stimulate algae to secrete large amounts of eps which plays an imperative role in ameliorating undesirable changes of algae as a result p c3n4 contributed to the unprecedented control over the metabolism of microcystis aeruginosa leading to enhanced functionality for eliminating harmful substances from water 4 conclusions in summary we have demonstrated that the structure tailoring of carbon nitride created a versatile nanoarchitecture that can interact with the algae in an unanticipated way surface protonation benefited the interfacial contact between carbon nitride elicitor and microcystis aeruginosa scenedesmus leading to moderate oxidative stress that altered the biological metabolism for up regulated environmental functionality the metabolic adaptation facilitated the formation of eps which triggered the defense system of algae for resisting the physiological damage of algae under environmental stress meanwhile the vigorous generation of oxidative o2 by acclimated algae could effectively degrade toxic substances in water which was evidenced by the increased sod and cat activities the synergy between natural microcystis aeruginosa scenedesmus and synthetic p c3n4 resulted in an unprecedented decontamination efficiency which was much superior to other categories of carbon nitride and various functional nanomaterials this work expands the use of structure tailored carbon nitride as an abiotic elicitor at the cellular level our study also provides a fascinating biotic abiotic platform to artificially up regulate biological metabolism

15703,comprehending the effects of synthetic nanomaterials on natural microorganisms is critical for the development of emerging nanotechnologies compared to artificial inactivation of microbes the up regulation of biological functions should be more attractive due to the possibility of discovering unexpected properties herein a nanoengineering strategy was employed to tailor g c3n4 for the metabolic regulation of algae we found that surface protonated g c3n4 p c3n4 as a nanopolymeric elicitor enabled the reinforced biological activity of microcystis aeruginosa and scenedesmus for harmful substances removal metabolomics analysis suggested that synthetic nanoarchitectures induced moderate oxidative stress of algae with up regulated biosynthesis of extracellular polymeric

most compelling techniques in the interdisciplinary research fields because of their vast potential for discovering the unknown many efforts have adopted to the bio inspired concepts and mechanisms to design synthetic materials with advanced structures and unprecedented functionalities zhang et al 2019 xiao et al 2019 kodaimati et al 2018 chen et al 2018 also the integration of biological systems with synthetic materials have allowed either up regulate wang et al 2014 wei et al 2018 kuk et al 2017 or down regulate mao et al 2020 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2016 the biological functionalities which has enormous potentials for beneficial effects and is more cost and time saving than the strategy of genetic manipulation li et al 2020 predictably abiotic elicitation by exogenous materials could open up versatile approaches to acclimate natural creatures for the benefit of mankind microalga is an important group of photosynthetic organisms that plays a critical role in the material and energy cycle of the global ecosystem chai et al 2021 over the past decades tremendous material microalgae nanohybrids nguyen et al 2019 lau et al 2022 tamayo belda et al 2021 have been explored which served a wide range of sectors most of these studies are central to the detrimental effects of nanomaterials on microalgae suppressing or destroying the microalgae proliferation for the purpose of environmental remediation chen et al 2020 qi et al 2020 differently some recent studies have revealed that specific nanomaterials could enhance the metabolic function of microalgae for positive effects in these examples extracellular polymeric substances eps as the major component of biofilms can bind with microalgae cells to form a 3 d gel like matrix you et al 2015 the interactions between algae and material is highly dependent on the components of eps specifically the soluble tightly bound and loosely bound eps affect the aggregation flocculation efficiency and biosorption of nanomaterials respectively tang et al 2017 as formed eps can protect microalgae aggregates against nanomaterials tang et al 2018 in addition due to the improved relative electron transport rate microalgae can produce more high valuable bioproducts after the integration with nanomaterials li et al 2020 however the application of nanomaterials in up regulating physiological function of algae for environmental remediation has been rarely investigated previous investigations have demonstrated that aspects of the chemical nature of nanomaterials could affect the microalgae outcomes li et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 ma et al 2015 tang et al 2018 thus it is theoretically possible to regulate the material algae interactions through surface engineering of nanomaterials polymeric carbon nitride g c3n4 is a class of burgeoning material that have received tremendous attentions fu et al 2018 with environmentally friendly components its monomer sequence and surface functional groups can be strategically modulated giving access to huge possibilities for manipulating microalgae metabolism inspired by the above deduction we report the first attempt to tailor the structure of polymeric carbon nitride for altered microalgae effects g c3n4 architectures with various surface features were used as artificial elicitors to acclimate microalgae we found that protonated g c3n4 could alter

ample possibility of precisely tuning its final morphology and functionality zhou et al 2018 therefore tailoring the molecular structure of g c3n4 could indirectly affect the biological counterparts providing a new approach to regulate the environmental function of biotic abiotic systems to validate this assumption polymorphous g c3n4 samples were synthesized and used to hybridize with microcystis aeruginosa and scenedesmus typical microalgas that exist widely in nature and are sensitive to aquatic toxicity structure tailoring of carbon nitride was conducted by changing precursors melamine and urea physical exfoliation surface protonation solubilization treatment and defect creation the corresponding samples were denoted as m c3n4 u c3n4 e c3n4 p c3n4 s c3n4 and d c3n4 respectively the preparation of carbon nitride with defective structure lamellar structure or protonated structure might affect the charge transfer and hydrophilicity between carbon nitride and microalgae material characterizations suggested that all these samples were comprised of homologous poly tri s triazine units fig 1a the xps survey spectrum revealed that the surface chemical states of synthesized m c3n4 contained o n and c elements fig 1b while structure tailoring significantly changed material morphology and size different from the irregular particle aggregates of bulk m c3n4 curled nanosheets thin lamellas small nanoparticles quantum dots and porous nanosheets were observed for u c3n4 e c3n4 p c3n4 s c3n4 and d c3n4 respectively fig 2 these diverse g c3n4 architectures were thereafter used to acclimate algae for eliminating harmful compounds from water fig 3a as shown in fig 3b the decontamination performance of as developed biotic abiotic systems was highly dependent on the structure of carbon nitride microcystis aeruginosa could remove a small amount of aniline through biological acclimation and cometabolism xiong et al 2018 the promotion effect was obviously observed for p c3n4 and e c3n4 especially p c3n4 tremendously improved the decontamination efficiency of algae according to the time series analysis there should be a synergistic effect between p c3n4 and algae as blank p c3n4 could hardly decompose aniline molecules fig s1 the decontamination of aniline over the p c3n4 algae hybrid system followed pseudo first order kinetics with a rate constant of 0 14 h 1 which was 5 8 times higher than that of microcystis aeruginosa 0 024 h 1 fig 3c to demonstrate the superiority of the p c3n4 elicitor several benchmarks of functional materials were employed to construct semi biological systems as shown in fig 3d p c3n4 even stood out from these artificial substances suggesting the vast potential of structure tailored carbon nitride for metabolic regulation cycling experiments convinced that this promotion effect was durable fig s2 due to the gradual physiological adaptation of algae to the reaction environment a surprisingly accelerated removal rate of aniline was achieved sheng et al 2018 this improvement should not be ascribed to the photocatalytic degradation by p c3n4 since all experiments were carried out under dark conditions even though alternating light dark cycles satisfied the actual culture environment of photosynthetic algae further enhanced the environmental function of the synergistic system fig 3e the adaptability of our protonation strategy was thereafter investigated encouragingly the integration of p c3n4 with microcystis aeruginosa also remarkably enhanced the decomposition of toxic phenol another widespread ecotoxin in water that may cause serious environmental problems fig s3 the promoted function of scenedesmus by p c3n4 further evidenced the significant role of protonated carbon nitride for metabolic regulation of microorganisms fig 3f x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to fundamentally understand the interfacial interplay between p c3n4 and algae according to the deconvolution results of high resolution n 1s spectra fig 4a the content of nhx groups increased from 15 5 of pristine g c3n4 to 19 8 of p c3n4 indicating the occurence of protonation by acid treatment zhou et al 2015 du et al 2015 the peaks for c 1s fig s4 at 288 5 and 285 1 ev are assigned to n c n and sp2 bonded carbon in c c of g c3n4 bu et al 2016 respectively after protonation a new peak appeared at 286 1 ev which indicated the existence of c oh bond in p c3n4 shi et al 2020 protonation treatment remarkably changed the chemical environment of component elements in p c3n4 which was validated by the solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique as shown in fig 4b compared to pristine g c3n4 the peak of bridging n n4 of the intrapolymer chain li et al 2018 in the 15n spectrum of p c3n4 decreased while the peak of nh2 n1 groups increased confirming the successful intercalation of hydrogen into carbon nitride polymers moreover the electron donating nature of hydrogen changed the bonding environment caused the shift of n2 n3 and n1 peaks toward higher fields 1h nmr spectra were also collected to investigate the hydrogen bonding environment of protonated samples fig 4c peak differencing analysis indicated that the protonation process indeed increased the content of nh2 groups in p c3n4 as the 1h peak around 5 ppm significantly increased after protonation hydrogen bonds should not be formed between these emerged nh2 groups the variation of chemical bonds before and after protonation was checked by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy the strengthened n h stretching vibration around 3300 cm 1 together with the appearance of c o stretching vibration at 1100 cm 1 were consistent with the above discussions fig s5 the typical breathing vibration peak of s triazine units at 808 1 cm 1 was associated with hydrogen bonding interactions in g c3n4 fig 4d yu et al 2021 in the spectrum of p c3n4 the absorption peak of s triazine units was blue shifted to 812 2 cm 1 indicating the broken hydrogen bonding between as formed amino groups lan et al 2017 however this peak slightly recovered in the biotic abiotic hybrids suggesting that new hydrogen bonds formed between protonated carbon nitride and algae the formation of hydroxyl and amido groups caused by surface protonation improved the hydrophilicity of carbon nitride contributed to the good dispersion of nanoarchitectures in water fig 4e based on the zeta potential curves protonated amino groups also increased isoelectric point from 3 4 to 4 3 fig s6 abated the charge repel with negatively charged microorganisms profited from the enhanced interfacial contact the cellular surface of algae was tightly encapsulated by carbon nitride nanoarchitectures as confirmed by microscopic observations fig 4f the cellular uptake of our protonated carbon nitride was not seen in the tem observation fig s7 furthermore no promotion effect was observed for s c3n4 with a much smaller size which should be more favorable for cellular uptake thus in vivo metabolism should not be the reason for performance improvement for the microorganisms in a biotic abiotic system any change in the environment might induce their physiological genetic or epigenetic adaptive response as abiotic stress carbon nitride exposure would induce the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros to neutralize the excess ros algae would up regulate the antioxidant system meanwhile algae cells would secrete more extracellular polymeric substances eps to resist the physiological damage aken et al 2015 tang et al 2018 the variation of eps in our system was measured to evaluate the physiological adaptation of the biological milieu to environmental stress you et al 2015 based on the fluorescence excitation emission matrices spectra in fig s8a and s8b aniline decreased the fluorescence intensity of algae ni et al 2009 indicating that toxic aniline affected algae metabolism and impeded eps secretion however the addition of p c3n4 remarkably increased the fluorescence intensity and slightly shifted the peak locations this suggested the facilitated formation of extracellular matrix in the presence of p c3n4 as external stimuli fig s8c the enhanced biosynthesis of eps by p c3n4 elicitation was further confirmed by total organic carbon toc analysis in which acclimated biological entities possessed the highest content of organic compounds fig s9 the encapsulation of algae by eps could certainly alleviate the damage of cellular ultrastructure by toxic substances based on the tem observations normal algae cells possessed intact cell membranes and walls with regularly arranged thylakoid membrane and uniformly dispersed cytoplasm fig 5a toxic aniline had adverse effects on the growth of algae cells as the distortion and collapse of organelles caused cell vacuolation fig 5b however the co cultivation of algae with p c3n4 ensured their normal growth and biological functionality fig 5c it indicated that p c3n4 could effectively trigger metabolic adaptation which played a significant role in ameliorating undesirable damage of algae under environmental stress the survival condition of algae under different conditions was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis with annexin v fluorescein isothiocyanate propidium iodide as displayed in fig s10 the regions of q1 q2 q3 q4 represented early late necrotic and healthy cells respectively the total number of apoptotic cells was estimated by summing q1 and q2 for cultured algae the natural apoptotic cells were determined to be 4 42 fig s10a the toxicity of aniline accelerated the apoptosis of algae cells with a high apoptosis ratio of 5 76 as expected p c3n4 factually improved the metabolic activity of algae leading to an apoptosis ratio of 3 42 which was smaller than treated with aniline alone all these results proved that p c3n4 could up regulate cell survival of algae microorganisms for synergistic applications we next tried to investigate the critical role of acclimated algae for water decontamination superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat were adopted as biological indexes to assess the formation of ros which is often correlated with the biodegradation of organic molecules marchi et al 2018 according to figs 5d and s1 both foreign aniline and p c3n4 triggered the cellular response of algae while co addition superimposed this effect it seems that p c3n4 acted as a unique elicitor to induce moderate oxidative stress which facilitated the secretion of eps for resisting cell damage as such the acclimated algae could vigorously generate oxidative ros for harmful substances degradation herein the contribution of ros to aniline removal was evaluated by radical scavenging experiments 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidinooxy tempo and sorbic acid were used as radical scavengers for o2 and 3dom which were derived from oxidative stress and dissolved organic matters dom respectively liu et al 2016 grebel et al 2011 as shown in fig 5e o2 was determined to be the dominant radical for aniline degradation while 3dom played a minor role this was consistent with the extracellular superoxide production results that p c3n4 algae hybrids yielded a high concentration of o2 over the reaction duration for harmful substances removal fig 5f in addition the photocatalysis of p c3n4 did not happen since the reactions were carried out under dark conditions therefore it was speculated that the o2 was mainly derived from the metabolic secretion of algae metabolomics analyses were carried out to clarify the metabolic changes of algae under different acclimation conditions the identified metabolites were shown in tables s1 s4 the cell membrane contains a large number of lipid structures which might be damaged by lipid peroxidation when sustained to oxidative stress yuan et al 2018 based on the lipidomics analysis fig 6a the apparent separation of principal component analysis pca score plots indicated the distinctions in lipid metabolic profiles of different samples similarly the pca of untargeted metabolomics showed an obvious separation between the two comparison groups implying the changed intracellular metabolites fig 6b qian et al 2018 chen et al 2020 the results of identified metabolites by lipid metabolic analysis were summarized and shown in the heatmap of fig 6c for algae exposed to aniline the levels of phosphatidylethanolamine pe and phosphatidylcholine pc were much lower than those of cultivated algae since pe and pc had the function of maintaining the fluidity of the cell membrane their down regulation implied that aniline seriously affected the fluidity of the cell membrane sheng et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 du et al 2015 an opposite tendency was observed for the levels of lyso phosphatidylglycerol lpg and docosahexaenoic acid dha phosphatidylglycerol pg is associated with photosynthetic pigment protein complexes song et al 2018 the up regulation of lpg biomarkers suggested that the toxicity of aniline affected the photosynthetic activity of algae furthermore the level of dha was increased to maintain the fluidity of cell membranes stillwell et al 2003 the detrimental effects of aniline on the cell membrane and photosynthetic system of algae were dramatically alleviated by p c3n4 since an unnoticeable change of metabolites was observed for the algae aniline p c3n4 group the clustering result of untargeted metabolomics analysis further demonstrated a satisfactory discriminatory power among the groups of pristine algae algae aniline and algae aniline p c3n4 fig s14 a total of 110 types of differential biochemical compounds were distinguished across the algae samples which could be classified into six metabolite categories lipids amino acid organic amine nucleotides organic acid and carbohydrates among them amino acids such as glutamate n acetylornithine and arginine presented significant differences p 0 05 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to clarify the crucial metabolic pathways of algae for physiological improvement by artificial acclimation in fig 6d glutamate n acetylornithine and arginine were enriched in the urea metabolic pathway of algae the amount of these species was down regulated for the algae aniline group while the introduction of protonated c3n4 resulted in a contrary trend arginine is a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide due to its highest nitrogen to carbon ratio among the 21 types of proteinogenic amino acids vanetten et al 1963 winter et al 2015 both nitric oxide and arginine had the effects of adjusting developmental processes as well as responding to abiotic and biotic stress in plants furthermore many kinds of amino acids have earlier been implied to be involved in stress response hasler sheetal et al 2015 the down regulated arginine in the algae aniline group indicated that aniline could seriously interfere with the metabolic activities and reduced the defense ability of algae nevertheless the up regulation of these metabolites suggested that p c3n4 could recover the metabolic system and stimulate algae to secrete large amounts of eps which plays an imperative role in ameliorating undesirable changes of algae as a result p c3n4 contributed to the unprecedented control over the metabolism of microcystis aeruginosa leading to enhanced functionality for eliminating harmful substances from water 4 conclusions in summary we have demonstrated that the structure tailoring of carbon nitride created a versatile nanoarchitecture that can interact with the algae in an unanticipated way surface protonation benefited the interfacial contact between carbon nitride elicitor and microcystis aeruginosa scenedesmus leading to moderate oxidative stress that altered the biological metabolism for up regulated environmental functionality the metabolic adaptation facilitated the formation of eps which triggered the defense system of algae for resisting the physiological damage of algae under environmental stress meanwhile the vigorous generation of oxidative o2 by acclimated algae could effectively degrade toxic substances in water which was evidenced by the increased sod and cat activities the synergy between natural microcystis aeruginosa scenedesmus and synthetic p c3n4 resulted in an unprecedented decontamination efficiency which was much superior to other categories of carbon nitride and various functional nanomaterials this work expands the use of structure tailored carbon nitride as an abiotic elicitor at the cellular level our study also provides a fascinating biotic abiotic platform to artificially up regulate biological metabolism

15704,the reactive nitrogen n emitted from continents significantly perturbs the pristine n cycle around the land ocean boundary resulting in eutrophication and hypoxia as nutrients are transported downstream through an estuary various types of biological processes co occur to modulate nitrogen speciation to influence the biogeochemical habitats for downstream microorganisms we surveyed the pearl river estuary to examine the n transfer dynamics among nitrogen species with considering process specific oxygen production and consumption by using 15n pulse tracing techniques we measured ammonia oxidation and uptakes of ammonium nitrite and nitrate simultaneously under dark and light conditions in parallel light strongly inhibited nitrification but enhanced n uptake and such light effect was further considered in the calculation for nitrogen transformation rates over a diel cycle we found both oxidation and uptake of ammonium decreased seaward as substrate decreased the nitrifier and phytoplankton work in antiphase to draw down incoming ammonium rapidly contrary to ammonium uptake uptake of nitrite and nitrate showed a seaward increasing pattern such an inverse spatial pattern implies a shift in n preference for phytoplankton such high ammonium preference inhibits nitrate nitrite uptake allowing them to behave conservatively in the estuary and to travel farther to outer estuary by integrating oxygen consumption and production induced by n transformation processes over the diel cycle oxygen was produced although allochthonous ammonium input is high 250 μm for most stations ammonium was completely consumed within 2 days some stations even less than 0 5 days implying that although the water residence time is short 2 15 days tremendous input of ammonium n from upstream was transformed into particulate organic or nitrate forms during traveling to modulate the biogeochemical niche including substrate organics and oxygen of coastal microbes in water column and sediments keywords ammonia oxidation ammonium uptake nitrite uptake nitrate uptake oxygen consumption and production pearl river estuary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the generation of reactive nitrogen n induced by increasing human activities heavily perturbs the global nitrogen cycle since the industrial revolution second to the biodiversity loss n pollution is currently the most serious global environmental problem folke et al 2021 the anthropogenic nitrogen flowed into the ocean mainly via riverine discharge globally the total riverine reactive nitrogen flux was expected to rise 30 from 118 tg n yr 1 in early 1990 up to 150 tg n yr 1 in 2050 galloway et al 2004 of which the anthropogenic n input far exceeds n sourced from natural processes folke et al 2021 for example some catchments in china like changjiang and jiulong river now hold 10 times riverine n loads relative to 1960 due to rapid urbanization and population increase e g li et al 2014 wu et al 2017 analogous conditions may occur in developing countries in the coming decades the additional n inputs from continents unavoidably lead to more frequent harmful algal blooms and seasonal hypoxia e g li et al 2014 2020 breitburg et al 2018 served as the land sea interface estuary features diverse ecosystems presenting a wide range of salinity nutrients and turbidity due to periodic horizontal exchange driven by tidal force harrison et al 2008 reactive nitrogen consists of various forms including organic nitrogen and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din that is ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 gruber 2008 transforming between each other in the estuary various n transformations mediated by distinct microorganisms along the estuary may create differential production and consumption of oxygen carbon dioxide and proton thus resulting in diverse effects on biogeochemical habitats for microorganisms of the downstream and coastal zones for example nh4 was the dominant and reduced nitrogen species which is readily utilized by various microorganisms including phytoplankton which perform photosynthesis to consume carbon dioxide produce oxygen and elevate ph on the other hand nh4 was transformed into no2 and then to no3 by nitrifiers contrary to photosynthesis such a chemo autotrophic nitrification pathway consumes oxygen and produces protons obviously nh4 consumption by phytoplankton or by nitrifier oxidation has distinctive environmental effects moreover the intermediate and final products no2 and no3 of nitrification act also as the substrate for primary production and denitrification the substrate no2 no3 availability for denitrification a crucial process to alleviate excessive n loads can depend on nitrification while nitrifiers must compete with phytoplankton for nh4 however environmental controls on this competition are largely unclear thus studies of n transformations along estuaries especially those heavily impacted by anthropogenic n inputs are important to address the linkages among in estuary biogeochemical processes coastal environmental problems coastal hypoxia and acidification and potential climatic effect at the land ocean boundary however available data of simultaneous measurements of multiple n transformation rates were still limited moreover the distinctive behaviors of nitrifiers and phytoplankton upon light exposure create a diel shift in biogeochemical stoichiometry which has rarely been quantified before the pearl river is the second largest river in terms of freshwater discharge in china the pearl river estuary pre is located in one of the fastest developing areas in china over the past forty years increasing wastewater discharge as a result of economic development causes many environmental issues such as nh4 pollution up to 800 μm in the upstream estuary and coastal hypoxia qian et al 2022 li et al 2020 thus the pre is a great setting by providing ideal gradients of salinity nutrient concentrations and microbial community compositions huang et al 2021 duan et al 2022 to examine the dynamics of n transformations and their relation with dissolved oxygen to date the spatial variation in the rates of co occurring multiple n processes in the pre has not been reported and possible environmental drivers e g light substrate remain unclear this study aims to enrich our knowledge of how n cycles function in a large human perturbed estuarine system and how environmental factors influence multiple transformation rates of nitrogen and associated oxygen production and consumption to fulfill our goal 15n tracer approach was applied additionally we conducted the light and dark incubation in parallel to acquire more accurate rates over a diel cycle and to examine the diel shift in nitrogen transformation pathways and associated biogeochemical stoichiometry this study will benefit the assessment of n related pollution mitigation and environmental risk and the rate measures can be used for biogeochemical model validation 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographic setting and sampling stations the annual river discharge of the pearl river is 3 5 1011 m3 yr 1 with strong seasonality harrison et al 2008 and 80 of annual discharge occurs in summer with a monthly average water flow up to 1 6 104 m3 s 1 dai et al 2008 in summer wet season the mean residence time is rather short 3 days while it goes up to 6 days in winter dry season sun et al 2014 the large freshwater flows downstream to offshore where water depth is 50 m in wet season while in dry season with low discharge the seawater intrusion is stronger harrison et al 2008 a perennial salt wedge and turbidity front exist though migrate seasonally in the pre as the co influence of upstream land use freshwater discharge and bottom seawater intrusion cui et al 2022 eleven stations covering a salinity gradient of 0 34 fig 1 were selected to conduct rate incubations during the cruise in july 2015 onboard the r v kediao viii these stations were classified into three zones according to surface salinity i e freshwater zone zone i s 0 freshwater dominated including station 2p01 2p03 and p05a inner estuary zone zone ii 0 s 20 freshwater and seawater mixing zone covering station a01 2a04 2a06 a08b and f301 and seawater dominated outer estuary zone iii s 20 f101 a11 and f501 the bottom depth of the sampling stations ranged from 5 m to 21 m table s1 we classified inner and outer estuary stations by using salinity rather than geographic location since salinity is a critical physiological determinant for microbes and the isopleth of salinity migrates over time due to the amount of freshwater discharge tidal height and in estuary circulation 2 2 water sampling water was sampled using 12 l go flo bottles mounted with the conductivity temperature depth pressure ctd unit sbe911 sea bird co two depths surface and bottom were sampled for nutrients nh4 no2 no3 total suspended matter tsm particulate organic nitrogen pn and chlorophyll a chl a analyses for all stations except station 2p03 5 2 m deep for which only surface samples were collected table s1 nutrient samples were filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes and the filtrates were collected in acid washed 1 2 n hcl 125 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles nh4 was analyzed immediately on deck using the indophenol blue spectrophotometric method with a detection limit of 0 1 μm pai et al 2001 the remaining samples were immediately stored at 20 c for future nutrient analyses no2 and no3 were measured in the laboratory with a technicon aa3 auto analyzer bran luebbe with detection limits of 0 02 and 0 07 μm respectively dai et al 2008 tsm samples were collected by filtering 1 2 l of water sample through 47 mm pre combusted and pre weighed whatman glass microfiber gf f filters and the filters were stored at 20 c until weighted after freeze drying the filters for pn is analyzed by using the persulfate oxidation method which converts pn into no3 knapp et al 2005 and then the no3 concentration was measured by the chemiluminescence method braman and hendrix 1989 samples for chl a were collected by filtering 1 2 l of water sample through 25 mm whatman gf f filters and then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until analysis chl a was determined after extraction with 90 acetone by using a turner fluorometer with a red sensitive photomultiplier xu et al 2019 2 3 onboard incubation experiments for rate experiments the 15n stable isotope tracer technique was implemented 15nh4 were added for ammonia oxidation ao and ammonium uptake au while 15no2 and 15no3 were added for nitrite uptake niu and nitrate uptake nau respectively detailed information for the methods has been summarized in the previous study xu et al 2017 incubations of ao au niu and nau were performed on deck in incubators at surface water temperature maintained by circulating surface water for each sampling depth water from the go flo bottle was first aliquoted into three 4 l polycarbonate pc bottles then prepared 15nh4 15no2 15no3 stock solution with gradients were added separately to the pc bottles the amount of addition was constrained based on the reported relations between salinity and din concentrations harrison et al 2008 the final concentration range of 15nh4 15no2 15no3 was 0 05 10 μm 0 1 5 μm and 0 13 10 μm respectively and the corresponding ratios of 15n addition to ambient substrate were 5 59 5 3 7 44 7 and 1 35 7 respectively for nh4 no2 no3 table s2 according to concentrations measured back to laboratory for each 4 l bottle 400 ml of the sample was filtered immediately after tracer addition through 47 mm pre combusted whatman gf f filters and filters were preserved as the initial point t0 samples for uptake rate calculation another 50 ml of water from the 15nh4 addition bottle was filtered through a 0 22 μm disposable syringe filter and the filtrate was collected into a 50 ml centrifuge tube as the t0 of ao collected samples were frozen at 20 c until the laboratory analysis the remaining water in each 4 l bottle was distributed evenly into four 500 ml pc bottles to perform incubations of which two for light and two for dark incubations during the cruise period the daily average surface par spar was 8 0 61 1 einstein m 2 day 1 according to noaa https oceanwatch pifsc noaa gov erddap griddap aqua par 1d 2018 0 html for the surface samples 50 spar i e 4 30 6 einstein m 2 day 1 was applied the euphotic depth of pre varied from 1 2 m in the upstream of humen to 4 m in the outer estuary during summertime liu et al 2017 given the microorganisms were transported up and down in the waterbody due to turbulent mixing li et al 2020 50 spar is assumed to represent the mean light exposure for the surface sample collected at 2 m deep for the bottom samples 50 spar is also used for light treatment to explore the light effect for the paralleled dark incubation bottles were covered by aluminum foil to prevent light after 3 6 h incubation the samples were terminated following the protocol of t0 samples to collect filters and filtrate additionally for station p05a and a01 time series incubations t0 t1 t2 t3 within 12 h and 24 h were conducted respectively to examine the precision of rate measures including sample heterogeneity analytical uncertainty the influence of substrate dilution and the stability of microbial community linearity of 15n production over the set incubation time course see results in fig s2 2 4 rate estimate the n isotope δ15n in nox no3 no2 the end product of ao was determined using the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 nox was quantitatively converted to n2o by denitrifier bacteria atcc 13985 and then determined for its isotopic composition by using a gasbench ii thermo fisher connected to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo delta v advantage δ15n values of samples were calibrated using international nitrate isotope reference materials δ15nusgs34 1 80 δ15niaea n3 4 70 δ15nusgs32 180 00 for the product of n uptake pn samples were oxidized to nitrate by using potassium persulfate first then using the denitrifier method to measure indirectly δ15npn n transformation rates including oxidation ao and uptake au niu and nau were determined from the increment of 15n in the product pool during the incubation interval using the eq 1 1 v r t p t r 0 p 0 t 14 n 15 n where v represents the n transformation rate nm h 1 rt and r0 stand for 15n atom of the product pool e g nox for ammonia oxidation and pn for uptake at the end and the start of incubation respectively pt and p0 are the concentration of product pools at the end and the start of incubation t is for the incubation time period 14n and 15n represent the final concentrations of 14n and 15n in substrates nh4 no2 no3 in the beginning after tracer addition respectively the 15n increment in product pool i e δ15nox and δ15n pn increased linearly within 24 h time course incubations after adding 15nh4 15no2 and 15no3 fig s2 such linearity suggests that rates remain constant at least within the first 12 h time course incubations and the dilution effect of nh4 regeneration is thus negligible during the linear reaction time interval xu et al 2017 therefore in this case we focused on the first 6 hours and introduced instantaneous rate expressed on an hourly basis leaving the bias from regeneration uncounted the daily surface rates were integrated by using light plus dark rates 12 12 hours while the daily rates of the bottom sample were calculated by using instant dark rates multiplying by 24 hours since the bottom samples were considered without light exposure due to rapid light attenuation in the water column liu et al 2017 in this study we do not calculate water column integrated rate 2 5 nitrogen preference index and din turnover as phytoplankton may utilize multiple n forms simultaneously to fuel their growth the relative n preference index rpi was introduced to examine which n species is preferred according to the equation put forward by mccarthy et al 1977 as follows 2 r p i x v x v nh 4 v no 2 v no 3 x nh 4 no 2 no 3 where rpix is the preference index for substrate x vx μm d 1 and x μm are the daily uptake rate of substrate x and the concentration of substrate x respectively the value of rpi indicates the degree of preference for a specific substrate i e when rpi lower than 1 suggests that phytoplankton prefers other forms of n rather than x mccarthy et al 1977 based on the summed consumption rates and the corresponding substrate n pool size the lifetime of the specific n pool can be estimated using the following equation 3 t x x v x stands for the concentration of x v μm d 1 represents the daily total consumption rate of x tx day is the lifetime time for complete consumption of the specific nitrogen x for example the lifetime of nh4 pool was estimated according to the summarized daily rates of ao and au while the lifetime of nitrite and nitrate were obtained based on the concentration of nitrite and nitrate divided respectively by their corresponding daily uptake rates 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of environmental parameters temperature salinity concentrations of nh4 no3 no2 pn chl a and tsm were plotted against the stations in a seaward direction fig 2 and against salinity fig s1 the salinity ranged from 0 to 30 and the salinity of stations upstream of humen was 0 the salinity increased up to 30 due to mixing with seawater furthermore the salinity in the bottom layer was higher than the values in the surface depths due to seawater bottom intrusion fig 2a the temperature showed no obvious difference both in the vertical surface and bottom depths and horizontal distributions except in zone iii where the bottom layer temperature was significantly lower than the surface fig 2b all din species show an overall downstream decreasing pattern as salinity increases fig s1a c from upstream to the downstream outer estuary fig 2c e ammonium was the dominant din species 65 for freshwater stations yet in zone i nh4 dropped rapidly from 183 3 at very upstream to 30 μm at around humen in the inner and outer estuary nh4 remained low to a few μm even below the detection limit at some stations fig 2c and fig s1a in contrast to ammonium no2 increased first in zone i from 12 7 μm to the highest concentration of 21 6 μm at around humen and then remained at 6 μm in zone ii and decreased to 2 0 5 μm in zone iii fig 2d and fig s1b nitrate displayed a similar horizontal pattern to nitrite i e increased from 84 7 to 137 5 μm inside zone i and remained at 84 30 μm in zone ii and then decreased to 11 2 9 1 μm in zone iii fig 2e and fig s1c in downstream of humen no3 became the dominant din species accounting for as high as 95 of din pool table s2 moreover no3 concentrations in the surface layers were higher than in the bottom for all stations except the station of p05a fig 2e and table s2 while no notable variation between nh4 and no2 was observed vertically fig 2c and d pn concentration was relatively high 12 5 25 6 μm upstream of humen and then decreased downstream showing a seaward decreasing pattern fig 2f and fig s1d the horizontal distribution of chl a was similar to that of pn which was high 19 7 35 5 μg l 1 in humen upstream and decreased seaward fig 2g and fig s1e both chl a and pn showed high values in zone i and relatively high values in zone iii with the highest value appearing at a11 station at the salinity of 28 fig s1d and e which corresponds to significant drops of nitrate and nitrite further in zone iii the highest values of pn and chl a for individual stations appeared in the surface fig 2f and g suggesting the presence of an actively growing phytoplankton community adapted to higher salinity the tsm ranged from 7 7 112 3 mg l 1 with a seaward declining trend fig 2h and fig s1f the distribution of tsm was relatively scattered and the value in the bottom was higher than that in the surface for nearly all the stations fig 2h likely due to resuspension 3 2 ammonia oxidation both the instant rates of ao in light l and in dark d incubation broadly decreased from zone i l 52 0 270 6 nm h 1 d 224

were lower than those in dark fig 3a consistent with previous reports xu et al 2019 revealing that ao rates were inhibited by light with strong diel rhythm additionally the instant ao rates were higher in bottom than in the surface fig 3a also reflecting a preferable niche for nitrifier in bottom water combining results from light and dark situations we obtained ao rate on daily basis which showed a seaward decreasing pattern dotted line in fig 3a daily ao rates were larger in zone i 3 7 18 2 μm d 1 than in zone ii 0 2 6 3 μm d 1 and zone iii 0 0 95 μm d 1 fig 3a and the rates dropped rapidly as salinity increased fig s3b 3 3 din uptake rates resembling ao s horizontal distribution pattern the au rates in both light and dark incubation were higher in zone i l 512 2 794 2 nm h 1 d

s3c on daily basis au 0 3 13 0 μm d 1 figs 3b and s3d were in the same magnitude as ao 0 18 2 μm d 1 the estuary zone decreasing pattern remains for au daily rates showing high values in zone i 4 4 13

zone i l 0 8 2 2 nm h 1 d 0 4 0 8 nm h 1 to zone ii l 0 5 46 8 nm h 1 d 0 1 2 6 nm h 1 and zone iii l 5 4 70 3 nm h 1 d 1 0 61 1 nm h 1 differing from the patterns of ao and au the rates of niu at all

rates were increasing seaward with lower rates in humen upstream 0 01 0 03 μm d 1 and up to 1 58 μm d 1 in downstream outer estuary at the salinity of 27 fig s3f the nau rates in both light and dark incubation increased from zone i l 10 2 47 1 nm h 1 d 0 5 12 4 nm h 1 to zone ii l 1 2 291 6 nm h 1 d 0 8 23 1 nm h 1 and zone iii l 7 7 514 6 nm h 1 d 0 3 79 6 nm h 1 figs 3d and s3g resembling the niu s distribution pattern meanwhile the nau rates in light incubation showed a clear vertical pattern with surface bottom except the station of f301 for every individual sample nau was higher in light than in dark fig 3d the daily nau varied in the same magnitude of daily au however showing an opposite downstream pattern daily nau increased from undetectable in humen upstream to the maximum value 7 1 μm d 1 in the outer estuary at the salinity of 27 fig s3h the daily nau rates in the surface were significantly higher than the rates in the bottom fig 3d for one way anova p 0 038 0 05 the peak of daily nau and daily niu appeared at the same station f501 in the outer estuary fig 3e and d 4 discussion 4 1 multiple n transformation pathways and associated factors in the pre the most notable horizontal feature of n cycling processes is the high ao and au in upstream zone i and the high niu and nau in the estuary zone zone iii similarly we found a gradual shift from relatively high nh4 fraction of total din concentration in the upstream to relatively high no3 fraction in the estuary area table s2 since substrates are one of the key factors influencing rates the high concentration of nh4 from sewage discharge in the zone i harrison et al 2008 probably play a role in determining such a high ao and au rate fig 4a and b however no statistically significant correlation was found between daily ao and au and nh4 in zone i table s3 which may be resulted from multiple sources with different ammonium concentrations upstream of humen where regional treated wastewater may provide variable ammonium discharges to alter the correlation xu et al 2008 furthermore other factors like nitrifier phytoplankton biomass tsm and light may also mask the linear substrate dependent relationship nevertheless in the estuary zone where nh4 was lower daily ao but not au was positively correlated with nh4 concentrations table s3 such positive correlation still exists for ao for samples from different depths in estuary after diel integration light and dark implying the ever present niche span of nitrifier in the whole water column on the other hand the increasing phytoplankton preference for nitrate and nitrite though less than ammonium toward downstream fig 5c occurred accompanying with nitrate and nitrite supply originated either from upstream due to longer nitrate and nitrite life time or from ao derived nox the positive correlation between niu nau and chl a and daily nau with pn probably suggest phytoplankton relies on nox for growth then leaving niche space for ao to use nh4 in the estuary smith et al 2014 xu et al 2019 for nau and niu however high no3 and no2 in zone i did not correspond to high nau and niu which may be explained by the theory of high ammonium inhibition on nitrate uptake dugdale et al 2007 glibert et al 2016 however the niu and nau were detectable once nh4 was below 4 μm fig 4 c and d supporting the inhibition threshold of 1 4 μm for nitrate uptake glibert et al 2016 to some extent and nox sourced from upstream may also support estuarine phytoplankton growth as discussed above additionally the shift of phytoplankton abundance and community composition from zone i to zone iii huang et al 2004 may also act as a factor to determine the horizonal pattern of din uptake tsm is also a determinant of ao hsiao et al 2014 and photosynthesis harrison et al 2008 a positive correlation between ao and tsm in the estuary zone was observed table s3 at low ammonium concentration particles not only act as a carrier for ammonia oxidizer but enriched organics on particle surface may also offer remineralized ammonium to fuel ao such positive relationships between ao and tsm were reported also in other estuarine regions berounsky and nixon 1993 hsiao et al 2014 in fact tsm affects the light availability and indirectly exerts influence on phytoplankton harrison et al 2008 and further influences the din uptake although no relation was observed between din uptake and tsm in this study table s3 besides substrate and tsm light is the primary factor showing a profound effect on ao as well the effect of light on ammonia oxidation rates in the open ocean and coastal water had been studied for decades smith et al 2014 xu et al 2019 in this study all the ratios of ao rates in light to dark aol d were 1 with most aol d values 0 5 fig 3e suggesting light inhibited ao supportive of previous studies lipschultz et al 1985 xu et al 2019 and light suppression on ao rates were 50 considering the high level of nh4 in the upstream of pre the light effect on ao was probably due to direct light inhibition on nitrifier activities while at low nh4 concentrations downstream the competition for nh4 from phytoplankton may aid in the light effect smith et al 2014 furthermore our ao rates in the bottom water were higher than that in the surface fig 3a further supporting photo inhibition different from the oxidation pathway by nitrifiers din uptake pathways were stimulated by light the light dark ratios of all assimilation aul d niul d and naul d were 1 fig 3f h consistent with previous studies like the case in the neuse river estuary boyer et al 1994 and the gulf of aqaba red sea mackey et al 2011 which suggests phytoplankton not heterotrophic bacteria contributes to din uptake generally the values of naul d 12 01 7 78 were much higher than niu and au 2 50 0 86 indicating nitrate uptake is more energy consuming than nitrite and ammonium our observations are supported by previous phytoplankton physiological studies the step of nitrate reduction into nitrite and further to nh4 requires a reductant either nadh or nadph and its supplement is directly regulated by light syrett 1981 thus nitrate reductase appeared to be activated by light during the nitrate uptake process vincent 1992 4 2 competition for nh4 and uptake preference of various din species ao and au were two distinct pathways to consume ammonium although au 0 3 13 0 μm d 1 were in the same magnitude as ao 0 18 2 μm d 1 on a daily basis the ratios of au ao varied up to four orders of magnitude and all au ao in the light were higher than those in dark regardless of surface or bottom water fig s4a and b indicating nitrifiers are poorer competitors for nh4 than phytoplankton upon light exposure under the dark almost all au ao values were 1 in the freshwater and inner estuary zones where waterbody is more turbid compared to that in outer estuary suggesting nitrifier is likely to outcompete phytoplankton when light is diminished fig s4a and b the results of phytoplankton and nitrifiers on site competition would modulate the biogeochemistry elsewhere downstream for example phytoplankton wins to generate oxygen on site however the decomposition of phytoplankton produced organics may consume oxygen consequently elsewhere during particle settling down or transport the nitrifiers win to consume oxygen and the nitrification produced nitrate may be respired by denitrifier or utilized by downstream phytoplankton for growth again thus understanding the niche partition and competition in space between phytoplankton and nitrifier is critical according to previous studies and our light dark experiments the niche boundary should vary in depth with phytoplankton in the euphotic zone while nitrifier below the depth light cannot penetrate thus the size of niche space will be determined by light penetration and water depth that is the niche space for nitrifiers may expand as the water depth increases downstream although we did not measure light profiles the shallow water transparency in summer liu et al 2017 suggested that nitrifiers may have a larger space in the water column relative to phytoplankton the reported water transparency in pre showed that the deepest euphotic depth appeared in spring while shallowest in summer revealing a notable seasonal variation liu et al 2017 reasonably the niche partition the competition between nitrifier and phytoplankton and ao and au associated oxygen flows would exhibit seasonal variations the fractional contribution of au nau and niu to total din uptake on the basis of daily rates for surface and bottom water were calculated in the surface au daily rates contributed 91 of din daily uptake in the freshwater zone above humen fig 5 a similar to the study in the monterey bay where 94 of the din uptake was contributed by ammonium bronk and ward 1999 the positive correlation of au against pn concentration in the freshwater zone table s3 is also consistent with the predominance of nh4 uptake contributing to pn as the concentration of ammonium decreased sharply downstream of humen surface nitrate uptake rates increased seaward and its contribution reached up to 81 fig 5a while in the bottom layers au was dominant in general 92 6 7 much higher than nau 0 6 14 of din uptake fig 5b which is due to limited light in the bottom layer among din uptake rates the contribution of niu 13 fig 5a and b was the lowest regardless of stations and depths similar to the results in the gulf of aqaba mackey et al 2011 the values of rpinh4 were always 1 1 5 125 2 with an average of 29 consistent with the dominant au contribution to bulk din uptake rate while rpino3 was 1 0 01 to 0 92 for all stations in this study fig 5c and d indicating that phytoplankton always prefer nh4 over nitrate syrett 1981 the results are consistent with the studies in the cook strait and loire estuary that the values of rpino3 were less than one priscu and downes 1985 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2000 although the values of rpino3 were 1 a gradually increasing pattern for rpino3 i e from 0 1 in humen upstream increased to close to one in the outer estuary accompanied by rpinh4 decreasing fig 5c and d indicating that nitrate was less preferred but still utilized to fulfill phytoplankton growth in estuary zone when nitrate was a dominant din species nau positively relates to both chl a and pn in the inner and outer estuary zone p 0 01 table s3 indicating nau may greatly contribute to pn rpino2 were 1 also indicated nitrite was less preferred by phytoplankton although presumably niu is toxic and more energetically costly relative to au lomas and lipschultz 2006 we noticed that rpino2 was larger than rpino3 in most cases fig 5c and d showing nitrite was still preferred relative to nitrate due to physiologically less energy requirement for niu than nau but nitrite uptake rates were lower than nitrate uptake rates in our study probably because of the high no3 concentration to be accessed previous investigations in the pre showed that the phytoplankton community shifted from freshwater diatoms zone i into estuarine diatoms zone ii iii zhang et al 2014 or into pico size phytoplankton zone iii chai et al 2016 such community shift might be caused by salinity or multiple environmental factors nevertheless such shift explains the observed downstream rpi variations and highlights the in estuary n dynamics may modulate n speciation to feed different phytoplankton 4 3 lifetime of the din pool the lifetime of nh4 ranged from 0 1 to 17 9 days with most of the values 2 days except the station of 2p01 at very upstream fig 5e and f such short lifetimes suggested ammonium pools of most stations in the pre were completely consumed within several hours to 2 days which is comparable to the jiulong river estuary yan et al 2019 the water residence time of pre ranged from 2 to 15 days in summer li et al 2020 much longer than the lifetime of nh4 leading to a significant feature of ammonium removal fig s1a obviously nh4 was transferred into particulate organic form or nitrate before reaching the coastline to influence the biogeochemical habitat of coastal microbes in fact a previous pre study suggested that organics sedimentation induced nitrification coupled with denitrification plays a major role to alleviate n pollution tan et al 2019 thus diel regulation on the two distinctive nh4 pathways may stimulate the sedimentary denitrification downstream via offering organics and nitrate simultaneously to mitigate the external nh4 input previous study also showed that in dry season with lower discharge din concentrations especially nh4 were much higher in the upper estuary harrison et al 2008 obviously the related ao and din uptake rates in dry season may increase as the water residence time increases in dry season all parameters and associated n processes will change accordingly e g light penetration depth lifetime of various n species the partition of niche space for phytoplankton and nitrifiers etc therefore more studies are needed to explore n transformations and associated biogeochemistry for different seasons nevertheless light exerts a profound effect on n dynamics in the estuary and diel regulation must be considered to accurately assess the role of multiple n species in estuarine and coastal biogeochemical cycles the lifetimes of nitrite and nitrate were much longer than that of nh4 up to thousands of days fig 5e and f resulting in the apparent conservative behavior for no2 and no3 fig s1b and c such conservative behavior was partly due to nh4 inhibition on daytime nitrate uptake and partly due to supply via ammonia oxidation in the nighttime as we did not measure nitrite oxidation rates the lifetime of nitrite may be slightly overestimated nevertheless the lifetime of both nitrite and nitrate were decreasing seaward with a significant drop to a few days at the outer estuary fig 5e and f where chl a peaked and pn enhanced significantly salinity 28 fig s1d and e in fact previous studies in changjiang plume tseng et al 2014 and pre li et al 2020 also showed more stagnant environments for phytoplankton growth in the frontal zone with salinity 26 28 which may cause the accumulation of phytoplankton and thus significant drawdown of turn over time for nitrate and nitrite 4 4 oxygen dynamics driven by din associated processes high anthropogenic nh4 and no3 inputs and their transformations in the estuary are of increasing concern not only due to their potential contribution to oxygen consumption but also the possible contribution to hypoxia in the outer estuary qian et al 2022 as mentioned earlier integrating the rate for entire water column is not feasible we discussed oxygen dynamics driven by din related transformations only via daily rates obtained from the surface and bottom layer during complete nitrification oxygen is consumed according to ward 2011 4 n h 3 2 o 2 no 3 h 2 o h thus the daily oxygen consumption rates of nitrifier were calculated to be 0 001 36 42 μm d 1 and 0 31 23 75 μm d 1 in the surface and bottom layers respectively with higher consumption in the zone 1 and lower in the outer estuary fig 6 a although external input of ammonium consumes oxygen via oxidation a significant portion of this external source also contributes to oxygen production either directly via au or indirectly via niu or nau uptake of the products of nitrification the equations of synthesis of organic matter by uptake of ammonium 5 and nitrate 6 as nitrogen source gruber 2008 were as follows as nitrite was an intermediary product of nitrate assimilation according to the equation of nitrate uptake we can derive the eq 7 as below 5 106 c o 2 16 nh 4 hpo 4 2 48 h 2 o 14 o h c 106 h 175 o 42 n 16 p 118 o 2 6 106 c o 2 16 no 3 hpo 4 2 78 h 2 o 18 h c 106 h 175 o 42 n 16 p 150 o 2 7 106 c o 2 16 no 2 hpo 4 2 78 h 2 o 18 h c 106 h 175 o 42 n 16 p 142 o 2 thus 16 mol nh4 no3 and no2 uptake by phytoplankton will produce 118 150 and 142 mol o2 respectively the total oxygen production vis din uptake was 7 8 104 7 μm d 1 in the surface higher than in the bottom depth 2 4 37 9 μm d 1 fig 6a the estimated daily net o2 production derived from the discrepancy between daily ao induced o2 consumption and daily din uptake induced o2 production was 3 5 104 7 μm d 1 for the surface and 5 0 25 4 μm d 1 for the bottom layer fig 6b and nearly all the samples from the surface and bottom layers showed net oxygen production counterintuitively although external nh4 input was high in the zone i the two contrasting nh4 consumption processes resulted in a net o2 production on daily basis overall speaking high au induced by external nh4 input generates oxygen in upstream yet the freshly produced particulate organic matter may consume oxygen to simulate hypoxia in downstream the high preference for nh4 combined with diel rhythm and low light penetration nitrate and nitrite are allowed to behave conservatively and be transported farther downstream for microbial utilization in downstream the delivered nitrate nitrite can produce oxygen via photosynthesis in euphotic zone meanwhile they can act as electron acceptor nitrate respiration similar to oxygen below the euphotic zone although the turbulence makes the water depth integration of oxygen fluxes impossible for the pre estuary our case study of multiple n transformation processes revealed 1 the effect of light and diel cycle on the correlation between oxygen and various n transformation pathways and 2 a tight linkage between upstream and downstream n processes and their association with oxygen conclusion this study was the first to measure daily oxidation and uptake rates of dissolved inorganic nitrogen by considering the effect of light in the pre the rates of ao and au were of similar magnitude and both of them showed a seaward decreasing pattern while nau and niu increased seaward light inhibits ao while stimulate din uptake significantly overall our results showed pre has two different biogeochemical regimes an upstream region with high nh4 consumption zone i and a downstream outer estuary dominated by no3 consumption zone iii fig 7 ao and au were the dominant n transformation processes in the upstream which is heavily affected by external ammonium input counterintuitively although external nh4 input was high in zone i the two contrasting nh4 consumption processes resulted in a net o2 production rather than consumption on daily basis for most stations both ao and au were sufficiently high to completely consume ammonium within 2 days thus before reaching the coastline nh4 was transferred 1 into particulate organic form to enhance the coupling of nitrification and denitrification in sediment to alleviate n pollution or 2 into nitrate to be transported downstream contributing to phytoplankton bloom and nitrate respiration the high preference of nh4 for phytoplankton allows no2 and no3 to maintain conservative behavior during mixing inside estuary and to travel farther downstream to fuel phytoplankton growth at zone iii to form the no3 utilization hotpot overall our study highlights 1 the importance of light on n dynamics 2 the high external nh4 input would not necessarily cause oxygen consumption on daily basis 3 nh4 was transformed rapidly into pn which is highly likely a driver for bottom water hypoxia in the outer estuary 4 assimilation preference for ammonium allows nitrate influx from upstream catchment to reach the coastal zone for phytoplankton bloom in the future pre as the land use changes and sewage treatment technology improves the n species and concentrations carried by freshwater discharge may vary concomitantly to change the current state of the association between n transformation and oxygen declaration of competing interest

15704,the reactive nitrogen n emitted from continents significantly perturbs the pristine n cycle around the land ocean boundary resulting in eutrophication and hypoxia as nutrients are transported downstream through an estuary various types of biological processes co occur to modulate nitrogen speciation to influence the biogeochemical habitats for downstream microorganisms we surveyed the pearl river estuary to examine the n transfer dynamics among nitrogen species with considering process specific oxygen production and consumption by using 15n pulse tracing techniques we measured ammonia oxidation and uptakes of ammonium nitrite and nitrate simultaneously under dark and light conditions in parallel light strongly inhibited nitrification but enhanced n uptake and such light effect was further considered in the calculation for nitrogen transformation rates over a diel cycle we found both oxidation and uptake of ammonium decreased seaward as substrate decreased the nitrifier and phytoplankton work in antiphase to draw down incoming ammonium rapidly contrary to ammonium uptake uptake of nitrite and nitrate showed a seaward increasing pattern such an inverse spatial pattern implies a shift in n preference for phytoplankton such high ammonium preference inhibits nitrate nitrite uptake allowing them to behave conservatively in the estuary and to travel farther to outer estuary by integrating oxygen consumption and production induced by n transformation processes over the diel cycle oxygen was produced although allochthonous ammonium input is high 250 μm for most stations ammonium was completely consumed within 2 days some stations even less than 0 5 days implying that although the water residence time is short 2 15 days tremendous input of ammonium n from upstream was transformed into particulate organic or nitrate forms during traveling to modulate the biogeochemical niche including substrate organics and oxygen of coastal microbes in water column and sediments keywords ammonia oxidation ammonium uptake nitrite uptake nitrate uptake oxygen consumption and production pearl river estuary data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the generation of reactive nitrogen n induced by increasing human activities heavily perturbs the global nitrogen cycle since the industrial revolution second to the biodiversity loss n pollution is currently the most serious global environmental problem folke et al 2021 the anthropogenic nitrogen flowed into the ocean mainly via riverine discharge globally the total riverine reactive nitrogen flux was expected to rise 30 from 118 tg n yr 1 in early 1990 up to 150 tg n yr 1 in 2050 galloway et al 2004 of which the anthropogenic n input far exceeds n sourced from natural processes folke et al 2021 for example some catchments in china like changjiang and jiulong river now hold 10 times riverine n loads relative to 1960 due to rapid urbanization and population increase e g li et al 2014 wu et al 2017 analogous conditions may occur in developing countries in the coming decades the additional n inputs from continents unavoidably lead to more frequent harmful algal blooms and seasonal hypoxia e g li et al 2014 2020 breitburg et al 2018 served as the land sea interface estuary features diverse ecosystems presenting a wide range of salinity nutrients and turbidity due to periodic horizontal exchange driven by tidal force harrison et al 2008 reactive nitrogen consists of various forms including organic nitrogen and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din that is ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 gruber 2008 transforming between each other in the estuary various n transformations mediated by distinct microorganisms along the estuary may create differential production and consumption of oxygen carbon dioxide and proton thus resulting in diverse effects on biogeochemical habitats for microorganisms of the downstream and coastal zones for example nh4 was the dominant and reduced nitrogen species which is readily utilized by various microorganisms including phytoplankton which perform photosynthesis to consume carbon dioxide produce oxygen and elevate ph on the other hand nh4 was transformed into no2 and then to no3 by nitrifiers contrary to photosynthesis such a chemo autotrophic nitrification pathway consumes oxygen and produces protons obviously nh4 consumption by phytoplankton or by nitrifier oxidation has distinctive environmental effects moreover the intermediate and final products no2 and no3 of nitrification act also as the substrate for primary production and denitrification the substrate no2 no3 availability for denitrification a crucial process to alleviate excessive n loads can depend on nitrification while nitrifiers must compete with phytoplankton for nh4 however environmental controls on this competition are largely unclear thus studies of n transformations along estuaries especially those heavily impacted by anthropogenic n inputs are important to address the linkages among in estuary biogeochemical processes coastal environmental problems coastal hypoxia and acidification and potential climatic effect at the land ocean boundary however available data of simultaneous measurements of multiple n transformation rates were still limited moreover the distinctive behaviors of nitrifiers and phytoplankton upon light exposure create a diel shift in biogeochemical stoichiometry which has rarely been quantified before the pearl river is the second largest river in terms of freshwater discharge in china the pearl river estuary pre is located in one of the fastest developing areas in china over the past forty years increasing wastewater discharge as a result of economic development causes many environmental issues such as nh4 pollution up to 800 μm in the upstream estuary and coastal hypoxia qian et al 2022 li et al 2020 thus the pre is a great setting by providing ideal gradients of salinity nutrient concentrations and microbial community compositions huang et al 2021 duan et al 2022 to examine the dynamics of n transformations and their relation with dissolved oxygen to date the spatial variation in the rates of co occurring multiple n processes in the pre has not been reported and possible environmental drivers e g light substrate remain unclear this study aims to enrich our knowledge of how n cycles function in a large human perturbed estuarine system and how environmental factors influence multiple transformation rates of nitrogen and associated oxygen production and consumption to fulfill our goal 15n tracer approach was applied additionally we conducted the light and dark incubation in parallel to acquire more accurate rates over a diel cycle and to examine the diel shift in nitrogen transformation pathways and associated biogeochemical stoichiometry this study will benefit the assessment of n related pollution mitigation and environmental risk and the rate measures can be used for biogeochemical model validation 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographic setting and sampling stations the annual river discharge of the pearl river is 3 5 1011 m3 yr 1 with strong seasonality harrison et al 2008 and 80 of annual discharge occurs in summer with a monthly average water flow up to 1 6 104 m3 s 1 dai et al 2008 in summer wet season the mean residence time is rather short 3 days while it goes up to 6 days in winter dry season sun et al 2014 the large freshwater flows downstream to offshore where water depth is 50 m in wet season while in dry season with low discharge the seawater intrusion is stronger harrison et al 2008 a perennial salt wedge and turbidity front exist though migrate seasonally in the pre as the co influence of upstream land use freshwater discharge and bottom seawater intrusion cui et al 2022 eleven stations covering a salinity gradient of 0 34 fig 1 were selected to conduct rate incubations during the cruise in july 2015 onboard the r v kediao viii these stations were classified into three zones according to surface salinity i e freshwater zone zone i s 0 freshwater dominated including station 2p01 2p03 and p05a inner estuary zone zone ii 0 s 20 freshwater and seawater mixing zone covering station a01 2a04 2a06 a08b and f301 and seawater dominated outer estuary zone iii s 20 f101 a11 and f501 the bottom depth of the sampling stations ranged from 5 m to 21 m table s1 we classified inner and outer estuary stations by using salinity rather than geographic location since salinity is a critical physiological determinant for microbes and the isopleth of salinity migrates over time due to the amount of freshwater discharge tidal height and in estuary circulation 2 2 water

were added separately to the pc bottles the amount of addition was constrained based on the reported relations between salinity and din concentrations harrison et al 2008 the final concentration range of 15nh4 15no2 15no3 was 0 05 10 μm 0 1 5 μm and 0 13 10 μm respectively and the corresponding ratios of 15n addition to ambient substrate were 5 59 5 3 7 44 7 and 1 35 7 respectively for nh4 no2 no3 table s2 according to concentrations measured back to laboratory for each 4 l bottle 400 ml of the sample was filtered immediately after tracer addition through 47 mm pre combusted whatman gf f filters and filters were preserved as the initial point t0 samples for uptake rate calculation another 50 ml of water from the 15nh4 addition bottle was filtered through a 0 22 μm disposable syringe filter and the filtrate was collected into a 50 ml centrifuge tube as the t0 of ao collected samples were frozen at 20 c until the laboratory analysis the remaining water in each 4 l bottle was distributed evenly into four 500 ml pc bottles to perform incubations of which two for light and two for dark incubations during the cruise period the daily average surface par spar was 8 0 61 1

of pre varied from 1 2 m in the upstream of humen to 4 m in the outer estuary during summertime liu et al 2017 given the microorganisms were transported up and down in the waterbody due to turbulent mixing li et al 2020 50 spar is assumed to represent the mean light exposure for the surface sample collected at 2 m deep for the bottom samples 50 spar is also used for light treatment to explore the light effect for the paralleled dark incubation bottles were covered by aluminum foil to prevent light after 3 6 h incubation the samples were terminated following the protocol of t0 samples to collect filters and filtrate additionally for station p05a and a01 time series incubations t0 t1 t2 t3 within 12 h and 24 h were conducted respectively to examine the precision of rate measures

results in fig s2 2 4 rate estimate the n isotope δ15n in nox no3 no2 the end product of ao was determined using the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 nox was quantitatively converted to n2o by denitrifier bacteria atcc 13985 and then determined for its isotopic composition by using a gasbench ii thermo fisher connected to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo delta v advantage δ15n values of samples were calibrated using international nitrate isotope reference materials δ15nusgs34 1 80 δ15niaea n3 4 70 δ15nusgs32 180 00 for the product of n uptake pn samples were oxidized to nitrate by using potassium persulfate first then using the denitrifier method to measure indirectly δ15npn n transformation rates including oxidation ao and uptake au niu and nau were determined from the increment of 15n in the product pool during the incubation interval using the eq 1 1 v r t p t r 0 p 0 t 14 n 15 n where v represents the n transformation rate nm h 1 rt and r0 stand for 15n atom of the product pool e g nox for ammonia oxidation and pn for uptake at the end and the start of incubation respectively pt and p0 are the concentration of product pools at the end and the start of incubation t is for the incubation time period 14n and 15n represent the final concentrations of 14n and 15n in substrates nh4 no2 no3 in the beginning after tracer addition respectively the 15n increment in product pool i e δ15nox and δ15n pn increased linearly within 24 h time course incubations after adding 15nh4 15no2 and 15no3 fig s2 such linearity suggests that rates remain constant at least within the first 12 h time course incubations and the dilution effect of nh4 regeneration is thus negligible during the linear reaction time interval xu et al 2017 therefore in this case we focused on the first 6 hours and introduced instantaneous rate expressed on an hourly basis leaving the bias from regeneration uncounted the daily surface rates were integrated by using light plus dark rates 12 12 hours while the daily rates of the bottom sample were calculated by using instant dark rates multiplying by 24 hours since the bottom samples were considered without light exposure due to rapid light attenuation in the water column liu et al 2017 in this study we do not calculate water column integrated rate 2 5 nitrogen preference index and din turnover as phytoplankton may utilize multiple n forms simultaneously to fuel their growth the relative n preference index rpi was introduced to examine which n species is preferred according to the equation put forward by mccarthy et al 1977 as follows 2 r p i x v x v nh 4 v no 2 v no 3 x nh 4 no 2 no 3 where rpix is the preference index for substrate x vx μm d 1 and x μm are the daily uptake rate of substrate x and the concentration of substrate x respectively the value of rpi indicates the degree of preference for a specific substrate i e when rpi lower than 1 suggests that phytoplankton prefers other forms of n rather than x mccarthy et al 1977 based on the summed consumption rates and the corresponding substrate n pool size the lifetime of the specific n pool can be estimated using the following equation 3 t x x v x stands for the concentration of x v μm d 1 represents the daily total consumption rate of x tx day is the lifetime time for complete consumption of the specific nitrogen x for example the lifetime of nh4 pool was estimated according to the summarized daily rates of ao and au while the lifetime of nitrite and nitrate were obtained based on the concentration of nitrite and nitrate divided respectively by their corresponding daily uptake rates 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of environmental parameters temperature salinity concentrations of nh4 no3 no2 pn chl a and tsm were plotted against the stations in a seaward direction fig 2 and against salinity fig s1 the salinity ranged from 0 to 30 and the salinity of stations upstream of humen was 0 the salinity increased up to 30 due to mixing with seawater furthermore the salinity in the bottom layer was higher than the values in the surface depths due to seawater bottom intrusion fig 2a the temperature showed no obvious difference both in the vertical surface and bottom depths and horizontal distributions except in zone iii where the bottom layer temperature was significantly lower than the surface fig 2b all din species show an overall downstream decreasing pattern as salinity increases fig s1a c from upstream to the downstream outer estuary fig 2c e ammonium was the dominant din species 65 for freshwater stations yet in zone i nh4 dropped rapidly from 183 3 at very upstream to 30 μm at around humen in the inner and outer estuary nh4 remained low to a few μm even below the detection limit at some stations fig 2c and fig s1a in contrast to ammonium no2 increased first in zone i from 12 7 μm to the highest concentration of 21 6 μm at around humen and then remained at 6 μm in zone ii and decreased to 2 0 5 μm in zone iii fig 2d and fig s1b nitrate displayed a similar horizontal pattern to nitrite i e increased from 84 7 to 137 5 μm inside zone i and remained at 84 30 μm in zone ii and then decreased to 11 2 9 1 μm in zone iii fig 2e and fig s1c in downstream of humen no3 became the dominant din species accounting for as high as 95 of din pool table s2 moreover no3 concentrations in the surface layers were higher than in the bottom for all stations except the station of p05a fig 2e and table s2 while no notable variation between nh4 and no2 was observed vertically fig 2c and d pn concentration was relatively high 12 5 25 6 μm upstream of humen and then decreased downstream showing a seaward decreasing pattern fig 2f and fig s1d the horizontal distribution of chl a was similar to that of pn which was high 19 7 35 5 μg l 1 in humen upstream and decreased seaward fig 2g and fig s1e both chl a and pn showed high values in zone i and relatively high values in zone iii with the highest value appearing at a11 station at the salinity of 28 fig s1d and e which corresponds to significant drops of nitrate and nitrite further in zone iii the highest values of pn and chl a for individual stations appeared in the surface fig 2f and g suggesting the presence of an actively growing phytoplankton community adapted to higher salinity the tsm ranged from 7 7 112 3 mg l 1 with a seaward declining trend fig 2h and fig s1f the distribution of tsm was relatively scattered and the value in the bottom was higher than that in the surface for nearly all the stations fig 2h likely due to resuspension 3 2 ammonia oxidation both the instant rates of ao in light l and in dark d incubation broadly decreased from zone i l 52 0 270 6 nm h 1 d 224

were lower than those in dark fig 3a consistent with previous reports xu et al 2019 revealing that ao rates were inhibited by light with strong diel rhythm additionally the instant ao rates were higher in bottom than in the surface fig 3a also reflecting a preferable niche for nitrifier in bottom water combining results from light and dark situations we obtained ao rate on daily basis which showed a seaward decreasing pattern dotted line in fig 3a daily ao rates were larger in zone i 3 7 18 2 μm d 1 than in zone ii 0 2 6 3 μm d 1 and zone iii 0 0 95 μm d 1 fig 3a and the rates dropped rapidly as salinity increased fig s3b 3 3 din uptake rates resembling ao s horizontal distribution pattern the au rates in both light and dark incubation were higher in zone i l 512 2 794 2 nm h 1 d

s3c on daily basis au 0 3 13 0 μm d 1 figs 3b and s3d were in the same magnitude as ao 0 18 2 μm d 1 the estuary zone decreasing pattern remains for au daily rates showing high values in zone i 4 4 13 0 μm d 1 and decreased seaward with the lower values fluctuating between 0 3 μm d 1 and 3 7 μm d 1 in estuary zone figs 3b and s3d the rates of niu in both light and dark incubation increased from zone i l 0 8 2 2 nm h 1 d 0 4 0 8 nm h 1 to zone ii l 0 5 46 8 nm h 1 d 0 1 2 6 nm h 1 and zone iii l 5 4 70 3 nm h 1 d 1 0 61 1 nm h 1 differing from the patterns of ao and au the rates of niu at all the stations were lower than 100 nm h 1 figs 3c and s3e similar to au s light response all the rates of niu were higher in light than those in dark figs 3c and s3e the daily niu rates 0 003 1 58 μm d

rates were increasing seaward with lower rates in humen upstream 0 01 0 03 μm d 1 and up to 1 58 μm d 1 in downstream outer estuary at the salinity of 27 fig s3f the nau rates in both light and dark incubation increased from zone i l 10 2 47 1 nm h 1 d 0 5 12 4 nm h 1 to zone ii l 1 2 291 6 nm h 1 d 0 8 23 1 nm h 1 and zone iii l 7 7 514 6 nm h 1 d 0 3 79 6 nm h 1 figs 3d and s3g resembling the niu s distribution pattern meanwhile the nau rates in light incubation showed a clear vertical pattern with surface bottom except the station of f301 for every individual sample nau was higher in light than in dark fig 3d the daily nau varied in the same magnitude of daily au however showing an opposite downstream pattern daily nau increased from undetectable in humen upstream to the maximum value 7 1 μm d 1 in the outer estuary at the salinity of 27 fig s3h the daily nau rates in the surface were significantly higher than the rates in the bottom fig 3d for one way anova p 0 038 0 05 the peak of daily nau and daily niu appeared at the same station f501 in the outer estuary fig 3e and d 4 discussion 4 1 multiple n transformation pathways and associated factors in the pre the most notable horizontal feature of n cycling processes is the high ao and au in upstream zone i and the high niu and nau in the estuary zone zone iii similarly we found a gradual shift from relatively high nh4 fraction of total din concentration in the upstream to relatively high no3 fraction in the estuary area table s2 since substrates are one of the key factors influencing rates the high concentration of nh4 from sewage discharge in the zone i harrison et al 2008 probably play a role in determining such a high ao and au rate fig 4a and b however no statistically significant correlation was found between daily ao and au and nh4 in zone i table s3 which may be resulted from multiple sources with different ammonium concentrations upstream of humen where regional treated wastewater may provide variable ammonium discharges to alter the correlation xu et al 2008 furthermore other factors like nitrifier phytoplankton biomass tsm and light may also mask the linear substrate dependent relationship nevertheless in the estuary zone where nh4 was lower daily ao but not au was positively correlated with nh4 concentrations table s3 such positive correlation still exists for ao for samples from different depths in estuary after diel integration light and dark implying the ever present niche span of nitrifier in the whole water column on the other hand the increasing phytoplankton preference for nitrate and nitrite though less than ammonium toward downstream fig 5c occurred accompanying with nitrate and nitrite supply originated either from upstream due to longer nitrate and nitrite life time or from ao derived nox the positive correlation between niu nau and chl a and daily nau with pn probably suggest phytoplankton relies on nox for growth then leaving niche space for ao to use nh4 in the estuary smith et al 2014 xu et al 2019 for nau and niu however high no3 and no2 in zone i did not correspond to high nau and niu which may be explained by the theory of high ammonium inhibition on nitrate uptake dugdale et al 2007 glibert et al 2016 however the niu and nau were detectable once nh4 was below 4 μm fig 4 c and d supporting the inhibition threshold of 1 4 μm for nitrate uptake glibert et al 2016 to some extent and nox sourced from upstream may also support estuarine phytoplankton growth as discussed above additionally the shift of phytoplankton abundance and community composition from zone i to zone iii huang et al 2004 may also act as a factor to determine the horizonal pattern of din uptake tsm is also a determinant of ao hsiao et al 2014 and photosynthesis harrison et al 2008 a positive correlation between ao and tsm in the estuary zone was observed table s3 at low ammonium concentration particles not only act as a carrier for ammonia oxidizer but enriched organics on particle surface may also offer remineralized ammonium to fuel ao such positive relationships between ao and tsm were reported also in other estuarine regions berounsky and nixon 1993 hsiao et al 2014 in fact tsm affects the light availability and indirectly exerts influence on phytoplankton harrison et al 2008 and further influences the din uptake although no relation was observed between din uptake and tsm in this study table s3 besides substrate and tsm light is the primary factor showing a profound effect on ao as well the effect of light on ammonia oxidation rates in the open ocean and coastal water had been studied for decades smith et al 2014 xu et al 2019 in this study all the ratios of ao rates in light to dark aol d were 1 with most aol d values 0 5 fig 3e suggesting light inhibited ao supportive of previous studies lipschultz et al 1985 xu et al 2019 and light suppression on ao rates were 50 considering the high level of nh4 in the upstream of pre the light effect on ao was probably due to direct light inhibition on nitrifier activities while at low nh4 concentrations downstream the competition for nh4 from phytoplankton may aid in the light effect smith et al 2014 furthermore our ao rates in the bottom water were higher than that in the surface fig 3a further supporting photo inhibition different from the oxidation pathway by nitrifiers din uptake pathways were stimulated by light the light dark ratios of all assimilation aul d niul d and naul d were 1 fig 3f h consistent with previous studies like the case in the neuse river estuary boyer et al 1994 and the gulf of aqaba red sea mackey et al 2011 which suggests phytoplankton not heterotrophic bacteria contributes to din uptake generally the values of naul d 12 01 7 78 were much higher than niu and au 2 50 0 86 indicating nitrate uptake is more energy consuming than nitrite and ammonium our observations are supported by previous phytoplankton physiological studies the step of nitrate reduction into nitrite and further to nh4 requires a reductant either nadh or nadph and its supplement is directly regulated by light syrett 1981 thus nitrate reductase appeared to be activated by light during the nitrate uptake process vincent 1992 4 2 competition for nh4 and uptake preference of various din species ao and au were two distinct pathways to consume ammonium although au 0 3 13 0 μm d 1 were in the same magnitude as ao 0 18 2 μm d 1 on a daily basis the ratios of au ao varied up to four orders of magnitude and all au ao in the light were higher than those in dark regardless of surface or bottom water fig s4a and b indicating nitrifiers are poorer competitors for nh4 than phytoplankton upon light exposure under the dark almost all au ao values were 1 in the freshwater and inner estuary zones where waterbody is more turbid compared to that in outer estuary suggesting nitrifier is likely to outcompete phytoplankton when light is diminished fig s4a and b the results of phytoplankton and nitrifiers on site competition would modulate the biogeochemistry elsewhere downstream for example phytoplankton wins to generate oxygen on site however the decomposition of phytoplankton produced organics may consume oxygen consequently elsewhere during particle settling down or transport the nitrifiers win to consume oxygen and the nitrification produced nitrate may be respired by denitrifier or utilized by downstream phytoplankton for growth again thus understanding the niche partition and competition in space between phytoplankton and nitrifier is critical according to previous studies and our light dark experiments the niche boundary should vary in depth with phytoplankton in the euphotic zone while nitrifier below the depth light cannot penetrate thus the size of niche space will be determined by light penetration and water depth that is the niche space for nitrifiers may expand as the water depth increases downstream although we did not measure light profiles the shallow water transparency in summer liu et al 2017 suggested that nitrifiers may have a larger space in the water column relative to phytoplankton the reported water transparency in pre showed that the deepest euphotic depth appeared in spring while shallowest in summer revealing a notable seasonal variation liu et al 2017 reasonably the niche partition the competition between nitrifier and phytoplankton and ao and au associated oxygen flows would exhibit seasonal variations the fractional contribution of au nau and niu to total din uptake on the basis of daily rates for surface and bottom water were calculated in the surface au daily rates contributed 91 of din daily uptake in the freshwater zone above humen fig 5 a similar to the study in the monterey bay where 94 of the din uptake was contributed by ammonium bronk and ward 1999 the positive correlation of au against pn concentration in the freshwater zone table s3 is also consistent with the predominance of nh4 uptake contributing to pn as the concentration of ammonium decreased sharply downstream of humen surface nitrate uptake rates increased seaward and its contribution reached up to 81 fig 5a while in the bottom layers au was dominant in general 92 6 7 much higher than nau 0 6 14 of din uptake fig 5b which is due to limited light in the bottom layer among din uptake rates the contribution of niu 13 fig 5a and b was the lowest regardless of stations and depths similar to the results in the gulf of aqaba mackey et al 2011 the values of rpinh4 were always 1 1 5 125 2 with an average of 29 consistent with the dominant au contribution to bulk din uptake rate while rpino3 was 1 0 01 to 0 92 for all stations in this study fig 5c and d indicating that phytoplankton always prefer nh4 over nitrate syrett 1981 the results are consistent with the studies in the cook strait and loire estuary that the values of rpino3 were less than one priscu and downes 1985 middelburg and nieuwenhuize 2000 although the values of rpino3 were 1 a gradually increasing pattern for rpino3 i e from 0 1 in humen upstream increased to close to one in the outer estuary accompanied by rpinh4 decreasing fig 5c and d indicating that nitrate was less preferred but still utilized to fulfill phytoplankton growth in estuary zone when nitrate was a dominant din species nau positively relates to both chl a and pn in the inner and outer estuary zone p 0 01 table s3 indicating nau may greatly contribute to pn rpino2 were 1 also indicated nitrite was less preferred by phytoplankton although presumably niu is toxic and more energetically costly relative to au lomas and lipschultz 2006 we noticed that rpino2 was larger than rpino3 in most cases fig 5c and d showing nitrite was still preferred relative to nitrate due to physiologically less energy requirement for niu than nau but nitrite uptake rates were lower than nitrate uptake rates in our study probably because of the high no3 concentration to be accessed previous investigations in the pre showed that the phytoplankton community shifted from freshwater diatoms zone i into estuarine diatoms zone ii iii zhang et al 2014 or into pico size phytoplankton zone iii chai et al 2016 such community shift might be caused by salinity or multiple environmental factors nevertheless such shift explains the observed downstream rpi variations and highlights the in estuary n dynamics may modulate n speciation to feed different phytoplankton 4 3 lifetime of the din pool the lifetime of nh4 ranged from 0 1 to 17 9 days with most of the values 2 days except the station of 2p01 at very upstream fig 5e and f such short lifetimes suggested ammonium pools of most stations in the pre were completely consumed within several hours to 2 days which is comparable to the jiulong river estuary yan et al 2019 the water residence time of pre ranged from 2 to 15 days in summer li et al 2020 much longer than the lifetime of nh4 leading to a significant feature of ammonium removal fig s1a obviously nh4 was transferred into particulate organic form or nitrate before reaching the coastline to influence the biogeochemical habitat of coastal microbes in fact a previous pre study suggested that organics sedimentation induced nitrification coupled with denitrification plays a major role to alleviate n pollution tan et al 2019 thus diel regulation on the two distinctive nh4 pathways may stimulate the sedimentary denitrification downstream via offering organics and nitrate simultaneously to mitigate the external nh4 input previous study also showed that in dry season with lower discharge din concentrations especially nh4 were much higher in the upper estuary harrison et al 2008 obviously the related ao and din uptake rates in dry season may increase as the water residence time increases in dry season all parameters and associated n processes will change accordingly e g light penetration depth lifetime of various n species the partition of niche space for phytoplankton and nitrifiers etc therefore more studies are needed to explore n transformations and associated biogeochemistry for different seasons nevertheless light exerts a profound effect on n dynamics in the estuary and diel regulation must be considered to accurately assess the role of multiple n species in estuarine and coastal biogeochemical cycles the lifetimes of nitrite and nitrate were much longer than that of nh4 up to thousands of days fig 5e and f resulting in the apparent conservative behavior for no2 and no3 fig s1b and c such conservative behavior was partly due to nh4 inhibition on daytime nitrate uptake and partly due to supply via ammonia oxidation in the nighttime as we did not measure nitrite oxidation rates the lifetime of nitrite may be slightly overestimated nevertheless the lifetime of both nitrite and nitrate were decreasing seaward with a significant drop to a few days at the outer estuary fig 5e and f where chl a peaked and pn enhanced significantly salinity 28 fig s1d and e in fact previous studies in changjiang plume tseng et al 2014 and pre li et al 2020 also showed more stagnant environments for phytoplankton growth in the frontal zone with salinity 26 28 which may cause the accumulation of phytoplankton and thus significant drawdown of turn over time for nitrate and nitrite 4 4 oxygen dynamics driven by din associated processes high anthropogenic nh4 and no3 inputs and their transformations in the estuary are of increasing concern not only due to their potential contribution to oxygen consumption but also the possible contribution to hypoxia in the outer estuary qian et al 2022 as mentioned earlier integrating the rate for entire water column is not feasible we discussed oxygen dynamics driven by din related transformations only via daily rates obtained from the surface and bottom layer during complete nitrification oxygen is consumed according to ward 2011 4 n h 3 2 o 2 no 3 h 2 o h thus the daily oxygen consumption rates of nitrifier were calculated to be 0 001 36 42 μm d 1 and 0 31 23 75 μm d 1 in the surface and bottom layers respectively with higher consumption in the zone 1 and lower in the outer estuary fig 6 a although external input of ammonium consumes oxygen via oxidation a significant portion of this external source also contributes to oxygen production either directly via au or indirectly via niu or nau uptake of the products of nitrification the equations of synthesis of organic matter by uptake of ammonium 5 and nitrate 6 as nitrogen source gruber 2008 were as follows as nitrite was an intermediary product of nitrate assimilation according to the equation of nitrate uptake we can derive the eq 7 as below 5 106 c o 2 16 nh 4 hpo 4 2 48 h 2 o 14 o h c 106 h 175 o 42 n 16 p 118 o 2 6 106 c o 2 16 no 3 hpo 4 2 78 h 2 o 18 h c 106 h 175 o 42 n 16 p 150 o 2 7 106 c o 2 16 no 2 hpo 4 2 78 h 2 o 18 h c 106 h 175 o 42 n 16 p 142 o 2 thus 16 mol nh4 no3 and no2 uptake by phytoplankton will produce 118 150 and 142 mol o2 respectively the total oxygen production vis din uptake was 7 8 104 7 μm d 1 in the surface higher than in the bottom depth 2 4 37 9 μm d 1 fig 6a the estimated daily net o2 production derived from the discrepancy between daily ao induced o2 consumption and daily din uptake induced o2 production was 3 5 104 7 μm d 1 for the surface and 5 0 25 4 μm d 1 for the bottom layer fig 6b and nearly all the samples from the surface and bottom layers showed net oxygen production counterintuitively although external nh4 input was high in the zone i the two contrasting nh4 consumption processes resulted in a net o2 production on daily basis overall speaking high au induced by external nh4 input generates oxygen in upstream yet the freshly produced particulate organic matter may consume oxygen to simulate hypoxia in downstream the high preference for nh4 combined with diel rhythm and low light penetration nitrate and nitrite are allowed to behave conservatively and be transported farther downstream for microbial utilization in downstream the delivered nitrate nitrite can produce oxygen via photosynthesis in euphotic zone meanwhile they can act as electron acceptor nitrate respiration similar to oxygen below the euphotic zone although the turbulence makes the water depth integration of oxygen fluxes impossible for the pre estuary our case study of multiple n transformation processes revealed 1 the effect of light and diel cycle on the correlation between oxygen and various n transformation pathways and 2 a tight linkage between upstream and downstream n processes and their association with oxygen conclusion this study was the first to measure daily oxidation and uptake rates of dissolved inorganic nitrogen by considering the effect of light in the pre the rates of ao and au were of similar magnitude and both of them showed a seaward decreasing pattern while nau and niu increased seaward light inhibits ao while stimulate din uptake significantly overall our results showed pre has two different biogeochemical regimes an upstream region with high nh4 consumption zone i and a downstream outer estuary dominated by no3 consumption zone iii fig 7 ao and au were the dominant n transformation processes in the upstream which is heavily affected by external ammonium input counterintuitively although external nh4 input was high in zone i the two contrasting nh4 consumption processes resulted in a net o2 production rather than consumption on daily basis for most stations both ao and au were sufficiently high to completely consume ammonium within 2 days thus before reaching the coastline nh4 was transferred 1 into particulate organic form to enhance the coupling of nitrification and denitrification in sediment to alleviate n pollution or 2 into nitrate to be transported downstream contributing to phytoplankton bloom and nitrate respiration the high preference of nh4 for phytoplankton allows no2 and no3 to maintain conservative behavior during mixing inside estuary and to travel farther downstream to fuel phytoplankton growth at zone iii to form the no3 utilization hotpot overall our study highlights 1 the importance of light on n dynamics 2 the high external nh4 input would not necessarily cause oxygen consumption on daily basis 3 nh4 was transformed rapidly into pn which is highly likely a driver for bottom water hypoxia in the outer estuary 4 assimilation preference for ammonium allows nitrate influx from upstream catchment to reach the coastal zone for phytoplankton bloom in the future pre as the land use changes and sewage treatment technology improves the n species and concentrations carried by freshwater discharge may vary concomitantly to change the current state of the association between n transformation and oxygen declaration of competing interest
