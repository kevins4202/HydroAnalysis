1215,design of low cost and high removal efficiency phosphate adsorbents is of great significance for the control of eutrophication in this study fly ash and metakaolin were used as raw materials to evaluate the capability of phosphate adsorption and to investigate the mechanism of phosphate adsorption the results of comparing the adsorption effect of geopolymers prepared with different modulus of alkali activator showed that the removal efficiency of phosphate in water at 0 8 m was on average 30 33 higher than 1 2 m therefore fa mk 0 8 had the maximum removal efficiency of 94 21 for phosphate in water with the maximum adsorption capacity of 36 02 mg kg in addition the adsorption of phosphate could be well fitted by pseudo second order model and the process was mainly controlled by film diffusion the alkali activation process can destroy the octahedral structure of the raw material so the geopolymer are mainly tetrahedral in structure interestingly new zeolite structures were formed in the mineral crystal phase of fa mk 0 8 which may facilitate the adsorption of phosphate by geopolymers furthermore the combined ftir and xrd analysis results indicated that the underlying mechanisms of phosphate adsorption were electrostatic gravitation ligand exchange and surface complexation this research not only synthesizes low cost and high removal efficiency wastewater

continuous accumulation of phosphate in the water causes overgrowth of aquatic plants and phytoplankton he et al 2016 when the phosphate content in water exceeds 20 mg m3 omwene and kobya 2018 it will

min the 0 10 g sample was added to 25 0 ml phosphate solution of 50 0 mg l which was prepared from potassium dihydrogen phosphate low ph favors adsorption due to the coupling of anion adsorption and hydroxyl anion release the optimal ph for phosphate adsorption is between 3 0 and 5 0 yan et al 2010 so the initial ph of phosphate is set to 4 0 in this study the adsorption time was controlled from 5 to 600 min for exploring the adsorption kinetics to study isothermal adsorption the initial concentrations of phosphate were set from 20 0 to 300 mg l and shaken for 400 min to reach adsorption equilibrium the adsorption effect of each treatment was investigated at different modulus of alkali activator with a phosphate concentrations of 100 mg l the phosphate concentrations were determined by icp aes agilent usa the adsorption ratio ar and the adsorption capacity qe mg kg of phosphate at equilibrium were calculated using eq 1 and eq 2 1 ar c 0 c c 0 100 2 q e v c 0 c e m where c0 mg l

models to fit isothermal sorption curve data the langmuir model assumes a monolayer adsorption of the adsorbent mass on the adsorbent surface expressed in a linear form as eq 3 langmuir 1916 the dimensionless constant separation factor rl in the model was calculated using eq 4 the freundlich isothermal adsorption model assumes that the adsorbent undergoes multilayer adsorption on a nonuniform

linear plot of qt versus t1 2 does not pass through the origin the adsorption is governed by the combination of intra particle diffusion and film diffusion he et al 2017 3 result and discussion 3 1 optimization of modulus of alkali activator exploring the effect of different alkali activator modulus on phosphate adsorption by geopolymers the results are shown in fig 1 a the adsorption effect of geopolymers at 0 8 m is better than that at 1 2 m the adsorption efficiencies of fa 0 8 mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8 increase by 57 65 21 95 and 11 40 compare with fa 1 2 mk 1 2 and fa mk 1 2 respectively the geopolymer mixed with fa and mk shows the best adsorption effect on phosphate and the adsorption effect at 0 8 m is still better than that at 1 2 m the phosphate removal efficiency of fa mk 0 8 reached 94 21 higher modulus can increase the mechanical strength of geopolymers and enhance the solubility xu and van deventer 2000 so the mechanical properties of the geopolymer prepared at 1 2 m are optimized but this also will reduce the porosity of the material and difficult to obtain the best adsorption effect gao et al 2014 the lower modulus encourages the early solidification of the geopolymer rahier et al 1997 which makes the surface of adsorbent material rougher and increases the adsorption sites thus promoting the phosphate adsorption therefore in order to obtain the highest phosphate removal efficiency in water the geopolymer prepared with fly ash and metakaolin as raw materials should be selected 0 8 m as the best preparation process parameter 3 2 adsorption isotherms the initial concentrations of phosphate are set in the range of 20 300 mg l the adsorption isotherms and fitting results are shown in fig 1 b the isothermal curve parameters are shown in table 4 the freundlich model can well fit the isothermal curve of fa 0 8 with an r2 of 0 958 which indicates the adsorption of phosphate by fa 0 8 is a heterogeneous multilayer adsorption mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8 are more suitable to be fitted by the langmuir model with r2 of 0 981 and 0 974 hence there is no interaction between the adsorbed molecules and the adsorption behavior of phosphate onto the mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8 could be described as a monolayer adsorption ge et al 2015 from the langmuir model mk 0 8 has the maximum adsorption of phosphate with 32 09 mg g which is more consistent with the actual experimental results 32 53 mg g however the actual experimental data showed that it was fa mk 0 8 having the maximum adsorption with 36 02 mg g this is due to the bias caused by the slightly lower fitting accuracy of fa mk 0 8 than mk 0 8 in the langmuir model r2 fa mk 0 8 0 974 r2 mk 0 8 0 981 the lower rl value indicates a stronger affinity balouch et al 2013 memon et al 2008 the rl values of mk 0 8 0 0138 0 1732 and fa mk 0 8 0 0117 0 1507 are closer to 0 thus they reached a higher phosphate adsorption compared with the adsorbent materials in previous studies the geopolymers prepared in this study showed good adsorption effects especially for fa mk 0 8 but the adsorption effect of fa 0 8 is not satisfactory table 3 the addition of mk can improve the adsorption of phosphate by geopolymers therefore fa mk 0 8 is considered a very promising adsorbent 3 3 adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order kinetic model pseudo second order kinetic model elovich and intra particle diffusion model are fitted and the adsorption kinetic data are analyzed the nonlinear fit plots are shown in fig 1 c the linear fit of the intra particle diffusion model is shown in fig 1 d and the kinetic model parameters are shown in table 4 the results show that fa 0 8 has the best fit in the elovich model r2 0 89 which indicates that the chemisorption between phosphate and fa 0 8 is by valence forces through electron sharing or exchange choi et al 2016 li et al 2017 mk 0 8 gives the best fit in the pseudo first order kinetic model r2 0 97 while fa mk 0 8 is better fitted in the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 99 the fitting results conclude that the adsorption of phosphate with mk 0 8 is dominated by physical adsorption while fa mk 0 8 is dominated by chemisorption asaoka et al 2021 to further elaborate the diffusion mechanism the adsorption kinetic data are fitted and analyzed using the intra particle diffusion model as shown in fig 1 d the process of phosphate adsorption by geopolymers can be divided into two stages the first stage is the rapid phosphate adsorption stage after which the adsorption equilibrium stage is reached the straight line does not pass through the origin which indicates that film diffusion is the dominant diffusion mechanism in the first stage ajmal et al 2018 lalley et al 2016 this stage is due to the rapid transport of phosphate to the outer surface of geopolymers by film diffusion instantly occupying most of the available surface sites the adsorption process occurs rapidly the adsorption rates of each geopolymers differed in the first stage higher ki1 values represent faster adsorption of phosphate onto the surface of geopolymers and the shorter time required to reach adsorption equilibrium when the active sites on the outer surface are completely occupied by phosphate the diffusion rate of the particles gradually slows down therefore the diffusion rate constant ki1 is much larger in the first adsorption stage than in the second stage ki2 the slope of the intra particle diffusion model is approximately zero in the second stage which indicates that the adsorption equilibrium has been reached 3 4 characterization of geopolymers 3 4 1 sem analysis the sem micrographs of fa raw raw material fa 0 8 fa 0 8p after phosphate adsorption mk raw mk 0 8 mk 0 8p fa mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8p and eds images of fa 0 8p mk 0 8p fa mk 0 8p are shown in fig 2 the surface of fa raw is smooth and has a more regular shape with circular pores and channels while the surface of mk raw has a clear layer peeling phenomenon with large number of layers stacked to form a block structure the apparent morphology of two materials is completely different after treatment with 0 8 m fa raw dissolves under alkaline conditions the regular shape of the material is dispersed the granularity is enhanced the surface becomes obviously rough and the small round shaped pores become more irregular the mk 0 8 surface also has more particulate matter but the overall laminar structure of the material is not broken after the alkali activation treatment the rough surface can increase the specific surface area of geopolymers he et al 2017 resulting in more adsorption active sites on the outer surface and in the inner pores of the material which may facilitate the adsorption of phosphate lin et al 2018 the surface particles of fa mk 0 8 are amorphous agglomerates indicating that fa and mk dissolve under alkaline conditions 3 4 2 ftir analysis within 4000 400 cm 1 fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of fa raw fa 0 8 fa 0 8p mk raw mk 0 8 mk 0 8p fa mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8p all samples have common characteristic absorption peaks in 3445 3448 cm 1 and 1634 1649 cm 1 which belong to the stretching vibrations of oh and ch2 respectively this is due to the adsorption of water molecules on the surface of the geopolymer or in the internal macropores luo et al 2019 the weaker absorption peaks near 1435 and 1385 cm 1 are due to the vibrational stretching of o c o bonds this represents the presence of sodium carbonate probably due to the carbonation reaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the surface of geopolymers lee and van deventer 2002 li et al 2012 the absorption peaks at 1076 and 1090 cm 1 are due to the asymmetric stretching vibration of si al o si in the raw material barbosa and mackenzie 2003 the material undergoes a condensation of sio and alo during the activation process and the characteristic peaks at 1076 and 1090 cm 1 are shifted to lower frequencies 1024 1013 and 1009 cm 1 respectively this indicates that after the alkali activation process the bonds of si al o are elongated the bond angles are reduced and the molecular vibrational force constants are decreased chen et al 2018 this conversion is due to the increase in the silicon fraction associated with non bridging oxygen atoms therefore the movement of the si al o stretching band indicates the formation of the geopolymer structure comparing different geopolymers it is found that fa mk 0 8 has the lowest frequency of si al o si characteristic peaks the characteristic peaks of fa and mk at 800 and 799 cm 1 represent the asymmetric stretching of alo after the alkali activation treatment the characteristic peak of fa 0 8 moves to 777 cm 1 and the characteristic peak of mk 0 8 at 799 cm 1 disappeared however a new characteristic peak appears at 714 cm 1 which could be a characteristic peak of silicon oxygen tetrahedral or aluminum oxygen octahedral structure fernandez jimenez and palomo 2005 the characteristic peak appearing at 746 cm 1 in fa mk 0 8 represents the stretching vibration of si al o si in the tetrahedral structure the shift of the characteristic peaks indicates that the octahedral structures in fa and mk may have decomposed after the alkali activation treatment so the tetrahedral structures are mainly dominant in the geopolymers in addition the adsorption intensity of peak at 569 557 and 561 cm 1 alo in fa 0 8p mk 0 8p and fa mk 0 8p is weakened after adsorption which maybe the main reason for phosphate removal 3 4 3 xrd analysis the xrd reflectance spectra of mk raw mk 0 8 mk 0 8p fa 0 8 fa 0 8p fa mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8p are shown in fig 4 according to jade 6 5 obvious quartz pdf 85 0797 reflections are observed in all geopolymers quartz is also the main constituent of the lamellar and bulk structures for geopolymers in sem the minerals in mk 0 8 are mainly aluminum silicate pdf 86 1406 while the minerals in fa 0 8 are dominated by mullite pdf 83 1881 it is worth noting the appearance of new zeolite pdf 79 0430 structures in the xrd reflectance spectra of fa mk 0 8 which is due to the geopolymer preparation process of alkali activation curing and heating when combined fly ash 75 wt and metakaolin 25 wt mixture for alkali activation and curing likewise obtained geopolymers containing zeolite structures de rossi et al 2019 the formation of zeolite structures can further increase the adsorption of phosphate by fa mk 0 8 the alkali activation treatment dissolved the material and the characteristic peaks of the aluminum silicate and mullite structures are significantly reduced while the presence of quartz does not affect the alkali activation process of the material heah et al 2012 zibouche et al 2009 after phosphate adsorption by geopolymers the reflection intensity of all characteristic peaks is reduced especially mk 0 8p and fa mk 0 8p this may be due to the phosphate adsorbed on the surface of the material resulting in the weakening of the reflection intensity in addition sem and eds images are able to demonstrate that phosphates are adsorbed on the surface of geopolymers 3 5 adsorption mechanisms phosphate ions can be adsorbed on clay minerals by electrostatic gravitation and ligand exchange xue et al 2009 moreover the structural hydroxyl groups present on the surface of geopolymers are able to exchange with phosphate ions to form complexes and this exchange process is accompanied by a rise in ph zong et al 2018 the ftir analysis results show that the alkali activation process destroys the mineral structure of the material so the positive charges present at the edges of the broken geopolymer can attract phosphate ions in the low ph solution the hydroxyl groups on the surface of materials are protonated which would be more favorable for the ligand exchange process yan et al 2010 the fitting results of the adsorption kinetics showed that the adsorption process of fa mk 0 8 on phosphate is chemisorption so that the si al o functional groups in the tetrahedral structure produce a chemical process of ligand exchange with phosphate ions the results of xrd analysis show the newly formed zeolite structure which would further increase the adsorption sites on the surface of the geopolymer and promote the adsorption process therefore it is reasonable to speculate that the process of phosphate adsorption on the surface of the geopolymer can be divided into two steps as follows 1 rapid transfer of phosphate ions in aqueous solution to the adsorption active site on the surface of geopolymers 2 ion exchange and complexation of phosphate ions at active sites and cross section of geopolymers fig 5 this reveals why geopolymers are such high efficiency in removing phosphate from water in the simplest way 4 conclusion using fly ash fa and metakaolin mk as precursors to synthesize geopolymers we investigated their adsorption performance on phosphate in water and explored the modulus of alkali activator in obtaining the highest removal efficiency moreover the potential adsorption mechanism of geopolymers on phosphate was investigated by adsorption model and spectral analysis overall the geopolymers prepared with fly ash and metakaolin as raw materials should be selected 0 8 m as the best preparation process parameter and the adsorption effect of geopolymers prepared under 0 8 m was all better than 1 2 m the fa mk 0 8 prepared in this study had the maximum removal efficiency of 94 21 for phosphate in water with a maximum adsorption capacity of 36 02 mg kg the alkali activation process destroyed the mineral structure of the material increased the adsorption sites on the surface of the geopolymer and accelerated phosphate adsorption process electrostatic gravitation ligand exchange and surface complexation were the main mechanisms for the high removal efficiency of phosphate by fa mk 0 8 a low cost and high efficiency geopolymers was prepared in this study which has a very

linear plot of qt versus t1 2 does not pass through the origin the adsorption is governed by the combination of intra particle diffusion and film diffusion he et al 2017 3 result and discussion 3 1 optimization of modulus of alkali activator exploring the effect of different alkali activator modulus on phosphate adsorption by geopolymers the results are shown in fig 1 a the adsorption effect of geopolymers at 0 8 m is better than that at 1 2 m the adsorption efficiencies of fa 0 8 mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8 increase by 57 65 21 95 and 11 40 compare with fa 1 2 mk 1 2 and fa mk 1 2 respectively the geopolymer mixed with fa and mk shows the best adsorption effect on phosphate and the adsorption effect at 0 8 m is still better than that at 1 2 m the phosphate removal efficiency of fa mk 0 8 reached 94 21 higher modulus can increase the mechanical strength of geopolymers and enhance the solubility xu and van deventer 2000 so the mechanical properties of the geopolymer prepared at 1 2 m are optimized but this also will reduce the porosity of the material and difficult to obtain the best adsorption effect gao et al 2014 the lower modulus encourages the early solidification of the geopolymer rahier et al 1997 which makes the surface of adsorbent material rougher and increases the adsorption sites thus promoting the phosphate adsorption therefore in order to obtain the highest phosphate removal efficiency in water the geopolymer prepared with fly ash and metakaolin as raw materials should be selected 0 8 m as the best preparation process parameter 3 2 adsorption isotherms the initial concentrations of phosphate are set in the range of 20 300 mg l the adsorption isotherms and fitting results are shown in fig 1 b the isothermal curve parameters are shown in table 4 the freundlich model can well fit the isothermal curve of fa 0 8 with an r2 of 0 958 which indicates the adsorption of phosphate by fa 0 8 is a heterogeneous multilayer adsorption mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8 are more suitable to be fitted by the langmuir model with r2 of 0 981 and 0 974 hence there is no interaction between the adsorbed molecules and the adsorption behavior of phosphate onto the mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8 could be described as a monolayer adsorption ge et al 2015 from the langmuir model mk 0 8 has the maximum adsorption of phosphate with 32 09 mg g which is more consistent with the actual experimental results 32 53 mg g however the actual experimental data showed that it was fa mk 0 8 having the maximum adsorption with 36 02 mg g this is due to the bias caused by the slightly lower fitting accuracy of fa mk 0 8 than mk 0 8 in the langmuir model r2 fa mk 0 8 0 974 r2 mk 0 8 0 981 the lower rl value indicates a stronger affinity balouch et al 2013 memon et al 2008 the rl values of mk 0 8 0 0138 0 1732 and fa mk 0 8 0 0117 0 1507 are closer to 0 thus they reached a higher phosphate adsorption compared with the adsorbent materials in previous studies the geopolymers prepared in this study showed good adsorption effects especially for fa mk 0 8 but the adsorption effect of fa 0 8 is not satisfactory table 3 the addition of mk can improve the adsorption of phosphate by geopolymers therefore fa mk 0 8 is considered a very promising adsorbent 3 3 adsorption kinetics the pseudo first order kinetic model pseudo second order kinetic model elovich and intra particle diffusion model are fitted and the adsorption kinetic data are analyzed the nonlinear fit plots are shown in fig 1 c the linear fit of the intra particle diffusion model is shown in fig 1 d and the kinetic model parameters are shown in table 4 the results show that fa 0 8 has the best fit in the elovich model r2 0 89 which indicates that the chemisorption between phosphate and fa 0 8 is by valence forces through electron sharing or exchange choi et al 2016 li et al 2017 mk 0 8 gives the best fit in the pseudo first order kinetic model r2 0 97 while fa mk 0 8 is better fitted in the pseudo second order kinetic model r2 0 99 the fitting results conclude that the adsorption of phosphate with mk 0 8 is dominated by physical adsorption while fa mk 0 8 is dominated by chemisorption asaoka et al 2021 to further elaborate the diffusion mechanism the adsorption kinetic data are fitted and analyzed using the intra particle diffusion model as shown in fig 1 d the process of phosphate adsorption by geopolymers can be divided into two stages the first stage is the rapid phosphate adsorption stage after which the adsorption equilibrium stage is reached the straight line does not pass through the origin which indicates that film diffusion is the dominant diffusion mechanism in the first stage ajmal et al 2018 lalley et al 2016 this stage is due to the rapid transport of phosphate to the outer surface of geopolymers by film diffusion instantly occupying most of the available surface sites the adsorption process occurs rapidly the adsorption rates of each geopolymers differed in the first stage higher ki1 values represent faster adsorption of phosphate onto the surface of geopolymers and the shorter time required to reach adsorption equilibrium when the active sites on the outer surface are completely occupied by phosphate the diffusion rate of the particles gradually slows down therefore the diffusion rate constant ki1 is much larger in the first adsorption stage than in the second stage ki2 the slope of the intra particle diffusion model is approximately zero in the second stage which indicates that the adsorption equilibrium has been reached 3 4 characterization of geopolymers 3 4 1 sem analysis the sem micrographs of fa raw raw material fa 0 8 fa 0 8p after phosphate adsorption mk raw mk 0 8 mk 0 8p fa mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8p and eds images of fa 0 8p mk 0 8p fa mk 0 8p are shown in fig 2 the surface of fa raw is smooth and has a more regular shape with circular pores and channels while the surface of mk raw has a clear layer peeling phenomenon with large number of layers stacked to form a block structure the apparent morphology of two materials is completely different after treatment with 0 8 m fa raw dissolves under alkaline conditions the regular shape of the material is dispersed the granularity is enhanced the surface becomes obviously rough and the small round shaped pores become more irregular the mk 0 8 surface also has more particulate matter but the overall laminar structure of the material is not broken after the alkali activation treatment the rough surface can increase the specific surface area of geopolymers he et al 2017 resulting in more adsorption active sites on the outer surface and in the inner pores of the material which may facilitate the adsorption of phosphate lin et al 2018 the surface particles of fa mk 0 8 are amorphous agglomerates indicating that fa and mk dissolve under alkaline conditions 3 4 2 ftir analysis within 4000 400 cm 1 fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of fa raw fa 0 8 fa 0 8p mk raw mk 0 8 mk 0 8p fa mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8p all samples have common characteristic absorption peaks in 3445 3448 cm 1 and 1634 1649 cm 1 which belong to the stretching vibrations of oh and ch2 respectively this is due to the adsorption of water molecules on the surface of the geopolymer or in the internal macropores luo et al 2019 the weaker absorption peaks near 1435 and 1385 cm 1 are due to the vibrational stretching of o c o bonds this represents the presence of sodium carbonate probably due to the carbonation reaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the surface of geopolymers lee and van deventer 2002 li et al 2012 the absorption peaks at 1076 and 1090 cm 1 are due to the asymmetric stretching vibration of si al o si in the raw material barbosa and mackenzie 2003 the material undergoes a condensation of sio and alo during the activation process and the characteristic peaks at 1076 and 1090 cm 1 are shifted to lower frequencies 1024 1013 and 1009 cm 1 respectively this indicates that after the alkali activation process the bonds of si al o are elongated the bond angles are reduced and the molecular vibrational force constants are decreased chen et al 2018 this conversion is due to the increase in the silicon fraction associated with non bridging oxygen atoms therefore the movement of the si al o stretching band indicates the formation of the geopolymer structure comparing different geopolymers it is found that fa mk 0 8 has the lowest frequency of si al o si characteristic peaks the characteristic peaks of fa and mk at 800 and 799 cm 1 represent the asymmetric stretching of alo after the alkali activation treatment the characteristic peak of fa 0 8 moves to 777 cm 1 and the characteristic peak of mk 0 8 at 799 cm 1 disappeared however a new characteristic peak appears at 714 cm 1 which could be a characteristic peak of silicon oxygen tetrahedral or aluminum oxygen octahedral structure fernandez jimenez and palomo 2005 the characteristic peak appearing at 746 cm 1 in fa mk 0 8 represents the stretching vibration of si al o si in the tetrahedral structure the shift of the characteristic peaks indicates that the octahedral structures in fa and mk may have decomposed after the alkali activation treatment so the tetrahedral structures are mainly dominant in the geopolymers in addition the adsorption intensity of peak at 569 557 and 561 cm 1 alo in fa 0 8p mk 0 8p and fa mk 0 8p is weakened after adsorption which maybe the main reason for phosphate removal 3 4 3 xrd analysis the xrd reflectance spectra of mk raw mk 0 8 mk 0 8p fa 0 8 fa 0 8p fa mk 0 8 and fa mk 0 8p are shown in fig 4 according to jade 6 5 obvious quartz pdf 85 0797 reflections are observed in all geopolymers quartz is also the main constituent of the lamellar and bulk structures for geopolymers in sem the minerals in mk 0 8 are mainly aluminum silicate pdf 86 1406 while the minerals in fa 0 8 are dominated by mullite pdf 83 1881 it is worth noting the appearance of new zeolite pdf 79 0430 structures in the xrd reflectance spectra of fa mk 0 8 which is due to the geopolymer preparation process of alkali activation curing and heating when combined fly ash 75 wt and metakaolin 25 wt mixture for alkali activation and curing likewise obtained geopolymers containing zeolite structures de rossi et al 2019 the formation of zeolite structures can further increase the adsorption of phosphate by fa mk 0 8 the alkali activation treatment dissolved the material and the characteristic peaks of the aluminum silicate and mullite structures are significantly reduced while the presence of quartz does not affect the alkali activation process of the material heah et al 2012 zibouche et al 2009 after phosphate adsorption by geopolymers the reflection intensity of all characteristic peaks is reduced especially mk 0 8p and fa mk 0 8p this may be due to the phosphate adsorbed on the surface of the material resulting in the weakening of the reflection intensity in addition sem and eds images are able to demonstrate that phosphates are adsorbed on the surface of geopolymers 3 5 adsorption mechanisms phosphate ions can be adsorbed on clay minerals by electrostatic gravitation and ligand exchange xue et al 2009 moreover the structural hydroxyl groups present on the surface of geopolymers are able to exchange with phosphate ions to form complexes and this exchange process is accompanied by a rise in ph zong et al 2018 the ftir analysis results show that the alkali activation process destroys the mineral structure of the material so the positive charges present at the edges of the broken geopolymer can attract phosphate ions in the low ph solution the hydroxyl groups on the surface of materials are protonated which would be more favorable for the ligand exchange process yan et al 2010 the fitting results of the adsorption kinetics showed that the adsorption process of fa mk 0 8 on phosphate is chemisorption so that the si al o functional groups in the tetrahedral structure produce a chemical process of ligand exchange with phosphate ions the results of xrd analysis show the newly formed zeolite structure which would further increase the adsorption sites on the surface of the geopolymer and promote the adsorption process therefore it is reasonable to speculate that the process of phosphate adsorption on the surface of the geopolymer can be divided into two steps as follows 1 rapid transfer of phosphate ions in aqueous solution to the adsorption active site on the surface of geopolymers 2 ion exchange and complexation of phosphate ions at active sites and cross section of geopolymers fig 5 this reveals why geopolymers are such high efficiency in removing phosphate from water in the simplest way 4 conclusion using fly ash fa and metakaolin mk as precursors to synthesize geopolymers we investigated their adsorption performance on phosphate in water and explored the modulus of alkali activator in obtaining the highest removal efficiency moreover the potential adsorption mechanism of geopolymers on phosphate was investigated by adsorption model and spectral analysis overall the geopolymers prepared with fly ash and metakaolin as raw materials should be selected 0 8 m as the best preparation process parameter and the adsorption effect of geopolymers prepared under 0 8 m was all better than 1 2 m the fa mk 0 8 prepared in this study had the maximum removal efficiency of 94 21 for phosphate in water with a maximum adsorption capacity of 36 02 mg kg the alkali activation process destroyed the mineral structure of the material increased the adsorption sites on the surface of the geopolymer and accelerated phosphate adsorption process electrostatic gravitation ligand exchange and surface complexation were the main mechanisms for the high removal efficiency of phosphate by fa mk 0 8 a low cost and high efficiency geopolymers was prepared in this study which has a very

1216,aluminium al rich 0 2 mg l groundwater has received more concerns because of its harmful to human beings origins of large scale occurrence on al rich groundwater in urbanized areas such as the pearl river delta prd are still little known the current work was conducted to investigate spatial distribution of al rich groundwater in the prd and to discuss its origins in various aquifers for that 265 groundwater samples and 15 river water samples were collected and 21 hydrochemical parameters including al were analyzed by using conventional analytical procedures the results showed that groundwater al concentrations were up to 22 64 mg l and al rich groundwater occurred in 15 of the area occupied by the prd al rich groundwater in the coastal alluvial aquifer was about 2 times those in alluvial proluvial and fissured aquifers whereas the karst aquifer was absent in the coastal alluvial aquifer al rich groundwater in the peri urban area was 2 or more times those in urbanized and agricultural areas whereas the remaining area was absent by contrast in the alluvial proluvial aquifer al rich groundwater in the remaining area was 1 5 3 5 times that in other areas in the fissured aquifer the distribution of al rich groundwater was independent of land use types the infiltration of wastewater from township enterprises was main anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in urbanized and peri urban areas whereas irrigation of al rich river water was the main one in the agricultural area naturally dissolution of al rich minerals in soils rocks triggered by both of ph decrease resulted from nitrification of contaminated ammonium e g sewage leakage the use of nitrogen fertilizer and acid deposition was the main geogenic source for al rich groundwater in the prd the contribution of anthropogenic sources to al rich groundwater in the coastal alluvial aquifer was more than that in alluvial proluvial and fissured aquifers whereas the contribution of geogenic sources was opposite in conclusion the discharge of township enterprises wastewater and ammonium rich sewage the emission of nitrogen containing gas and the use of nitrogen fertilizer should be preferentially limited to decrease the occurrence of al rich groundwater in urbanized areas such as the prd graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aluminium rich groundwater pearl river delta anthropogenic factors geogenic factors acid deposition data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction though aluminium al is the most abundant metallic element in the earth s crust constituting about 8 of its weight it often shows low levels in groundwater because it generally shows low solubility and difficult to participate in hydrogeochemical reactions driscoll and schecher 1990 however in some occasions such as acid rain deposition al in waters will increase and may be arrival toxic levels piña and cervantes 1996 for example high levels of al are harmful to human beings and cause many diseases such as dialysis dementia osteomalacia and microcytic anaemia without iron deficiency crisponi et al 2013 therefore the provisional tolerable weekly intake for al recommended by world health organization who is 1 mg kg bw week and the allowable upper limit for residual al in food determined by china is 100 mg kg ogimoto et al 2016 likewise who earlier recommended a maximum acceptable concentration for al in drinking water of 0 9 mg l although currently do not establish a guideline value who 2017 in addition general administration of quality supervision and inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china state that the allowable upper limit of al in groundwater for drinking purpose in china is 0 2 mg l gaqsiqprc 2017 hereafter in this study waters with al concentrations 0 2 mg l and 0 9 mg l are denoted as al rich waters and al high waters respectively groundwater is one of the abundant freshwater resources available on earth and applied as drinking water for 2 5 billion people in the world mukherjee et al 2020 however its usage is often limited because of widely distribution of poor quality groundwater li et al 2022 on one hand groundwater polluted by various human activities often occurs in agricultural areas urbanized areas and mining areas el osta et al 2022 rao et al 2022 thereby limiting its usage on the other hand geogenic contamination such as geogenic metal loid s rich groundwater also often limits groundwater usage worldwide wang et al 2021 for example a population of 50 60 million in pakistan is potentially influenced by as contaminated groundwater podgorski et al 2017 in argentina 4 million people are exposed to as contaminated groundwater bardach et al 2015 in china estimates of the population exposed to as contaminated groundwater vary widely ranging from 0 58 million to 19 6 million individuals wang et al 2018 overall occurrences and origins of geogenic metal loid s such as arsenic iron and manganese in groundwater have received much attention whereas only a few studies investigated al rich groundwater on regional scales in recent decades in global jia et al 2018 hou et al 2020 wang et al 2021 huang et al 2022a for example de meyer et al 2017 reported geogenic factors controlling groundwater al contamination in western amazonia and revealed that al rich groundwater occurs in the aquifer composed of iquitos formation where acidic groundwater ph 4 2 5 5 and alumina minerals e g gibbsite kaolinite present hart et al 2021 found that al rich groundwater generally distributed in surficial aquifers and plutonic and metamorphic bedrock aquifers in nova scotia of canada and groundwater al concentrations had significant correlation with ph and organic carbon concentrations all these studies have paid little attention on the contribution of human activities to al rich groundwater on a regional scale the pearl river delta prd is a highly urbanized delta located in south china its groundwater demand has increased rapidly in recent decades because of the urbanization accompanied by the growth of population liu et al 2018 however the poor quality because of metal loid s rich often limits the usage of groundwater in this area for drinking agricultural and domestic purposes zhang et al 2019 joelle et al 2021 for instance liu et al 2019 recently reported that large scale al rich groundwater occurred and the groundwater al concentration was abnormally up to 31 5 mg l in the prd as a consequence the occurrence of al rich groundwater is one of major concerns related to groundwater in the prd because al rich groundwater is harmful to human health to date origins of large scale occurrence of al rich groundwater in the prd are still little known the objectives of this study are to depict the spatial distribution of al in shallow groundwater of areas with different land use types in the prd and to discuss origins of al rich groundwater in various aquifers to the best of our knowledge it is the first time to reveal the spatial distribution and origins of large scale al rich groundwater in urbanized areas on a regional scale unlike previously studies co effects of both geogenic factors and anthropogenic factors on large scale occurrence of al rich groundwater in urbanized areas were highlighted in this study 2 study area 2 1 geographical conditions and urbanization the prd 111 59 115 25 e 21 17 23 55 n accounts for a total area of 41 698 km2 and located at the south of guangdong province china fig 1 it is adjacent to the south china sea and under a subtropical marine monsoonal climate the annual average precipitation is between 1600 and 2200 mm the annual average evaporation is between 1200 and 1400 mm and the annual average temperature is around 22 c sun et al 2009 huang et al 2018a all rivers streams including east river west river and north river in the prd merge into the pearl river system and finally discharge into the south china sea at present the annually riverine runoff amount is 300 billion m3 geng et al 2015 urbanization expansion of the prd has lasted for more than four decades since the opening up policy of china the area of construction land in the prd increases 1 5 1 6 times in three stages of 1988 1998 1998 2006 and 2006 2018 respectively huang et al 2018b 2020a 2022a plenty of sewage resulted from industrialization and urbanization was illegally discharged into rivers and led to 40 of river water showing poor quality in the prd during the early 21st century sun et al 2009 we divided the prd into four areas according to the land use namely urbanized areas peri urban areas agricultural areas as well as the remaining area fig s1 urbanized areas are related to construction lands and peri urban areas are 0 2 km outside of urbanized areas the remaining area includes woodlands grasslands uncultivated lands and small villages huang et al 2020b 2022b note that landfills in the prd are commonly located at the remaining area sun et al 2009 2 2 geological and hydrogeological conditions the prd is composed of a metamorphosed pre paleozoic basement overlain by discontinuous paleozoic to mesozoic continental formations and then overlain by quaternary deposits lancia et al 2020 quaternary deposits in the prd consist of two marine formations and two continental formations fig 1 a younger marine formation m1 is deposited during the holocene while other three formations are deposited during the pleistocene huang et al 1982 zong et al 2009a marine formations m1 and m2 are commonly dominated by silt and clay while underlying continental formations c1 and c2 with thicknesses of 2 22 m and 2 25 m respectively are generally dominated by sandy deposits or sand gravel and form coastal alluvial aquifers aquifer i zong et al 2009b in valley and inter hill plains of the prd where marine formations are missing and one or two terrestrial formations form alluvial proluvial aquifers aquifer ii fissured aquifers aquifer iii and karst aquifers aquifer iv occur in hilly areas where bedrocks e g granite clastic rocks sandstone limestone shale and mudstone often crop out and details are shown in section 2 2 of the supplementary material aquifer iii is associated with fractures while aquifer iv is distributed in carbonate formations aged from devonian to permian fig s2 groundwater in the prd is mainly recharged by vertical infiltration of precipitation and agricultural irrigation and the lateral flow of river water huang et al 2023 regional groundwater flow is generally from aquifer ii and aquifer iii to aquifer i and finally toward the south china sea fig s3 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques a total of 280 water samples including 265 groundwater samples and 15 river water samples were collected in once time from the prd in wet seasons of 2006 2007 fig 1 and groundwater sampling densities were 30 50 samples 1000 km2 and 5 10 samples 1000 km2 in the plains and hilly regions respectively specifically 71 and 102 shallow groundwater samples were collected from aquifer i m1 or c1 and aquifer ii respectively whereas 85 and 7 groundwater samples were collected from aquifer iii and aquifer iv respectively groundwater samples were collected at a depth of 50 cm below the water table after purging at least 3 well volumes and samples were filtered with 0 45 μm membranes on site two 250 ml polyethylene bottles were filled for measuring trace elements and other inorganic components respectively the former bottle was acidified with nitric acid to a ph of 2 while the latter one was not acidified a multi parameters instrument wtw multi 340i set germany was used to analyze ph redox potential eh and dissolved oxygen

were measured in the laboratory the total dissolved solids tds was measured using a gravimetric method hco3 and po4 3 were analyzed by acid base titration and molybdenum blue methods respectively whereas nh4 and other anions such as no3 so4 2 cl no2 and f were measured using ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10advp japan metal loid s such as k na ca2 mg2 pb as fe mn and al were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan each sample was measured in triplicate and sample batches were regularly interspersed with standards and blanks for quality control the detection limits for the above chemical parameters are shown in table s1 charge balance errors cbe were calculated after the field measurements were double checked in the lab the relative errors of parameters were 6 3 2 socioeconomic data socioeconomic parameters of various cities in the prd were obtained from the statistical yearbook of guangdong province gpsb 2007 as shown in table s2 here socioeconomic parameters include gross domestic product gdp population density pd proportion of urbanized areas pua domestic sewage discharge dsd industrial wastewater discharge iwd industrial enterprises above a specified size ies township enterprises tes and industrial waste gas discharge wgd besides cities in the prd related to socioeconomic data include guangzhou shenzhen foshan dongguan huizhou zhaoqing and jiangmen while other two major cities are excluded because of few groundwater samples 3 3 principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca are useful tools for analyzing high dimensional hydrochemical datasets huang et al 2013 2014 benadela et al 2022 el osta et al 2022 gad et al 2022 in this study pca was used to extract al and related variables and infer the underlying geochemical and or anthropogenic processes that control the occurrence of al rich groundwater besides pca was also used to identify the relationships between the proportion of al rich groundwater parg and socioeconomic parameters in various cities of the prd the varimax method was adopted for the rotation of pcs and eigenvalues 1 of pcs were retained for analyses in addition hca with ward s method was adopted to classify chemical parameters in groundwater of the prd to identify similar geochemical processes and or origins of al and other chemical parameters in a same group 4 results 4 1 distribution of al concentrations in waters of the prd 4 1 1 al concentrations in river water as shown in fig s4 al concentrations in river water of the prd was a range of 0 11 3 02 mg l the median concentration of al in river water was 0 43 mg l and 2 times that of the allowable upper limit of al in groundwater recommended by china gaqsiqprc 2017 moreover al rich and al high river waters accounted for 86 7 and 26 7 of the total river waters in downstream of the prd respectively both were 2 times that in 2002 ouyang et al 2006 this indicates that river water in the prd polluted by al was aggravated from 2002 to 2007 4 1 2 al concentrations in groundwater as shown in fig 2 groundwater al concentrations in the prd was a wide range of 0 01 22 64 mg l the median concentration of al in groundwater of the prd was 0 08 mg l and nearly one of fifth of that in river water proportions of al rich groundwater parg and al high groundwater pahg in the prd were 15 1 and 4 5 in comparison with allowable limits recommended by china and who respectively the parg in aquifer i was the highest and was 2 0 and 1 9 times that in aquifer ii and aquifer iii respectively by contrast al rich groundwater was absent in aquifer iv fig 3a similarly the pahg in aquifer i was also the highest and was also approximately 2 times that in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii while al high groundwater was also absent in aquifer iv fig 3a both indicate that groundwater al preferred to enrich in aquifer i than in other aquifers groundwater al concentrations in areas with different land use types were also investigated fig 2 in aquifer i the median concentration of groundwater al in peri urban areas was 2 times that in other areas similarly in aquifer i the parg in peri urban areas was 5 6 and 2 0 times that in urbanized areas and agricultural areas respectively fig 3b the pahg in peri urban areas in aquifer i was also the highest and 8 9 times that in urbanized areas while agricultural areas in aquifer i had absence of al high groundwater fig 3b likewise agricultural areas in aquifer ii also had none of al high groundwater both of parg and pahg in the remaining area in aquifer ii were the highest and were 3 5 and 1 7 times those in urbanized areas 1 5 and 2 0 times those in peri urban areas and 3 0 times that in agricultural areas respectively fig 3b unlike in aquifer i and aquifer ii the parg in agricultural areas in aquifer iii was a little bit higher than that in other land use types besides the pahg in agricultural areas in aquifer iii was also the highest and 3 8 times that in the remaining area while other two land use types had absence of al high groundwater fig 3b in addition jiangmen city had the highest parg of 25 6 in the prd followed by cities of foshan dongguan zhaoqing guangzhou hui zhou and shenzhen table s3 by contrast dongguan city had the highest pahg of 7 1 in the prd followed by cities of jiangmen guangzhou foshan and hui zhou while cities of zhaoqing and shenzhen had the absence of al high groundwater table s3 4 2 hydrochemical characteristics of al rich groundwater in the prd the median values of hydrochemical parameters in the groundwater with different levels of al are summarized in table s4 in aquifer i median values of nh4 fe mn and pb in al rich groundwater were 2 times those in al moderate 0 05 0 2 mg l and al poor 0 05 mg l groundwaters this indicate that al rich groundwater in aquifer i was generally enrichment of nh4 fe mn and pb similarly al rich groundwater in aquifer ii was also enrichment of fe and pb because median values of these two chemical components in al rich groundwater were 3 times or more those in al moderate and al poor groundwaters besides al rich groundwater in aquifer ii was commonly characterized by oxidizing environment because the median value of eh in al rich groundwater was 2 times that in al moderate and al poor groundwaters by contrast median values of hco3 so4 2 and po4 3 in al moderate and al poor groundwaters in aquifer ii were 3 times or more those in al rich groundwater this indicate that al rich groundwater in aquifer ii was poor of hco3 so4 2 and po4 3 unlike in aquifer i and aquifer ii al rich groundwater in aquifer iii was enrichment of k cl no3 nh4 mn and pb because median values of these six chemical components in al rich groundwater were 2 times or more those in al moderate and al poor groundwaters besides al rich groundwater in aquifer iii was also characterized by oxidizing environment and poor of hco3 and fe because of much higher median value of eh and much lower median values of hco3 and fe in al rich groundwater in comparison with those in al moderate and al poor groundwaters in addition hydrochemical facies of groundwater with different levels of al in the prd was also investigated in this study no3 facies represents the equivalent concentration of no3 accounting for 25 of total major anions in waters while no3 d facies represents that no3 is the dominant anion in waters this is also for cl hco3 and so4 2 as shown in fig 4 the number 14 of hydrochemical facies of al rich groundwater in aquifer i was close to that in river water 12 but significantly more than that in other aquifers 10 moreover both of al rich groundwater in aquifer i and al rich river water had so4 d facies but none in other aquifers these indicate that hydrochemical facies of al rich groundwater in aquifer i was more complex than that in other aquifers but similar to that in river water on the other hand al rich groundwater samples with no3 facies in aquifer ii and aquifer iii accounted for 66 7 and 90 9 of al rich groundwater samples respectively and both were 3 8 times and 5 2 times that in aquifer i by contrast al rich river water had none of no3 facies these further indicate that hydrochemical facies of al rich groundwater in aquifer ii and aquifer iii were close to each other but significantly differ to that in aquifer i and river water 4 3 relationships between al and other hydrochemical parameters in the prd as shown in table s5 groundwater al concentrations in aquifer i had significantly negative and positive correlations with ph value and concentrations of f pb mn and so4 2 respectively by contrast in aquifer ii the groundwater al concentration was significantly negative correlated with ph value and hco3 concentration and positive correlated with pb concentration and eh value similarly the groundwater al concentration in aquifer iii was also significantly negative correlated with ph value and positive correlated with eh value and concentrations of pb and no3 as shown in table 1 pc2 of aquifer i had strong positive loadings with al pb and f moderate positive loadings with mn and so4 2 and a weak negative loading with ph by contrast pc3 of aquifer ii demonstrated a strong positive loading with al a moderate positive loading with pb and a moderate negative loading with ph table 1 similarly pc3 of aquifer iii also showed strong positive loadings with pb and al and a moderate negative loading with ph table 1 as shown in fig 5 groundwater al and other three hydrochemical components such as pb f and mn in aquifer i were in a same sub group while al in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were grouped only closely with pb these indicate that al rich groundwater in aquifer i was generally enriched with pb f mn and so4 2 while al rich groundwater in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were commonly enrichment of pb besides these also indicate that the decrease of ph was in favor of the occurrence of al rich groundwater in all of these aquifers 4 4 relationship between groundwater al and socioeconomic parameters of the prd in this study correlations between parg and socioeconomic parameters of major cities in the prd was identified by the pca nine variables were combined to produce two pcs which explained 88 0 of the variance in the datasets table 2 the parg was related to pc2 that had strong positive loadings with township enterprises tes and industrial wastewater discharge iwd a moderate positive loading with parg and a weak positive loading with industrial waste gas discharge wgd this indicates that the parg in the prd was probably affected by tes iwd and wgd 5 discussion as mentioned previously al rich groundwater was present in aquifer i to aquifer iii but not in aquifer iv fig 2 besides al rich groundwater occurred in various areas with different land use types fig 2 thus we discuss the occurrence of al rich groundwater in aquifer i to aquifer iii and in areas with different land use types hereafter 5 1 sources for al rich groundwater in the prd 5 1 1 anthropogenic sources positive loadings of tes iwd and parg in a same pc indicate that the infiltration of wastewater from tes was the main anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in urbanized and peri urban areas of the prd table 2 because plenty of factories were built in urbanized and peri urban areas of the prd and wastewaters often infiltrated into groundwater via illegal discharge and the leakage of sewer system huang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 this is also supported by the evidence that al rich groundwater was present in urbanized and peri urban areas in all aquifers i to iii of the prd fig 3b besides this is also likely responsible for the higher parg of urbanized areas in aquifer iii than in aquifer i and aquifer ii fig 2 because vadose zones overlying aquifer i and aquifer ii are dominant of silt clay and shown lower permeability in comparison with that overlying aquifer iii bi et al 2022 thereby resulting in groundwater in aquifer iii contaminated by the wastewater infiltration more often than in aquifer i and aquifer ii unlike in urbanized and peri urban areas irrigation of river water was probably the main anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in agricultural areas because irrigation of river water often occurred in agricultural areas of the prd and river water in the prd was commonly enriched with al fig s4 huang et al 2022a this is also likely responsible for the higher parg in agricultural areas in aquifer i than in aquifer ii and aquifer iii fig 2 because river network areas are located in the coastal alluvial plain resulting in the more frequency of irrigation with al rich river water in aquifer i than in aquifer ii and aquifer iii fig 1 besides as far as the groundwater contamination is concerned pesticides and fertilizers are often main sources in agricultural areas but they were not main ones for al rich groundwater in agricultural areas of the prd because their al concentrations are generally at very low levels gilkes and mangano 1983 unlike in above areas the infiltration of industrial wastewater and irrigation of river water did not occur in the remaining area we guess the seepage of landfill leachate was likely the main anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in the remaining area fig 2 because landfills are generally built in the remaining area of the prd sun et al 2009 and groundwater contaminated by the leakage of landfill leachate sometimes occurs due to lacks of anti seepage measures huang et al 2014 hou et al 2020 correspondingly landfill leachates in the prd had high al concentrations of 0 46 24 26 mg l fig s4 5 1 2 geogenic sources apart from anthropogenic sources geogenic sources such as the dissolution of al rich minerals in rocks sediments under acidic conditions also often contribute to al rich groundwater because al is an acid sensitive element edmunds et al 1992 de meyer et al 2017 in theory al concentrations increase exponentially with the decrease of ph at ph 6 driscoll and schecher 1990 correspondingly groundwater ph in the prd was acidic to neutral and 50 of groundwaters in aquifers ii and iii were shown ph 6 table s4 besides 50 of soils in the prd were also shown ph 6 fig 6 guo et al 2011 thus it can be expected that al rich minerals e g feldspar in rocks sediments of the prd are dissolved when acid inputs thereby the soluble al enters into groundwater via the water flow this is supported by two evidences that groundwater ph values had significantly negative correlation with al concentrations in all aquifers i to iii and groundwater ph and al in these aquifers were shown opposite loadings in same pcs tables 1 s4 here acid inputs of groundwater in the prd are controlled by two main factors one factor is the acid deposition for instance liu et al 2017 reported that acid deposition was the main factor for groundwater acidification in the prd because so4 2 cl mass ratio in most of groundwater was significantly below that in rainwater 1 67 this is consistent with the result of this study that 90 of al rich groundwaters in the prd were also shown their so4 2 cl mass ratios 1 67 fig s5 the other factor is the nh4 contamination because nh4 converts to no3 via nitrification accompanied by the decrease of ph schmidt 1982 a couple of studies have reported that nh4 contamination occurred in both of soil and groundwater in the prd via the infiltration of nh4 rich sewage the irrigation with nh4 rich river water the use of nitrogen n fertilizer in agricultural activities as well as geogenic nh4 in marine sediments related to aquifer i jiao et al 2010 gong et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 however geogenic nh4 in marine sediments did not likely contribute to groundwater acidification in the prd because geogenic nh4 in the prd is resulted from the mineralization of organic n accompanied by the generation of hco3 and the increase of ph bi et al 2022 and median values of groundwater ph in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were lower than that in aquifer i where marine sediments are common table s4 therefore naturally dissolution of al rich minerals in soils rocks induced by both of acid deposition and ph decrease resulted from nitrification of contaminated ammonium was the main geogenic source for al rich groundwater in the prd this is supported by two evidences one is that al rich groundwater in the prd was often accompanied by no3 facies especially in aquifer ii and aquifer iii fig 4 another is that 70 of al rich groundwaters in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were present in areas with soil ph 5 5 but few in areas with soil ph 6 5 fig 6 besides geogenic sources of al are also related to rock sediment types for example al concentrations in shales and sandstones are generally 2 or more times that in carbonate rocks driscoll and schecher 1990 correspondingly al rich groundwater in the prd was present in bedrock aquifer with granite and clastic rocks but absent in bedrock aquifer with carbonate rocks figs 3a s2 5 2 driving mechanisms of al rich groundwater in the prd al rich groundwater in both of peri urban and agricultural areas in aquifer i was 2 or more times that in aquifer ii and aquifer iii fig 2 this is likely attributed to two factors related to anthropogenic sources one factor is more occurrence of tes wastewater infiltration in peri urban areas in aquifer i than in other aquifers because more proportion of tes located on aquifer i than on other aquifers table s2 gu and yan 1999 and the infiltration of al rich wastewater from tes in peri urban areas often occurred owing to the absence of sewer systems sun et al 2009 huang et al 2020a another factor is that river network areas in the prd locate on aquifer i rather than on other aquifers and river water for agricultural irrigation was often enrichment of al figs 1 s4 therefore the contribution of anthropogenic sources to al rich groundwater in aquifer i was more than in aquifer ii and aquifer iii because the more al rich groundwater in aquifer i in comparison with aquifer ii and aquifer iii was mainly attributed to the much higher parg in both of peri urban and agricultural areas in aquifer i than in aquifer ii and aquifer ii on the other hand the contribution of geogenic sources to al rich groundwater in aquifer ii and aquifer iii was likely more than in aquifer i because aquifer ii and aquifer iii were more oxidizing than aquifer i and oxidizing conditions are in favor of nitrification under conditions of n deposition and nh4 contamination and thereby decrease ph and release al into groundwater schmidt 1982 this assumption is supported by two aspects one is that median values of groundwater eh in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were 1 5 times that in aquifer i and median eh values of al rich groundwater in aquifer ii and aquifer iii were 2 times and 3 times that in al moderate and al poor groundwaters respectively table s4 besides groundwater eh values had significantly positive correlation with al concentrations in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii but not in aquifer i table s5 the other is that al rich groundwater with no3 facies in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii was much more than that in aquifer i fig 4 this also is probably responsible for that al rich groundwater in the remaining area in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii was much more than in aquifer i in addition results of pca and hca showed that al rich groundwater in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii was mainly controlled by co leaching of al and pb in soils under acidic conditions table1 and fig 5 because soil pb with high levels are widely distributed in the prd via the pollution of automobile exhausts and pb rich industrial dusts zhu et al 2001 yin et al 2021 by contrast al rich groundwater in aquifer i was mainly controlled not only by co leaching of al pb and mn in soils but also by complexations with f and so4 2 under acidic conditions driscoll and schecher 1990 because groundwater ph pb mn f so4 2 and al in aquifer i were in a same pc table1 and more proportion of mn rich soils overlaying aquifer i than in other aquifers yin et al 2021 5 3 suggestions for reducing al rich groundwater in the prd according to above discussion it is known that al rich groundwater in the prd was controlled by not only geogenic factors but also many human activities in view of the fact that anthropogenic factors can be controlled whereas natural factors are difficult to be controlled we suggest changing human activities to reduce al rich groundwater in the prd for sustainable development in groundwater usage because groundwater is an indispensable water resource for water supply in the prd first in order to limit illegal discharge of wastewater from tes and nh4 rich sewage local governmental agencies could adopt below strategies constructing drainage systems in peri urban areas lacking sewer systems in current renovating sewer systems in urbanized areas where sewer systems have been disrupted building more sewage treatment plants and improve the efficiency of sewage treatment via new technologies and strengthening the supervision of sewage wastewater discharge second local governmental agencies should urge factories to enhance denitrification capacities via new technologies in flue gas denitrification to reduce n emission third local farmers should regulate the amount and type of chemical fertilizers based on the reasonable fertilizer standards to limit the excessive use of n fertilizer 6 conclusions the distribution of al rich groundwater in the prd was investigated al rich groundwater in aquifer i was about 2 times that in aquifer ii and aquifer iii whereas aquifer iv was absent in aquifer i al rich groundwater in peri urban areas was 2 or more times that in urbanized areas and agricultural areas whereas the remaining area was absent both of anthropogenic and geogenic sources contributed to the presence of al rich groundwater in the prd infiltration of tes wastewater was main the anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in urbanized and peri urban areas whereas irrigation of al rich river water was the main one in agricultural areas naturally dissolution of al rich minerals in rocks sediments induced by acid deposition and nh4 nitrification was the main geogenic source for al rich groundwater in the prd anthropogenic sources contributing to the occurrence of al rich groundwater in aquifer i was more than in aquifer ii and aquifer iii owing to higher proportion of tes and more irrigation of al rich river water in aquifer i than other aquifers whereas the contribution of geogenic sources was opposite due to the more oxidizing environment in aquifer ii and aquifer iii than in aquifer i in order to decrease al rich groundwater in urbanized areas such as the prd illegal discharge of tes wastewater n emission nh4 rich sewage discharge as well as the use of n fertilizer should be preferentially limited in the future we will compare variations of al rich groundwater in different periods of urbanization and in different seasons in the prd in addition we will try to quantify natural and anthropogenic contributions for al rich groundwater in the prd credit authorship contribution statement guanxing huang writing original draft

1216,aluminium al rich 0 2 mg l groundwater has received more concerns because of its harmful to human beings origins of large scale occurrence on al rich groundwater in urbanized areas such as the pearl river delta prd are still little known the current work was conducted to investigate spatial distribution of al rich groundwater in the prd and to discuss its origins in various aquifers for that 265 groundwater samples and 15 river water samples were collected and 21 hydrochemical parameters including al were analyzed by using conventional analytical procedures the results showed that groundwater al concentrations were up to 22 64 mg l and al rich groundwater occurred in 15 of the area occupied by the prd al rich groundwater in the coastal alluvial aquifer was about 2 times those in alluvial proluvial and fissured aquifers whereas the karst aquifer was absent in the coastal alluvial aquifer al rich groundwater in the peri urban area was 2 or more times those in urbanized and agricultural areas whereas the remaining area was absent by contrast in the alluvial proluvial aquifer al rich groundwater in the remaining area was 1 5 3 5 times that in other areas in the fissured aquifer the distribution of al rich groundwater was independent of land use types the infiltration of wastewater from township enterprises was main anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in urbanized and peri urban areas whereas irrigation of al rich river water was the main one in the agricultural area naturally dissolution of al rich minerals in soils rocks triggered by both of ph decrease resulted from nitrification of contaminated ammonium e g sewage leakage the use of nitrogen fertilizer and acid deposition was the main geogenic source for al rich groundwater in the prd the contribution of anthropogenic sources to al rich groundwater in the coastal alluvial aquifer was more than that in alluvial proluvial and fissured aquifers whereas the contribution of geogenic sources was opposite in conclusion the discharge of township enterprises wastewater and ammonium rich sewage the emission of nitrogen containing gas and the use of nitrogen fertilizer should be preferentially limited to decrease the occurrence of al rich groundwater in urbanized areas such as the prd graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords aluminium rich groundwater pearl river delta anthropogenic factors geogenic factors acid deposition data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction though aluminium al is the most abundant metallic element in the earth s crust constituting about 8 of its weight it often shows low levels in groundwater because it generally shows low solubility and difficult to participate in hydrogeochemical reactions driscoll and schecher 1990 however in some occasions such as acid rain deposition al in waters will increase and may be arrival toxic levels piña and cervantes 1996 for example high levels of al are harmful to human beings and cause many diseases such as dialysis dementia osteomalacia and microcytic anaemia without iron deficiency crisponi et al 2013 therefore the provisional tolerable weekly intake for al recommended by world health organization who is 1 mg kg bw week and the allowable upper limit for residual al in food determined by china is 100 mg kg ogimoto et al 2016 likewise who earlier recommended a maximum acceptable concentration for al in drinking water of 0 9 mg l although currently do not establish a guideline value who 2017 in addition general administration of quality supervision and inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china state that the allowable upper limit of al in groundwater for drinking purpose in china is 0 2 mg l gaqsiqprc 2017 hereafter in this study waters with al concentrations 0 2 mg l and 0 9 mg l are denoted as al rich waters and al high waters respectively groundwater is one of the abundant freshwater resources available on earth and applied as drinking water for 2 5 billion people in the world mukherjee et al 2020 however its usage is often limited because of widely distribution of poor quality groundwater li et al 2022 on one hand groundwater polluted by various human activities often occurs in agricultural areas urbanized areas and mining areas el osta et al 2022 rao et al 2022 thereby limiting its usage on the other hand geogenic contamination such as geogenic metal loid s rich groundwater also often limits groundwater usage worldwide wang et al 2021 for example a population of 50 60 million in pakistan is potentially influenced by as contaminated groundwater podgorski et al 2017 in argentina 4 million people are exposed to as contaminated groundwater bardach et al 2015 in china estimates of the population exposed to as contaminated groundwater vary widely ranging from 0 58 million to 19 6 million individuals wang et al 2018 overall occurrences and origins of geogenic metal loid s such as arsenic iron and manganese in groundwater have received much attention whereas only a few studies investigated al rich groundwater on regional scales in recent decades in global jia et al 2018 hou et al 2020 wang et al 2021 huang et al 2022a for example de meyer et al 2017 reported geogenic factors controlling groundwater al contamination in western amazonia and revealed that al rich groundwater occurs in the aquifer composed of iquitos formation where acidic groundwater ph 4 2 5 5 and alumina minerals e g gibbsite kaolinite present hart et al 2021 found that al rich groundwater generally distributed in surficial aquifers and plutonic and metamorphic bedrock aquifers in nova scotia of canada and groundwater al concentrations had significant correlation with ph and organic carbon concentrations all these studies have paid little attention on the contribution of human activities to al rich groundwater on a regional scale the pearl river delta prd is a highly urbanized delta located in south china its groundwater demand has increased rapidly in recent decades because of the urbanization accompanied by the growth of population liu et al 2018 however the poor quality because of metal loid s rich often limits the usage of groundwater in this area for drinking agricultural and domestic purposes zhang et al 2019 joelle et al 2021 for instance liu et al 2019 recently reported that large scale al rich groundwater occurred and the groundwater al concentration was abnormally up to 31 5 mg l in the prd as a consequence the occurrence of al rich groundwater is one of major concerns related to groundwater in the prd because al rich groundwater is harmful to human health to date origins of large scale occurrence of al rich groundwater in the prd are still little known the objectives of this study are to depict the spatial distribution of al in shallow groundwater of areas with different land use types in the prd and to discuss origins of al rich groundwater in various aquifers to the best of our knowledge it is the first time to reveal the spatial distribution and origins of large scale al rich groundwater in urbanized areas on a regional scale unlike previously studies co effects of both geogenic factors and anthropogenic factors on large scale occurrence of al rich groundwater in urbanized areas were highlighted in this study 2 study area 2 1 geographical conditions and urbanization the prd 111 59 115 25 e 21 17 23 55 n accounts for a total area of 41 698 km2 and located at the south of guangdong province china fig 1 it is adjacent to the south china sea and under a subtropical marine monsoonal climate the annual average precipitation is between 1600 and 2200 mm the annual average evaporation is between 1200 and 1400 mm and the annual average temperature is around 22 c sun et al 2009 huang et al 2018a all rivers streams including east river west river and north river in the prd merge into the pearl river system and finally discharge into the south china sea at present the annually riverine runoff amount is 300 billion m3 geng et al 2015 urbanization expansion of the prd has lasted for more than four decades since the opening up policy of china the area of construction land in the prd increases 1 5 1 6 times in three stages of 1988 1998 1998 2006 and 2006 2018 respectively huang et al 2018b 2020a 2022a plenty of sewage resulted from industrialization and urbanization was illegally discharged into rivers and led to 40 of river water showing poor quality in the prd during the early 21st century sun et al 2009 we divided the prd into four areas according to the land use namely urbanized areas peri urban areas agricultural areas as well as the remaining area fig s1 urbanized areas are related to construction lands and peri urban areas are 0 2 km outside of urbanized areas the remaining area includes woodlands grasslands uncultivated lands and small villages huang et al 2020b 2022b note that landfills in the prd are commonly located at the remaining area sun et al 2009 2 2 geological and hydrogeological conditions the prd is composed of a metamorphosed pre paleozoic basement overlain by discontinuous paleozoic to mesozoic continental formations and then overlain by quaternary deposits lancia et al 2020 quaternary deposits in the prd consist of two marine formations and two continental formations fig 1 a younger marine formation m1 is deposited during the holocene while other three formations are deposited during the pleistocene huang et al 1982 zong et al 2009a marine formations m1 and m2 are commonly dominated by silt and clay while underlying continental formations c1 and c2 with thicknesses of 2 22 m and 2 25 m respectively are generally dominated by sandy deposits or sand gravel and form coastal alluvial aquifers aquifer i zong et al 2009b in valley and inter hill plains of the prd where marine formations are missing and one or two terrestrial formations form alluvial proluvial aquifers aquifer ii fissured aquifers aquifer iii and karst aquifers aquifer iv occur in hilly areas where bedrocks e g granite clastic rocks sandstone limestone shale and mudstone often crop out and details are shown in section 2 2 of the supplementary material aquifer iii is associated with fractures while aquifer iv is distributed in carbonate formations aged from devonian to permian fig s2 groundwater in the prd is mainly recharged by vertical infiltration of precipitation and agricultural irrigation and the lateral flow of river water huang et al 2023 regional groundwater flow is generally from aquifer ii and aquifer iii to aquifer i and finally toward the south china sea fig s3 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and analytical techniques a total of 280 water samples including 265 groundwater samples and 15 river water samples were collected in once time from the prd in wet seasons of 2006 2007 fig 1 and groundwater sampling densities were 30 50 samples 1000 km2 and 5 10 samples 1000 km2 in the plains and hilly regions respectively specifically 71 and 102 shallow groundwater samples were collected from aquifer i m1 or c1 and aquifer ii respectively whereas 85 and 7 groundwater samples were collected from aquifer iii and aquifer iv respectively groundwater samples were collected at a depth of 50 cm below the water table after purging at least 3 well volumes and samples were filtered with 0 45 μm membranes on site two 250 ml polyethylene bottles were filled for measuring trace elements and other inorganic components respectively the former bottle was acidified with nitric acid to a ph of 2 while the latter one was not acidified a multi parameters instrument wtw multi 340i set germany was used to analyze ph redox potential eh and dissolved oxygen do on site other 18 parameters including total dissolved solids tds 5 cations k na ca2 mg2 and nh4 7 anions hco3 no3 so4 2 cl f no2 and po4 3 and 5 metal loid s pb as fe mn and al in water samples were measured in the laboratory the total dissolved solids tds was measured using a gravimetric method hco3 and po4 3 were analyzed by acid base titration and molybdenum blue methods respectively whereas nh4 and other anions such as no3 so4 2 cl no2 and f were measured using ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10advp japan metal loid s such as k na ca2 mg2 pb as fe mn and al were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan each sample was measured in triplicate and sample batches were regularly interspersed with standards and blanks for quality control the detection limits for the above chemical parameters are shown in table s1 charge balance errors cbe were calculated after the field measurements were double checked in the lab the relative errors of parameters were 6 3 2 socioeconomic data socioeconomic parameters of various cities in the prd were obtained from the statistical yearbook of guangdong province gpsb 2007 as shown in table s2 here socioeconomic parameters include gross domestic product gdp population density pd proportion of urbanized areas pua domestic sewage discharge dsd industrial wastewater discharge iwd industrial enterprises above a specified size ies township enterprises tes and industrial waste gas discharge wgd besides cities in the prd related to socioeconomic data include guangzhou shenzhen foshan dongguan huizhou zhaoqing and jiangmen while other two major cities are excluded because of few groundwater samples 3 3 principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca are useful tools for analyzing high dimensional hydrochemical datasets huang et al 2013 2014 benadela et al 2022 el osta et al 2022 gad et al 2022 in this study pca was used to extract al and related variables and infer the underlying geochemical and or anthropogenic processes that control the occurrence of al rich groundwater besides pca was also used to identify the relationships between the proportion of al rich groundwater parg and socioeconomic parameters in various cities of the prd the varimax method was adopted for the rotation of pcs and eigenvalues 1 of pcs were retained for analyses in addition hca with ward s method was adopted to classify chemical parameters in groundwater of the prd to identify similar geochemical processes and or origins of al and other chemical parameters in a same group 4 results 4 1 distribution of al concentrations in waters of the prd 4 1 1 al concentrations in river water as shown in fig s4 al concentrations in river water of the prd was a range of 0 11 3 02 mg l the median concentration of al in river water was 0 43 mg l and 2 times that of the allowable upper limit of al in groundwater recommended by china gaqsiqprc 2017 moreover al rich and al high river waters accounted for 86 7 and 26 7 of the total river waters in downstream of the prd respectively both were 2 times that in 2002 ouyang et al 2006 this indicates that river water in the prd polluted by al was aggravated from 2002 to 2007 4 1 2 al concentrations in groundwater as shown in fig 2 groundwater al concentrations in the prd was a wide range of 0 01 22 64 mg l the median concentration of al in groundwater of the prd was 0 08 mg l and nearly one of fifth of that in river water proportions of al rich groundwater parg and al high groundwater pahg in the prd were 15 1 and 4 5 in comparison with allowable limits recommended by china and who respectively the parg in aquifer i was the highest and was 2 0 and 1 9 times that in aquifer ii and aquifer iii respectively by contrast al rich groundwater was absent in aquifer iv fig 3a similarly the pahg in aquifer i was also the highest and was also approximately 2 times that in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii while al high groundwater was also absent in aquifer iv fig 3a both indicate that groundwater al preferred to enrich in aquifer i than in other aquifers groundwater al concentrations in areas with different land use types were also investigated fig 2 in aquifer i the median concentration of groundwater al in peri urban areas was 2 times that in other areas similarly in aquifer i the parg in peri urban areas was 5 6 and 2 0 times that in urbanized areas and agricultural areas respectively fig 3b the pahg in peri urban areas in aquifer i was also the highest and 8 9 times that in urbanized areas while agricultural areas in aquifer i had absence of al high groundwater fig 3b likewise agricultural areas in aquifer ii also had none of al high groundwater both of parg and pahg in the remaining area in aquifer ii were the highest and were 3 5 and 1 7 times those in urbanized areas 1 5 and 2 0 times those in peri urban areas and 3 0 times that in agricultural areas respectively fig 3b unlike in aquifer i and aquifer ii the parg in agricultural areas in aquifer iii was a little bit higher than that in other land use types besides the pahg in agricultural areas in aquifer iii was also the highest and 3 8 times that in the remaining area while other two land use types had absence of al high groundwater fig 3b in addition jiangmen city had the highest parg of 25 6 in the prd followed by cities of foshan dongguan zhaoqing guangzhou hui zhou and shenzhen table s3 by contrast dongguan city had the highest pahg of 7 1 in the prd followed by cities of jiangmen guangzhou foshan and hui zhou while cities of zhaoqing and shenzhen had the absence of al high groundwater table s3 4 2 hydrochemical characteristics of al rich groundwater in the prd the median values of hydrochemical parameters in the groundwater with different levels of al are summarized in table s4 in aquifer i median values of nh4 fe mn and pb in al rich groundwater were 2 times those in al moderate 0 05 0 2 mg l and al poor 0 05 mg l groundwaters this indicate that al rich groundwater in aquifer i was generally enrichment of nh4 fe mn and pb similarly al rich groundwater in aquifer ii was also enrichment of fe and pb because median values of these two chemical components in al rich groundwater were 3 times or more those in al moderate and al poor groundwaters besides al rich groundwater in aquifer ii was commonly characterized by oxidizing environment because the median value of eh in al rich groundwater was 2 times that in al moderate and al poor groundwaters by contrast median values of hco3 so4 2 and po4 3 in al moderate and al poor groundwaters in aquifer ii were 3 times or more those in al rich groundwater this indicate that al rich groundwater in aquifer ii was poor of hco3 so4 2 and po4 3 unlike in aquifer i and aquifer ii al rich groundwater in aquifer iii was enrichment of k cl no3 nh4 mn and pb because median values of these six chemical components in al rich groundwater were 2 times or more those in al moderate and al poor groundwaters besides al rich groundwater in aquifer iii was also characterized by oxidizing environment and poor of hco3 and fe because of much higher median value of eh and much lower median values of hco3 and fe in al rich groundwater in comparison with those in al moderate and al poor groundwaters in addition hydrochemical facies of groundwater with different levels of al in the prd was also investigated in this study no3 facies represents the equivalent concentration of no3 accounting for 25 of total major anions in waters while no3 d facies represents that no3 is the dominant anion in waters this is also for cl hco3 and so4 2 as shown in fig 4 the number 14 of hydrochemical facies of al rich groundwater in aquifer i was close to that in river water 12 but significantly more than that in other aquifers 10 moreover both of al rich groundwater in aquifer i and al rich river water had so4 d facies but none in other aquifers these indicate that hydrochemical facies of al rich groundwater in aquifer i was more complex than that in other aquifers but similar to that in river water on the other hand al rich groundwater samples with no3 facies in aquifer ii and aquifer iii accounted for 66 7 and 90 9 of al rich groundwater samples respectively and both were 3 8 times and 5 2 times that in aquifer i by contrast al rich river water had none of no3 facies these further indicate that hydrochemical facies of al rich groundwater in aquifer ii and aquifer iii were close to each other but significantly differ to that in aquifer i and river water 4 3 relationships between al and other hydrochemical parameters in the prd as shown in table s5 groundwater al concentrations in aquifer i had significantly negative and positive correlations with ph value and concentrations of f pb mn and so4 2 respectively by contrast in aquifer ii the groundwater al concentration was significantly negative correlated with ph value and hco3 concentration and positive correlated with pb concentration and eh value similarly the groundwater al concentration in aquifer iii was also significantly negative correlated with ph value and positive correlated with eh value and concentrations of pb and no3 as shown in table 1 pc2 of aquifer i had strong positive loadings with al pb and f moderate positive loadings with mn and so4 2 and a weak negative loading with ph by contrast pc3 of aquifer ii demonstrated a strong positive loading with al a moderate positive loading with pb and a moderate negative loading with ph table 1 similarly pc3 of aquifer iii also showed strong positive loadings with pb and al and a moderate negative loading with ph table 1 as shown in fig 5 groundwater al and other three hydrochemical components such as pb f and mn in aquifer i were in a same sub group while al in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were grouped only closely with pb these indicate that al rich groundwater in aquifer i was generally enriched with pb f mn and so4 2 while al rich groundwater in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were commonly enrichment of pb besides these also indicate that the decrease of ph was in favor of the occurrence of al rich groundwater in all of these aquifers 4 4 relationship between groundwater al and socioeconomic parameters of the prd in this study correlations between parg and socioeconomic parameters of major cities in the prd was identified by the pca nine variables were combined to produce two pcs which explained 88 0 of the variance in the datasets table 2 the parg was related to pc2 that had strong positive loadings with township enterprises tes and industrial wastewater discharge iwd a moderate positive loading with parg and a weak positive loading with industrial waste gas discharge wgd this indicates that the parg in the prd was probably affected by tes iwd and wgd 5 discussion as mentioned previously al rich groundwater was present in aquifer i to aquifer iii but not in aquifer iv fig 2 besides al rich groundwater occurred in various areas with different land use types fig 2 thus we discuss the occurrence of al rich groundwater in aquifer i to aquifer iii and in areas with different land use types hereafter 5 1 sources for al rich groundwater in the prd 5 1 1 anthropogenic sources positive loadings of tes iwd and parg in a same pc indicate that the infiltration of wastewater from tes was the main anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in urbanized and peri urban areas of the prd table 2 because plenty of factories were built in urbanized and peri urban areas of the prd and wastewaters often infiltrated into groundwater via illegal discharge and the leakage of sewer system huang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020 this is also supported by the evidence that al rich groundwater was present in urbanized and peri urban areas in all aquifers i to iii of the prd fig 3b besides this is also likely responsible for the higher parg of urbanized areas in aquifer iii than in aquifer i and aquifer ii fig 2 because vadose zones overlying aquifer i and aquifer ii are dominant of silt clay and shown lower permeability in comparison with that overlying aquifer iii bi et al 2022 thereby resulting in groundwater in aquifer iii contaminated by the wastewater infiltration more often than in aquifer i and aquifer ii unlike in urbanized and peri urban areas irrigation of river water was probably the main anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in agricultural areas because irrigation of river water often occurred in agricultural areas of the prd and river water in the prd was commonly enriched with al fig s4 huang et al 2022a this is also likely responsible for the higher parg in agricultural areas in aquifer i than in aquifer ii and aquifer iii fig 2 because river network areas are located in the coastal alluvial plain resulting in the more frequency of irrigation with al rich river water in aquifer i than in aquifer ii and aquifer iii fig 1 besides as far as the groundwater contamination is concerned pesticides and fertilizers are often main sources in agricultural areas but they were not main ones for al rich groundwater in agricultural areas of the prd because their al concentrations are generally at very low levels gilkes and mangano 1983 unlike in above areas the infiltration of industrial wastewater and irrigation of river water did not occur in the remaining area we guess the seepage of landfill leachate was likely the main anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in the remaining area fig 2 because landfills are generally built in the remaining area of the prd sun et al 2009 and groundwater contaminated by the leakage of landfill leachate sometimes occurs due to lacks of anti seepage measures huang et al 2014 hou et al 2020 correspondingly landfill leachates in the prd had high al concentrations of 0 46 24 26 mg l fig s4 5 1 2 geogenic sources apart from anthropogenic sources geogenic sources such as the dissolution of al rich minerals in rocks sediments under acidic conditions also often contribute to al rich groundwater because al is an acid sensitive element edmunds et al 1992 de meyer et al 2017 in theory al concentrations increase exponentially with the decrease of ph at ph 6 driscoll and schecher 1990 correspondingly groundwater ph in the prd was acidic to neutral and 50 of groundwaters in aquifers ii and iii were shown ph 6 table s4 besides 50 of soils in the prd were also shown ph 6 fig 6 guo et al 2011 thus it can be expected that al rich minerals e g feldspar in rocks sediments of the prd are dissolved when acid inputs thereby the soluble al enters into groundwater via the water flow this is supported by two evidences that groundwater ph values had significantly negative correlation with al concentrations in all aquifers i to iii and groundwater ph and al in these aquifers were shown opposite loadings in same pcs tables 1 s4 here acid inputs of groundwater in the prd are controlled by two main factors one factor is the acid deposition for instance liu et al 2017 reported that acid deposition was the main factor for groundwater acidification in the prd because so4 2 cl mass ratio in most of groundwater was significantly below that in rainwater 1 67 this is consistent with the result of this study that 90 of al rich groundwaters in the prd were also shown their so4 2 cl mass ratios 1 67 fig s5 the other factor is the nh4 contamination because nh4 converts to no3 via nitrification accompanied by the decrease of ph schmidt 1982 a couple of studies have reported that nh4 contamination occurred in both of soil and groundwater in the prd via the infiltration of nh4 rich sewage the irrigation with nh4 rich river water the use of nitrogen n fertilizer in agricultural activities as well as geogenic nh4 in marine sediments related to aquifer i jiao et al 2010 gong et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 however geogenic nh4 in marine sediments did not likely contribute to groundwater acidification in the prd because geogenic nh4 in the prd is resulted from the mineralization of organic n accompanied by the generation of hco3 and the increase of ph bi et al 2022 and median values of groundwater ph in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were lower than that in aquifer i where marine sediments are common table s4 therefore naturally dissolution of al rich minerals in soils rocks induced by both of acid deposition and ph decrease resulted from nitrification of contaminated ammonium was the main geogenic source for al rich groundwater in the prd this is supported by two evidences one is that al rich groundwater in the prd was often accompanied by no3 facies especially in aquifer ii and aquifer iii fig 4 another is that 70 of al rich groundwaters in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were present in areas with soil ph 5 5 but few in areas with soil ph 6 5 fig 6 besides geogenic sources of al are also related to rock sediment types for example al concentrations in shales and sandstones are generally 2 or more times that in carbonate rocks driscoll and schecher 1990 correspondingly al rich groundwater in the prd was present in bedrock aquifer with granite and clastic rocks but absent in bedrock aquifer with carbonate rocks figs 3a s2 5 2 driving mechanisms of al rich groundwater in the prd al rich groundwater in both of peri urban and agricultural areas in aquifer i was 2 or more times that in aquifer ii and aquifer iii fig 2 this is likely attributed to two factors related to anthropogenic sources one factor is more occurrence of tes wastewater infiltration in peri urban areas in aquifer i than in other aquifers because more proportion of tes located on aquifer i than on other aquifers table s2 gu and yan 1999 and the infiltration of al rich wastewater from tes in peri urban areas often occurred owing to the absence of sewer systems sun et al 2009 huang et al 2020a another factor is that river network areas in the prd locate on aquifer i rather than on other aquifers and river water for agricultural irrigation was often enrichment of al figs 1 s4 therefore the contribution of anthropogenic sources to al rich groundwater in aquifer i was more than in aquifer ii and aquifer iii because the more al rich groundwater in aquifer i in comparison with aquifer ii and aquifer iii was mainly attributed to the much higher parg in both of peri urban and agricultural areas in aquifer i than in aquifer ii and aquifer ii on the other hand the contribution of geogenic sources to al rich groundwater in aquifer ii and aquifer iii was likely more than in aquifer i because aquifer ii and aquifer iii were more oxidizing than aquifer i and oxidizing conditions are in favor of nitrification under conditions of n deposition and nh4 contamination and thereby decrease ph and release al into groundwater schmidt 1982 this assumption is supported by two aspects one is that median values of groundwater eh in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii were 1 5 times that in aquifer i and median eh values of al rich groundwater in aquifer ii and aquifer iii were 2 times and 3 times that in al moderate and al poor groundwaters respectively table s4 besides groundwater eh values had significantly positive correlation with al concentrations in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii but not in aquifer i table s5 the other is that al rich groundwater with no3 facies in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii was much more than that in aquifer i fig 4 this also is probably responsible for that al rich groundwater in the remaining area in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii was much more than in aquifer i in addition results of pca and hca showed that al rich groundwater in both of aquifer ii and aquifer iii was mainly controlled by co leaching of al and pb in soils under acidic conditions table1 and fig 5 because soil pb with high levels are widely distributed in the prd via the pollution of automobile exhausts and pb rich industrial dusts zhu et al 2001 yin et al 2021 by contrast al rich groundwater in aquifer i was mainly controlled not only by co leaching of al pb and mn in soils but also by complexations with f and so4 2 under acidic conditions driscoll and schecher 1990 because groundwater ph pb mn f so4 2 and al in aquifer i were in a same pc table1 and more proportion of mn rich soils overlaying aquifer i than in other aquifers yin et al 2021 5 3 suggestions for reducing al rich groundwater in the prd according to above discussion it is known that al rich groundwater in the prd was controlled by not only geogenic factors but also many human activities in view of the fact that anthropogenic factors can be controlled whereas natural factors are difficult to be controlled we suggest changing human activities to reduce al rich groundwater in the prd for sustainable development in groundwater usage because groundwater is an indispensable water resource for water supply in the prd first in order to limit illegal discharge of wastewater from tes and nh4 rich sewage local governmental agencies could adopt below strategies constructing drainage systems in peri urban areas lacking sewer systems in current renovating sewer systems in urbanized areas where sewer systems have been disrupted building more sewage treatment plants and improve the efficiency of sewage treatment via new technologies and strengthening the supervision of sewage wastewater discharge second local governmental agencies should urge factories to enhance denitrification capacities via new technologies in flue gas denitrification to reduce n emission third local farmers should regulate the amount and type of chemical fertilizers based on the reasonable fertilizer standards to limit the excessive use of n fertilizer 6 conclusions the distribution of al rich groundwater in the prd was investigated al rich groundwater in aquifer i was about 2 times that in aquifer ii and aquifer iii whereas aquifer iv was absent in aquifer i al rich groundwater in peri urban areas was 2 or more times that in urbanized areas and agricultural areas whereas the remaining area was absent both of anthropogenic and geogenic sources contributed to the presence of al rich groundwater in the prd infiltration of tes wastewater was main the anthropogenic source for al rich groundwater in urbanized and peri urban areas whereas irrigation of al rich river water was the main one in agricultural areas naturally dissolution of al rich minerals in rocks sediments induced by acid deposition and nh4 nitrification was the main geogenic source for al rich groundwater in the prd anthropogenic sources contributing to the occurrence of al rich groundwater in aquifer i was more than in aquifer ii and aquifer iii owing to higher proportion of tes and more irrigation of al rich river water in aquifer i than other aquifers whereas the contribution of geogenic sources was opposite due to the more oxidizing environment in aquifer ii and aquifer iii than in aquifer i in order to decrease al rich groundwater in urbanized areas such as the prd illegal discharge of tes wastewater n emission nh4 rich sewage discharge as well as the use of n fertilizer should be preferentially limited in the future we will compare variations of al rich groundwater in different periods of urbanization and in different seasons in the prd in addition we will try to quantify natural and anthropogenic contributions for al rich groundwater in the prd credit authorship contribution statement guanxing huang writing original draft

1217,worldwide most uranium production relies on the in situ recovery isr extraction technique this consists of dissolving the ore using a leaching solution acid or alkaline directly within the deposit through a series of injection and extraction wells due to the nature of the injected isr solutions the water quality of the aquifer could be affected reactive transport modeling is a powerful tool for predicting fluid flow and geochemical reactions in isr reservoirs in this study we present a coupled 3d environmental geochemical model egm based on the hytec reactive transport software capable of predicting the physico chemical conditions in an acid leaching isr uranium mine and its environmental footprint on the aquifer in the years following the closure of the production block the model was validated at the katco mine kazakhstan on two different and independent production blocks over 10 years after their closure the model shows that incorporating two main geochemical processes 1 cationic sorption on clay surfaces smectite beidellite and 2 precipitation of gypsum caso4 2h2o successfully reproduces the measured well data ph acidity and so4 over short and long term time scales clay surface sites remain mostly saturated in protons during the production phase simulations show that sorbed protons on the clay surfaces maintains the acid conditions for a longer period of time the environmental impact model was also compared to a pre existing model specifically developed for production simulation purposes differences are observed as expected for the uranium production but also for the impact distances due to differences in the considered reactive mineralogical paragenesis thus the choice of geochemical model should be made with due regard for the desired objectives this work will assist the mine operator by providing a tool capable of assessing both the short and long term environmental footprints of the isr production operation conditions and of identifying the best remediation strategy graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords in situ recovery uranium environmental monitoring reactive transport modeling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction approximately 50 of world uranium production uses the in situ recovery isr technique wna 2018 oecd nea and iaea 2020 isr mining is defined as the extraction of a metal e g uranium from its host formation by the circulation of leaching solutions alkaline or acid using injection and extraction wells lagneau et al 2019 the solution is treated in production blocks on the surface to recover the dissolved metal of interest reagents are then added to the solution before recirculation in the ore formation iaea 2001 the fundamental advantages of isr over other mining techniques are the reduced costs and environmental footprint neither mill tailings nor waste rocks are generated ballini et al 2020 chautard et al 2020 déjeant et al 2016 lahrouch et al 2022 making isr by far the most cost effective extraction technique kidd 2009 it is particularly suited for permeable deposits located in a confined zone for example in roll front deposits uranium mineralized orebodies imply the presence of a redox front separating a downstream reducing zone rich in organic matter and sulfide minerals e g pyrite from an upstream zone where the sediments appear leached and or oxidized since uranium is insoluble under reducing conditions it precipitates in contact with the reducing zone in its tetravalent form of uraninite uo2 s and coffinite usio4 s woldegabriel et al 2014 zammit et al 2014 rallakis et al 2019 bonnetti et al 2014 yensepbayev et al 2010 pre production conditions are usually characterized by poor water quality unfit for any use resulting from the ore genesis mechanisms sodov et al 2016 and by high salinity and high concentrations of metals including uranium and its daughter elements e g 226ra ariunbileg et al 2016 sodov et al 2016 de boissezon et al 2020 grozeva et al 2021 isr uranium extraction relies on relatively high uranium solubility under oxidizing conditions both at low and high ph complexation with several anions further enhances solubility e g so4 2 and co3 2 bhargava et al 2015 seigneur et al 2021 acid leaching usually sulfuric acid h2so4 is the preferred technique representing up to 96 of total uranium produced by isr acid leaching mining practices have been used since the 1960s in countries of eastern and central europe and central asia kazakhstan uzbekistan russia ukraine bulgaria and czech republic and also in china australia and usa iaea 2016 märten 2006 uranium dissolution during acidic leaching is dominated by the oxidation of u iv bearing minerals e g uraninite and coffinite by fe3 in the bearing solution ben simon et al 2014 the presence of ferric iron is due to several mechanisms local dissolution and oxidation of gangue minerals goethite beidellite pyrite recirculation of fe3 from the well field and surface active regeneration of fe3 using hydrogen peroxide or other oxidants low ph typically 2 is required to allow significant ferric iron mobility lagneau et al 2019 the main environmental impacts associated with isr mining practices are related to the risk of water contamination in the mineralized and adjacent aquifers saunders et al 2016 the initial water conditions in the aquifer are disrupted due to the injection of acid solutions in the mineralized zone decreasing the ph and generating a saline plume depending on local regulations the objective of the remediation strategy is focused on the mine s aquifer and its remediation to return as closely as possible to its initial conditions natural attenuation is based partly on the geochemical ability of the geological host to buffer the chemical disturbances associated with the injection of the acid and oxidizing solutions and partly on the natural dilution of the saline plume generated during mining the attenuation of inorganic contaminants in the aquifer is achieved by a combination of complex physical including dispersion and diffusion and bio geochemical processes including precipitation sorption biotic and abiotic reactions christensen et al 2004 hall 2009 wu et al 2006a 2006b yabusaki et al 2007 2014 coral et al 2018 descostes et al 2014 these relevant processes operate on a wide range of reaction rates that may simultaneously require both kinetic and equilibrium treatment the only numerical models able to account for both reservoir geometries and flow and bio geochemical processes occurring within reservoirs are reactive transport models therefore reactive transport models are the de facto choice to study the phenomena of natural attenuation in the context of isr mining and to demonstrate that post production environmental targets can be reached lagneau et al 2019 these models have also proven to be efficient tools for increasing production via wellfield optimization and short and long term planning strategies even considering the residual geological uncertainty of the aquifer lagneau et al 2019 langanay et al 2021 collet et al 2022 therefore until now geochemical models have been developed for two different purposes on the one hand an isr production model satisfies the constraints of the operator and focuses mainly on the oxidation of uranium and the acid consumption during the production phase ranging from one year to a maximum of 12 lagneau et al 2019 collet et al 2022 modeling focuses on very restricted zones demarcated by the location of the injection and extraction wells production blocks in such approaches uranium dissolution and recovery and acid consumption are the main processes investigated within the mined geological formation bonnaud et al 2015 johnson and tutu 2016 lagneau et al 2019 regnault et al 2015 the production phase provides numerous data sets that contribute to an accurate calibration of the numerical models on the other hand an isr environmental model defines uranium production and focuses on the aquifer geochemical conditions e g ph so4 aq tds and radionuclide etc at the end of uranium extraction integrating the initial production phase of the production block and on the increase in concentration of long term chemical components in the targeted aquifer in order to predict its remediation de boissezon et al 2020 one of the limits of environmental models is the lack of available geochemical monitoring data during the life of the block s operations and after its closure which complicates calibration of the numerical models geochemical models developed for production and remediation differ on the number of chemical elements and processes to be considered and on their spatial and temporal constraints until now near field 3d simulations have been performed to simulate the production phase however the geochemical models adapted for the production phase do not take into account key geochemical processes that govern the remediation reactions e g cationic sorption on clay surfaces precipitation of secondary minerals and 226ra migration see de boissezon et al 2020 besançon et al 2020 limiting the ability of these models to properly predict changes in ph and the behavior of contaminants so4 226ra u during the production phase and over a longer duration 100 years until now the environmental impact of an isr mining site has been investigated over longer durations 20 years and distances 2 km using 2d far field simulations e g lagneau et al 2019 dong et al 2016 near field modeling has only recently been used in 2d for the umnut isr pilot in mongolia de boissezon et al 2020 the geochemical complexity of the system leads to computationally intensive modeling long duration cpu calculations so that 2d models are easier to handle however the behavior of the saline plume in the vicinity of the production blocks during and after the production phase depends largely on the local geology which exhibits significant vertical heterogeneity therefore it is imperative to be able to track the environmental footprint of a production block and surrounding area 2 km in 3d in this article we present a robust geochemical model dedicated to estimating the environmental impact of isr uranium production in the vicinity of a production block using 3d simulations for this work we have used the production and monitored data from the katco mine kazakhstan this work makes it possible to develop reactive transport models focused on the chemical changes during and after isr extraction based on water quality monitoring e g ph so4 ions cations and available mineralogical and hydrogeological data hence this model reconciles the simulations of uranium production with an environmental impact assessment this work contributes to the creation of a tool which will enable the operator to determine the short and long term environmental footprints of the production operation conditions and in turn will help to choose the appropriate remediation solution 2 methodology 2 1 overview of in situ recovery mining the isr mining technique is based on a variety of injection and producer well configurations fig 1 optimal configurations ensure a good circulation of the solutions through the mineralized zone and thereby effective leaching ward et al 1983 for instance the katco mine operates using a hexagonal pattern each production cell is composed of six injection wells acid leaching solution with an average input flow rate of 4 m3 h positioned around a producer well to recover the uranium rich solution with an average output flow rate of 8 12 m3 h with a typical distance of 42 m between an injection well and a producer well the layout of the wells is optimized to cover the entire mineralized surface with the minimum number of cells the cells are grouped into production technological blocks or production blocks with about 45 injection wells and 15 producer wells per block giving a total flow rate of 150 m3 h injected produced the u deposits exploited by the katco mine are located in the chu sarysu basin kazahastan the uyuk sedimentary formation is made up of medium sands combined with lenticular clay vertically constrained by two impermeable formations kizilchy on top and intymac underneath dahlkamp 2009 the natural background flow rate is 10 m yr ne kotchetkov et al 1987 in the uyuk aquifer values for total dissolved solids tds of around 1 g l were recorded before the commencement of isr mining i e baseline conditions at ph 8 subsequently the injection of the acid bearing solution into the aquifer triggerered changes in aquifer water quality conferring saline and acidic properties thus maintaining a neutral hydraulic balance the difference between the volumes injected and extracted on the same block limits the risks of a potential spread of leaching solutions outside the mine boundary jeuken et al 2009 a piezometric network was set up for environmental monitoring and to maintain optimal geochemical conditions within the aquifer to mitigate pollutant migration 2 2 modeled areas this study focuses on two of the production blocks modeled by collet et al 2022 referred to as f3 and e3 respectively fig 2 this choice is motivated by i one of the mine s densest networks of monitoring wells being in the vicinity of the two blocks fig 2 ii the relative isolation of these two blocks limiting the effects of neighboring blocks iii the inability of the production geochemical model used by collet et al 2022 to reproduce the ph observed over the entire life of the block f3 and at the beginning 1 year and the end of the production history for f3 which the authors attribute to the failure to account for sorption the 3d geological models well field dimensions and operational conditions imposed on the reservoir are strictly identical to those presented and used by collet et al 2022 and are briefly detailed in the following sections however as the model of collet et al 2022 is only designed for the production phase ph and u there is a lack of the main geochemical reactions that control the environmental processes so4 major cations ca2 mg2 k na h thus in this paper we describe a geochemical model including sorption reactions but also the background flow rate the model includes a more complete mineralogical reactive paragenesis than the one proposed by collet et al 2022 and is given in section 2 4 2 3 geological model the geological model is based on block models of the ore deposit using geological data drill core observations and geophysical logging and geostatistical reconstruction stochastic simulation methods from the katco mine for e3 and deterministic methods for f3 thus the 3d model is constructed using the geometry of the well field position of the wells length and depth of the screens on the whole thickness of the aquifer porosity was set to 20 and permeability varied from permeable 10 4 m s to relatively impermeable 10 9 m s respectively according to field observations ben simon et al 2014 mineral facies u mineralized reduced and oxidized are also distributed on the geological model according to geochemical and geophysical observations see supplementary information fig a the present study uses three 3d modeling meshes for block f3 1 45288 cells measuring 10 10 2 m in a volume of 370 680 36 m3 2 339660 cells measuring 5 5 1 m in a volume of 370 675 34 m3 and for block e3 3 334880 cells measuring 5 5 1 m in a volume of 455 490 40 m3 2 4 geochemical models the reactive transport simulations were performed using two alternative geochemical models the first geochemical model is specifically designed to simulate the uranium isr production phase here referred to as the production geochemical model pgm e g lagneau et al 2019 collet et al 2022 the pgm focuses on uranium production and reagent consumption other constraints of the model design were limiting the number of reactions to keep cpu time manageable and number of parameters for a more robust predictive capacity the second geochemical model is designed to simulate the environmental geochemical processes occurring in the aquifer due to isr uranium exploitation focusing on the evolution of groundwater quality herein referred to as the environmental geochemical model egm among other differences the egm puts a heavy focus on surface reactions for their capacity to control dissolved metal concentrations at intermediate ph also thermodynamic equilibrium is preferred to kinetic control when justified for its robustness fewer adjustment parameters simulating the aquifer water composition during and after isr extraction requires the construction of a geochemical model describing the water composition of the studied aquifer the sedimentary reservoir consists of a mildly cemented arkosic sandstone munara 2012 mathieu et al 2015 petrov 1998 with composition of around 70 quartz 10 feldspar 5 micas and 5 10 clay minerals mostly smectite and kaolinite authigenic smectite is mostly composed of beidellite with a significant fe iii content robin et al 2015b other minerals include goethite and pyrite 1 in the oxidized and reduced part of the aquifer respectively and a low concentration of calcite 0 1 finally uranium bearing minerals are found in the roll front mostly uraninite and coffinite at relatively low concentrations 0 1 the initial aquifer water composition was determined using base line monitoring table 1 the present environmental geochemical model describes a reactive mineral paragenesis compatible with the mineralogical observations which are in equilibrium with the interstitial water in the three roll front zones oxidized mineralized and reduced zones see fig 1 table 1 the proportions of minerals constituting the reactive paragenesis were chosen to respect the available total rock analyses the minerals were chosen to represent the reactivity of the system considering three mechanisms i precipitation dissolution at the thermodynamic equilibrium of the mineral phases calcite uraninite muscovite schoepite and gypsum ii precipitation dissolution of additional mineral phases taking into account the kinetics cristobalite microcline kaolinite beidellite ferrihydrite hydroxylapatite giammar 2001 palandri and kharaka 2004 robin et al 2015b rimstidt and barnes 1980 lagneau and van der lee 2010 table b supplementary material and iii the sorption of cations on the clay surfaces h na k ca mg uo2 the sorption of cations was considered on the three sorption sites of the beidellite surfaces due to the minor cation exchange capacity of kaolinite compared to beidellite robin et al 2017 following the gains thomas formalism see table c supplementary material the percentage of clays in the sediment was set to the same value for both the production and the environmental models 4 3 wt 2 5 wt beidellite and 1 8 wt kaolinite for block f3 and 3 wt 1 3 beidellite and 1 8 wt kaolinite for block e3 however the beidellite surface area was adjusted on the egm to fit the field aqueous chemistry e g ph for block f3 beidellite surface was set to 3 3 106 cm2 g on the egm and 6 6 106 cm2 g on the pgm this means that the available number of surface sites for fixed cations on the beidellite surface was divided by a factor of 2 between the models in addition for block e3 the same value 6 105 cm2 g was used for both models egm and pgm this means that the surface sites of beidellite are the same beidellite preserves its sorption properties during and after reaction with acid solutions robin et al 2020 the fe oxides ferrihydrite on the egm for blocks f3 and e3 were set to 0 005 wt which corresponds to a similar value on the pgm for block f3 in contrast with on block e3 one order of magnitude lower on the egm compared to the pgm goethite 0 1 wt thus the mineral paragenesis for the present environmental geochemical model is determined by 11 minerals 18 surface sites for ion exchange reactions and 7 kinetic reactions and is detailed in table 1 every mineral content is specified by facies while uraninite is spatially distributed on the mineralized facies thanks to the stochastic simulations 2 5 modeling tools the reactive transport modeling was carried out using hytec v 4 7 1 software coupling the chess geochemistry code v3 9 to an r2d2 fluid transport model lagneau and van der lee 2010 van der lee et al 2003 hytec is able to solve a multiphase multicomponent reactive system solving the solid liquid gas equilibrium taking into account a wide variety of geochemical processes cation exchange mineral dissolution precipitation the reactive transport algorithm is based on the sequential iterative algorithm carrayrou et al 2010 thus hytec provides a multipurpose flexible framework for solving complex hydrogeochemical problems lagneau and van der lee 2010 steefel et al 2015 in saturated or

groundwater flow model was used calculations were run using machine capacities of 24 32 and 64 cpus the pgm was constructed using the llnl thermodynamic database delany and lundeen 1991 while the egm was constructed using a thermochemical database dedicated for mine environment purposes prodata v 1 1 0 4 reiller and descostes 2020 the prodata database was completed by incorporating the sorption exchange constants of major cations on clay surfaces the equilibrium constants for h na ca2 mg2 k and uo2 2 follow the gains thomas formalism robin et al 2015a robin et al 2017 simulations include boundary conditions which account for the natural background flow rate also the injection and extraction rates as well as the solution composition change through the simulation and are described as source terms for e3 and f3 as in most cases the blocks undergo an initial phase of intense acidification this relates to the re injection of the extracted waters to which significant amounts of acid are added 20 g l this phase which generally takes two to four months aims at reaching a ph below 2 then when the concentration of uranium in the recovered solution starts to increase the block is connected to the overall plant network the fluid composition is then influenced by the multiple circulations of the fluid over the whole well field the result is an accumulation of dissolved elements in the solution only uranium is extracted at the plant the model uses compositions in line with analyses at the plant and the acid content is adjusted daily by the operator as required so that the ph at the extraction well remains between 1 and 2 to ensure fe iii and u mobility and to limit the precipitation of secondary minerals lagneau et al 2019 in this study we present 18 reactive transport simulations performed using the two different geochemical models table a supplementary information on the two production blocks f3 and e3 the construction of the egm was performed on block f3 and its validation was carried out on block e3 which offers a longer extraction duration 7 yr vs 1 yr a set of sensitivity tests were performed on 1 the background flow rate from 1 m yr 2 5 m yr 5 m yr and 10 m yr and 2 the clay content 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of the geochemical system the acidification of the aquifer induces geochemical reactions between the acid bearing solution and the minerals in the host rock lagneau et al 2019 to illustrate this we performed appropriate batch simulations fig 3 the simulations at equilibrium show the redistribution of the species solid aqueous and sorbed as a function of ph fig 3a b thus at acidic ph 1 5 dissolution reactions of the host rock bearing minerals result in an increase of the total dissolved solids tds of the aquifer fig 4 of over 1 g l due to the increase of ions such as so4 ca and na among others fig 3a originating from the composition of the acid leaching solution and the concomitant host rock dissolution the reactive transport isr modeling performed on block f3 shows that the principal mineral quartz sio2 from the mineral paragenesis undergoes negligible dissolution during the phase of 1 yr 0 01 on the technological block while dissolution of the host rock minerals e g calcite fe oxides hydroxylapatite microcline clays beidellite and kaolinite and clay sorption compromises acid consumption i e consumption of aqueous h during the acidification phase which buffers the ph and creates a delay of the acidification of the aquifer thus after one year of production on block f3 66 of the h injected was consumed by mineral dissolution r1 to r6 and aqueous reactions and 34 of the h injected was consumed by sorption on the clay surface r7 proton sorption on a clay surface acts as a sink term for acidity further delaying aquifer acidification r 7 which is consistent with the observations made by robin et al 2015b robin et al 2020 and collet et al 2022 the pgm underestimates the acid consumption by 80 1 62 1 on average for the investigated blocks during the first year of production reactions r1 to r7 are given as r 1 caco 3 s calcite 2h ca 2 aq co 2 aq h 2 o r 2 fe oh 3 s

expected batch simulations at equilibrium show that protons are the main cation sorbed during acid conditions e g ph 2 87 of sites are occupied by protons ca2 3 2 mg2 8 2 na 1 1 k 0 1 fig 3 on the same basis u bearing minerals are strongly dissolved by the acid as expected and oxidative leaching solutions originating from the dissolution of ferric minerals goethite ferrihydrite and beidellite result in oxidative uranium rich solutions as expected the injection of sulfuric acid led to a drastic increase in solution of sulfate ions and protons sulfate ions therefore constituted the major anion and could as a first approximation be considered as non reactive with the host formation here simulations on block f3 using the pgm determine that only 70 of the sulfuric acid injected is recovered by extraction by the end of the production phase when considering the absence of precipitation of sulfate bearing minerals this means that 30 of the sulfuric acid remains in the aquifer moreover the remaining aqueous sulfate within the production block is expected in a first stage to be diluted in the aquifer but also to slightly decrease by precipitation of so4 bearing minerals gypsum alunite jarosite in the vicinity of the production blocks lagneau et al 2019 before being reduced by autochthonous sulfato reducing bacteria coral et al 2016 bonnetti et al 2017 jroundi et al 2020 coral et al 2022 the egm includes gypsum precipitation in the mineral paragenesis defined by reaction r 8 r 8 ca 2 aq so 4 aq 2h 2 o caso 4 2h 2 o s thus environmental simulations show that after 1 year of production on block f3 26 of the sulfates injected were precipitated as gypsum i e 170 mol m3 so4 total injected t 1 year and 45 mol m3 of gypsum precipitated t 1 year which may constitute a long term sulfate source term within the aquifer as highlighted previously the sorption process on clay surfaces has a significant influence on the water composition fig 3a b clay surface sites can constitute an important sink term for cations including protons however this effect is limited mostly to the initial acidification phase of the production process when the ph is driven from neutral conditions ph 8 to 2 fig 3b for instance from the end of the acidification phase to the block closure ph 2 the proportion of ca2 and h sorbed represents 3 9 and 21 4 of the total concentration i e mineral aqueous sorbed of calcium and h in the system respectively the surface sites then remain mostly saturated in protons h during the production phase however the amount of sorbed protons remains negligible 0 001 when comparing the total acidity consumed 25 during the lifetime of a production block several years here represented as 1 year on block f3 as mentioned in previous studies e g lagneau et al 2019 de boissezon et al 2020 sorption influence is crucial during post exploitation when the remaining buffer capacity of the aquifer drives ph above 4 5 depending on the slow renewal of cations from circulating fresh waters i e clay minerals deprotonate thus the arrival of the fresh water dilutes the acidic and saline plume increasing the pore water ph and drives out the cations initially sorbed via cation exchange on the clay minerals mainly ca and mg in favor of the protons fig 3b the increase of ph in the contaminant plume rearranges the species distribution aqueous sorbed and solid species fig 3 likewise the ph changes may trigger the dissolution of the precipitated so4 bearing minerals during the exploitation phase however together with particle dispersion reducing conditions usually observed downstream of the natural hydraulic gradient of a roll front constitute the principal natural mechanisms involved in the attenuation of so4 lagneau et al 2019 coral et al 2016 bonnetti et al 2017 jroundi et al 2020 coral et al 2022 also ph neutralization can lead to the re precipitation of mineral phases such as carbonate bearing minerals decreasing the concentration of ca mg and co3 in solution both mechanisms contribute to decrease the total dissolved solids fig 4 3 2 applications for in situ recovery in this section we compare reactive transport simulations using both geochemical models pgm and egm with historical data in order to evaluate the feasibility of the egm during the uranium acidification phase the production phase and in the coming years after the closure of the production blocks in addition the validation robustness and the predictive quality of the egm on different production blocks production duration permeability and facies heterogeneity distribution etc are discussed 3 2 1 isr production phase the aim of the first set of simulations is to reproduce the acid consumption ph and uranium production observed at the block scale results are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 for blocks f3 and e3 respectively simulations 5 and 8 for block f3 and simulations 17and 18 for block e3 si table a the simulations were run over the production period of each considered block i e 1 y and 7 y for f3 and e3 respectively here we mention that 1 yr of production is very short compared to the 8 yr production average the results show the general ph in the extraction well network for simulated and measured field data which decreases from 8 to approximately 2 fig 5a here we emphasize that this data fig 5 6 refers to the cumulative flow from all the extraction wells of the technological block the simulated data for block f3 is in good agreement during the first two months 0 2 yr using the pgm compared to the egm showing a delay in the decrease of ph during the first months however from 0 3 yr the egm shows a good agreement between the simulated and measured field data both models have similar clay and calcite concentrations however the pgm does not include sorption processes which means that h remains in solution decreasing the ph or is consumed by rock mineral dissolution e g calcite in addition uncertainties on porosity and permeabilities have an impact when adjusting modeling data to field measurements differences in ph 0 2 years between both models also suggest the clay fraction could be used as a parameter to adjust the models and highlight the heterogeneity of the clay fraction in the reservoir it could control the amount of h sorbed during acidification on the first months until the clays are completely saturated on h this point will be discussed more in detail in the section 3 3 3 the egm is a better fit for the general ph measured in the extraction wells of block f3 for the longer duration 0 2 years compared to the pgm fig 5 protons are sorbed on the clay surfaces which controls the concentration of h in the aquifer and in turn the ph at ph 1 5 the fraction of h sorbed represents 80 of the total cationic exchange capacity fig 3 also general acidity and total acid consumed are better represented using the egm compared to the pgm fig 5b d the acidity is calculated according to eq 1 which considers the concentration of h hso4 and h2so4 excluding all the other so4 aqueous complexes such as caso4 0 1 acid h hs o 4 2 h 2 so 4 thus the good fit of the environmental simulations with the measured data is explained due to the good fit of the ph during the production phase fig 5a that controls eqs r 9 and r 10 according to r 9 hso 4 aq so 4 2 aq h r 10 h 2 so 4 aq so 4 2 aq 2h in addition we see that gypsum precipitation in the mineral paragenesis helps to control the concentration of sulfates in the aquifer however gypsum precipitation only decreases the amount of recovered acid by 2 5 a good estimation of sulfate concentration in the aquifer at the end of the production phase will contribute to a better long term estimation of the environmental footprint due to isr industrial practices total uranium produced in block f3 is better represented using the pgm rather than the egm fig 5c the egm considers thermodynamic equilibrium and in this case it triggers an overestimation of uranium production i e uranium dissolution is not kinetically limited thus we carried out a sensitivity test on the simulations including uraninite kinetics on the egm and results shows that they approximate closely to the field data fig 5c during the production phase the high fluid velocities in the injection and producer wells prevent uraninite from reaching its equilibrium which is why including the uraninite kinetics enables a better fit to the field data on the contrary during the post production phase higher ph and slow flow rate allow close to equilibrium conditions for uranium phases since the environmental impact is more related to uranium solubility than the actual stock of uranium the overestimation of uranium recovery during the production phase is acceptable for environmental impact simulations 3 2 2 validation of the environmental geochemical model on another production block e3 during the production phase the egm was tested on block e3 which is known for its different geological distribution and longer production duration results show that the egm successfully reproduces ph and acidity during the production phase fig 6 a c e the pgm underestimates ph by 0 1 ph units on average over 6 years compared to the egm but also overestimates the amount of acid recovered 28 more than the field data compared to the egm 10 more than the field data these results suggest that the egm correctly predicts the production conditions for ph and so4 that will determine the environmental footprint in the coming years after the closure of the production blocks however for block e3 the egm underestimates uranium production by 20 compared to field data fig 6b this discrepancy is explained by the slightly lower concentration of fe3 released in solution using the egm compared to the pgm fig 6d fe3 in solution contributes to uraninite oxidation according to reaction r 11 r 11 uo 2 s 2fe 3 uo 2 2 2fe 2 here aqueous fe3 is controlled by the dissolution of fe bearing oxides e g ferrihydrite and goethite and fe bearing clays e g beidellite which is controlled by their thermodynamic parameters in addition the two models differ in the initial concentration and their description of primary fe3 minerals goethite for the pgm and ferrihydrite for the egm 0 1 wt and 0 005 wt respectively altering its in situ release which is translated by a slight transient underestimation of oxidizing conditions this initial difference between the production and environmental models generates a lower concentration of dissolved fe aq during the first year of production fig 6d resulting in a lower production of uranium fig 6 b the fe oxides fraction on the mineral paragenesis has been already identified as a parameter to adjust the uranium production on the production models collet et al 2022 thus to better constrain uranium production during the first year on block e3 we increased the ferrihydrite fraction on the egm the results show that increasing the ferrihydrite fraction from 0 005 wt to 0 085 wt triggers a sufficient increase of fe aq to adjust the uranium produced to match the field data fig 6c and this also led to a good fit for the ph during the first year this observation highlights the usefulness of fe oxides as a parameter to adjust the uranium production nevertheless other mechanisms such as the difference in simulated ph between the production and environmental models also help to explain the difference in uranium production the less acidic ph simulated in the egm compared to the pgm induces a lower solubility for uraninite and ferric oxy hydroxides and subsequent lower aqueous concentrations of ferric iron and uranium validation on the other production block and for a longer duration demonstrates that aquifer conditions ph and acidity at the end of the production phase are well represented using the egm thus this validates the hypothesis that the egm could be used to predict the overall production conditions of a production block calculations are made in a similar timeframe using each model i e 6 years of production using a 334 879 grid cells requires 3 89 days and 4 15 days calculation time for the production and environmental models respectively using the same number of cpus but the pgm requires a lower computer ram capacity 512 gb compared to the egm 1024 gb 3 2 3 isr post production phase evaluating the environmental footprint on production block f3 the second set of simulations were dedicated to reproduce the pore water chemistry during and after the closure of the production blocks the simulations were run over a 10 year period i e 1 yr of production and 9 yr of post production assuming a constant background flow rate of 2 5 m y on block f3 here we compare the simulations with measured field data from monitored well p52 located at 50 m from the production block monitoring well p52 shows a constant ph of 8 over almost 10 years following the closure of the production block suggesting a low impact fig 7a moreover measured field data shows an increase of so4 ca and mg concentrations when compared to the aquifer baseline fig 7b d reactive transport simulations using both geochemical models show a good agreement between simulated and measured ph while predictions from reactive transport simulations using the egm are in good agreement with the measured concentrations of so4 ca and mg fig 7b c the pgm model underestimates these concentrations such a discrepancy is explained by consideration of the sorption reaction in the environmental geochemical model when the acidic saline plume reaches the monitoring well the ca and mg bearing minerals dissolve in addition cation exchange reactions in favor of h lead to the release of the sorbed ca and mg into the solution fig 9c and in turn the concentrations of aqueous ca and mg increase fig b si the pgm predicts a wider saline plume compared to the egm hence 2 years after the end of production a distance of 120 m from the head of the production block with ph 4 is predicted while a 60 m distance is calculated using the environmental model 60 m fig 8 thus the pgm overestimates the environmental impact the absence of a sorption process in the pgm leads to an overestimation of the h concentration in the groundwaters thus a more acidic ph plume furthermore when assessing remediation strategies a narrower saline plume is more manageable while this is a positive aspect this also implies that sorbed protons will constitute a long term source of acidity fig 9b c the influence of clay sorption is crucial during post production when the remaining buffer capacity in the aquifer drives ph above 4 5 due to the slow renewal of cations from the circulating fresh water the arrival of the fresh water dilutes the acidic and saline plume increasing the pore ph and drives out the h initially sorbed via cation exchange onto the clay minerals and increasing mainly the sorption in favor of ca and mg fig 9c in any case the lack of a sorption process in the geochemical model could lead to overestimating the environmental footprint in the vicinity of the extraction well fig 8b d thus a clay sorption process needs to be included in the geochemical model in order to simulate the natural attenuation or any remediation strategies which are critically dependent of the acidity reserve of h from the acidic plume the results presented in this section restate that the pgm satisfies the constraints of the operator and focuses mainly on the oxidation of uranium and the acid consumption however the geochemical reactions and geochemical processes i e sorption that may be considered as secondary to the production of uranium become critical when trying to assess the migration of chemicals of concern on longer time and larger space scales 3 3 sensitivity during the production phase the modeling focuses on a short duration and on very restricted areas demarcated by the location of the injection and extraction wells at production block scale in such an approach permeability and mineralogical composition clay minerals and uraninite distribution induce significant discrepancies in the ph of the aquifer and the predicted u production curves e g collet et al 2022 langanay et al 2021 however in the long term the evolution of the aquifer chemistry ph so4 aq will be controlled by the rate and the direction of the background flow rate within the aquifer in this section we propose a sensitivity study of these two parameters first a study of the role of clay fraction on the ph of the aquifer and second a sensitivity on the rate of the background flow these sensitivity analyses serve as a proxy to understand the effect of heterogeneities as discussed in collet et al 2022 local changes in parameters can provide a better description of the exploitation for individual wells for this purpose we do not aim at realizing stochastic simulations of permeabilities and uranium distributions within the reservoir 3 3 1 sensitivity test on the clay distribution the clay distribution in the reservoir was shown to be a relevant parameter during both the production phase and the natural attenuation phase fig 10a b during the production phase the simulations run with a relatively high beidellite content e g 5 wt show a slow decrease of ph compared to a lower beidellite content e g 1 and 2 5 wt a higher content will extend the time to reach clay proton saturation and the ph target 1 5 for instance after two months of acid injection in the vicinity of such a producer well 0 09 mol l of h are sorbed when considering 5 wt of beidellite for a lower beidellite content e g 1 wt the concentration of sorbed h decreases to 0 027 mol l these observations suggest the decrease of ph during the first months of acidification is mainly governed by the clay content in the reservoir thus a high clay content will retain a larger mass of sorbed protons which will make the acid conditions last longer fig 10b another key aspect here is that the simulations assume a homogenous distribution of clay content at the block scale regarding the mean ph across all the producer wells one would guess that 1 wt of clays fit the field data better fig 10a however regarding each individual producer well the ph is sometimes better fitted to the field data when considering for instance 2 5 wt clays fig 10d this corroborates the assumptions made by collet et al 2022 from a statistical analysis on 39 production blocks that the distribution of clay content in the reservoir is not homogeneous and may partially explain the discrepancies between field data and modeling results thus cationic sorption by clay minerals has shown to be a significant process that affects 1 the acidification phase and 2 the time needed to attain the initial baseline conditions after the closure of the blocks this demonstrates that clay sorption becomes a valuable parameter to adjust simulations with field data 3 3 2 sensitivity test on the background flow rate during the production phase an emphasis is made on the competition between the kinetics of the major reactions and the extraction dependent flow rates in the technological block e g 150 m3 h sum of the flow rate of 45 injectors meanwhile when considering a longer duration for the environmental post mining remediation the migration of the chemicals of concern is mainly governed by the natural flow of the aquifer in the order of m yr the background flow rate in the uyuk aquifer varies from 1 to 10 m y ben simon et al 2014 in order to evaluate the effect of flow rate on the chemical distribution of the aquifer after the closure of the technological block four simulations using the egm at variable flow rates of 1 2 5 5 and 10 m yr were performed the simulations on a monitoring well p52 located at almost 50 m from the boundary of block f3 are compared the simulations show that when the background flow rate is slow the monitor well experiences high concentrations of chemical elements such as h so4 ca and mg over time fig 11 a d and as the flow rate increases the concentrations decrease in the monitor well over time in order to explain this phenomenon we monitored the shape and size of the saline plume on the simulations at different flow rates and using the concentration of so4 tot as a tracer fig c si the results indicate that the shape and size of the contaminant plume are mainly governed by the flow system at slower regional flow rates e g 1 m y the limit of the so4 plume here defined as 3 times the baseline concentration of so4 aq on the aquifer reaches the monitoring well three years after the closure of the block slow flow triggers a slow renewal of fresh water in the aquifer and the contaminants remain longer in the contaminant plume i e are less diluted the saline plume shows a higher dispersion in the transverse direction east west compared to the direction of the background gradient flow north south fig c si however for flow rates ranging from 5 to 10 m y the saline plume barely reaches the monitored well this could explain the low modeled concentrations of so4 aq ca and mg in the monitor well which remain almost at the baseline conditions fig 11a d as expected a high flow rate accelerates the arrival of fresh water in the aquifer and pushes the migration of the contaminant plume in the same direction and in this case far from the monitor well thus the predominantly n s orientation of the plume misses the monitor well nevertheless it is not only the flow system that governs the direction and morphology of the plume the heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics e g permeability of the geological reservoir and the background flow system will together influence the flow pathways in the reservoir and in turn the morphology and orientation of the saline plume the simulations demonstrated that the simulated aqueous concentrations of so4 ca and mg on the monitor well over time are in best agreement with the observed data when considering a background flow rate of 2 5 m y also ph is better described using a background flow rate of 2 5 m y this shows evidence of the high uncertainty regarding the background flow rate in the sedimentary reservoir moreover for this particular case imposing a regional flow rate of 2 5 m y will underestimate the ph but overall fits the aqueous concentrations of so4 ca and mg the contaminant plume morphology and aqueous geochemistry could be influenced by the local flow distribution in addition the permeability distribution could locally modify the flow paths and influence the orientation of the saline plume for instance the arrival of contaminants at the monitor well will be slightly faster e g 10 4 m s when considering homogeneous highly permeable facies but the effect is negligible when considering the effect on the entire geological model fig d si these results show that in situ recovery is very complex with chemical reactions kinetic control and strong influence of hydrodynamic transport as was also highlighted by zhu et al 2001 and bain et al 2001 background flow can be considered as a key factor for natural attenuation 4 conclusions this paper presents an environmental geochemical model egm dedicated to performing 3d isr reactive transport simulations this model predominantly focuses on chemical aspects of concern such as ph so4 inherited from isr practices and the natural capacity of the aquifer to attenuate this acidification the model was validated on the katco mine on two independent blocks f3 and e3 which are located sufficiently far apart to exhibit different geological and geochemical characteristics and using monitored data sampled over 10 years after their closure the model was found to be very robust at the technological block and monitoring well scales accurately reproducing ph acid consumption and concentrations of so4 tot ca tot and mg tot over 1 to 6 years of production and 10 years of environmental monitoring after the closure of the blocks the robustness of this model is due to the complete mineral paragenesis determined by 11 minerals 18 surface sites for surface ion exchange reactions and 7 kinetic reactions consistent with internal mineralogical studies the model shows that incorporating two main geochemical processes 1 cationic sorption on clay surfaces smectite beidellite and 2 precipitation of so4 bearing phases here represented as gypsum caso4 2h2o successfully reproduces the measured data on production and monitoring wells at short and long term time scales the egm also shows a good reproducibility better than 90 of the acidity regarding the field data compared to the production model pgm 70 thus clay sorption and gypsum precipitation are an important bias for the production model and will allow production simulations to be more predictive for acid consumption furthermore modeling shows that proton sorption on clay surfaces acts as a sink term for acidity at very low ph protons overwhelmingly saturate sorption sites thus delaying aquifer acidification at the beginning of the production phase conversely slow release of sorbed protons slows down ph recovery after the end of acidification the clay fraction in the reservoir was shown to be a relevant parameter during the production phase and natural attenuation a higher content of clay minerals triggers a greater surface area where cations can be sorbed the strength of the production geochemical model pgm lies in its lower cpu intensity calculations are completed in a shorter time and require less cpu and ram capacity compared to the environmental geochemical model also since it was specifically designed to accurately represent uranium production during the production phase uranium production is better represented with the pgm in some particular cases the egm overestimates uranium production due to the absence of uraninite kinetics and in others an underestimation is explained by the lower concentration of fe3 released in solution when the geochemical conditions do not satisfy fe oxide dissolution e g molar fraction wt of fe oxides ferrihydrite long term reactions are excluded from the scope of the pgm simplifying hypotheses therefore use of the production model should be strictly limited to the production phase by extension the long term evolution post production cannot be accurately captured by the pgm at the end of production numerical modeling overestimates of the impact distances using the pgm compared to the egm this is largely explained by the sorption process which is only taken into account in the egm retaining protons for a longer period of time while this is a positive aspect this also implies that retained protons will constitute a long term source of acidity progressively depleted by the arrival of fresh water and the local buffering capacity sensitivity tests on the background flow rate show that 1 as expected as the rate of water renewal in the aquifer is faster desorption and dilution will be enhanced which will accelerate natural attenuation and 2 the rate of fresh water renewal will also control the shape of the contaminant plume faster rates contributing to concentrate the contaminants in the direction of the flow and to minimize lateral extension this effect might be modified by the presence of several possibly sequential blocks in the same area the geological and geochemical parameters used to fit the field data are different regarding the objectives of the simulations i e production and environmental model parameters such as the cationic sorption on clays and the background flow rate are imperative to accurately describe the post production period and to better estimate the natural attenuation this work contributes to the development of a tool for operators to be able to determine the short and long term environmental footprint of the production operation conditions and to adopt the best remediation strategy from natural attenuation to alternative remediation solutions such as bioremediation declaration of

1217,worldwide most uranium production relies on the in situ recovery isr extraction technique this consists of dissolving the ore using a leaching solution acid or alkaline directly within the deposit through a series of injection and extraction wells due to the nature of the injected isr solutions the water quality of the aquifer could be affected reactive transport modeling is a powerful tool for predicting fluid flow and geochemical reactions in isr reservoirs in this study we present a coupled 3d environmental geochemical model egm based on the hytec reactive transport software capable of predicting the physico chemical conditions in an acid leaching isr uranium mine and its environmental footprint on the aquifer in the years following the closure of the production block the model was validated at the katco mine kazakhstan on two different and independent production blocks over 10 years after their closure the model shows that incorporating two main geochemical processes 1 cationic sorption on clay surfaces smectite beidellite and 2 precipitation of gypsum caso4 2h2o successfully reproduces the measured well data ph acidity and so4 over short and long term time scales clay surface sites remain mostly saturated in protons during the production phase simulations show that sorbed protons on the clay surfaces maintains the acid conditions for a longer period of time the environmental impact model was also compared to a pre existing model specifically developed for production simulation purposes differences are observed as expected for the uranium production but also for the impact distances due to differences in the considered reactive mineralogical paragenesis thus the choice of geochemical model should be made with due regard for the desired objectives

australia and usa iaea 2016 märten 2006 uranium dissolution during acidic leaching is dominated by the oxidation of u iv bearing minerals e g uraninite and coffinite by fe3 in the bearing solution ben simon et al 2014 the presence of ferric iron is due to several mechanisms local dissolution and oxidation of gangue minerals goethite beidellite pyrite recirculation of fe3 from the well field and surface active regeneration of fe3 using hydrogen peroxide or other oxidants low ph typically 2 is required to allow significant ferric iron mobility lagneau et al 2019 the main environmental impacts associated with isr mining practices are related to the risk of water contamination in the mineralized and adjacent aquifers saunders et al 2016 the initial water conditions in the aquifer are disrupted due to the injection of acid solutions in the mineralized zone decreasing the ph and generating a saline plume depending on local regulations the objective of the remediation strategy is focused on the mine s aquifer and its remediation to return as closely as possible to its initial conditions natural attenuation is based partly on the geochemical ability of the geological host to buffer the chemical disturbances associated with the injection of the acid and oxidizing solutions and partly on the natural dilution of the saline plume generated during mining the attenuation of inorganic contaminants in the aquifer is achieved by a combination of complex physical including dispersion and diffusion and bio geochemical processes including precipitation sorption biotic and abiotic reactions christensen et al 2004 hall 2009 wu et al 2006a 2006b yabusaki et al 2007 2014 coral et al 2018 descostes et al 2014 these relevant processes operate on a wide range of reaction rates that may simultaneously require both kinetic and equilibrium treatment the only numerical models able to account for both reservoir geometries and flow and bio geochemical processes occurring within reservoirs are reactive transport models therefore reactive transport models are the de facto choice to study the phenomena of natural attenuation in the context of isr mining and to demonstrate that post production environmental targets can be reached lagneau et al 2019 these models have also proven to be efficient tools for increasing production via wellfield optimization and short and long term planning strategies even considering the residual geological uncertainty of the aquifer lagneau et al 2019 langanay et al 2021 collet et al 2022 therefore until now geochemical models have been developed for two different purposes on the one hand an isr production model satisfies the constraints of the operator and focuses mainly on the oxidation of uranium and the acid consumption during the production phase ranging from one year to a maximum of 12 lagneau et al 2019 collet et al 2022 modeling focuses on very restricted zones demarcated by the location of the injection and extraction wells production blocks in such approaches uranium dissolution and recovery and acid consumption are the main processes investigated within the mined geological formation bonnaud et al 2015 johnson and tutu 2016 lagneau et al 2019 regnault et al 2015 the production phase provides numerous data sets that contribute to an accurate calibration of the numerical models on the other hand an isr environmental model defines uranium production and focuses on the aquifer geochemical conditions e g ph so4 aq tds and radionuclide etc at the end of uranium extraction integrating the initial production phase of the production block and on the increase in concentration of long term chemical components in the targeted aquifer in order to predict its remediation de boissezon et al 2020 one of the limits of environmental models is the lack of available geochemical monitoring data during the life of the block s operations and after its closure which complicates calibration of the numerical models geochemical models developed for production and remediation differ on the number of chemical elements and processes to be considered and on their spatial and temporal constraints until now near field 3d simulations have been performed to simulate the production phase however the geochemical models adapted for the production phase do not take into account key geochemical processes that govern the remediation reactions e g cationic sorption on clay surfaces precipitation of secondary minerals and 226ra migration see de boissezon et al 2020 besançon et al 2020 limiting the ability of these models to properly predict changes in ph and the behavior of contaminants so4 226ra u during the production phase and over a longer duration 100 years until now the environmental impact of an isr mining site has been investigated over longer durations 20 years and distances 2 km using 2d far field simulations e g lagneau et al 2019 dong et al 2016 near field modeling has only recently been used in 2d for the umnut isr pilot in mongolia de boissezon et al 2020 the geochemical complexity of the system leads to computationally intensive modeling long duration cpu calculations so that 2d models are easier to handle however the behavior of the saline plume in the vicinity of the production blocks during and after the production phase depends largely on the local geology which exhibits significant vertical heterogeneity therefore it is imperative to be able to track the environmental footprint of a production block and surrounding area 2 km in 3d in this article we present a robust geochemical model dedicated to estimating the environmental impact of isr uranium production in the vicinity of a production block using 3d simulations for this work we have used the production and monitored data from the katco mine kazakhstan this work makes it possible to develop reactive transport models focused on the chemical changes during and after isr extraction based on water quality monitoring e g ph so4 ions cations and available mineralogical and hydrogeological data hence this model reconciles the simulations of uranium production with an environmental impact assessment this work contributes to the creation of a tool which will enable the operator to determine the short and long term environmental footprints of the production operation conditions and in turn will help to choose the appropriate remediation solution 2 methodology 2 1 overview of in situ recovery mining the isr mining technique is based on a variety of injection and producer well configurations fig 1 optimal configurations ensure a good circulation of the solutions through the mineralized zone and thereby effective leaching ward et al 1983 for instance the katco mine operates using a hexagonal pattern each production cell is composed of six injection wells acid leaching solution with an average input flow rate of 4 m3 h positioned around a producer well to recover the uranium rich solution with an average output flow rate of 8 12 m3 h with a typical distance of 42 m between an injection well and a producer well the layout of the wells is optimized to cover the entire mineralized surface with the minimum number of cells the cells are grouped into production technological blocks or production blocks with about 45 injection wells and 15 producer wells per block giving a total flow rate of 150 m3 h injected produced the u deposits exploited by the katco mine are located in the chu sarysu basin kazahastan the uyuk sedimentary formation is made up of medium sands combined with lenticular clay vertically constrained by two impermeable formations kizilchy on top and intymac underneath dahlkamp 2009 the natural background flow rate is 10 m yr ne kotchetkov et al 1987 in the uyuk aquifer values for total dissolved solids tds of around 1 g l were recorded before the commencement of isr mining i e baseline conditions at ph 8 subsequently the injection of the acid bearing solution into the aquifer triggerered changes in aquifer water quality conferring saline and acidic properties thus maintaining a neutral hydraulic balance the difference between the volumes injected and extracted on the same block limits the risks of a potential spread of leaching solutions outside the mine boundary jeuken et al 2009 a piezometric network was set up for environmental monitoring and to maintain optimal geochemical conditions within the aquifer to mitigate pollutant migration 2 2 modeled areas this study focuses on two of the production blocks modeled by collet et al 2022 referred to as f3 and e3 respectively fig 2 this choice is motivated by i one of the mine s densest networks of monitoring wells being in the vicinity of the two blocks fig 2 ii the relative isolation of these two blocks limiting the effects of neighboring blocks iii the inability of the production geochemical model used by collet et al 2022 to reproduce the ph observed over the entire life of the block f3 and at the beginning 1 year and the end of the production history for f3 which the authors attribute to the failure to account for sorption the 3d geological models well field dimensions and operational conditions imposed on the reservoir are strictly identical to those presented and used by collet et al 2022 and are briefly detailed in the following sections however as the model of collet et al 2022 is only designed for the production phase ph and u there is a lack of the main geochemical reactions that control the environmental processes so4 major cations ca2 mg2 k na h thus in this paper we describe a geochemical model including sorption reactions but also the background flow rate the model includes a more complete mineralogical reactive paragenesis than the one proposed by collet et al 2022 and is given in section 2 4 2 3 geological model the geological model is based on block models of the ore deposit using geological data drill core observations and geophysical logging and geostatistical reconstruction stochastic simulation methods from the katco mine for e3 and deterministic methods for f3 thus the 3d model is constructed using the geometry of the well field position of the wells length and depth of the screens on the whole thickness of the aquifer porosity was set to 20 and permeability varied from permeable 10 4 m s to relatively impermeable 10 9 m s respectively according to field observations ben simon et al 2014 mineral facies u mineralized reduced and oxidized are also distributed on the geological model according to geochemical and geophysical observations see supplementary information fig a the present study uses three 3d modeling meshes for block f3 1 45288 cells measuring 10 10 2 m in a volume of 370 680 36 m3 2 339660 cells measuring 5 5 1 m in a volume of 370 675 34 m3 and for block e3 3 334880 cells measuring 5 5 1 m in a volume of 455 490 40 m3 2 4 geochemical models the reactive transport simulations were performed using two alternative geochemical models the first geochemical model is specifically designed to simulate the uranium isr production phase here referred to as the production geochemical model pgm e g lagneau et al 2019 collet et al 2022 the pgm focuses on uranium production and reagent consumption other constraints of the model design were limiting the number of reactions to keep cpu time manageable and number of parameters for a more robust predictive capacity the second geochemical model is designed to simulate the environmental geochemical processes occurring in the aquifer due to isr uranium exploitation focusing on the evolution of groundwater quality herein referred to as the environmental geochemical model egm among other differences the egm puts a heavy focus on surface reactions for their capacity to control dissolved metal concentrations at intermediate ph also thermodynamic equilibrium is preferred to kinetic control when justified for its robustness fewer adjustment parameters simulating the aquifer water composition during and after isr extraction requires the construction of a geochemical model describing the water composition of the studied aquifer the sedimentary reservoir consists of a mildly cemented arkosic sandstone munara 2012 mathieu et al 2015 petrov 1998 with composition of around 70 quartz 10 feldspar 5 micas and 5 10 clay minerals mostly smectite and kaolinite authigenic smectite is mostly composed of beidellite with a significant fe iii content robin et al 2015b other minerals include goethite and pyrite 1 in the oxidized and reduced part of the aquifer respectively and a low concentration of calcite 0 1 finally uranium bearing minerals are found in the roll front mostly uraninite and coffinite at relatively low concentrations 0 1 the initial aquifer water composition was determined using base line monitoring table 1 the present environmental geochemical model describes a reactive mineral paragenesis compatible with the mineralogical observations which are in equilibrium with the interstitial water in the three roll front zones oxidized mineralized and reduced zones see fig 1 table 1 the proportions of minerals constituting the reactive paragenesis were chosen to respect the available total rock analyses the minerals were chosen to represent the reactivity of the system considering three mechanisms i precipitation dissolution at the thermodynamic equilibrium of the mineral phases calcite uraninite muscovite schoepite and gypsum ii precipitation dissolution of additional mineral phases taking into account the kinetics cristobalite microcline kaolinite beidellite ferrihydrite hydroxylapatite giammar 2001 palandri and kharaka 2004 robin et al 2015b rimstidt and barnes 1980 lagneau and van der lee 2010 table b supplementary material and iii the sorption of cations on the clay surfaces h na k ca mg uo2 the sorption of cations was considered on the three sorption sites of the beidellite surfaces due to the minor cation exchange capacity of kaolinite compared to beidellite robin et al 2017 following the gains thomas formalism see table c supplementary material the percentage of clays in the sediment was set to the same value for both the production and the environmental models 4 3 wt 2 5 wt beidellite and 1 8 wt kaolinite for block f3 and 3 wt 1 3 beidellite and 1 8 wt kaolinite for block e3 however the beidellite surface area was adjusted on the egm to fit the field aqueous chemistry e g ph for block f3 beidellite surface was set to 3 3 106 cm2 g on the egm and 6 6 106 cm2 g on the pgm this means that the available number of surface sites for fixed cations on the beidellite surface was divided by a factor of 2 between the models in addition for block e3 the same value 6 105 cm2 g was used for both models egm and pgm this means that the surface sites of beidellite are the same beidellite preserves its sorption properties during and after reaction with acid solutions robin et al 2020 the fe oxides ferrihydrite on the egm for blocks f3 and e3 were set to 0 005 wt which corresponds to a similar value on the pgm for block f3 in contrast with on block e3 one order of magnitude lower on the egm compared to the pgm goethite 0 1 wt thus the mineral paragenesis for the present environmental geochemical model is determined by 11 minerals 18 surface sites for ion exchange reactions and 7 kinetic reactions and is detailed in table 1 every mineral content is specified by facies while uraninite is spatially distributed on the mineralized facies thanks to the stochastic simulations 2 5 modeling tools the reactive transport modeling was carried out using hytec v 4 7 1 software coupling the chess geochemistry code v3 9 to an r2d2 fluid transport model lagneau and van der lee 2010 van der lee et al 2003 hytec is able to solve a multiphase multicomponent reactive system solving the solid liquid gas equilibrium taking into account a wide variety of geochemical processes cation exchange mineral dissolution precipitation the reactive transport algorithm is based on the sequential iterative algorithm carrayrou et al 2010 thus hytec provides a multipurpose flexible framework for solving complex hydrogeochemical problems lagneau and van der lee 2010 steefel et al 2015 in saturated or multiphase conditions it was successfully employed in benchmark studies carrayrou et al 2010 and for various applications e g cement degradation de windt and devillers 2010 seigneur et al 2020 geological storage of acid gases sin et al 2017 and the environmental impact mining activities seigneur et al 2021 including isr sites de boissezon et al 2020 for our simulations a saturated groundwater flow model was used calculations were run using machine capacities of 24 32 and 64 cpus the pgm was constructed using the llnl thermodynamic database delany and lundeen 1991 while the egm was constructed using a thermochemical database dedicated for mine environment purposes prodata v 1 1 0 4 reiller and descostes 2020 the prodata database was completed by incorporating the sorption exchange constants of major cations on clay surfaces the equilibrium constants for h na ca2 mg2 k and uo2 2 follow the gains thomas formalism robin et al 2015a robin et al 2017 simulations include boundary conditions which account for the natural background flow rate also the injection and extraction rates as well as the solution composition change through the simulation and are described as source terms for e3 and f3 as in most cases the blocks undergo an initial phase of intense acidification this relates to the re injection of the extracted waters to which significant amounts of acid are added 20 g l this phase which generally takes two to four months aims at reaching a ph below 2 then when the concentration of uranium in the recovered solution starts to increase the block is connected to the overall plant network the fluid composition is then influenced by the multiple circulations of the fluid over the whole well field the result is an accumulation of dissolved elements in the solution only uranium is extracted at the plant the model uses compositions in line with analyses at the plant and the acid content is adjusted daily by the operator as required so that the ph at the extraction well remains between 1 and 2 to ensure fe iii and u mobility and to limit the precipitation of secondary minerals lagneau et al 2019 in this study we present 18 reactive transport simulations performed using the two different geochemical models table a supplementary information on the two production blocks f3 and e3 the construction of the egm was performed on block f3 and its validation was carried out on block e3 which offers a longer extraction duration 7 yr vs 1 yr a set of sensitivity tests were performed on 1 the background flow rate from 1 m yr 2 5 m yr 5 m yr and 10 m yr and 2 the clay content 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactivity of the geochemical system the acidification of the aquifer induces geochemical reactions between the acid bearing solution and the minerals in the host rock lagneau et al 2019 to illustrate this we performed appropriate batch simulations fig 3 the simulations at equilibrium show the redistribution of the species solid aqueous and sorbed as a function of ph fig 3a b thus at acidic ph 1 5 dissolution reactions of the host rock bearing minerals result in an increase of the total dissolved solids tds of the aquifer fig 4 of over 1 g l due to the increase of ions such as so4 ca and na among others fig 3a originating from the composition of the acid leaching solution and the concomitant host rock dissolution the reactive transport isr modeling performed on block f3 shows that the principal mineral quartz sio2 from the mineral paragenesis undergoes negligible dissolution during the phase of 1 yr 0 01 on the technological block while dissolution of the host rock minerals e g calcite fe oxides hydroxylapatite microcline clays beidellite and kaolinite and clay sorption compromises acid consumption i e consumption of aqueous h during the acidification phase which buffers the ph and creates a delay of the acidification of the aquifer thus after one year of production on block f3 66 of the h injected was consumed by mineral dissolution r1 to r6 and aqueous reactions and 34 of the h injected was consumed by sorption on the clay surface r7 proton sorption on a clay surface acts as a sink term for acidity further delaying aquifer acidification r 7 which is consistent with the observations made by robin et al 2015b robin et al 2020 and collet et al 2022 the pgm underestimates the acid consumption by 80 1 62 1 on average for the investigated blocks during the first year of production reactions r1 to r7 are given as r 1 caco 3 s calcite 2h ca 2 aq co 2 aq h 2 o r 2 fe oh 3 s

expected batch simulations at equilibrium show that protons are the main cation sorbed during acid conditions e g ph 2 87 of sites are occupied by protons ca2 3 2 mg2 8 2 na 1 1 k 0 1 fig 3 on the same basis u bearing minerals are strongly dissolved by the acid as expected and oxidative leaching solutions originating from the dissolution of ferric minerals goethite ferrihydrite and beidellite result in oxidative uranium rich solutions as expected the injection of sulfuric acid led to a drastic increase in solution of sulfate ions and protons sulfate ions therefore constituted the major anion and could as a first approximation be considered as non reactive with the host formation here simulations on block f3 using the pgm determine that only 70 of the sulfuric acid injected is recovered by extraction by the end of the production phase when considering the absence of precipitation of sulfate bearing minerals this means that 30 of the sulfuric acid remains in the aquifer moreover the remaining aqueous sulfate within the production block is expected in a first stage to be diluted in the aquifer but also to slightly decrease by precipitation of so4 bearing minerals gypsum alunite jarosite in the vicinity of the production blocks lagneau et al 2019 before being reduced by autochthonous sulfato reducing bacteria coral et al 2016 bonnetti et al 2017 jroundi et al 2020 coral et al 2022 the egm includes gypsum precipitation in the mineral paragenesis defined by reaction r 8 r 8 ca 2 aq so 4 aq 2h 2 o caso 4 2h 2 o s thus environmental simulations show that after 1 year of production on block f3 26 of the sulfates injected were precipitated as gypsum i e 170 mol m3 so4 total injected t 1 year and 45 mol m3 of gypsum precipitated t 1 year which may constitute a long term sulfate source term within the aquifer as highlighted previously the sorption process on clay surfaces has a significant influence on the water composition fig 3a b clay surface sites can constitute an important sink term for cations including protons however this effect is limited mostly to the initial acidification phase of the production process when the ph is driven from neutral conditions ph 8 to 2 fig 3b for instance from the end of the acidification phase to the block closure ph 2 the proportion of ca2 and h sorbed represents 3 9 and 21 4 of the total concentration i e mineral aqueous sorbed of calcium and h in the system respectively the surface sites then remain mostly saturated in protons h during the production phase however the amount of sorbed protons remains negligible 0 001 when comparing the total acidity consumed 25 during the lifetime of a production block several years here represented as 1 year on block f3 as mentioned in previous studies e g lagneau et al 2019 de boissezon et al 2020 sorption influence is crucial during post exploitation when the remaining buffer capacity of the aquifer drives ph above 4 5 depending on the slow renewal of cations from circulating fresh waters i e clay minerals deprotonate thus the arrival of the fresh water dilutes the acidic and saline plume increasing the pore water ph and drives out the cations initially sorbed via cation exchange on the clay minerals mainly ca and mg in favor of the protons fig 3b the increase of ph in the contaminant plume rearranges the species distribution aqueous sorbed and solid species fig 3 likewise the ph changes may trigger the dissolution of the precipitated so4 bearing minerals during the exploitation phase however together with particle dispersion reducing conditions usually observed downstream of the natural hydraulic gradient of a roll front constitute the principal natural mechanisms involved in the attenuation of so4 lagneau et al 2019 coral et al 2016 bonnetti et al 2017 jroundi et al 2020 coral et al 2022 also ph neutralization can lead to the re precipitation of mineral phases such as carbonate bearing minerals decreasing the concentration of ca mg and co3 in solution both mechanisms contribute to decrease the total dissolved solids fig 4 3 2 applications for in situ recovery in this section we compare reactive transport simulations using both geochemical models pgm and egm with historical data in order to evaluate the feasibility of the egm during the uranium acidification phase the production phase and in the coming years after the closure of the production blocks in addition the validation robustness and the predictive quality of the egm on different production blocks production duration permeability and facies heterogeneity distribution etc are discussed 3 2 1 isr production phase the aim of the first set of simulations is to reproduce the acid consumption ph and uranium production observed at the block scale results are shown in fig 5 and fig 6 for blocks f3 and e3 respectively simulations 5 and 8 for block f3 and simulations 17and 18 for block e3 si table a the simulations were run over the production period of each considered block i e 1 y and 7 y for f3 and e3 respectively here we mention that 1 yr of production is very short compared to the 8 yr production average the results show the general ph in the extraction well network for simulated and measured field data which decreases from 8 to approximately 2 fig 5a here we emphasize that this data fig 5 6 refers to the cumulative flow from all the extraction wells of the technological block the simulated data for block f3 is in good agreement during the first two months 0 2 yr using the pgm compared to the egm showing a delay in the decrease of ph during the first months however from 0 3 yr the egm shows a good agreement between the simulated and measured field data both models have similar clay and calcite concentrations however the pgm does not include sorption processes which means that h remains in solution decreasing the ph or is consumed by rock mineral dissolution e g calcite in addition uncertainties on porosity and permeabilities have an impact when adjusting modeling data to field measurements differences in ph 0 2 years between both models also suggest the clay fraction could be used as a parameter to adjust the models and highlight the heterogeneity of the clay fraction in the reservoir it could control the amount of h sorbed during acidification on the first months until the clays are completely saturated on h this point will be discussed more in detail in the section 3 3 3 the egm is a better fit for the general ph measured in the extraction wells of block f3 for the longer duration 0 2 years compared to the pgm fig 5 protons are sorbed on the clay surfaces which controls the concentration of h in the aquifer and in turn the ph at ph 1 5 the fraction of h sorbed represents 80 of the total cationic exchange capacity fig 3 also general acidity and total acid consumed are better represented using the egm compared to the pgm fig 5b d the acidity is calculated according to eq 1 which considers the concentration of h hso4 and h2so4 excluding all the other so4 aqueous complexes such as caso4 0 1 acid h hs o 4 2 h 2 so 4 thus the good fit of the environmental simulations with the measured data is explained due to the good fit of the ph during the production phase fig 5a that controls eqs r 9 and r 10 according to r 9 hso 4 aq so 4 2 aq h r 10 h 2 so 4 aq so 4 2 aq 2h in addition we see that gypsum precipitation in the mineral paragenesis helps to control the concentration of sulfates in the aquifer however gypsum precipitation only decreases the amount of recovered acid by 2 5 a good estimation of sulfate concentration in the aquifer at the end of the production phase will contribute to a better long term estimation of the environmental footprint due to isr industrial practices total uranium produced in block f3 is better represented using the pgm rather than the egm fig 5c the egm considers thermodynamic equilibrium and in this case it triggers an overestimation of uranium production i e uranium dissolution is not kinetically limited thus we carried out a sensitivity test on the simulations including uraninite kinetics on the egm and results shows that they approximate closely to the field data fig 5c during the production phase the high fluid velocities in the injection and producer wells prevent uraninite from reaching its equilibrium which is why including the uraninite kinetics enables a better fit to the field data on the contrary during the post production phase higher ph and slow flow rate allow close to equilibrium conditions for uranium phases since the environmental impact is more related to uranium solubility than the actual stock of uranium the overestimation of uranium recovery during the production phase is acceptable for environmental impact simulations 3 2 2 validation of the environmental geochemical model on another production block e3 during the production phase the egm was tested on block e3 which is known for its different geological distribution and longer production duration results show that the egm successfully reproduces ph and acidity during the production phase fig 6 a c e the pgm underestimates ph by 0 1 ph units on average over 6 years compared to the egm but also overestimates the amount of acid recovered 28 more than the field data compared to the egm 10 more than the field data these results suggest that the egm correctly predicts the production conditions for ph and so4 that will determine the environmental footprint in the coming years after the closure of the production blocks however for block e3 the egm underestimates uranium production by 20 compared to field data fig 6b this discrepancy is explained by the slightly lower concentration of fe3 released in solution using the egm compared to the pgm fig 6d fe3 in solution contributes to uraninite oxidation according to reaction r 11 r 11 uo 2 s 2fe 3 uo 2 2 2fe 2 here aqueous fe3 is controlled by the dissolution of fe bearing oxides e g ferrihydrite and goethite and fe bearing clays e g beidellite which is controlled by their thermodynamic parameters in addition the two models differ in the initial concentration and their description of primary fe3 minerals goethite for the pgm and ferrihydrite for the egm 0 1 wt and 0 005 wt respectively altering its in situ release which is translated by a slight transient underestimation of oxidizing conditions this initial difference between the production and environmental models generates a lower concentration of dissolved fe aq during the first year of production fig 6d resulting in a lower production of uranium fig 6 b the fe oxides fraction on the mineral paragenesis has been already identified as a parameter to adjust the uranium production on the production models collet et al 2022 thus to better constrain uranium production during the first year on block e3 we increased the ferrihydrite fraction on the egm the results show that increasing the ferrihydrite fraction from 0 005 wt to 0 085 wt triggers a sufficient increase of fe aq to adjust the uranium produced to match the field data fig 6c and this also led to a good fit for the ph during the first year this observation highlights the usefulness of fe oxides as a parameter to adjust the uranium production nevertheless other mechanisms such as the difference in simulated ph between the production and environmental models also help to explain the difference in uranium production the less acidic ph simulated in the egm compared to the pgm induces a lower solubility for uraninite and ferric oxy hydroxides and subsequent lower aqueous concentrations of ferric iron and uranium validation on the other production block and for a longer duration demonstrates that aquifer conditions ph and acidity at the end of the production phase are well represented using the egm thus this validates the hypothesis that the egm could be used to predict the overall production conditions of a production block calculations are made in a similar timeframe using each model i e 6 years of production using a 334 879 grid cells requires 3 89 days and 4 15 days calculation time for the production and environmental models respectively using the same number of cpus but the pgm requires a lower computer ram capacity 512 gb compared to the egm 1024 gb 3 2 3 isr post production phase evaluating the environmental footprint on production block f3 the second set of simulations were dedicated to reproduce the pore water chemistry during and after the closure of the production blocks the simulations were run over a 10 year period i e 1 yr of production and 9 yr of post production assuming a constant background flow rate of 2 5 m y on block f3 here we compare the simulations with measured field data from monitored well p52 located at 50 m from the production block monitoring well p52 shows a constant ph of 8 over almost 10 years following the closure of the production block suggesting a low impact fig 7a moreover measured field data shows an increase of so4 ca and mg concentrations when compared to the aquifer baseline fig 7b d reactive transport simulations using both geochemical models show a good agreement between simulated and measured ph while predictions from reactive transport simulations using the egm are in good agreement with the measured concentrations of so4 ca and mg fig 7b c the pgm model underestimates these concentrations such a discrepancy is explained by consideration of the sorption reaction in the environmental geochemical model when the acidic saline plume reaches the monitoring well the ca and mg bearing minerals dissolve in addition cation exchange reactions in favor of h lead to the release of the sorbed ca and mg into the solution fig 9c and in turn the concentrations of aqueous ca and mg increase fig b si the pgm predicts a wider saline plume compared to the egm hence 2 years after the end of production a distance of 120 m from the head of the production block with ph 4 is predicted while a 60 m distance is calculated using the environmental model 60 m fig 8 thus the pgm overestimates the environmental impact the absence of a sorption process in the pgm leads to an overestimation of the h concentration in the groundwaters thus a more acidic ph plume furthermore when assessing remediation strategies a narrower saline plume is more manageable while this is a positive aspect this also implies that sorbed protons will constitute a long term source of acidity fig 9b c the influence of clay sorption is crucial during post production when the remaining buffer capacity in the aquifer drives ph above 4 5 due to the slow renewal of cations from the circulating fresh water the arrival of the fresh water dilutes the acidic and saline plume increasing the pore ph and drives out the h initially sorbed via cation exchange onto the clay minerals and increasing mainly the sorption in favor of ca and mg fig 9c in any case the lack of a sorption process in the geochemical model could lead to overestimating the environmental footprint in the vicinity of the extraction well fig 8b d thus a clay sorption process needs to be included in the geochemical model in order to simulate the natural attenuation or any remediation strategies which are critically dependent of the acidity reserve of h from the acidic plume the results presented in this section restate that the pgm satisfies the constraints of the operator and focuses mainly on the oxidation of uranium and the acid consumption however the geochemical reactions and geochemical processes i e sorption that may be considered as secondary to the production of uranium become critical when trying to assess the migration of chemicals of concern on longer time and larger space scales 3 3 sensitivity during the production phase the modeling focuses on a short duration and on very restricted areas demarcated by the location of the injection and extraction wells at production block scale in such an approach permeability and mineralogical composition clay minerals and uraninite distribution induce significant discrepancies in the ph of the aquifer and the predicted u production curves e g collet et al 2022 langanay et al 2021 however in the long term the evolution of the aquifer chemistry ph so4 aq will be controlled by the rate and the direction of the background flow rate within the aquifer in this section we propose a sensitivity study of these two parameters first a study of the role of clay fraction on the ph of the aquifer and second a sensitivity on the rate of the background flow these sensitivity analyses serve as a proxy to understand the effect of heterogeneities as discussed in collet et al 2022 local changes in parameters can provide a better description of the exploitation for individual wells for this purpose we do not aim at realizing stochastic simulations of permeabilities and uranium distributions within the reservoir 3 3 1 sensitivity test on the clay distribution the clay distribution in the reservoir was shown to be a relevant parameter during both the production phase and the natural attenuation phase fig 10a b during the production phase the simulations run with a relatively high beidellite content e g 5 wt show a slow decrease of ph compared to a lower beidellite content e g 1 and 2 5 wt a higher content will extend the time to reach clay proton saturation and the ph target 1 5 for instance after two months of acid injection in the vicinity of such a producer well 0 09 mol l of h are sorbed when considering 5 wt of beidellite for a lower beidellite content e g 1 wt the concentration of sorbed h decreases to 0 027 mol l these observations suggest the decrease of ph during the first months of acidification is mainly governed by the clay content in the reservoir thus a high clay content will retain a larger mass of sorbed protons which will make the acid conditions last longer fig 10b another key aspect here is that the simulations assume a homogenous distribution of clay content at the block scale regarding the mean ph across all the producer wells one would guess that 1 wt of clays fit the field data better fig 10a however regarding each individual producer well the ph is sometimes better fitted to the field data when considering for instance 2 5 wt clays fig 10d this corroborates the assumptions made by collet et al 2022 from a statistical analysis on 39 production blocks that the distribution of clay content in the reservoir is not homogeneous and may partially explain the discrepancies between field data and modeling results thus cationic sorption by clay minerals has shown to be a significant process that affects 1 the acidification phase and 2 the time needed to attain the initial baseline conditions after the closure of the blocks this demonstrates that clay sorption becomes a valuable parameter to adjust simulations with field data 3 3 2 sensitivity test on the background flow rate during the production phase an emphasis is made on the competition between the kinetics of the major reactions and the extraction dependent flow rates in the technological block e g 150 m3 h sum of the flow rate of 45 injectors meanwhile when considering a longer duration for the environmental post mining remediation the migration of the chemicals of concern is mainly governed by the natural flow of the aquifer in the order of m yr the background flow rate in the uyuk aquifer varies from 1 to 10 m y ben simon et al 2014 in order to evaluate the effect of flow rate on the chemical distribution of the aquifer after the closure of the technological block four simulations using the egm at variable flow rates of 1 2 5 5 and 10 m yr were performed the simulations on a monitoring well p52 located at almost 50 m from the boundary of block f3 are compared the simulations show that when the background flow rate is slow the monitor well experiences high concentrations of chemical elements such as h so4 ca and mg over time fig 11 a d and as the flow rate increases the concentrations decrease in the monitor well over time in order to explain this phenomenon we monitored the shape and size of the saline plume on the simulations at different flow rates and using the concentration of so4 tot as a tracer fig c si the results indicate that the shape and size of the contaminant plume are mainly governed by the flow system at slower regional flow rates e g 1 m y the limit of the so4 plume here defined as 3 times the baseline concentration of so4 aq on the aquifer reaches the monitoring well three years after the closure of the block slow flow triggers a slow renewal of fresh water in the aquifer and the contaminants remain longer in the contaminant plume i e are less diluted the saline plume shows a higher dispersion in the transverse direction east west compared to the direction of the background gradient flow north south fig c si however for flow rates ranging from 5 to 10 m y the saline plume barely reaches the monitored well this could explain the low modeled concentrations of so4 aq ca and mg in the monitor well which remain almost at the baseline conditions fig 11a d as expected a high flow rate accelerates the arrival of fresh water in the aquifer and pushes the migration of the contaminant plume in the same direction and in this case far from the monitor well thus the predominantly n s orientation of the plume misses the monitor well nevertheless it is not only the flow system that governs the direction and morphology of the plume the heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics e g permeability of the geological reservoir and the background flow system will together influence the flow pathways in the reservoir and in turn the morphology and orientation of the saline plume the simulations demonstrated that the simulated aqueous concentrations of so4 ca and mg on the monitor well over time are in best agreement with the observed data when considering a background flow rate of 2 5 m y also ph is better described using a background flow rate of 2 5 m y this shows evidence of the high uncertainty regarding the background flow rate in the sedimentary reservoir moreover for this particular case imposing a regional flow rate of 2 5 m y will underestimate the ph but overall fits the aqueous concentrations of so4 ca and mg the contaminant plume morphology and aqueous geochemistry could be influenced by the local flow distribution in addition the permeability distribution could locally modify the flow paths and influence the orientation of the saline plume for instance the arrival of contaminants at the monitor well will be slightly faster e g 10 4 m s when considering homogeneous highly permeable facies but the effect is negligible when considering the effect on the entire geological model fig d si these results show that in situ recovery is very complex with chemical reactions kinetic control and strong influence of hydrodynamic transport as was also highlighted by zhu et al 2001 and bain et al 2001 background flow can be considered as a key factor for natural attenuation 4 conclusions this paper presents an environmental geochemical model egm dedicated to performing 3d isr reactive transport simulations this model predominantly focuses on chemical aspects of concern such as ph so4 inherited from isr practices and the natural capacity of the aquifer to attenuate this acidification the model was validated on the katco mine on two independent blocks f3 and e3 which are located sufficiently far apart to exhibit different geological and geochemical characteristics and using monitored data sampled over 10 years after their closure the model was found to be very robust at the technological block and monitoring well scales accurately reproducing ph acid consumption and concentrations of so4 tot ca tot and mg tot over 1 to 6 years of production and 10 years of environmental monitoring after the closure of the blocks the robustness of this model is due to the complete mineral paragenesis determined by 11 minerals 18 surface sites for surface ion exchange reactions and 7 kinetic reactions consistent with internal mineralogical studies the model shows that incorporating two main geochemical processes 1 cationic sorption on clay surfaces smectite beidellite and 2 precipitation of so4 bearing phases here represented as gypsum caso4 2h2o successfully reproduces the measured data on production and monitoring wells at short and long term time scales the egm also shows a good reproducibility better than 90 of the acidity regarding the field data compared to the production model pgm 70 thus clay sorption and gypsum precipitation are an important bias for the production model and will allow production simulations to be more predictive for acid consumption furthermore modeling shows that proton sorption on clay surfaces acts as a sink term for acidity at very low ph protons overwhelmingly saturate sorption sites thus delaying aquifer acidification at the beginning of the production phase conversely slow release of sorbed protons slows down ph recovery after the end of acidification the clay fraction in the reservoir was shown to be a relevant parameter during the production phase and natural attenuation a higher content of clay minerals triggers a greater surface area where cations can be sorbed the strength of the production geochemical model pgm lies in its lower cpu intensity calculations are completed in a shorter time and require less cpu and ram capacity compared to the environmental geochemical model also since it was specifically designed to accurately represent uranium production during the production phase uranium production is better represented with the pgm in some particular cases the egm overestimates uranium production due to the absence of uraninite kinetics and in others an underestimation is explained by the lower concentration of fe3 released in solution when the geochemical conditions do not satisfy fe oxide dissolution e g molar fraction wt of fe oxides ferrihydrite long term reactions are excluded from the scope of the pgm simplifying hypotheses therefore use of the production model should be strictly limited to the production phase by extension the long term evolution post production cannot be accurately captured by the pgm at the end of production numerical modeling overestimates of the impact distances using the pgm compared to the egm this is largely explained by the sorption process which is only taken into account in the egm retaining protons for a longer period of time while this is a positive aspect this also implies that retained protons will constitute a long term source of acidity progressively depleted by the arrival of fresh water and the local buffering capacity sensitivity tests on the background flow rate show that 1 as expected as the rate of water renewal in the aquifer is faster desorption and dilution will be enhanced which will accelerate natural attenuation and 2 the rate of fresh water renewal will also control the shape of the contaminant plume faster rates contributing to concentrate the contaminants in the direction of the flow and to minimize lateral extension this effect might be modified by the presence of several possibly sequential blocks in the same area the geological and geochemical parameters used to fit the field data are different regarding the objectives of the simulations i e production and environmental model parameters such as the cationic sorption on clays and the background flow rate are imperative to accurately describe the post production period and to better estimate the natural attenuation this work contributes to the development of a tool for operators to be able to determine the short and long term environmental

1218,karst springs are globally important for drinking water supply but are often also exceptionally vulnerable to contamination such springs usually exhibit strong variation in microbial water quality in sharp response to rainfall events thus posing a health hazard to consumers of water supplied from these sources the rapid detection of such changes is extremely important as well as being able to establish a link to the sources of such pollution so that appropriate measures can be taken both in terms of immediate protection of human health and the management of karst aquifers in this study a fluorescence based multi parameter approach was trialed in order to evaluate which methods can be used to monitor rainfall induced rapid changes in microbial water quality at karst springs as well as determine whether such changes can be linked to sources of human effluent contamination the results from three monitoring periods at two karst springs revealed marked responses to rainfall events for all of the microbial parameters measured total cell count tcc measurements using flow cytometry fcm showed very strong positive correlations with the more conventionally monitored faecal indicator bacteria fib and total coliforms tc indicating that such a fluorescence based and cultivation independent technique can be very useful to indicate rapid changes in microbial water quality at karst springs furthermore very strong positive correlations were also found between tryptophan like fluorescence tlf measurements and concentrations of all monitored microbial parameters again demonstrating that such a fluorescence based approach can also be useful for detecting rapid changes in concentrations of traditional faecal indicators interestingly it was found that fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs signals do not necessarily follow temporal variations of microbial indicators however the frequency of detection of positive fwcs signals may still reveal useful information

around 9 of the global population stevanović 2019 however karst aquifers are often exceptionally vulnerable to contamination because of commonly thin soil coverage with a low field capacity above the highly weathered upper part of the karst system epikarst and or the rapid infiltration into the groundwater system directly through discrete flowpaths i e swallow holes also known as ponors and closed depressions also known as dolines such pathways can connect directly into the highly conductive network of solutionally enlarged conduits where turbulent flow conditions generally dominate which finally discharge at springs thorn and coxon 1992 vesper et al 2001 white and white 2005 hillebrand et al 2012 gutiérrez and gutiérrez 2016 these exacerbate the threats to karst groundwater contamination through concentrated inputs of faecal point and non point sources which have been regularly observed worldwide kaçaroğlu 1999 heinz et al 2009 coxon 2011 in rural and suburban areas wastewater effluent from on site domestic wastewater treatment systems dwtss and agricultural sources are considered among the most significant threats to groundwater quality many incidences of waterborne diseases can be associated with contamination of surface water and groundwater due to failing on site domestic wastewater treatment systems fetter 2001 who 2003 therefore the potential impacts of domestic wastewater effluent contaminants especially in cases of inadequate performance or failure of dwtss e g due to poor maintenance design or siting are of particular interest in the management of karst aquifers due to their high vulnerability katz et al 2011 springs provide appropriate natural locations for monitoring pollutant concentration dynamics in karst aquifer systems as they provide an integrated picture of contaminant transport through a karst conduit network compared to wells and boreholes which are not necessarily directly connected to the most transmissive parts of the aquifer geyer et al 2007 karst springs often have strong and rapid variations in microbial water quality in response to rainfall events pronk et al 2007 posing a health hazard to consumers of water supplied from these sources katz et al 2011 hence being able to detect such rapid changes in faecal bacteria concentrations during and or after rain event conditions at karst springs used for water supply is critical as well as being able to establish the sources of the pollution so that appropriate measures can be taken both in terms of immediate protection of human health and the management of karst aquifers unfortunately conventional and advanced microbiological methods e g standard methods for culturing bacteria microbial source tracking etc are usually either very expensive complex labour intensive and or time consuming nrc us 2004 nemati et al 2016 savio et al 2018 and more such limitations therefore diminish their value in terms of rapid assessment of variations in microbial water quality and the potential public health risks from waterborne diseases in karst terrains accordingly the suitability of various surrogate techniques with easy to measure indicators e g turbidity doc toc etc of microbial water contamination in karst environments has been explored in the past thurman 1985 pronk et al 2006 2007 allen et al 2008 heinz et al 2009 ender et al 2017 frank et al 2018 and more flow cytometry fcm is emerging as a very promising fluorescence based and cultivation independent technique in environmental microbiology as a result of the ability of flow cytometers to rapidly quantify bacteria and discriminate them from debris after staining the bacterial dna with fluorescent dyes gatza et al 2013 prest et al 2016 safford and bischel 2019 have identified and examined nearly 300 studies from the last two decades mainly focused on fcm applications in water treatment distribution and reuse but conclude that more research is needed in order to realise the full potential of fcm moreover although extensive research has been carried out on the monitoring and assessment of drinking water quality e g hammes et al 2008 de roy et al 2012 prest et al 2016 and the characterisation of microbial communities e g hammes and egli 2010 van nevel et al 2013 using fcm studies in karst aquifer systems are still rare e g sinreich et al 2014 besmer et al 2017 page et al 2017 vucinic et al 2022 nevertheless on the basis of these previous studies in karst aquifer systems it seems clear that flow cytometric rapid counting of total cell counts tcc could be a very useful approach to track precipitation induced contamination events at karst springs and thereby improve our understanding of microbial contamination dynamics in karst systems fluorescence spectrometry has been used in the past for assessing surface water and groundwater quality and identifying human wastewater pollution impacts baker 2002 cumberland et al 2012 baker et al 2015 carstea et al 2016 nowicki et al 2019 ward et al 2021 and more since the intensity of fluorescence detected at different excitation emission wavelengths can be used to identify pollution and or the potential origin of compounds carstea et al 2020 for example dissolved humic substances in natural water are mainly derived from dead and decaying soil detritus aquatic plants animals and debris hongve 1999 with fulvic substances derived predominantly from tree and plant residues chen et al 2003 however it should be noted that bacteria may also produce compounds that fluoresce at humic like wavelengths fox et al 2021 aquatic protein like fluorescence which is less well understood than humic and fulvic like fluorescence is linked to a mixture of amino acids free or bound in proteins and or other organic materials with similar fluorescence characteristics and is generally described as an indicator of biologic activity fellman et al 2010 frank et al 2018 sorensen et al 2020 it has been shown to be the dominant form of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in domestic on site wastewater effluent dubber et al 2021 tryptophan like fluorescence tlf is a term that describes fluorescence occurring from a range of compounds generally aromatic and proteinaceous compounds that share similar fluorescence properties to the amino acid tryptophan baker 2002 sorensen et al 2018a notably in controlled laboratory studies e coli cells have been proven to directly emit tlf as well as to excrete compounds that fluoresce in the tlf region dalterio et al 1986 1987 dartnel et al 2013 fox et al 2017 hence tryptophan like fluorescence has been evaluated and in many cases used successfully as an indicator of faecal contamination e g thermotolerant faecal coliforms in drinking water supplies and groundwater sorensen et al 2015 2016 2018a 2021 ward et al 2021 and more more specifically frank et al 2018 evaluated tlf as a part of their fluorescence based multi parameter approach conducted at alpine karst springs while sorensen et al 2018b conducted fluorescence based multi parameter approach at springs and boreholes in karst environments moreover frank et al 2021 evaluated transport properties of dissolved tryptophan in karst and demonstrated that the transport properties of tryptophan are similar to those of uranine conservative dye tracer commonly used for conducting artificial tracer tests in karst aquifer systems fluorescence based approaches can also be used to target well known source specific chemical markers of human wastewater origin known as fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs and therefore help to link groundwater pollution with dwts impacts in rural and suburban areas and or to assess the magnitude of human wastewater impact on groundwater fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs also known as fluorescent whitening agents and optical brighteners are added to common liquid and powder laundry detergents due to their ability to make fabrics appear brighter in colour and prevent yellow staining and fading over time poiger et al 1998 hartel et al 2007 cao et al 2009 hagedorn and weisberg 2009 dubber and gill 2017 the most commonly used fwcs in laundry detergents include the distyrylbiphenyl types such as distyrylbiphenylsulfonate dsbp and stilbene types such as the diaminostilbene das 1 dubber and gill 2017 the use of washing detergents in modern households makes these compounds ubiquitous in human wastewater therefore they enter the environment through the discharge of domestic wastewater effluents poiger et al 1998 cao et al 2009 dubber and gill 2017 fennell et al 2021 especially from failing dwtss maswabi 2015 the specificity solubility and low potential for biodegradability of fwcs in the environment have led to studies into their use as a tracer of wastewater contamination in surface waters and groundwater tran et al 2015 fennell et al 2021 the main objectives of this study were to assess whether multiple different fluorescence approaches total cell counts tryptophan like fluorescence and fluorescent whitening compounds can be used to identify rapid changes in microbial water quality at karst springs associated with rainfall events and whether such variations in microbial indicators can be linked to contamination by dwts effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling this study focuses on two karst springs in ireland which are herein named based on the closest locality or town elmvale spring and ballindine spring fig 1 elmvale spring see also figs s1 s5 in supporting information is one of the largest karst springs in the west of ireland but has never been used as a drinking water supply since the source is extremely vulnerable to contamination cronin and deakin 2000 gsi 2020 the zone of contribution of elmvale spring is 131 1 km2 epa 2020 dinantian pure bedded limestones underlie roughly 90 of this catchment with overlying shallow well drained mineral soils and or areas with bedrock at or close to the surface within 1 m of the surface in almost 85 of the catchment with some namurian shales overlain by peaty subsoils and sandstones within the zone of contribution of the spring in the western part of the catchment cronin and deakin 2000 gsi 2020 this spring appears at several outlets within the limestone formation with the vast majority of the groundwater emerging from a 3 m high limestone cliff over a distance of approximately 80 m drew 1988 the aquifer has been described as conduit flow dominated and some rapid groundwater velocities recorded in this area between 10 and 110 m h suggest the presence of relatively sizeable conduits drew and daly 1993 gsi 2020 elmvale spring responds rapidly to rainfall even during the summer months and appears to be fed significantly by diffuse input recharge drew 1988 rather than by sinking streams this catchment has a mixed land use with open spaces with little or no vegetation mixed forest pastures grasslands and arable land clc 2018 epa 2020 the density of dwtss in the zone of contribution to elmvale spring is approx 3 per km2 however a high percentage of on site domestic wastewater treatment systems 10 5 are located within 200 m of at least one karst feature such as swallow hole estavelle or turlough that can provide a pathway for the rapid transport of such effluent and associated contaminants into the karst aquifer system these values were calculated using epa ireland geodirectory data for dwtss and karst features data from gsi 2020 as explained in section 2 4 ballindine spring see also figs s6 s10 in supporting information is a locally significant karst spring that was used for the town s with the same name water supply up to june 2010 at which point it was abandoned as a water source due to continual contamination incidences this small agricultural land use is almost entirely described as pastures grasslands catchment 3 4 km2 clc 2018 epa 2020 gsi 2020 has no visible karst features at the surface that can provide direct transport of contaminants into the karst aquifer system such as swallow holes and estavelles however it should be noted that some enclosed depressions have been recently mapped and reported by schuler et al 2021 moreover recent hydrological studies of the catchment have shown that under moderate recharge conditions the aquifer has a damped response to rainfall but during higher sustained recharge conditions the spring becomes connected to a nearby river via a high level conduit providing a much faster response to rainfall events schuler et al 2021 the bedrock geology of this catchment consists of the dinantian pure bedded limestones gsi 2020 with mainly carboniferous limestone tills and deep well drained mineral soils overlying the limestone formation epa 2020 hence the groundwater vulnerability which in ireland is defined on the basis of the thickness and permeability of the subsoils overlying the bedrock aquifer as explained in doelg epa gsi 1999 in detail in the catchment is split between high moderate and low with depth to bedrock being 3 m in 98 of the catchment gsi 2020 the density of dwtss is very high at almost 13 dwts per km2 calculated as explained in section 2 4 in total three continuous sampling campaigns targeted across rain events were conducted for the purpose of this study elmvale spring was continuously sampled on two occasions el1 in december 2018 and el2 in january 2020 and ballindine spring once bd1 in january 2020 samples were collected every hour for 24 h on all three occasions el1 el2 and bd1 using isco portable automatic samplers 6712 model with 24 1000 ml sterile polypropylene sampling bottles teledyne technologies inc ca usa the sampling tube was automatically rinsed and purged several times before collecting each sample to avoid stagnation and cross contamination all samples collected during the three continuous sampling periods were analysed for total cell counts tcc total coliforms tc and faecal indicator bacteria e coli and enterococci turbidity and presence of fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs in addition to these analyses tryptophan like fluorescence tlf was measured in samples collected during the el2 and bd1 sampling periods samples were collected directly at the karst spring outlets and required several different storage protocols to ensure the rigorousness of the different subsequent analysis results as detailed in the following sections 2 2 standard and fluorescence based microbiological analyses microbiological analyses in this study included fluorescence based and cultivation independent measurements of tcc using flow cytometry as well as standard methods for quantification of total coliforms and faecal indicator bacteria e coli and enterococci all samples were transported to the laboratory after the sampling events in cool boxes where they were analysed immediately upon arrival before the flow cytometry analysis of tcc samples were pre treated and diluted in physiologic phosphate buffered saline containing 0 2 pluronic f68 and 1 mmol l edta which has been previously passed through a 0 22 μm syringe filter in the next step the eawag swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology and bd biosciences staining protocol for rapid counting of tcc was followed see gatza et al 2013 for details after staining with thiazole orange the parent compound of sybr stain family that stains all cells and enables discrimination of cells from debris all tubes with individual samples were capped vortexed for 30 s and incubated 37 c in the dark for 10 min samples were analysed at the flow cytometry facility the school of biochemistry and immunology at trinity college dublin biomedical sciences institute using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer and a software analysis template with predefined workspace instrument settings fixed gates and parameters developed by researchers at eawag as described in detail in gatza et al 2013 all fcm tcc measurements were performed in triplicate for quality control and statistical analysis with a constant medium flow rate of the instrument during data acquisition process in order to achieve comparable data aseptic techniques were employed for each microbiological analysis performed at the environmental engineering department laboratory at trinity college dublin for the presence absence and the most probable numbers mpns per 100 ml of total coliforms tc e coli and enterococci ent these analyses were carried out using idexx colilert 18 iso 9308 2 and idexx enterolert e iso 7899 1 test kits in conjunction with the idexx quanti tray 2000 and idexx quanti tray sealer each individual quanti tray with sample mixed with an appropriate powder from the test kits was incubated at 35 c for 18 h for tc and e coli analysis and at 41 c for 24 h for ent analysis after incubation the number of large and small wells that were positive based on a colour change and or uv fluorescence were counted and these counts were converted into results using the idexx mpn generator 1 4 4 software for quality control three samples were randomly selected during each analysis session and analysed in duplicate or triplicate 2 3 fluorescence based analysis of compounds the fluorescence based analysis of compounds included measurements of signals originating from fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs as well as tryptophan like fluorescence tlf measurements of compounds that share similar fluorescence properties to the amino acid tryptophan as follows samples for fwcs analysis were transferred from the automatic samplers directly into amber glass bottles to protect samples from uv light and kept in cool boxes during the transfer from the field to the laboratory where they were stored in the fridge until analysis within 72 h the analysis for fwcs was performed in the laboratory located in the school of chemistry at trinity college dublin using a ls55 fluorescence spectrometer perkin elmer massachusetts and pmma cuvettes with 10 mm optical path length the emission wavelength was set at λem 436 nm with a slit width of either 5 or 10 nm the presence or absence of fwcs in karst spring samples was determined using the photodecay method recommended by dubber and gill 2017 the photodecay of the samples was measured in triplicate by recording the fluorescence signal after 0 1 and 10 min of exposure to uv light a dark box containing a sun lamp with 4 philips cleo 15 w uv tubes was used to control uv exposure the sample cuvettes were placed into a ldpe holder centrally positioned in front of the uv tubes at a height and distance of 16 and 5 cm respectively ventilation of the box was maintained throughout each exposure to minimise any heat accumulation the ratio of the reduction after 1 min to the reduction after 10 min of uv exposure was determined and samples with a ratio 1 10 min 0 25 were considered to contain fwcs dubber and gill 2017 tlf analysis was performed using a portable uvilux fluorimeter λex 280 nm λem 360 nm chelsea technologies group ltd uk by immersing probe in the groundwater sample in the dark as explained in sorensen et al 2015 the sensor utilises a uv light emitting diode led light source and a miniature photomultiplier detector allowing a high level of sensitivity the calibration of the instrument was done by the manufacturer before the sampling periods tryptophan like fluorescence is reported in quinine sulphate units qsu 2 4 other analyses and data turbidity in karst groundwater samples was measured in each collected sample with a hi9829 multiparameter instrument hanna instruments usa which was calibrated according to the manufacturer s instructions prior to each field sampling campaign rainfall data were obtained from the local irish meteorological service met eireann stations located at 7 2 km from elmvale spring and 5 9 km from ballindine spring respectively for logistical reasons it was not possible to gauge either spring for flows the densities of dwtss in the zone of contribution of springs as well as the percentages of dwtss in the catchments that are within 200 m of at least one karst feature such as swallow hole estavelle or turlough were calculated using arcgis 10 7 1 with dwtss layers obtained from the epa ireland geodirectory under the same conditions as explained in gill and mockler 2016 and karst features data from gsi 2020 statistical analysis was carried out in r environment r core team 2020 a significance level of 0 05 is used throughout this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 first monitoring event at elmvale spring the results of the first continuous sampling at elmvale spring in response to a rain event el1 in december 2018 sampling started on the 4th december at 1 pm are presented in fig 2 it should be noted that prior to the start of the el1 sampling no rain had fallen for around 30 h the targeted rain event started when the second sample was collected one hour after the start of the el1 auto sampling and in total 19 5 mm of rain fell during this 24 h sampling period consequently at the beginning of the sampling events values of tcc tc e coli ent and turbidity were among the lowest measured during this 24 h period the analysed microbiological values as well as turbidity started rising within a few hours after rainfall began concentrations slowly started to rise about 2 to 3 h after rainfall started showing a rapid response to rainfall as suggested by previous studies of the spring i e drew 1988 drew and daly 1993 cronin and deakin 2000 this may be mainly due to the remobilization of sediments and microbial particles both dead and live from inside the karst network i e autochthonous material as opposed to representative of new contaminants washed through the system from surface sources by the rainfall event i e allochthonous material see pronk et al 2007 total coliforms tc first peaked around 8 h after rainfall began as evident from the analysis of sample number 9 while tcc e coli and ent as well as turbidity lagged one hour behind those of tc peaking for the first time 9 h after rainfall began sample 10 the concentrations of microbiological parameters and turbidity generally dropped a bit after the first peak likely as a result of rainfall decrease for a few hours and they all peaked for the second time together around the time when sample 17 was collected hence 16 h after the rainfall began and when the highest concentrations of turbidity and microbiological parameters during the entire el1 auto sampling period were recorded a significant difference between the minimum and maximum values of microbiological and turbidity parameters was observed during the el1 period in fact tcc values ranged from 5 7 105 cells per ml in sample 2 to a peak of 1 08 106 cells per ml in sample 17 coinciding with the peak concentrations in tc of 5231 mpn 100 ml as well as e coli and enterococci 99 mpn 100 ml for e coli and 11 8 mpn 100 ml for ent turbidity varied between 2 3 and 8 2 ntu with the highest turbidity value again recorded in sample 17 16 h after the start of the rainfall the fwcs results from 24 samples collected during the el1 sampling period show that 15 samples 62 5 have a mean photodecay signal reduction ratio 1 10 min equal to or higher than the threshold value of 0 25 moreover 14 of these 15 samples have also the 95 lower confidence interval lci values higher than 0 25 and are therefore considered as positive for fwcs the sample with 95 lci value below the threshold at hour 10 can only be considered to be indicative for fwcs hence 58 3 samples collected during the el1 were positive for fwcs which indicates a significant impact of dwtss effluent on groundwater quality at elmvale spring the strongest fwcs signal the highest mean photodecay signal reduction 1 10 min ratio of 0 67 was recorded in sample number 4 3 h after rainfall began while the lowest fwcs signal 0 16 ratio was detected in two samples sample numbers 9 and 26 pearson s correlations between monitored parameters were also carried out fig 3 which revealed no significant relationships were observed between temporal variations in fwcs signals and other monitored parameters during the el1 period except a negative correlation between fwcs signals and ent concentrations r 0 48 p 0 017 on the other hand tcc concentrations during this sampling period correlated strongly with turbidity followed by fib e coli and ent and then tc all with p 0 01 strong positive relationships between turbidity and e coli turbidity and ent and turbidity and tc again all p 0 01 were also observed strong positive and significant p 0 01 relationships between tc and e coli tc and ent and e coli and ent as reported in fig 3 were also observed 3 2 second monitoring event at elmvale spring the results of the second continuous sampling at elmvale spring during the rain event el2 conducted in january 2020 sampling started on the 27th january at 7 pm are presented in fig 4 several relatively short lasting precipitation events were recorded within approx 26 h prior to the start of the el2 continuous hourly auto sampling 6 2 mm of rain of which 3 2 mm of rain fell in about 6 h before the el2 sampling hence the el2 auto sampling period should be considered as sampling during the rain event which started before the first sample was taken nevertheless during the el2 sampling it was still possible to capture some temporal variation of monitored parameters considering that in total 7 2 mm of rain fell during the 24 h of el2 sampling period 3 3 mm in short amount of time between 18 and 21 h after the start of el2 sampling the analysed microbiological values as well as tryptophan like fluorescence tlf and turbidity started rising by the end of el2 sampling period after a more intense burst of consecutive rainfall as shown in fig 4 importantly all analysed microbial parameters tcc tc e coli ent as well as tlf and turbidity peaked at the same time during the el2 tcc concentrations during the el2 sampling fluctuated between 2 89 105 cells per ml in sample 12 and a peak value of 6 34 105 cells per ml in sample 22 which coincided with the highest tc 1960 8 mpn 100 ml e coli 70 8 mpn 100 ml and ent 17 4 mpn 100 ml values in contrast no enterococci bacteria were found to be present in sample 8 or sample 11 equally tryptophan like fluorescence tlf values peaked at 13 3 qsu in sample 22 as well as the highest turbidity values at 5 8 ntu the fwcs results from 24 samples collected during the el2 sampling period show that whilst 21 samples or around 87 5 have a mean photodecay signal reduction ratio 1 10 min equal to or higher than the threshold value of 0 25 only 16 of them also have the 95 lci value higher than the threshold and can thus be considered as positive for fwcs with the remaining 5 samples considered as indicative for fwcs presence therefore 66 6 of all samples collected during the el2 sampling were positive for fwcs the strongest fwcs signal 0 45 mean ratio value during the el2 period was detected in sample 10 while the lowest fwcs signal 0 21 mean ratio value was detected interestingly in sample 22 where the highest concentration of microbial parameters as well as tlf and turbidity were observed as previously reported the lowest fwc signals corresponding to the periods of highest microbial contamination during el2 has several possible explanations for example dubber and gill 2017 found that higher organic matter content negatively affects the detectability of fwcs with this method which could be a potential explanation i e tlf concentrations were elevated in those two samples which could also indicate the potential presence of other compounds that could affect the detectability of fwcs also since positive fwcs signals were detected persistently in samples taken before samples 21 and 22 which were negative for fwcs and positive samples were detected after fwcs were detected in samples 23 and 24 it is possible that transport of fwcs through karst aquifer system was different than particulates including microbial transport it is also possible that the microbial turbidity and tlf peak during the el2 could be attributed to the arrival of contaminants from the land surface which are not of human wastewater effluent origin e g agricultural that entered the karst network see pronk et al 2007 despite the fact that the detection frequency of positive fwcs signals during this 24 h sampling period only three samples or 12 5 of total samples were neither positive nor indicative for fwcs presence reveals a considerable impact of dwtss effluent on groundwater quality a correlation matrix heatmap fig 5 reveals that correlations between tcc and tc tcc and e coli tcc and ent tcc and tlf tcc and turbidity tc and tlf tc and turbidity e coli and tlf e coli and turbidity ent and tlf tlf and turbidity and ent and turbidity all significant p 0 01 and positive correlations between tc and fib and e coli and ent were again significant p 0 01 and positive during the second monitoring event at elmvale spring in terms of relationships between fwcs signals and other datasets these relationships were mostly not significant except between fwcs signals and tcc r 0 48 p 0 05 and fwcs signals and tc r 0 41 p 0 05 where moderate negative correlations were found 3 3 monitoring event at ballindine spring the results of the single continuous sampling at ballindine spring during the rain event bd1 conducted in january 2020 sampling started on the 30th january at 7 pm are presented in fig 6 before the bd1 continuous auto sampling campaign a very significant precipitation event occurred 30 4 mm of rain fell within 96 h before the first sample was taken however only 3 5 mm of that rain fell within 48 h prior to the start of bd1 period thus this potentially explains the elevated concentrations of microbial parameters as well as tlf in the beginning of the bd1 sampling period which were slowly decreasing for several hours after the start of bd1 sampling as shown in fig 6 during the 24 h of bd1 sampling 7 7 mm of rain fell mostly between the time of collection of samples number 5 and number 13 therefore approx 8 9 h hence the response in terms of microbial parameters and tlf captured by the end of bd1 sampling period peaking at hour 23 would seem to be in response to that precipitation event reflective of the more diffuse nature of the karst system in this catchment compared to elmvale in terms of variation of monitored parameters during this sampling event turbidity concentrations were low throughout the entire bd1 period between 0 2 and 0 4 ntu with very little variation which contrasts against the turbidity responses seen in el1 and el2 at the other spring however other parameters especially microbial and tlf compounds showed much more variation the maximum tcc concentration during this sampling period was 1 01 106 cells per ml in sample 23 which coincided with the highest tc concentration of 1123 5 mpn 100 ml and maximum values of fib of 78 mpn 100 ml of e coli and 25 3 mpn 100 ml of ent in comparison no ent bacteria were present in sample number 10 which matched with when the lowest e coli concentrations were recorded 9 4 mpn 100 ml regarding tlf measurements these values ranged from 9 2 qsu recorded in sample 11 to 14 3 qsu measured in sample 23 coinciding with when the highest concentrations of monitored microbial parameters were found the fwcs results from 24 samples collected during the bd1 sampling period show that half of those samples 12 samples in total have a mean photodecay signal reduction ratio 1 10 min equal to or higher than the threshold value of 0 25 with 10 of those 12 samples considered as positive for fwcs since their 95 lci values are also higher than 0 25 the remaining 2 samples with 95 lci values below the threshold are being considered as indicative for fwcs the highest fwcs signal was detected in sample number 5 0 47 mean ratio value and the lowest in sample number 18 0 15 mean ratio value because roughly 42 of all samples collected during the bd1 sampling period were positive for fwcs this indicates a considerable impact of dwtss effluent on groundwater quality at the ballindine spring moreover considering that sample 23 with the highest microbial and tlf values during the bd1 monitoring was also positive for fwcs a link between the observed pollution peak and dwtss effluent may be suggested although it should be noted that this does not mean that pollution peak can be attributed to only this pollution source correlations between tcc and tc tcc and e coli tcc and ent tcc and tlf tc and tlf e coli and tlf and ent and tlf were all significant p 0 01 and positive fig 7 also correlations between tc and fib and e coli and ent were all significant p 0 01 and positive as reported in the same correlation matrix heatmap the relationships between recorded fwcs signals and other datasets were not significant nor relationships between any monitored microbial parameter and turbidity since turbidity variations during the bd1 period were negligible turbidity showed only a moderate positive correlation with tlf r 0 42 p 0 05 mainly because tlf concentrations varied less than collected microbial data during this event at the ballindine spring 3 4 discussion of the results both springs during these three continuous 24 h sampling periods showed marked responses to rainfall events for all of the microbial parameters measured it was expected that elmvale spring would show faster responses to rainfall events than ballindine spring on the basis of differences between the two catchments ballindine catchment is a lot smaller in size but has thicker layer of soil and no swallow holes or estavelles yielding more diffuse recharge condtions it also appears to be less karstified with the exception of the high level conduit between a river and the spring that only activates under very high recharge conditions as discussed in schuler et al 2021 this was indeed the case with the more conduit flow dominated elmvale spring exhibiting a 3 to 4 h lagged response compared to the 12 to 13 h lag at ballindine spring during those winter periods when the trials were carried out 3 4 1 evaluation of total cell counts tcc with flow cytometry fcm since tlf was not measured during the el1 period the focus was on evaluating whether tcc measurements with fcm can be successfully used to predict precipitation induced rapid changes in tc and fib whilst using fwcs to try to source apportion the relative pollution impact from dwts effluent as reported earlier in section 3 1 during the el1 period tcc showed a very strong positive correlations with e coli and ent and somewhat lower but still a very strong positive correlation with tc such significant and a very strong positive relationships between tcc and fib as well as tc was further confirmed during the el2 period see section 3 2 when the correlation between tcc and ent was similarly strong and positive as during the el1 period as well as the strong correlations between tcc and tc and tcc and e coli the statistical analysis of combined datasets from the el1 and el2 periods n 48 as shown in fig 8 also reveal strong positive correlations between tcc and other monitored microbiological data r 0 87 and p 0 01 between tcc and tc r 0 73 and p 0 01 between tcc and e coli r 0 51 and p 0 01 between tcc and ent furthermore correlations between tcc and tc and fib at ballindine spring during the single continuous sampling period bd1 as reported in section 3 3 also suggest significant and very strong positive relationships therefore the results in this study further support some earlier findings see for example besmer et al 2017 that tcc can be useful to track rapid changes in microbial water quality at karst springs as a result of rain events despite the fact that tcc peaks are less sharp than peaks of the fib as expected additionally findings from this study are important given the need for more field based research in terms of linking tcc and fib concentrations in karst aquifer systems has been highlighted in previous studies i e page et al 2017 because they have demonstrated that tcc can be useful at karst springs such as elmvale where it also appears that turbidity can be used as easy to measure indicator of microbial faecal pollution as evident from el1 and el2 results and statistical analysis however at karst springs such as ballindine with insignificant turbidity variations in comparison to variations in microbial parameters online tcc monitoring would be a particularly useful method in order to signify microbial faecal pollution 3 4 2 evaluation of tryptophan like fluorescence tlf on the basis of the el2 and bd1 sampling periods tryptophan like fluorescence was also evaluated in terms of its potential to predict precipitation induced rapid changes of monitored microbial parameters tcc tc and fib the results at both springs show that concentrations of compounds with tlf properties were changing in a similar way to microbial parameters and traditional faecal indicators in response to rain events with very strong positive correlations tryptophan like fluorescence concentrations correlated slightly better with tc and fib values in samples collected during the el2 than with those found in samples collected during the bd1 conversely tcc concentrations during the bd1 period correlated better with tlf than tcc concentrations during the el2 sampling period thus on the basis of this analysis it seems that tlf can be very useful at both springs although more useful at conduit flow dominated elmvale spring considering the somewhat better correlation with traditional fib however since temperature and or turbidity khamis et al 2015 ph reynolds 2003 dissolved organic carbon doc and humic like fluorescence hlf all have potential to influence the tlf signal sorensen et al 2020 ward et al 2021 and only turbidity was measured in this study a more comprehensive approach needs to be taken in order to fully evaluate the potential benefits of tlf at these springs 3 4 3 evaluation of fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs on the basis of these sampling periods across three rainfall events it seems that the use of fwcs signals as a specific way of fingerprinting domestic wastewater effluent at karst springs in parallel to monitoring fib variations and other changes in microbial water quality parameters can reveal some interesting insights about the impact and pathways of human wastewater pollution as well as more broadly the overall sources of contamination at karst springs following significant rainfall events it is clear in these two springs at least that fwcs signals do not necessarily follow temporal variations of microbial parameters indicators the frequency of detection of positive fwcs signals particularly during low flow conditions seems to reveal better the magnitude of human wastewater effluent impacts rather than whether those samples are being recorded with respect to microbial pollution changes since fwcs and particulates bacteria might travel differently through the karst aquifer systems and or be coming from different sources the results show that positive fwcs signals were more frequently detected at elmvale spring during the two events as well as the strongest fwc signals than at ballindine spring during the one monitored event which could be due to the relatively high percentage of on site domestic wastewater treatment systems located relatively near karst features that can provide rapid transport of such contaminants into the conduit dominated karst aquifer system a since there are no swallow holes or estavelles on the surface within ballindine catchment the inverse relationships between fwc results and the e coli and tcc results suggesting that the fwc concentrations from human effluent seem to be diluted during high flow events raises the question where the increases in microbial indicators with the high flows are coming from these are obviously sources that are getting mobilised by the more saturated conditions on the catchments at these times some of the increase might be attributed to domestic wastewater treatment systems whereby more saturated conditions will mean shorter travel times both through the soil and through the karst network and therefore more chance of bacteria being intact by the time they reach the spring but the other probable source is from agricultural activities in the catchments manure spreading is practised in the catchments and would have been allowed as per the irish good agricultural practice regulations government of ireland 2017 up to beginning of november and it is conceivable that bacteria still surviving from landspreading might have been washed off the fields into the karst system by the el1 sampling event equally the closed season for manure and slurry spreading ends on the 15th january and so monitoring events el2 and bd1 may well have been impacted by such agricultural sources of faecal microorganisms 3 4 4 in situ real time monitoring of springs finally this research has shown how such parameters can be used to gain real insights into contaminant transport in karst environments which is particularly attractive as such techniques can be applied in situ to provide real time monitoring of spring water quality which will be very beneficial for utility companies consumers who rely on such water sources 4 conclusions this study evaluated several different fluorescence based techniques at two karst springs in ireland over three monitoring periods this research has shown that flow cytometry as a fluorescence based and cultivation independent technique can rapidly provide measurements of total cell counts that can be very useful to indicate rapid changes in faecal indicator bacteria and microbial water quality in general additionally the results suggest that monitoring of tryptophan like fluorescence concentrations at karst springs can be also very useful for detecting rapid changes in concentrations of traditional faecal indicators hence direct in situ real time flow cytometric monitoring of total cell counts and tryptophan like fluorescence concentrations hold great promise in karst environments moreover it was found that detections of positive fwcs signals do not necessarily follow temporal variations of monitored microbial indicators however the frequency of detection of positive signals from such well known indicators of human wastewater contamination may still reveal useful information about the magnitude of human wastewater effluent impacts on karst aquifer systems finally this study confirms the importance of event based monitoring of microbiological water quality at karst springs given the resulting substantial increases in bacterial concentrations following

1218,karst springs are globally important for drinking water supply but are often also exceptionally vulnerable to contamination such springs usually exhibit strong variation in microbial water quality in sharp response to rainfall events thus posing a health hazard to consumers of water supplied from these sources the rapid detection of such changes is extremely important as well as being able to establish a link to the sources of such pollution so that appropriate measures can be taken both in terms of immediate protection of human health and the management of karst aquifers in this study a fluorescence based multi parameter approach was trialed in order to evaluate which methods can be used to monitor rainfall induced rapid changes in microbial water quality at karst springs as well as determine whether such changes can be linked to sources of human effluent contamination the results from three monitoring periods at two karst springs revealed marked responses to rainfall events for all of the microbial parameters measured total cell count tcc measurements using flow cytometry fcm showed very strong positive correlations with the more conventionally monitored faecal indicator bacteria fib and total coliforms tc indicating that such a fluorescence based and cultivation independent technique can be very useful to indicate rapid changes in microbial water quality at karst springs furthermore very strong positive correlations were also found between tryptophan like fluorescence tlf measurements and concentrations of all monitored microbial parameters again demonstrating that such a fluorescence based approach can also be useful for detecting rapid changes in concentrations of traditional faecal indicators interestingly it was found that fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs signals do not necessarily follow temporal variations of microbial indicators however the frequency of detection of positive fwcs signals may still reveal useful information

around 9 of the global population stevanović 2019 however karst aquifers are often exceptionally vulnerable to contamination because of commonly thin soil coverage with a low field capacity above the highly weathered upper part of the karst system epikarst and or the rapid infiltration into the groundwater system directly through discrete flowpaths i e swallow holes also known as ponors and closed depressions also known as dolines such pathways can connect directly into the highly conductive network of solutionally enlarged conduits where turbulent flow conditions generally dominate which finally discharge at springs thorn and coxon 1992 vesper et al 2001 white and white 2005 hillebrand et al 2012 gutiérrez and gutiérrez 2016 these exacerbate the threats to karst groundwater contamination through concentrated inputs of faecal point and non point sources which have been regularly observed worldwide kaçaroğlu 1999 heinz et al 2009 coxon 2011 in rural and suburban areas wastewater effluent from on site domestic wastewater treatment systems dwtss and agricultural sources are considered among the most significant threats to groundwater quality many incidences of waterborne diseases can be associated with contamination of surface water and groundwater due to failing on site domestic wastewater treatment systems fetter 2001 who 2003 therefore the potential impacts of domestic wastewater effluent contaminants especially in cases of inadequate performance or failure of dwtss e g due to poor maintenance design or siting are of particular interest in the management of karst aquifers due to their high vulnerability katz et al 2011 springs provide appropriate natural locations for monitoring pollutant concentration dynamics in karst aquifer systems as they provide an integrated picture of contaminant transport through a karst conduit network compared to wells and boreholes which are not necessarily directly connected to the most transmissive parts of the aquifer geyer et al 2007 karst springs often have strong and rapid variations in microbial water quality in response to rainfall events pronk et al 2007 posing a health hazard to consumers of water supplied from these sources katz et al 2011 hence being able to detect such rapid changes in faecal bacteria concentrations during and or after rain event conditions at karst springs used for water supply is critical as well as being able to establish the sources of the pollution so that appropriate measures can be taken both in terms of immediate protection of human health and the management of karst aquifers unfortunately conventional and advanced microbiological methods e g standard methods for culturing bacteria microbial source tracking etc are usually either very expensive complex labour intensive and or time consuming nrc us 2004 nemati et al 2016 savio et al 2018 and more such limitations therefore diminish their value in terms of rapid assessment of variations in microbial water quality and the potential public health risks from waterborne diseases in karst terrains accordingly the suitability of various surrogate techniques with easy to measure indicators e g turbidity doc toc etc of microbial water contamination in karst environments has been explored in the past thurman 1985 pronk et al 2006 2007 allen et al 2008 heinz et al 2009 ender et al 2017 frank et al 2018 and more flow cytometry fcm is emerging as a very promising fluorescence based and cultivation independent technique in environmental microbiology as a result of the ability of flow cytometers to rapidly quantify bacteria and discriminate them from debris after staining the bacterial dna with fluorescent dyes gatza et al 2013 prest et al 2016 safford and bischel 2019 have identified and examined nearly 300 studies from the last two decades mainly focused on fcm applications in water treatment distribution and reuse but conclude that more research is needed in order to realise the full potential of fcm moreover although extensive research has been carried out on the monitoring and assessment of drinking water quality e g hammes et al 2008 de roy et al 2012 prest et al 2016 and the characterisation of microbial communities e g hammes and egli 2010 van nevel et al 2013 using fcm studies in karst aquifer systems are still rare e g sinreich et al 2014 besmer et al 2017 page et al 2017 vucinic et al 2022 nevertheless on the basis of these previous studies in karst aquifer systems it seems clear that flow cytometric rapid counting of total cell counts tcc could be a very useful approach to track precipitation induced contamination events at karst springs and thereby improve our understanding of microbial contamination dynamics in karst systems fluorescence spectrometry has been used in the past for assessing surface water and groundwater quality and identifying human wastewater pollution impacts baker 2002 cumberland et al 2012 baker et al 2015 carstea et al 2016 nowicki et al 2019 ward et al 2021 and more since the intensity of fluorescence detected at different excitation emission wavelengths can be used to identify pollution and or the potential origin of compounds carstea et al 2020 for example dissolved humic substances in natural water are mainly derived from dead and decaying soil detritus aquatic plants animals and debris hongve 1999 with fulvic substances derived predominantly from tree and plant residues chen et al 2003 however it should be noted that bacteria may also produce compounds that fluoresce at humic like wavelengths fox et al 2021 aquatic protein like fluorescence which is less well understood than humic and fulvic like fluorescence is linked to a mixture of amino acids free or bound in proteins and or other organic materials with similar fluorescence characteristics and is generally described as an indicator of biologic activity fellman et al 2010 frank et al 2018 sorensen et al 2020 it has been shown to be the dominant form of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in domestic on site wastewater effluent dubber et al 2021 tryptophan like fluorescence tlf is a term that describes fluorescence occurring from a range of compounds generally aromatic and proteinaceous compounds that share similar fluorescence properties to the amino acid tryptophan baker 2002 sorensen et al 2018a notably in controlled laboratory studies e coli cells have been proven to directly emit tlf as well as to excrete compounds that fluoresce in the tlf region dalterio et al 1986 1987 dartnel et al 2013 fox et al 2017 hence tryptophan like fluorescence has been evaluated and in many cases used successfully as an indicator of faecal contamination e g thermotolerant faecal coliforms in drinking water supplies and groundwater sorensen et al 2015 2016 2018a 2021 ward et al 2021 and more more specifically frank et al 2018 evaluated tlf as a part of their fluorescence based multi parameter approach conducted at alpine karst springs while sorensen et al 2018b conducted fluorescence based multi parameter approach at springs and boreholes in karst environments moreover frank et al 2021 evaluated transport properties of dissolved tryptophan in karst and demonstrated that the transport properties of tryptophan are similar to those of uranine conservative dye tracer commonly used for conducting artificial tracer tests in karst aquifer systems fluorescence based approaches can also be used to target well known source specific chemical markers of human wastewater origin known as fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs and therefore help to link groundwater pollution with dwts impacts in rural and suburban areas and or to assess the magnitude of human wastewater impact on groundwater fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs also known as fluorescent whitening agents and optical brighteners are added to common liquid and powder laundry detergents due to their ability to make fabrics appear brighter in colour and prevent yellow staining and fading over time poiger et al 1998 hartel et al 2007 cao et al 2009 hagedorn and weisberg 2009 dubber and gill 2017 the most commonly used fwcs in laundry detergents include the distyrylbiphenyl types such as distyrylbiphenylsulfonate dsbp and stilbene types such as the diaminostilbene das 1 dubber and gill 2017 the use of washing detergents in modern households makes these compounds ubiquitous in human wastewater therefore they enter the environment through the discharge of domestic wastewater effluents poiger et al 1998 cao et al 2009 dubber and gill 2017 fennell et al 2021 especially from failing dwtss maswabi 2015 the specificity solubility and low potential for biodegradability of fwcs in the environment have led to studies into their use as a tracer of wastewater contamination in surface waters and groundwater tran et al 2015 fennell et al 2021 the main objectives of this study were to assess whether multiple different fluorescence approaches total cell counts tryptophan like fluorescence and fluorescent whitening compounds can be used to identify rapid changes in microbial water quality at karst springs associated with rainfall events and whether such variations in microbial indicators can be linked to contamination by dwts effluent 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling this study focuses on two karst springs in ireland which are herein named based on the closest locality or town elmvale spring and ballindine spring fig 1 elmvale spring see also figs s1 s5 in supporting information is one of the largest karst springs in the west of ireland but has never been used as a drinking water supply since the source is extremely vulnerable to contamination cronin and deakin 2000 gsi 2020 the zone of contribution of elmvale spring is 131 1 km2 epa 2020 dinantian pure bedded limestones underlie roughly 90 of this catchment with overlying shallow well drained mineral soils and or areas with bedrock at or close to the surface within 1 m of the surface in almost 85 of the catchment with some namurian shales overlain by peaty subsoils and sandstones within the zone of contribution of the spring in the western part of the catchment cronin and deakin 2000 gsi 2020 this spring appears at several outlets within the limestone formation with the vast majority of the groundwater emerging from a 3 m high limestone cliff over a distance of approximately 80 m drew 1988 the aquifer has been described as conduit flow dominated and some rapid groundwater velocities recorded in this area between 10 and 110 m h suggest the presence of relatively sizeable conduits drew and daly 1993 gsi 2020 elmvale spring responds rapidly to rainfall even during the summer months and appears to be fed significantly by diffuse input recharge drew 1988 rather than by sinking streams this catchment has a mixed land use with open spaces with little or no vegetation mixed forest pastures grasslands and arable land clc 2018 epa 2020 the density of dwtss in the zone of contribution to elmvale spring is approx 3 per km2 however a high percentage of on site domestic wastewater treatment systems 10 5 are located within 200 m of at least one karst feature such as swallow hole estavelle or turlough that can provide a pathway for the rapid transport of such effluent and associated contaminants into the karst aquifer system these values were calculated using epa ireland geodirectory data for dwtss and karst features data from gsi 2020 as explained in section 2 4 ballindine spring see also figs s6 s10 in supporting information is a locally significant karst spring that was used for the town s with the same name water supply up to june 2010 at which point it was abandoned as a water source due to continual contamination incidences this small agricultural land use is almost entirely described as pastures grasslands catchment 3 4 km2 clc 2018 epa 2020 gsi 2020 has no visible karst features at the surface that can provide direct transport of contaminants into the karst aquifer system such as swallow holes and estavelles however it should be noted that some enclosed depressions have been recently mapped and reported by schuler et al 2021 moreover recent hydrological studies of the catchment have shown that under moderate recharge conditions the aquifer has a damped response to rainfall but during higher sustained recharge conditions the spring becomes connected to a nearby river via a high level conduit providing a much faster response to rainfall events schuler et al 2021 the bedrock geology of this catchment consists of the dinantian pure bedded limestones gsi 2020 with mainly carboniferous limestone tills and deep well drained mineral soils overlying the limestone formation epa 2020 hence the groundwater vulnerability which in ireland is defined on the basis of the thickness and permeability of the subsoils overlying the bedrock aquifer as explained in doelg epa gsi 1999 in detail in the catchment is split between high moderate and low with depth to bedrock being 3 m in 98 of the catchment gsi 2020 the density of dwtss is very high at almost 13 dwts per km2 calculated as explained in section 2 4 in total three continuous sampling campaigns targeted across rain events were conducted for the purpose of this study elmvale spring was continuously sampled on two occasions el1 in december 2018 and el2 in january 2020 and ballindine spring once bd1 in january 2020 samples were collected every hour for 24 h on all three occasions el1 el2 and bd1 using isco portable automatic samplers 6712 model with 24 1000 ml sterile polypropylene sampling bottles teledyne technologies inc ca usa the sampling tube was automatically rinsed and purged several times before collecting each sample to avoid stagnation and cross contamination all samples collected during the three continuous sampling periods were analysed for total cell counts tcc total coliforms tc and faecal indicator bacteria e coli and enterococci turbidity and presence of fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs in addition to these analyses tryptophan like fluorescence tlf was measured in samples collected during the el2 and bd1 sampling periods samples were collected directly at the karst spring outlets and required several different storage protocols to ensure the rigorousness of the different subsequent analysis results as detailed in the following sections 2 2 standard and fluorescence based microbiological analyses microbiological analyses in this study included fluorescence based and cultivation independent measurements of tcc using flow cytometry as well as standard methods for quantification of total coliforms and faecal indicator bacteria e coli and enterococci all samples were transported to the laboratory after the sampling events in cool boxes where they were analysed immediately upon arrival before the flow cytometry analysis of tcc samples were pre treated and diluted in physiologic phosphate buffered saline containing 0 2 pluronic f68 and 1 mmol l edta which has been previously passed through a 0 22 μm syringe filter in the next step the eawag swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology and bd biosciences staining protocol for rapid counting of tcc was followed see gatza et al 2013 for details after staining with thiazole orange the parent compound of sybr stain family that stains all cells and enables discrimination of cells from debris all tubes with individual samples were capped vortexed for 30 s and incubated 37 c in the dark for 10 min samples were analysed at the flow cytometry facility the school of biochemistry and immunology at trinity college dublin biomedical sciences institute using a bd accuri c6 flow cytometer and a software analysis template with predefined workspace instrument settings fixed gates and parameters developed by researchers at eawag as described in detail in gatza et al 2013 all fcm tcc measurements were performed in triplicate for quality control and statistical analysis with a constant medium flow rate of the instrument during data acquisition process in order to achieve comparable data aseptic techniques were employed for each microbiological analysis performed at the environmental engineering department laboratory at trinity college dublin for the presence absence and the most probable numbers mpns per 100 ml of total coliforms tc e coli and enterococci ent these analyses were carried out using idexx colilert 18 iso 9308 2 and idexx enterolert e iso 7899 1 test kits in conjunction with the idexx quanti tray 2000 and idexx quanti tray sealer each individual quanti tray with sample mixed with an appropriate powder from the test kits was incubated at 35 c for 18 h for tc and e coli analysis and at 41 c for 24 h for ent analysis after incubation the number of large and small wells that were positive based on a colour change and or uv fluorescence were counted and these counts were converted into results using the idexx mpn generator 1 4 4 software for quality control three samples were randomly selected during each analysis session and analysed in duplicate or triplicate 2 3 fluorescence based analysis of compounds the fluorescence based analysis of compounds included measurements of signals originating from fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs as well as tryptophan like fluorescence tlf measurements of compounds that share similar fluorescence properties to the amino acid tryptophan as follows samples for fwcs analysis were transferred from the automatic samplers directly into amber glass bottles to protect samples from uv light and kept in cool boxes during the transfer from the field to the laboratory where they were stored in the fridge until analysis within 72 h the analysis for fwcs was performed in the laboratory located in the school of chemistry at trinity college dublin using a ls55 fluorescence spectrometer perkin elmer massachusetts and pmma cuvettes with 10 mm optical path length the emission wavelength was set at λem 436 nm with a slit width of either 5 or 10 nm the presence or absence of fwcs in karst spring samples was determined using the photodecay method recommended by dubber and gill 2017 the photodecay of the samples was measured in triplicate by recording the fluorescence signal after 0 1 and 10 min of exposure to uv light a dark box containing a sun lamp with 4 philips cleo 15 w uv tubes was used to control uv exposure the sample cuvettes were placed into a ldpe holder centrally positioned in front of the uv tubes at a height and distance of 16 and 5 cm respectively ventilation of the box was maintained throughout each exposure to minimise any heat accumulation the ratio of the reduction after 1 min to the reduction after 10 min of uv exposure was determined and samples with a ratio 1 10 min 0 25 were considered to contain fwcs dubber and gill 2017 tlf analysis was performed using a portable uvilux fluorimeter λex 280 nm λem 360 nm chelsea technologies group ltd uk by immersing probe in the groundwater sample in the dark as explained in sorensen et al 2015 the sensor utilises a uv light emitting diode led light source and a miniature photomultiplier detector allowing a high level of sensitivity the calibration of the instrument was done by the manufacturer before the sampling periods tryptophan like fluorescence is reported in quinine sulphate units qsu 2 4 other analyses and data turbidity in karst groundwater samples was measured in each collected sample with a hi9829 multiparameter instrument hanna instruments usa which was calibrated according to the manufacturer s instructions prior to each field sampling campaign rainfall data were obtained from the local irish meteorological service met eireann stations located at 7 2 km from elmvale spring and 5 9 km from ballindine spring respectively for logistical reasons it was not possible to gauge either spring for flows the densities of dwtss in the zone of contribution of springs as well as the percentages of dwtss in the catchments that are within 200 m of at least one karst feature such as swallow hole estavelle or turlough were calculated using arcgis 10 7 1 with dwtss layers obtained from the epa ireland geodirectory under the same conditions as explained in gill and mockler 2016 and karst features data from gsi 2020 statistical analysis was carried out in r environment r core team 2020 a significance level of 0 05 is used throughout this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 first monitoring event at elmvale spring the results of the first continuous sampling at elmvale spring in response to a rain event el1 in december 2018 sampling started on the 4th december at 1 pm are presented in fig 2 it should be noted that prior to the start of the el1 sampling no rain had fallen for around 30 h the targeted rain event started when the second sample was collected one hour after the start of the el1 auto sampling and in total 19 5 mm of rain fell during this 24 h sampling period consequently at the beginning of the sampling events values of tcc tc e coli ent and turbidity were among the lowest measured during this 24 h period the analysed microbiological values as well as turbidity started rising within a few hours after rainfall began concentrations slowly started to rise about 2 to 3 h after rainfall started showing a rapid response to rainfall as suggested by previous studies of the spring i e drew 1988 drew and daly 1993 cronin and deakin 2000 this may be mainly due to the remobilization of sediments and microbial particles both dead and live from inside the karst network i e autochthonous material as opposed to representative of new contaminants washed through the system from surface sources by the rainfall event i e allochthonous material see pronk et al 2007 total coliforms tc first peaked around 8 h after rainfall began as evident from the analysis of sample number 9 while tcc e coli and ent as well as turbidity lagged one hour behind those of tc peaking for the first time 9 h after rainfall began sample 10 the concentrations of microbiological parameters and turbidity generally dropped a bit after the first peak likely as a result of rainfall decrease for a few hours and they all peaked for the second time together around the time when sample 17 was collected hence 16 h after the rainfall began and when the highest concentrations of turbidity and microbiological parameters during the entire el1 auto sampling period were recorded a significant difference between the minimum and maximum values of microbiological and turbidity parameters was observed during the el1 period in fact tcc values ranged from 5 7 105 cells per ml in sample 2 to a peak of 1 08 106 cells per ml in sample 17 coinciding with the peak concentrations in tc of 5231 mpn 100 ml as well as e coli and enterococci 99 mpn 100 ml for e coli and 11 8 mpn 100 ml for ent turbidity varied between 2 3 and 8 2 ntu with the highest turbidity value again recorded in sample 17 16 h after the start of the rainfall the fwcs results from 24 samples collected during the el1 sampling period show that 15 samples 62 5 have a mean photodecay signal reduction ratio 1 10 min equal to or higher than the threshold value of 0 25 moreover 14 of these 15 samples have also the 95 lower confidence interval lci values higher than 0 25 and are therefore considered as positive for fwcs the sample with 95 lci value below the threshold at hour 10 can only be considered to be indicative for fwcs hence 58 3 samples collected during the el1 were positive for fwcs which indicates a significant impact of dwtss effluent on groundwater quality at elmvale spring the strongest fwcs signal the highest mean photodecay signal reduction 1 10 min ratio of 0 67 was recorded in sample number 4 3 h after rainfall began while the lowest fwcs signal 0 16 ratio was detected in two samples sample numbers 9 and 26 pearson s correlations between monitored parameters were also carried out fig 3 which revealed no significant relationships were observed between temporal variations in fwcs signals and other monitored parameters during the el1 period except a negative correlation between fwcs signals and ent concentrations r 0 48 p 0 017 on the other hand tcc concentrations during this sampling period correlated strongly with turbidity followed by fib e coli and ent and then tc all with p 0 01 strong positive relationships between turbidity and e coli turbidity and ent and turbidity and tc again all p 0 01 were also observed strong positive and significant p 0 01 relationships between tc and e coli tc and ent and e coli and ent as reported in fig 3 were also observed 3 2 second monitoring event at elmvale spring the results of the second continuous sampling at elmvale spring during the rain event el2 conducted in january 2020 sampling started on the 27th january at 7 pm are presented in fig 4 several relatively short lasting precipitation events were recorded within approx 26 h prior to the start of the el2 continuous hourly auto sampling 6 2 mm of rain of which 3 2 mm of rain fell in about 6 h before the el2 sampling hence the el2 auto sampling period should be considered as sampling during the rain event which started before the first sample was taken nevertheless during the el2 sampling it was still possible to capture some temporal variation of monitored parameters considering that in total 7 2 mm of rain fell during the 24 h of el2 sampling period 3 3 mm in short amount of time between 18 and 21 h after the start of el2 sampling the analysed microbiological values as well as tryptophan like fluorescence tlf and turbidity started rising by the end of el2 sampling period after a more intense burst of consecutive rainfall as shown in fig 4 importantly all analysed microbial parameters tcc tc e coli ent as well as tlf and turbidity peaked at the same time during the el2 tcc concentrations during the el2 sampling fluctuated between 2 89 105 cells per ml in sample 12 and a peak value of 6 34 105 cells per ml in sample 22 which coincided with the highest tc 1960 8 mpn 100 ml e coli 70 8 mpn 100 ml and ent 17 4 mpn 100 ml values in contrast no enterococci bacteria were found to be present in sample 8 or sample 11 equally tryptophan like fluorescence tlf values peaked at 13 3 qsu in sample 22 as well as the highest turbidity values at 5 8 ntu the fwcs results from 24 samples collected during the el2 sampling period show that whilst 21 samples or around 87 5 have a mean photodecay signal reduction ratio 1 10 min equal to or higher than the threshold value of 0 25 only 16 of them also have the 95 lci value higher than the threshold and can thus be considered as positive for fwcs with the remaining 5 samples considered as indicative for fwcs presence therefore 66 6 of all samples collected during the el2 sampling were positive for fwcs the strongest fwcs signal 0 45 mean ratio value during the el2 period was detected in sample 10 while the lowest fwcs signal 0 21 mean ratio value was detected interestingly in sample 22 where the highest concentration of microbial parameters as well as tlf and turbidity were observed as previously reported the lowest fwc signals corresponding to the periods of highest microbial contamination during el2 has several possible explanations for example dubber and gill 2017 found that higher organic matter content negatively affects the detectability of fwcs with this method which could be a potential explanation i e tlf concentrations were elevated in those two samples which could also indicate the potential presence of other compounds that could affect the detectability of fwcs also since positive fwcs signals were detected persistently in samples taken before samples 21 and 22 which were negative for fwcs and positive samples were detected after fwcs were detected in samples 23 and 24 it is possible that transport of fwcs through karst aquifer system was different than particulates including microbial transport it is also possible that the microbial turbidity and tlf peak during the el2 could be attributed to the arrival of contaminants from the land surface which are not of human wastewater effluent origin e g agricultural that entered the karst network see pronk et al 2007 despite the fact that the detection frequency of positive fwcs signals during this 24 h sampling period only three samples or 12 5 of total samples were neither positive nor indicative for fwcs presence reveals a considerable impact of dwtss effluent on groundwater quality a correlation matrix heatmap fig 5 reveals that correlations between tcc and tc tcc and e coli tcc and ent tcc and tlf tcc and turbidity tc and tlf tc and turbidity e coli and tlf e coli and turbidity ent and tlf tlf and turbidity and ent and turbidity all significant p 0 01 and positive correlations between tc and fib and e coli and ent were again significant p 0 01 and positive during the second monitoring event at elmvale spring in terms of relationships between fwcs signals and other datasets these relationships were mostly not significant except between fwcs signals and tcc r 0 48 p 0 05 and fwcs signals and tc r 0 41 p 0 05 where moderate negative correlations were found 3 3 monitoring event at ballindine spring the results of the single continuous sampling at ballindine spring during the rain event bd1 conducted in january 2020 sampling started on the 30th january at 7 pm are presented in fig 6 before the bd1 continuous auto sampling campaign a very significant precipitation event occurred 30 4 mm of rain fell within 96 h before the first sample was taken however only 3 5 mm of that rain fell within 48 h prior to the start of bd1 period thus this potentially explains the elevated concentrations of microbial parameters as well as tlf in the beginning of the bd1 sampling period which were slowly decreasing for several hours after the start of bd1 sampling as shown in fig 6 during the 24 h of bd1 sampling 7 7 mm of rain fell mostly between the time of collection of samples number 5 and number 13 therefore approx 8 9 h hence the response in terms of microbial parameters and tlf captured by the end of bd1 sampling period peaking at hour 23 would seem to be in response to that precipitation event reflective of the more diffuse nature of the karst system in this catchment compared to elmvale in terms of variation of monitored parameters during this sampling event turbidity concentrations were low throughout the entire bd1 period between 0 2 and 0 4 ntu with very little variation which contrasts against the turbidity responses seen in el1 and el2 at the other spring however other parameters especially microbial and tlf compounds showed much more variation the maximum tcc concentration during this sampling period was 1 01 106 cells per ml in sample 23 which coincided with the highest tc concentration of 1123 5 mpn 100 ml and maximum values of fib of 78 mpn 100 ml of e coli and 25 3 mpn 100 ml of ent in comparison no ent bacteria were present in sample number 10 which matched with when the lowest e coli concentrations were recorded 9 4 mpn 100 ml regarding tlf measurements these values ranged from 9 2 qsu recorded in sample 11 to 14 3 qsu measured in sample 23 coinciding with when the highest concentrations of monitored microbial parameters were found the fwcs results from 24 samples collected during the bd1 sampling period show that half of those samples 12 samples in total have a mean photodecay signal reduction ratio 1 10 min equal to or higher than the threshold value of 0 25 with 10 of those 12 samples considered as positive for fwcs since their 95 lci values are also higher than 0 25 the remaining 2 samples with 95 lci values below the threshold are being considered as indicative for fwcs the highest fwcs signal was detected in sample number 5 0 47 mean ratio value and the lowest in sample number 18 0 15 mean ratio value because roughly 42 of all samples collected during the bd1 sampling period were positive for fwcs this indicates a considerable impact of dwtss effluent on groundwater quality at the ballindine spring moreover considering that sample 23 with the highest microbial and tlf values during the bd1 monitoring was also positive for fwcs a link between the observed pollution peak and dwtss effluent may be suggested although it should be noted that this does not mean that pollution peak can be attributed to only this pollution source correlations between tcc and tc tcc and e coli tcc and ent tcc and tlf tc and tlf e coli and tlf and ent and tlf were all significant p 0 01 and positive fig 7 also correlations between tc and fib and e coli and ent were all significant p 0 01 and positive as reported in the same correlation matrix heatmap the relationships between recorded fwcs signals and other datasets were not significant nor relationships between any monitored microbial parameter and turbidity since turbidity variations during the bd1 period were negligible turbidity showed only a moderate positive correlation with tlf r 0 42 p 0 05 mainly because tlf concentrations varied less than collected microbial data during this event at the ballindine spring 3 4 discussion of the results both springs during these three continuous 24 h sampling periods showed marked responses to rainfall events for all of the microbial parameters measured it was expected that elmvale spring would show faster responses to rainfall events than ballindine spring on the basis of differences between the two catchments ballindine catchment is a lot smaller in size but has thicker layer of soil and no swallow holes or estavelles yielding more diffuse recharge condtions it also appears to be less karstified with the exception of the high level conduit between a river and the spring that only activates under very high recharge conditions as discussed in schuler et al 2021 this was indeed the case with the more conduit flow dominated elmvale spring exhibiting a 3 to 4 h lagged response compared to the 12 to 13 h lag at ballindine spring during those winter periods when the trials were carried out 3 4 1 evaluation of total cell counts tcc with flow cytometry fcm since tlf was not measured during the el1 period the focus was on evaluating whether tcc measurements with fcm can be successfully used to predict precipitation induced rapid changes in tc and fib whilst using fwcs to try to source apportion the relative pollution impact from dwts effluent as reported earlier in section 3 1 during the el1 period tcc showed a very strong positive correlations with e coli and ent and somewhat lower but still a very strong positive correlation with tc such significant and a very strong positive relationships between tcc and fib as well as tc was further confirmed during the el2 period see section 3 2 when the correlation between tcc and ent was similarly strong and positive as during the el1 period as well as the strong correlations between tcc and tc and tcc and e coli the statistical analysis of combined datasets from the el1 and el2 periods n 48 as shown in fig 8 also reveal strong positive correlations between tcc and other monitored microbiological data r 0 87 and p 0 01 between tcc and tc r 0 73 and p 0 01 between tcc and e coli r 0 51 and p 0 01 between tcc and ent furthermore correlations between tcc and tc and fib at ballindine spring during the single continuous sampling period bd1 as reported in section 3 3 also suggest significant and very strong positive relationships therefore the results in this study further support some earlier findings see for example besmer et al 2017 that tcc can be useful to track rapid changes in microbial water quality at karst springs as a result of rain events despite the fact that tcc peaks are less sharp than peaks of the fib as expected additionally findings from this study are important given the need for more field based research in terms of linking tcc and fib concentrations in karst aquifer systems has been highlighted in previous studies i e page et al 2017 because they have demonstrated that tcc can be useful at karst springs such as elmvale where it also appears that turbidity can be used as easy to measure indicator of microbial faecal pollution as evident from el1 and el2 results and statistical analysis however at karst springs such as ballindine with insignificant turbidity variations in comparison to variations in microbial parameters online tcc monitoring would be a particularly useful method in order to signify microbial faecal pollution 3 4 2 evaluation of tryptophan like fluorescence tlf on the basis of the el2 and bd1 sampling periods tryptophan like fluorescence was also evaluated in terms of its potential to predict precipitation induced rapid changes of monitored microbial parameters tcc tc and fib the results at both springs show that concentrations of compounds with tlf properties were changing in a similar way to microbial parameters and traditional faecal indicators in response to rain events with very strong positive correlations tryptophan like fluorescence concentrations correlated slightly better with tc and fib values in samples collected during the el2 than with those found in samples collected during the bd1 conversely tcc concentrations during the bd1 period correlated better with tlf than tcc concentrations during the el2 sampling period thus on the basis of this analysis it seems that tlf can be very useful at both springs although more useful at conduit flow dominated elmvale spring considering the somewhat better correlation with traditional fib however since temperature and or turbidity khamis et al 2015 ph reynolds 2003 dissolved organic carbon doc and humic like fluorescence hlf all have potential to influence the tlf signal sorensen et al 2020 ward et al 2021 and only turbidity was measured in this study a more comprehensive approach needs to be taken in order to fully evaluate the potential benefits of tlf at these springs 3 4 3 evaluation of fluorescent whitening compounds fwcs on the basis of these sampling periods across three rainfall events it seems that the use of fwcs signals as a specific way of fingerprinting domestic wastewater effluent at karst springs in parallel to monitoring fib variations and other changes in microbial water quality parameters can reveal some interesting insights about the impact and pathways of human wastewater pollution as well as more broadly the overall sources of contamination at karst springs following significant rainfall events it is clear in these two springs at least that fwcs signals do not necessarily follow temporal variations of microbial parameters indicators the frequency of detection of positive fwcs signals particularly during low flow conditions seems to reveal better the magnitude of human wastewater effluent impacts rather than whether those samples are being recorded with respect to microbial pollution changes since fwcs and particulates bacteria might travel differently through the karst aquifer systems and or be coming from different sources the results show that positive fwcs signals were more frequently detected at elmvale spring during the two events as well as the strongest fwc signals than at ballindine spring during the one monitored event which could be due to the relatively high percentage of on site domestic wastewater treatment systems located relatively near karst features that can provide rapid transport of such contaminants into the conduit dominated karst aquifer system a since there are no swallow holes or estavelles on the surface within ballindine catchment the inverse relationships between fwc results and the e coli and tcc results suggesting that the fwc concentrations from human effluent seem to be diluted during high flow events raises the question where the increases in microbial indicators with the high flows are coming from these are obviously sources that are getting mobilised by the more saturated conditions on the catchments at these times some of the increase might be attributed to domestic wastewater treatment systems whereby more saturated conditions will mean shorter travel times both through the soil and through the karst network and therefore more chance of bacteria being intact by the time they reach the spring but the other probable source is from agricultural activities in the catchments manure spreading is practised in the catchments and would have been allowed as per the irish good agricultural practice regulations government of ireland 2017 up to beginning of november and it is conceivable that bacteria still surviving from landspreading might have been washed off the fields into the karst system by the el1 sampling event equally the closed season for manure and slurry spreading ends on the 15th january and so monitoring events el2 and bd1 may well have been impacted by such agricultural sources of faecal microorganisms 3 4 4 in situ real time monitoring of springs finally this research has shown how such parameters can be used to gain real insights into contaminant transport in karst environments which is particularly attractive as such techniques can be applied in situ to provide real time monitoring of spring water quality which will be very beneficial for utility companies consumers who rely on such water sources 4 conclusions this study evaluated several different fluorescence based techniques at two karst springs in ireland over three monitoring periods this research has shown that flow cytometry as a fluorescence based and cultivation independent technique can rapidly provide measurements of total cell counts that can be very useful to indicate rapid changes in faecal indicator bacteria and microbial water quality in general additionally the results suggest that monitoring of tryptophan like fluorescence concentrations at karst springs can be also very useful for detecting rapid changes in concentrations of traditional faecal indicators hence direct in situ real time flow cytometric monitoring of total cell counts and tryptophan like fluorescence concentrations hold great promise in karst environments moreover it was found that detections of positive fwcs signals do not necessarily follow temporal variations of monitored microbial indicators however the frequency of detection of positive signals from such well known indicators of human wastewater contamination may still reveal useful information about the magnitude of human wastewater effluent impacts on karst aquifer systems finally this study confirms the importance of event based monitoring of microbiological water quality at karst springs given the resulting substantial increases in bacterial concentrations following

test was carried out in compliance with the ethical committee s local and national guidelines for animal research 2 8 1 fish collection maintenance and experimental setup during the respawning season july 35 45 g of young and strong juvenile heteropneustes fossilis were purchased from a local fish market mishra and chaube 2017 the fish were acclimatized for a week in the laboratory at a regular photoperiod and temperature 12 12 h light to dark and 25 c during the acclimation stage the fish were fed goat liver dietary carbohydrate regularly the toxicity of the sww was assessed by determining the lc50 in a 24 h exposure experiment the fish were separated into four groups of 10 fish each n 2 in duplicate the swws were given to three groups 1 0 5 0 or 10 while the fourth group was kept in plain freshwater as a control the lc50 was calculated using mortality data collected after 24 h the gills and liver of the fish were taken after they were killed in the lab gills were preserved in bouin s fixative for anatomical inspection and livers were maintained at 20 c until further study catalase activity was used to assess the stress level generated by wastewater exposure 2 8 2 histological and catalase study the snipped gill sections were dehydrated through a succession of calibrated ethanol after 24 h in the bouin s fixative and then embedded in filtered paraffin 54 to 62 c the rotator microtome weswox india was used to slice paraffin embedded gills into 5 m thick sections after passing through a series of calibrated water and ethanol the slices were double stained

significant results p 0 001 and p 0 05 tukey s analysis was also performed using graphpad software graphpad software san diego ca usa after one way anova to see whether the results varied or differed kim 2014 chandra et al 2018 3 result and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of sww the swws were brown in color and had an affected odour as indicated in table 2 the levels of bod cod and other pollution parameters were extremely high in the inlet sample of swws and decreased in the outlet sample however the values of the outlet samples remain significantly higher than the regulatory bodies usepa 2002 industrial discharge permitted limits and their detected method and instruments shown in table 1 as previously documented in other wastewater research the presence of a significant amount of dissolved organic matter as well as calcium magnesium and nitrogen compounds table 2 may have contributed to the high bod and cod of effluent choi et al 2017 tripathi et al 2021a chandra et al 2008a 2008b sankaran et al 2014 different soluble salts and heavy metals combine to form organometallic compounds with complicated structures sankaran et al 2014 chandra et al 2018 furthermore the proliferation of bod cod tss tds volatile solids total n phenolics sulfates and phosphate might be attributed to huge amounts of unidentified chemicals and hazardous chemicals created during the processing of wastewater aniyikaiye et al 2019 the elevated concentrations of heavy metals in the sww could be attributed to the deterioration of metallic connections digester vessels and to a slightly lesser extent raw materials conveyed by sewage wastewater bortoletto et al 2018 the results indicated the wastewater treatment plant was not sufficiently effective in improving the quality of the wastewater the high levels of metals remaining in the wastewater were a great concern especially in terms of wastewater reuse such as the irrigation of crops 3 2 morphological examination of pollutants the analyses indicated that both the inlet and outlet sww samples have a sophisticated and distinctive form as illustrated in fig 2a and b the sem analysis showed enlarged rods that were cylindrical in shape in the outlet samples whereas globular like structures were found in the inlet samples commonly discovered in sww speiser et al 2001 manohara and belagali 2017 the residue of thermal decomposition resulted in the stretched and porous look of sww samples the morphology of a rod and brick shape might be due to polymers or cellulose observed in sww samples likewise observations on the crystalline texture of organic molecules with their whole structure have been published previously remond et al 2002 herman et al 2016 earlier findings by graminha et al 2008 and abdel shafy and mansour 2018 revealed the existence of metallic complexes of several organic contaminants the complicated structure of several heavy metals polymers and other co pollutants was generally seen in sww samples sww samples of different pore shapes and sizes were found to be anisotropic sww samples were much finer and more uniformly scattered the elemental composition of the effluent was confirmed by edx elemental analysis the wastewater s high salt content showed that it may be a serious pollutant in both terrestrial and aquatic environments the presence of residual metals in the outlet samples as indicated by the physicochemical and sem analyses suggests the sww requires further treatment before it can be discharged safely into the aquatic environment for example bioremediation involving autochthonous bacteria and phytoremediation using native plants can provide sustainable and low cost treatment as they had been shown to be effective in reducing the metal levels tripathi et al 2021b 2022a sharma et al 2021 3 3 ultraviolet visibility and functional groups of compounds the scanning of uv vis s absorption spectra absorption peaks in the region of 200 250 nm is shown in fig 2c d this revealed a polymerized organic molecule as a complex color material with uv absorption although the absorption band had been at 220 nm 225 nm and 235 nm the spectral measurement absorbance maximum was at λmax 230 nm the defining attribute of a chemical once the polymerization procedure is completed during its production has always been maximum billaud et al 2004 a combination of additional contaminants was revealed by the modest peaks in the absorption spectrum the results of previous investigations echavarria pinto et al 2013 chandra et al 2018 have likewise corroborated this finding this study demonstrated how organic molecules were degraded with increasing dilution fig 2c d shows how little the absorbance intensities at 230 nm in sww s primary product changed there was also a dominant band at 230 nm which was previously described to demonstrate the number of early complex chemicals in the polymerized product gu et al 2010 this ultraviolet area is where a variety of chemical compounds have been produced in the early stages of the polymerization process at the sww with optical absorption echavarria pinto et al 2013 ft ir spectroscopy was used to analyse the molecular orbitals and covalent bonds in the sww samples organic robust and weak bonds functional groups and polymers were found in both the inlet and outflow samples as can be seen in fig 2e the spectra of sww samples are displayed in the infrared together with their respective absorption peaks for illustration functional groups with strong and weak bonds in organic compounds and polymers were analysed in the inlet and exit sww using the ft ir range 3500 to 500 cm 1 there was broadband at 3415 5 cm 1 in the inlet sample and 3424 4 cm 1 in the output sample with values of 2152 1 1649 1 1562 6 1414 0 1207 1 1049 5 866 4 and 851 9 cm 1 respectively the oh stretch indicated there was an alcohol hydroxyl group and a considerable amount of alcohol many organic compounds were identified in the inlet and outflow ssw samples which had a bandwidth range of 3315 5 to 2967 9 cm 1 table 2 there were functional groups such as cn or cc triple bonds in the 2188 4 and 1564 6 cm 1 broadband area the broadband area with bond n c s stretching strength of medium at 1564 6 and 1415 5 cm 1 demonstrated the presence of functional groups particularly isothiocyanate absorption at 2152 1 and 14 164 0 cm 1 distinguished the functional group of alkenes and aliphatic ch stretching in ch3 especially c c c stretching and ch oh because of its great energy and precious resources recovery potential and the cheap cost sewage wastewater is an excellent long term resource the ft ir data showed a shift in functional groups as a consequence of the exchange of metabolites in sww during biodegradation the functional groups cc co and so stretching where amide ketone and quinones were identified correlated with the maximum infrared spectra had been used to investigate various bonds and functional groups in complex sww samples haberhauer et al 2000 the structural and functional features of natural organic substance groups agreed with a study by singh et al 2019 the metabolization of organic components in the wastewater treatment process was indicated by the various functional groups found in the inlet and output samples chemical characterization and ecotoxicological analyses were carried out to identify the influence of the metabolites on aquatic biota due to their potentially dangerous nature 3 4 organic pollutants characterization fig 3 shows the gc ms ms spectrographs of organic chemicals recovered with ethyl acetate from the swws samples tables 2 and 3 present the chemical compounds identified based entirely on the mass to charge proportion m z at different retention times rts in the inlet and outlet samples respectively the majority of the synthesized derivatives seem to have been lingering secondary metabolites due to the formation of complexes with each other in the existence of divalent cations with feedstock which include numerous saturated fats such as hexadecenoic acid octadecanoic acid propanoic acid dodecanoic acid and nonacosane that were derived from primary commodities and generated wastewater chandra and kumar 2017 chandra et al 2018 some of these substances were also classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in the current study according to the usepa screening programme list u s environmental protection agency us epa 2012 tripathi et al 2022c the edc characteristics of numerous pollutants released by this industry remain unknown other substances found in the wastewater were either bacterial metabolic products or chemical additives which can behave as mycotoxins carcinogens or edcs in addition to metals and other metalloids in released wastewater the presence of these harmful chemicals must be removed or brought down to an acceptable level before the treated wastewater can be reused safely and prevent the chemicals from entering the human food chain 3 5 phytotoxicity assessment in comparison with the control phaseolus mungo l seedling growth in the presence of sww decreased by 82 and 88 after sprouting in inlet and outlet swws respectively fig 4 due to the obvious greater pollution load swws showed increased germination toxicity seed germination was inhibited in the germination experiments which was attributable to the α amylase enzyme inhibiting chemicals obuotor and odeyemi 2017 similar findings have been observed in previous research tripathi et al 2021a sourkova et al 2020 the reaction of the seed to numerous contaminants during germination activity is a critical step in the growth of plants balestri et al 2019 zayneb et al 2015 in this investigation the sww samples had a significant influence on seed germination characteristics when phaseolus mungo l roots were exposed to varied concentrations of sww samples their root length and germination were affected due to the high salt concentration table 1 higher values indicate a higher germination efficiency and rate of germination therefore the germination index gi can be employed as a phytotoxicity indicator s includes toxins both organic and inorganic that can prevent seeds from germinating according to previous studies sww with increased total salt concentrations generated oxidative pressure which resulted in germination inhibition ramana et al 2002 compared to the control all of the examined seeds treated with varying doses of sww had significantly lower root length or damage fig 4 heavy metals phenolics organic contaminants and high salt concentrations are all present in sww even at relatively low concentrations 25 of sww seed germination and plumule development were reduced seed germination plumule and radical development were further suppressed at greater doses and blackening of the embryo point was observed according to one way anova the toxicity results at varied doses exhibited substantial variance the amylase activity decreased as the concentration of sww increased amylase is responsible for the conversion of starch into maltose which is then converted into glucose by alpha glucosidase to provide energy to the germinating seed in treated plots with 25 v v sww the optimal α amylase activity was found to be 0 6 u furthermore an increase in sww by 50 reduced α amylase expression by 10 the suppression of α amylase activity might be related to the penetration of organic pollutants as well as the cumulative toxic impact of metallic compounds on the seed as a result of the effluent concentration s endosmosis effect additionally shoots and root length inhibition revealed a negative impact on plant growth hormones i e indole acetic acid iaa gibberellic acid and cytokinins which seemed to be important for shoots and root lengthening this resulted in the suppression of plant growth hormones at high effluent concentrations as well as a negative influence on germination percentage as reported in separate research chandra et al 2008a 2008b because the harmful effects of heavy metals on seed germination are well recognized high concentrations of heavy metals owing to exceeding allowed values in sww might potentially be attributed to the toxicity of the tested seed mahimairaja and bolan 2004 3 6 fish toxicity the sww was found to be extremely toxic to h fossilis despite being a well known tenacious common freshwater fish fig 5 during the 24 h incubation period the estimated lc50 based on the mortality percentage was 1 432 inlet swws and 0 932 outlet swws the percentage of mortality increased significantly as the concentration of swws increased a previous study also reported on the fish toxicity of the effluent inlet and outlet wastewater samples tripathi et al 2021a the effluent toxicity was well depicted in the photomicrograph of gills after 24 h fig 5 vacuolation and degradation of main and secondary lamellae and epithelial cells were among the abnormalities a complete loss of integrated gill tissue structure was found at a concentration of 5 inlet swws furthermore after 24 h higher concentrations of swws resulted in a higher than 5 rise in cat activity in the fish s liver indicating toxicity fig 5b this study suggested that oxidative defence mechanisms were activated in response to the production of free radicals induced by effluent exposure and the salinity shown in table 4 billah et al 2022 saha et al 2022 these new findings were validated by previous sww toxicity data in terms of lethal concentrations nutritional biochemistry and haematological markers after a 24 h exposure to swws the lc50 in h fossilis was 3 663 with 95 confidence limits of 9 231 and 0 143 this corroborated earlier toxicity results for fish toxicity in the presence of other contaminants khanom et al 2022 samim et al 2022 the treated wastewater outlet caused similar histological damage to a resilient fish species as the inlet raises concern about the safety of the treated sww in the aquatic environment and the suitability of its reuse see table 5 4 limitations of this technology in india there are a lot of issues with the technology used for treating sewage wastewater such as the need for more room and energy and the disposal of sludge in addition there are significant practical challenges associated with these technologies including inefficient removal of complex organic compounds the inability to process wastewater in excess of the set design capacity and a dearth of appropriately trained personnel these operational and technical limitations of existing wastewater treatment systems have prompted the development of new classes of advanced wastewater treatment technologies membrane technologies and advanced oxidation processes are essential components of tomorrow s wastewater treatment systems iii sludge production should be reduced and if any is produced it should be put to good use rather than dumped in a landfill iv cost effective adsorption materials v less chemical or bio flocculant applications vi a new category of nanomaterials for wastewater treatment despite the vast amount of published research on the aforementioned topics there are still knowledge gaps in the published literature that prevent adequate solutions to the problems associated with new wastewater treatment methods from being implemented effective wastewater treatment and more reuse and recycling of treated water may arise from the employment of innovative wastewater technologies in tandem with more traditional methods 5 conclusion india is the seventh largest nation in terms of land and the second largest country in terms of population nearly 1 2 billion the wastewater generated by the population is either discharged into the environment or reused for irrigation due to water scarcity the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment facility is therefore paramount in protecting the environment and human health according to the findings in this physico chemical and toxicological study various organic monomers metals and other co pollutants were detected in both the inlet and outlet sww samples and several carcinogenic and edcs compounds were detected in the outlet treated samples their discharged into the environment could impact the biota directly or indirectly the ability of chemicals to remain in the environment was confirmed by ft ir and gc ms the toxicity tests using p mungo l and h fossilis showed the inherent toxicity of the treated wastewater our results provided scientific evidence that the sewage treatment plant stp in gorakhpur was not sufficiently effective in removing the toxic compounds present in the wastewater investment in a suitable long term treatment technique such as bioremediation using autochthonous bacteria and phytoremediation using native plants is urgently needed to reduce pollutant loading in sww lower the potential harm to human and environmental health and to allow for the safe reuse of the treated wastewater ethical approval any of the authors investigations with human participants or animals are not included

result it is critical to monitor sewage effluent regularly to establish an appropriate water management system more than 90 of the sewage wastewater is used for agricultural irrigation the remainding supply is recycled and reused for drinking water ali et al 2019 sishodia et al 2016 however it is difficult in developing countries to obtain reliable wastewater reuse and recycling information due to a lack of records the production of sewage effluent is frequently linked to economic demographic and social variables the improper management and maintenance of sewage wastewater sww in developing nations is a recognized cause of environmental harm ferronato and torretta 2019 poor sewage wastewater management degrades the ecosystem resulting in pollution of the water land and air treated sewage

reuse them in rural areas verma et al 2022 a number of environmental regulatory bodies throughout the globe have concluded that sww is detrimental to human and environmental health including the world health organization unep and epa us epa therefore the safety of the treated wastewater in gorakhpur needs to be determined and established many studies examined point data on physicochemical properties to determine if treated sewage effluent could be reused one of the cost effective and efficient methods is to conduct regular environmental monitoring of plants in the affected areas dailianis et al 2021 blaise et al 2018 the phaseolus mungo l seed germination test is widely considered one of the simplest most precise and affordable phytotoxicity assays for industrial effluent barathi et al 2020 ibrahim et al 2022 it is important to measure the susceptibility of animals to toxicants as well as assess the degree of damage to target organs that may cause physiological biochemical and behavioural abnormalities tripathi et al 2022a 2022b information on the toxicity and impacts on specific local species is needed to augment risk assessment studies heteropneustes fossilis is a freshwater fish with a high yield potential often found in ponds ditches swamps marshes and in the rice fields of southeast asia khanom et al 2022 samim et al 2022 this species has become increasingly popular due to its delicious taste appealing market price and medicinal and nutritional value it has been proven to be a good candidate for aquaculture due to its very hardy nature the presence of the accessory respiratory organs also enables this species to survive additional few hours even if outside the water billah et al 2022 saha et al 2022 although h fossilis breeds in confined waters during the monsoon months they can also breed in ponds derelict ponds and ditches when sufficient rainwater accumulates which makes this fish one of the most susceptible species to exposure to aquatic pollutants in the present study as a model fish fry of freshwater stinging catfish h fossilis was selected to evaluate the lc50 mediated toxicity histopathological observations of major organs and changes in haematological parameters were investigated to understand the probable threats elicited by this wastewater during the early life stages of this fish in the wild the aim of this research is to establish scientific data concerning the physicochemical properties in the swws at a 30 mld sewage treatment facility in gorakhpur india and to investigate the toxicity of the

test was carried out in compliance with the ethical committee s local and national guidelines for animal research 2 8 1 fish collection maintenance and experimental setup during the respawning season july 35 45 g of young and strong juvenile heteropneustes fossilis were purchased from a local fish market mishra and chaube 2017 the fish were acclimatized for a week in the laboratory at a regular photoperiod and temperature 12 12 h light to dark and 25 c during the acclimation stage the fish were fed goat liver dietary carbohydrate regularly the toxicity of the sww was assessed by determining the lc50 in a 24 h exposure experiment the fish were separated into four groups of 10 fish each n 2 in duplicate the swws were given to three groups 1 0 5 0 or 10 while the fourth group was kept in plain freshwater as a control the lc50 was calculated using mortality data collected after 24 h the gills and liver of the fish were taken after they were killed in the lab gills were preserved in bouin s fixative for anatomical inspection and livers were maintained at 20 c until further study catalase activity was used to assess the stress level generated by wastewater exposure 2 8 2 histological and catalase study the snipped gill sections were dehydrated through a succession of calibrated ethanol after 24 h in the bouin s fixative and then embedded in filtered paraffin 54 to 62 c the rotator microtome weswox india was used to slice paraffin embedded gills into 5 m thick sections after passing through a series of calibrated water and ethanol the slices were double stained with hematoxylin and eosin washed in xylene and mounted in dpx to photomicrograph the activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase cat in liver tissues was measured and analysed keramati et al 2010 in

significant results p 0 001 and p 0 05 tukey s analysis was also performed using graphpad software graphpad software san diego ca usa after one way anova to see whether the results varied or differed kim 2014 chandra et al 2018 3 result and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characterization of sww the swws were brown in color and had an affected odour as indicated in table 2 the levels of bod cod and other pollution parameters were extremely high in the inlet sample of swws and decreased in the outlet sample however the values of the outlet samples remain significantly higher than the regulatory bodies usepa 2002 industrial discharge permitted limits and their detected method and instruments shown in table 1 as previously documented in other wastewater research the presence of a significant amount of dissolved organic matter as well as calcium magnesium and nitrogen compounds table 2 may have contributed to the high bod and cod of effluent choi et al 2017 tripathi et al 2021a chandra et al 2008a 2008b sankaran et al 2014 different soluble salts and heavy metals combine to form organometallic compounds with complicated structures sankaran et al 2014 chandra et al 2018 furthermore the proliferation of bod cod tss tds volatile solids total n phenolics sulfates and phosphate might be attributed to huge amounts of unidentified chemicals and hazardous chemicals created during the processing of wastewater aniyikaiye et al 2019 the elevated concentrations of heavy metals in the sww could be attributed to the deterioration of metallic connections digester vessels and to a slightly lesser extent raw materials conveyed by sewage wastewater bortoletto et al 2018 the results indicated the wastewater treatment plant was not sufficiently effective in improving the quality of the wastewater the high levels of metals remaining in the wastewater were a great concern especially in terms of wastewater reuse such as the irrigation of crops 3 2 morphological examination of pollutants the analyses indicated that both the inlet and outlet sww samples have a sophisticated and distinctive form as illustrated in fig 2a and b the sem analysis showed enlarged rods that were cylindrical in shape in the outlet samples whereas globular like structures were found in the inlet samples commonly discovered in sww speiser et al 2001 manohara and belagali 2017 the residue of thermal decomposition resulted in the stretched and porous look of sww samples the morphology of a rod and brick shape might be due to polymers or cellulose observed in sww samples likewise observations on the crystalline texture of organic molecules with their whole structure have been published previously remond et al 2002 herman et al 2016 earlier findings by graminha et al 2008 and abdel shafy and mansour 2018 revealed the existence of metallic complexes of several organic contaminants the complicated structure of several heavy metals polymers and other co pollutants was generally seen in sww samples sww samples of different pore shapes and sizes were found to be anisotropic sww samples were much finer and more uniformly scattered the elemental composition of the effluent was confirmed by edx elemental analysis the wastewater s high salt content showed that it may be a serious pollutant in both terrestrial and aquatic environments the presence of residual metals in the outlet samples as indicated by the physicochemical and sem analyses suggests the sww requires further treatment before it can be discharged safely into the aquatic environment for example bioremediation involving autochthonous bacteria and phytoremediation using native plants can provide sustainable and low cost treatment as they had been shown to be effective in reducing the metal levels tripathi et al 2021b 2022a sharma et al 2021 3 3 ultraviolet visibility and functional groups of compounds the scanning of uv vis s absorption spectra absorption peaks in the region of 200 250 nm is shown in fig 2c d this revealed a polymerized organic molecule as a complex color material with uv absorption although the absorption band had been at 220 nm 225 nm and 235 nm the spectral measurement absorbance maximum was at λmax 230 nm the defining attribute of a chemical once the polymerization procedure is completed during its production has always been maximum billaud et al 2004 a combination of additional contaminants was revealed by the modest peaks in the absorption spectrum the results of previous investigations echavarria pinto et al 2013 chandra et al 2018 have likewise corroborated this finding this study demonstrated how organic molecules were degraded with increasing dilution fig 2c d shows how little the absorbance intensities at 230 nm in sww s primary product changed there was also a dominant band at 230 nm which was previously described to demonstrate the number of early complex chemicals in the polymerized product gu et al 2010 this ultraviolet area is where a variety of chemical compounds have been produced in the early stages of the polymerization process at the sww with optical absorption echavarria pinto et al 2013 ft ir spectroscopy was used to analyse the molecular orbitals and covalent bonds in the sww samples organic robust and weak bonds functional groups and polymers were found in both the inlet and outflow samples as can be seen in fig 2e the spectra of sww samples are displayed in the infrared together with their respective absorption peaks for illustration functional groups with strong and weak bonds in organic compounds and polymers were analysed in the inlet and exit sww using the ft ir range 3500 to 500 cm 1 there was broadband at 3415 5 cm 1 in the inlet sample and 3424 4 cm 1 in the output sample with values of 2152 1 1649 1 1562 6 1414 0 1207 1 1049 5 866 4 and 851 9 cm 1 respectively the oh stretch indicated there was an alcohol hydroxyl group and a considerable amount of alcohol many organic compounds were identified in the inlet and outflow ssw samples which had a bandwidth range of 3315 5 to 2967 9 cm 1 table 2 there were functional groups such as cn or cc triple bonds in the 2188 4 and 1564 6 cm 1 broadband area the broadband area with bond n c s stretching strength of medium at 1564 6 and 1415 5 cm 1 demonstrated the presence of functional groups particularly isothiocyanate absorption at 2152 1 and 14 164 0 cm 1 distinguished the functional group of alkenes and aliphatic ch stretching in ch3 especially c c c stretching and ch oh because of its great energy and precious resources recovery potential and the cheap cost sewage wastewater is an excellent long term resource the ft ir data showed a shift in functional groups as a consequence of the exchange of metabolites in sww during biodegradation the functional groups cc co and so stretching where amide ketone and quinones were identified correlated with the maximum infrared spectra had been used to investigate various bonds and functional groups in complex sww samples haberhauer et al 2000 the structural and functional features of natural organic substance groups agreed with a study by singh et al 2019 the metabolization of organic components in the wastewater treatment process was indicated by the various functional groups found in the inlet and output samples chemical characterization and ecotoxicological analyses were carried out to identify the influence of the metabolites on aquatic biota due to their potentially dangerous nature 3 4 organic pollutants characterization fig 3 shows the gc ms ms spectrographs of organic chemicals recovered with ethyl acetate from the swws samples tables 2 and 3 present the chemical compounds identified based entirely on the mass to charge proportion m z at different retention times rts in the inlet and outlet samples respectively the majority of the synthesized derivatives seem to have been lingering secondary metabolites due to the formation of complexes with each other in the existence of divalent cations with feedstock which include numerous saturated fats such as hexadecenoic acid octadecanoic acid propanoic acid dodecanoic acid and nonacosane that were derived from primary commodities and generated wastewater chandra and kumar 2017 chandra et al 2018 some of these substances were also classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs in the current study according to the usepa screening programme list u s environmental protection agency us epa 2012 tripathi et al 2022c the edc characteristics of numerous pollutants released by this industry remain unknown other substances found in the wastewater were either bacterial metabolic products or chemical additives which can behave as mycotoxins carcinogens or edcs in addition to metals and other metalloids in released wastewater the presence of these harmful chemicals must be removed or brought down to an acceptable level before the treated wastewater can be reused safely and prevent the chemicals from entering the human food chain 3 5 phytotoxicity assessment in comparison with the control phaseolus mungo l seedling growth in the presence of sww decreased by 82 and 88 after sprouting in inlet and outlet swws respectively fig 4 due to the obvious greater pollution load swws showed increased germination toxicity seed germination was inhibited in the germination experiments which was attributable to the α amylase enzyme inhibiting chemicals obuotor and odeyemi 2017 similar findings have been observed in previous research tripathi et al 2021a sourkova et al 2020 the reaction of the seed to numerous contaminants during germination activity is a critical step in the growth of plants balestri et al 2019 zayneb et al 2015 in this investigation the sww samples had a significant influence on seed germination characteristics when phaseolus mungo l roots were exposed to varied concentrations of sww samples their root length and germination were affected due to the high salt concentration table 1 higher values indicate a higher germination efficiency and rate of germination therefore the germination index gi can be employed as a phytotoxicity indicator s includes toxins both organic and inorganic that can prevent seeds from germinating according to previous studies sww with increased total salt concentrations generated oxidative pressure which resulted in germination inhibition ramana et al 2002 compared to the control all of the examined seeds treated with varying doses of sww had significantly lower root length or damage fig 4 heavy metals phenolics organic contaminants and high salt concentrations are all present in sww even at relatively low concentrations 25 of sww seed germination and plumule development were reduced seed germination plumule and radical development were further suppressed at greater doses and blackening of the embryo point was observed according to one way anova the toxicity results at varied doses exhibited substantial variance the amylase activity decreased as the concentration of sww increased amylase is responsible for the conversion of starch into maltose which is then converted into glucose by alpha glucosidase to provide energy to the germinating seed in treated plots with 25 v v sww the optimal α amylase activity was found to be 0 6 u furthermore an increase in sww by 50 reduced α amylase expression by 10 the suppression of α amylase activity might be related to the penetration of organic pollutants as well as the cumulative toxic impact of metallic compounds on the seed as a result of the effluent concentration s endosmosis effect additionally shoots and root length inhibition revealed a negative impact on plant growth hormones i e indole acetic acid iaa gibberellic acid and cytokinins which seemed to be important for shoots and root lengthening this resulted in the suppression of plant growth hormones at high effluent concentrations as well as a negative influence on germination percentage as reported in separate research chandra et al 2008a 2008b because the harmful effects of heavy metals on seed germination are well recognized high concentrations of heavy metals owing to exceeding allowed values in sww might potentially be attributed to the toxicity of the tested seed mahimairaja and bolan 2004 3 6 fish toxicity the sww was found to be extremely toxic to h fossilis despite being a well known tenacious common freshwater fish fig 5 during the 24 h incubation period the estimated lc50 based on the mortality percentage was 1 432 inlet swws and 0 932 outlet swws the percentage of mortality increased significantly as the concentration of swws increased a previous study also reported on the fish toxicity of the effluent inlet and outlet wastewater samples tripathi et al 2021a the effluent toxicity was well depicted in the photomicrograph of gills after 24 h fig 5 vacuolation and degradation of main and secondary lamellae and epithelial cells were among the abnormalities a complete loss of integrated gill tissue structure was found at a concentration of 5 inlet swws furthermore after 24 h higher concentrations of swws resulted in a higher than 5 rise in cat activity in the fish s liver indicating toxicity fig 5b this study suggested that oxidative defence mechanisms were activated in response to the production of free radicals induced by effluent exposure and the salinity shown in table 4 billah et al 2022 saha et al 2022 these new findings were validated by previous sww toxicity data in terms of lethal concentrations nutritional biochemistry and haematological markers after a 24 h exposure to swws the lc50 in h fossilis was 3 663 with 95 confidence limits of 9 231 and 0 143 this corroborated earlier toxicity results for fish toxicity in the presence of other contaminants khanom et al 2022 samim et al 2022 the treated wastewater outlet caused similar histological damage to a resilient fish species as the inlet raises concern about the safety of the treated sww in the aquatic environment and the suitability of its reuse see table 5 4 limitations of this technology in india there are a lot of issues with the technology used for treating sewage wastewater such as the need for more room and energy and the disposal of sludge in addition there are significant practical challenges associated with these technologies including inefficient removal of complex organic compounds the inability to process wastewater in excess of the set design capacity and a dearth of appropriately trained personnel these operational and technical limitations of existing wastewater treatment systems have prompted the development of new classes of advanced wastewater treatment technologies membrane technologies and advanced oxidation processes are essential components of tomorrow s wastewater treatment systems iii sludge production should be reduced and if any is produced it should be put to good use rather than dumped in a landfill iv cost effective adsorption materials v less chemical or bio flocculant applications vi a new category of nanomaterials for wastewater treatment despite the vast amount of published research on the aforementioned topics there are still knowledge gaps in the published literature that prevent adequate solutions to the problems associated with new wastewater treatment methods from being implemented effective wastewater treatment and more reuse and recycling of treated water may arise from the employment of innovative wastewater technologies in tandem with more traditional methods 5 conclusion india is the seventh largest nation in terms of land and the second largest country in terms of population nearly 1 2 billion the wastewater generated by the population is either discharged into the environment or reused for irrigation due to water scarcity the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment facility is therefore paramount in protecting the environment and human health according to the findings in this physico chemical and toxicological study various organic monomers metals and other co pollutants were detected in both the inlet and outlet sww samples and several carcinogenic and edcs compounds were detected in the outlet treated samples their discharged into the environment could impact the biota directly or indirectly the ability of chemicals to remain in the environment was confirmed by ft ir and gc ms the toxicity tests using p mungo l and h fossilis showed the inherent toxicity of the treated wastewater our results provided scientific evidence that the sewage treatment plant stp in gorakhpur was not sufficiently effective in removing the toxic compounds present in the wastewater investment in a suitable long term treatment technique such as bioremediation using autochthonous bacteria and phytoremediation using native plants is urgently needed to reduce pollutant loading in sww lower the potential harm to human and environmental health and to allow for the safe reuse of the treated wastewater ethical approval any of the authors investigations with human participants or animals are not included
