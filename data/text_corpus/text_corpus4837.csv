24185,while plankton are often characterized by metabolism as either phototrophic primary producers or heterotrophic consumers many actually combine photosynthesis and phagotrophy within a single cell these mixotrophic plankton which play an important biogeochemical role in marine food webs exhibit diverse metabolic strategies with varied contributions from photosynthesis and phagotrophy mixotrophs

was able to adjust its nutrition from complete phagotrophy to mixotrophy as a function of light and therefore is characterized as a facultative mixotroph a different strain was identified as an obligate phototroph because it could not survive phagotrophically in darkness lie et al 2018 li et al 2022 also illustrated in their study a spectrum of mixotrophic strategies by the variation in grazing abilities where mixotrophs fall on the phototrophy phagotrophy spectrum can have significant consequences for ecosystem level biogeochemical characteristics since mixotrophs compete with both

mixotroph metabolic strategies are likely shaped not only by the supply of resources e g light inorganic nutrients and prey but also by competition with other species compared to their specialist

treatments have been shown to have a positive effect on phytoplankton biomass and a negative effect on nutrient flux as a result of increased water column stratification leading to potentially more intense competition among primary producers lewandowska et al 2014 experimental results have not been entirely conclusive however for example princiotta et al 2016 examined the role of temperature on grazing and photosynthesis of a mixotrophic alga identifying an increase in both ingestion and photosynthesis rates however wilken et al 2013 showed that warming can lead to differences in the increase of mixotroph metabolic rates proposing that it would be more beneficial for mixotrophs to become more phagotrophic with rising temperature the relationship between mixotroph metabolism and temperature appears complex and may incorporate ecological feedbacks making prediction of warming s effect on competitive trait displacement difficult here we model the effects of a specialized phototrophic competitor on the optimal metabolic strategy of a constitutive mixotroph in our model mixotrophic growth as well as competition with a specialized primary producer depends on a single nutrient resource phototrophy and phagotrophy are treated as completely substitutable methods for obtaining this resource and fueling subsequent growth these simplifying assumptions help abstract mixotrophs complex interactions as both producers and consumers stickney et al 2000 into mathematical terms by varying input parameters we simulate a variety of interesting real life and theoretical scenarios specifically we ask 1 how different investments of resources into phagotrophy and phototrophy affect resource availability in the environment 2 what effects competition between phytoplankton and mixotrophs has on mixotroph metabolic strategies 3 what factors contribute to these effects and 4 how temperature alters outcomes 2 methods to simulate the dynamics between specialized

phototrophy cause decreasing investments in phagotrophy following gonzalez et al 2022 we model the attack rate a as a decreasing function of θ that is scaled by the shape parameter z 5 a 1 θ 2 z 2 z a ˆ where a ˆ is the maximum achievable attack rate when θ 0 when z 0 the mixotroph experiences a linear tradeoff in the supplementary material we consider two additional cases z 1 representing a generalist tradeoff in which the mixotroph can simultaneously maintain high rates of phototrophy and phagotrophy at intermediate θ values and z 1 representing a specialist tradeoff in which only one metabolic rate can be high at a time figure s1 phytoplankton mixotroph and bacteria mortality terms all contribute to the pool of organic matter which is then remineralized by bacteria with a rate of

simulated the model for θ 0 1 while setting other parameters as constants table 1 we define the optimal mixotroph investment strategy θ o p t as the value of θ that minimizes the steady state nutrient concentration because competition between mixotrophs and phytoplankton is mediated through the shared nutrient resource minimizing the nutrient concentration maximizes mixotroph competitive ability tilman 1977 1990 we also consider temperature dependency in this model by defining rate parameters as a function of temperature t this is done by introducing the temperature coefficient q 10 such that 8 x t e m p e r a t u r e d e p e n d e n t x q 10 t 20 10 where x represents the uptake rates u p u m u b mortality rates m p m m m b and the mixotroph attack rate a importantly the phagotrophic parameter mixotroph attack rate a may either take the same or a different q 10 value from the phototrophic uptake and mortality rates wilken et al 2013 archibald et al 2022 we simulated the temperature dependent model under these two q 10 assumptions and compared the model s asymptotic behavior in each we considered two competition scenarios table 1 1 a baseline case in which only mixotrophs are present p 0 and 2 a competition case in which p 0 the first case established a baseline for the optimal mixotroph metabolic strategy in the absence of competition and the second case allowed us to measure character displacement due to competition 3 results the equilibrium ecosystem state depends on the mixotroph s metabolic strategy θ mixotroph and phytoplankton biomass at equilibrium change as mixotrophs move from entirely phagotrophic to entirely phototrophic strategies fig 2 even in the absence of phytoplankton the optimal mixotroph strategy occurs at a θ value between zero and one indicating that some degree of mixotrophy is favored instead of complete phototrophy or phagotrophy when the mixotroph is entirely phagotrophic θ 0 and phytoplankton are absent there are no primary producers in the system and therefore no source of new organic matter as a result both mixotrophs and bacteria are extinct at equilibrium as θ initially increases mixotrophs are able to exploit abundant inorganic nutrients via photosynthesis supporting higher mixotroph biomass fig 2a however the high attack rates maintained at small values of θ ensure that bacteria are near extinction at equilibrium eventually as mixotrophs invest more into phototrophy and consequently less into phagotrophy attack rates drop and bacterial populations increase this increased bacterial biomass contributes to further increases in mixotroph biomass in two ways 1 by accelerating remineralization of inorganic nutrients that support photosynthesis and 2 by directly supporting phagotrophic growth as θ continues to grow nutrients become scarcer in the environment due to mixotroph consumption while bacteria accumulate and phototrophy gradually becomes less favorable for mixotrophs because of the opportunity cost of not utilizing the bacterial prey pool maximum mixotrophic biomass corresponds very closely to θ o p t where the mixotroph is exploiting both nutrients and bacteria pools to some degree fig 2a when phytoplankton are present in the ecosystem mixotrophs have overall lower biomass and an optimal metabolic strategy that is more phagotrophic compared to when phytoplankton are absent fig 2b the presence of phytoplankton competitively displaces mixotrophs from a highly photosynthetic θ o p t 0 95 niche towards a greater reliance on bacteria that are being supported by photosynthetically produced organic matter importantly mixotrophs that are entirely phagotrophic are able to persist when phytoplankton are present because there is a primary producer to convert inorganic nutrients into organic matter that can be utilized by the rest of the ecosystem the mixotroph s optimal metabolic strategy θ o p t is sensitive to a number of model parameters often in opposite directions fig 3 for example as the growth rate of phytoplankton u p increases the competition between mixotrophs and phytoplankton is more intense this leads mixotrophs to shift towards a more phagotrophic metabolic strategy to mitigate the competition effect lower θ o p t fig 3a on the other hand as the maximum uptake rate of the mixotroph u ˆ m increases photosynthesis becomes more efficient and θ o p t becomes more phototrophic fig 3b similarly as the attack rate a ˆ of mixotrophs increases the bacterial prey pool may become depleted leading mixotrophs to rely more on photosynthesis fig 3c in general an increase in parameters such as m p a ˆ and u ˆ m would give mixotrophs more advantages in competition with phytoplankton this would in turn lead to an increase in θ o p t encouraging the optimal metabolic strategy of mixotrophs to become more phototrophic an increase in parameters such as u p increasing phytoplankton photosynthetic rates and m m increasing mixotroph mortality on the contrary make the mixotroph a weaker competitor alternatively an increase in u b provides more prey for phagotrophy therefore increases in all of these parameters lead to a decrease in θ o p t encouraging mixotrophs metabolic strategy to become more phagotrophic our results were sensitive to the trade off that the mixotroph experienced between investment strategies mixotrophs with generalist trade off curves tended to maintain relatively higher investments in photosynthesis greater θ o p t values even in the presence of phytoplankton because they experience weaker reductions in attack rate compared to mixotrophs with linear trade offs fig s2 s3 in contrast mixotrophs with specialist trade offs can only achieve high rates of one metabolic process at a time as a result our analysis predicts that these mixotrophs will tend to specialize as either phototrophs θ o p t 0 in the absence of phytoplankton competition or phagotrophs θ o p t 1 in the presence of phytoplankton competition fig s4 s5 note that a phagotrophic strategy θ o p t 0 can still be resource minimizing due to feedbacks between mixotroph grazing bacterial abundance and nutrient remineralization fig s4 temperature and the phagotrophic q 10 value of mixotrophs also affect the optimal strategy of mixotrophs and the corresponding biomass of phytoplankton mixotroph and bacteria fig 4 with rising temperatures multiple metabolic rates increase including both mixotroph and phytoplankton growth rates these increasing metabolic rates have contradicting effects on θ o p t fig 3 as a result the overall displacement effect of temperature depends on the integrated effects of multiple sometimes opposing factors we examined the competition effect both as a function of temperature and the q 10 of mixotroph grazing when phytoplankton are absent warming temperatures allow the accumulation of both mixotroph and bacteria biomass as internal cycling becomes more efficient the growing number of bacteria in turn supports mixotroph phagotrophy leading to a decrease in θ o p t recall that θ o p t 0 means fully phagotrophic in the meantime the increasing respiratory losses at higher temperatures cause a decrease in mixotroph biomass when q 10 is low since mixotroph phagotrophy is not efficient enough to mitigate the losses at a higher phagotrophic q 10 level however the grazing term of the mixotroph becomes too large as temperature increases such that the consumption eventually starts to damage bacterial growth leading to a much slower accumulation in bacteria biomass mixotrophs are thus forced to decrease their shift towards phagotrophy the balance between these contrasting mechanisms means that the relationship between θ o p t and temperature depends in part on the q 10 value for mixotroph grazing when phytoplankton are present they compete with mixotrophs for nutrients as phagotrophic efficiency increases mixotrophs become competitively dominant over phytoplankton whose biomass begins to decrease fewer competitors open the opportunity for mixotrophs to perform more phototrophy leading to an increase in θ o p t however the competition with phytoplankton still displaces mixotrophs from their phototrophic niche as θ o p t is generally lower in values after competition is introduced fig 5a this displacement effect is subject to the change in temperature and q 10 overall the displacement effect of competition is larger at lower temperatures and higher q 10 values fig 5b 4 discussion this study examines the effects of competition between mixotrophs and a specialized phytoplankton competitor on mixotroph metabolic strategy previous modeling studies have shown that the combination of phototrophy and heterotrophy can grant mixotrophs a competitive edge flynn and mitra 2009 leles et al 2018 ward 2019 in experimental studies mixotrophs are often found to prefer one metabolic strategy over another sanders et al 1990 lie et al 2018 these diverse metabolic strategies mixotrophs can exhibit have been shown to be affected by the availability of both nutrients and prey resources jones 2000 wilken et al 2020 livanou et al 2020 the results of our model simulations agree with the theory that mixotroph s optimal metabolic strategy is to utilize both photosynthesis and phagotrophy even without the presence of competitors furthermore our study suggests that the choice of metabolic strategy is also affected by the competition brought by phytoplankton which displaces mixotrophs away from the photosynthetic niche to adopt a more phagotrophic metabolism the presence or absence of phytoplankton creates ecological feedbacks that affect the supply rate of resources needed for mixotroph growth shifting abiotic conditions previously demonstrated to influence mixotroph metabolic strategy chakraborty et al 2017 decelle 2013 the magnitude of this trait displacement is subject to changes in temperature and the thermal sensitivity q 10 of phagotrophic metabolic processes we found that the competitive displacement effect is larger at lower temperatures and that mixotrophs with relatively high phagotrophic q 10 values are more sensitive to this effect as both predators and primary producers mixotrophic microorganisms are increasingly recognized for their significant contribution to carbon cycling mixotrophs biogeochemical niche is often quite complex as their photosynthetic energy acquisition compensates at least in part for their respiratory losses worden et al 2015 wilken et al 2020 as a result mixotrophy itself can make the transfer of biomass up the food chain more efficient leading to an increase in vertical carbon flux ward and follows 2016 however the exact magnitude of this effect likely depends on the degree of mixotrophy expressed i e the mixotroph s nutritional strategy wilken et al 2014 thus highlighting the importance of understanding the link between a mixotroph s metabolic strategy and its biogeochemical niche here we have explored the influence of competition on mixotrophy s role in carbon cycling as mixotrophs are shifted out of the phototrophic niche by competition with specialist phototrophs there would be less carbon capture in the marine ecosystem and increased overall respiration by plankton communities the presence of temperature dependence in our results suggests that the relationship between competition and mixotrophic biogeochemical niche in marine ecosystems may indeed shift as a result of global climate change other studies e g jassey et al 2015 have found that mixotrophs play a key role in the response of ecosystem carbon cycling to climate change which makes it even more important to understand the thermal response of these organisms previous competition models have examined the competitive advantages and disadvantages of mixotrophs but contrasting theories exist stickney et al 2000 although some expected that the potential evolutionary costs of maintaining both phototrophic and heterotrophic machinery may give mixotrophs disadvantages stickney et al 2000 raven 2003 others argue that even with relatively higher costs the combined use of phototrophy and phagotrophy could give mixotrophs advantages under certain environmental conditions bockstahler and coats 1993 katechakis and stibor 2006 in reality it has also been suggested that the metabolic costs for photosynthesis and prey uptake are multidimensional and that within different ranges of costs mixotrophs may have higher or lower overall costs than specialized competitors raven 2003 this idea further complicates the evaluation of mixotrophy s competitiveness our model examines the case where mixotrophs are less competitive compared to their specialized phototroph competitor see fig 2b and concludes that they are also forced out of their phototrophic niche when competing with phytoplankton for a single limited nutrient source what would happen if we consider other cases where mixotrophs are more than or equally competitive as specialized phototrophs this suggests a future direction for similar studies in our study we examine mixotroph strategies that minimize nutrients on the principle that this strategy maximizes the mixotroph s competitive ability indeed our test simulations show that mixotrophs with optimal strategies achieve higher biomass than mixotrophs with suboptimal strategies although competitive exclusion does not always occur thus our model suggests that if an evolutionary analysis were undertaken evolutionary branching leading to coexistence of different mixotroph types could occur this is consistent with other modeling studies of mixotroph evolution e g troost et al 2005a b further other optimality conditions such as maximization of growth rates could be considered the model we used in our study accounts for the interactions between a small number of plankton types mixotrophs phytoplankton and bacteria under a single inorganic nutrient source the relative simplicity of this structure allows for a rigorous exploration of mechanisms and model parameters however real marine ecosystems include many more axes of complexity that could be adapted to investigate effects of specific ecological phenomenon on mixotroph optimal metabolic strategy for example competition often occurs for multiple resources simultaneously so the effects of competition are likely more complex than those presented here co limitation of light huisman and weissing 1994 or phosphorus codeço and grover 2001 would provide interesting avenues for future investigation on the other hand competition with not just phototrophs but also heterotrophs has been widely discussed by combining light inorganic nutrients and prey as substitutable resources mixotrophs are found to be able to reduce prey abundance below the critical food concentration of competing specialist heterotrophs and thus outcompete them in the competition rothhaupt 1996 tittel et al 2003 this strategy has a potential effect on character displacement and the actual direction of such displacement calls for future research furthermore the mixotrophs in our model are assumed to use phototrophy and phagotrophy interchangeably for growth even when they experience different trade offs between metabolic investments figures s1 s5 in this way our model parallels other representations of mixotrophs such as those used in large scale upper ocean ecosystem models ward and follows 2016 however there is a wide array of mixotrophs that exist in nature and our model does not capture the nuances of mixotrophs with different resource requirements for example inducible mixotrophs e g prorocentrum minimum johnson 2014 prefer phototrophy and feed only when nutrients are limiting other mixotrophs are obligate phagotrophs or phototrophs lie et al 2018 wilken et al 2020 moeller et al 2019 incorporating these mixotroph strategies would require alternative model formulations that account for the different types of resources mixotrophs obtain through phototrophy and phagotrophy e g that accounts for both carbon and nutrients flynn and mitra 2009 such models have used quota based approaches where growth depends on internal rather than environmental concentration of nutrients ward et al 2011 leles et al 2018 edwards 2019 future work could expand on our model to include multiple resource types in order to better account for other mixotroph metabolic strategies knowing that mixotrophs may be either more or less competitive than their specialized competitors as environmental factors are altered raises the question of what types of environments would generally favor mixotrophy over specialized phototrophy or phagotrophy hansson et al 2019 identified variables driving the success of mixotrophs using data collected from north american lakes they found that the success of mixotrophy was positively related to the concentration of colored dissolved organic matter cdom and dissolved co 2 they also pointed out that while water temperature and food abundance have a positive effect on mixotroph productivity as well these factors also favor specialized phototrophic phytoplanktons in the same way competition then may influence not only the optimal strategy of mixotrophic plankton but play a role in maintaining mixotrophy as a trophic strategy in general mixotrophs play a vital role in establishing the biogeochemical character of marine ecosystems here we have used a simple model of competition between a mixotroph and a specialized phototrophic phytoplankton to explore competitive trait displacement in mixotrophic metabolic strategy our results suggest that in the presence of phytoplankton mixotrophs should experience competitive displacement of their metabolic investment traits specifically mixotrophs should shift towards more phagotrophic investments to reduce niche overlap with strict phototrophs thus mixotrophs role in carbon cycling will depend upon the presence or absence of competitors this effect on mixotroph nutritional strategy is also temperature dependent suggesting a link between community level competitive mechanisms and global climate change given the unique biogeochemical nature of marine mixotrophs understanding this link is an important building block in constructing a comprehensive theory of how mixotrophs ecological role changes in the context of global warming credit authorship contribution statement tianyi chu model analysis writing original draft

ˆ where a ˆ is the maximum achievable attack rate when θ 0 when z 0 the mixotroph experiences a linear tradeoff in the supplementary material we consider two additional cases z 1 representing a generalist tradeoff in which the mixotroph can simultaneously maintain high rates of phototrophy and phagotrophy at intermediate θ values and z 1 representing a specialist tradeoff in which only one

simulated the model for θ 0 1 while setting other parameters as constants table 1 we define the optimal mixotroph investment strategy θ o p t as the value of θ that minimizes the steady state nutrient concentration because competition between mixotrophs and phytoplankton is mediated through the shared nutrient resource minimizing the nutrient concentration maximizes mixotroph competitive ability tilman 1977 1990 we also consider temperature dependency in this model by defining rate parameters as a function of temperature t this is done by introducing the temperature coefficient q 10 such that 8 x t e m p e r a t u r e d e p e n d e n t x q 10 t 20 10 where x represents the uptake rates u p u m u b mortality rates m p m m m b and the mixotroph attack rate a importantly the phagotrophic parameter mixotroph attack rate a may either take the same or a different q 10 value from the phototrophic uptake and mortality rates wilken et al 2013 archibald et al 2022 we simulated the temperature dependent model under these two q 10 assumptions and compared the model s asymptotic behavior in each we considered two competition scenarios table 1 1 a baseline case in which only mixotrophs are present p 0 and 2 a competition case in which p 0 the first case established a baseline for the optimal mixotroph metabolic strategy in the absence of competition and the second case allowed us to measure character displacement due to competition 3 results the equilibrium ecosystem state depends on the mixotroph s metabolic strategy θ mixotroph and phytoplankton biomass at equilibrium change as mixotrophs move from entirely phagotrophic to entirely phototrophic strategies fig 2 even in the absence of phytoplankton the optimal mixotroph strategy occurs at a θ value between zero and one indicating that some degree of mixotrophy is favored instead of complete phototrophy or phagotrophy when the mixotroph is entirely phagotrophic θ 0 and phytoplankton are absent there are no primary producers in the system and therefore no source of new organic matter as a result both mixotrophs and bacteria are extinct at equilibrium as θ initially increases mixotrophs are able to exploit abundant inorganic nutrients via photosynthesis supporting higher mixotroph biomass fig 2a however the high attack rates maintained at small values of θ ensure that bacteria are near extinction at equilibrium eventually as mixotrophs invest more into phototrophy and consequently less into phagotrophy attack rates drop and bacterial populations increase this increased bacterial biomass contributes to further increases in mixotroph biomass in two ways 1 by accelerating remineralization of inorganic nutrients that support photosynthesis and 2 by directly supporting phagotrophic growth as θ continues to grow nutrients become scarcer in the environment due to mixotroph consumption while bacteria accumulate and phototrophy gradually becomes less favorable for mixotrophs because of the opportunity cost of not utilizing the bacterial prey pool maximum mixotrophic biomass corresponds very closely to θ o p t where the mixotroph is exploiting both nutrients and bacteria pools to some degree fig 2a when phytoplankton are present in the ecosystem mixotrophs have overall lower biomass and an optimal metabolic strategy that is more phagotrophic compared to when phytoplankton are absent fig 2b the presence of phytoplankton competitively displaces mixotrophs from a highly photosynthetic θ o p t 0 95 niche towards a greater reliance on bacteria that are being supported by photosynthetically produced organic matter importantly mixotrophs that are entirely phagotrophic are able to persist when phytoplankton are present because there is a primary producer to convert inorganic nutrients into organic matter that can be utilized by the rest of the ecosystem the mixotroph s optimal metabolic strategy θ o p t is sensitive to a number of model parameters often in opposite directions fig 3 for example as the growth rate of phytoplankton u p increases the competition between mixotrophs and phytoplankton is more intense this leads mixotrophs to shift towards a more phagotrophic metabolic strategy to mitigate the competition effect lower θ o p t fig 3a on the other hand as the maximum uptake rate of the mixotroph u ˆ m increases photosynthesis becomes more efficient and θ o p t becomes more phototrophic fig 3b similarly as the attack rate a ˆ of mixotrophs increases the bacterial prey pool may become depleted leading mixotrophs to rely more on photosynthesis fig 3c in general an increase in parameters such as m p a ˆ and u ˆ m would give mixotrophs more advantages in competition with phytoplankton this would in turn lead to an increase in θ o p t encouraging the optimal metabolic strategy of mixotrophs to become more phototrophic an increase in parameters such as u p increasing phytoplankton photosynthetic rates and m m increasing mixotroph mortality on the contrary make the mixotroph a weaker competitor alternatively an increase in u b provides more prey for phagotrophy therefore increases in all of these parameters lead to a decrease in θ o p t encouraging mixotrophs metabolic strategy to become more phagotrophic our results were sensitive to the trade off that the mixotroph experienced between investment strategies mixotrophs with generalist trade off curves tended to maintain relatively higher investments in photosynthesis greater θ o p t values even in the presence of phytoplankton because they experience weaker reductions in attack rate compared to mixotrophs with linear trade offs fig s2 s3 in contrast mixotrophs with specialist trade offs can only achieve high rates of one metabolic process at a time as a result our analysis predicts that these mixotrophs will tend to specialize as either phototrophs θ o p t 0 in the absence of phytoplankton competition or phagotrophs θ o p t 1 in the presence of phytoplankton competition fig s4 s5 note that a phagotrophic strategy θ o p t 0 can still be resource minimizing due to feedbacks between mixotroph grazing bacterial abundance and nutrient remineralization fig s4 temperature and the phagotrophic q 10 value of mixotrophs also affect the optimal strategy of mixotrophs and the corresponding biomass of phytoplankton mixotroph and bacteria fig 4 with rising temperatures multiple metabolic rates increase including both mixotroph and phytoplankton growth rates these increasing metabolic rates have contradicting effects on θ o p t fig 3 as a result the overall displacement effect of temperature depends on the integrated effects of multiple sometimes opposing factors we examined the competition effect both as a function of temperature and the q 10 of mixotroph grazing when phytoplankton are absent warming temperatures allow the accumulation of both mixotroph and bacteria biomass as internal cycling becomes more efficient the growing number of bacteria in turn supports mixotroph phagotrophy leading to a decrease in θ o p t recall that θ o p t 0 means fully phagotrophic in the meantime the increasing respiratory losses at higher temperatures cause a decrease in mixotroph biomass when q 10 is low since mixotroph phagotrophy is not efficient enough to mitigate the losses at a higher phagotrophic q 10 level however the grazing term of the mixotroph becomes too large as temperature increases such that the consumption eventually starts to damage bacterial growth leading to a much slower accumulation in bacteria biomass mixotrophs are thus forced to decrease their shift towards phagotrophy the balance between these contrasting mechanisms means that the relationship between θ o p t and temperature depends in part on the q 10 value for mixotroph grazing when phytoplankton are present they compete with mixotrophs for nutrients as phagotrophic efficiency increases mixotrophs become competitively dominant over phytoplankton whose biomass begins to decrease fewer competitors open the opportunity for mixotrophs to perform more phototrophy leading to an increase in θ o p t however the competition with phytoplankton still displaces mixotrophs from their phototrophic niche as θ o p t is generally lower in values after competition is introduced fig 5a this displacement effect is subject to the change in temperature and q 10 overall the displacement effect of competition is larger at lower temperatures and higher q 10 values fig 5b 4 discussion this study examines the effects of competition between mixotrophs and a specialized phytoplankton competitor on mixotroph metabolic strategy previous modeling studies have shown that the combination of phototrophy and heterotrophy can grant mixotrophs a competitive edge flynn and mitra 2009 leles et al 2018 ward 2019 in experimental studies mixotrophs are often found to prefer one metabolic strategy over another sanders et al 1990 lie et al 2018 these diverse metabolic strategies mixotrophs can exhibit have been shown to be affected by the availability of both nutrients and prey resources jones 2000 wilken et al 2020 livanou et al 2020 the results of our model simulations agree with the theory that mixotroph s optimal metabolic strategy is to utilize both photosynthesis and phagotrophy even without the presence of competitors furthermore our study suggests that the choice of metabolic strategy is also affected by the competition brought by phytoplankton which displaces mixotrophs away from the photosynthetic niche to adopt a more phagotrophic metabolism the presence or absence of phytoplankton creates ecological feedbacks that affect the supply rate of resources needed for mixotroph growth shifting abiotic conditions previously demonstrated to influence mixotroph metabolic strategy chakraborty et al 2017 decelle 2013 the magnitude of this trait displacement is subject to changes in temperature and the thermal sensitivity q 10 of phagotrophic metabolic processes we found that the competitive displacement effect is larger at lower temperatures and that mixotrophs with relatively high phagotrophic q 10 values are more sensitive to this effect as both predators and primary producers mixotrophic microorganisms are increasingly recognized for their significant contribution to carbon cycling mixotrophs biogeochemical niche is often quite complex as their photosynthetic energy acquisition compensates at least in part for their respiratory losses worden et al 2015 wilken et al 2020 as a result mixotrophy itself can make the transfer of biomass up the food chain more efficient leading to an increase in vertical carbon flux ward and follows 2016 however the exact magnitude of this effect likely depends on the degree of mixotrophy expressed i e the mixotroph s nutritional strategy wilken et al 2014 thus highlighting the importance of understanding the link between a mixotroph s metabolic strategy and its biogeochemical niche here we have explored the influence of competition on mixotrophy s role in carbon cycling as mixotrophs are shifted out of the phototrophic niche by competition with specialist phototrophs there would be less carbon capture in the marine ecosystem and increased overall respiration by plankton communities the presence of temperature dependence in our results suggests that the relationship between competition and mixotrophic biogeochemical niche in marine ecosystems may indeed shift as a result of global climate change other studies e g jassey et al 2015 have found that mixotrophs play a key role in the response of ecosystem carbon cycling to climate change which makes it even more important to understand the thermal response of these organisms previous competition models have examined the competitive advantages and disadvantages of mixotrophs but contrasting theories exist stickney et al 2000 although some expected that the potential evolutionary costs of maintaining both phototrophic and heterotrophic machinery may give mixotrophs disadvantages stickney et al 2000 raven 2003 others argue that even with relatively higher costs the combined use of phototrophy and phagotrophy could give mixotrophs advantages under certain environmental conditions bockstahler and coats 1993 katechakis and stibor 2006 in reality it has also been suggested that the metabolic costs for photosynthesis and prey uptake are multidimensional and that within different ranges of costs mixotrophs may have higher or lower overall costs than specialized competitors raven 2003 this idea further complicates the evaluation of mixotrophy s competitiveness our model examines the case where mixotrophs are less competitive compared to their specialized phototroph competitor see fig 2b and concludes that they are also forced out of their phototrophic niche when competing with phytoplankton for a single limited nutrient source what would happen if we consider other cases where mixotrophs are more than or equally competitive as specialized phototrophs this suggests a future direction for similar studies in our study we examine mixotroph strategies that minimize nutrients on the principle that this strategy maximizes the mixotroph s competitive ability indeed our test simulations show that mixotrophs with optimal strategies achieve higher biomass than mixotrophs with suboptimal strategies although competitive exclusion does not always occur thus our model suggests that if an evolutionary analysis were undertaken evolutionary branching leading to coexistence of different mixotroph types could occur this is consistent with other modeling studies of mixotroph evolution e g troost et al 2005a b further other optimality conditions such as maximization of growth rates could be considered the model we used in our study accounts for the interactions between a small number of plankton types mixotrophs phytoplankton and bacteria under a single inorganic nutrient source the relative simplicity of this structure allows for a rigorous exploration of mechanisms and model parameters however real marine ecosystems include many more axes of complexity that could be adapted to investigate effects of specific ecological phenomenon on mixotroph optimal metabolic strategy for example competition often occurs for multiple resources simultaneously so the effects of competition are likely more complex than those presented here co limitation of light huisman and weissing 1994 or phosphorus codeço and grover 2001 would provide interesting avenues for future investigation on the other hand competition with not just phototrophs but also heterotrophs has been widely discussed by combining light inorganic nutrients and prey as substitutable resources mixotrophs are found to be able to reduce prey abundance below the critical food concentration of competing specialist heterotrophs and thus outcompete them in the competition rothhaupt 1996 tittel et al 2003 this strategy has a potential effect on character displacement and the actual direction of such displacement calls for future research furthermore the mixotrophs in our model are assumed to use phototrophy and phagotrophy interchangeably for growth even when they experience different trade offs between metabolic investments figures s1 s5 in this way our model parallels other representations of mixotrophs such as those used in large scale upper ocean ecosystem models ward and follows 2016 however there is a wide array of mixotrophs that exist in nature and our model does not capture the nuances of mixotrophs with different resource requirements for example inducible mixotrophs e g prorocentrum minimum johnson 2014 prefer phototrophy and feed only when nutrients are limiting other mixotrophs are obligate phagotrophs or phototrophs lie et al 2018 wilken et al 2020 moeller et al 2019 incorporating these mixotroph strategies would require alternative model formulations that account for the different types of resources mixotrophs obtain through phototrophy and phagotrophy e g that accounts for both carbon and nutrients flynn and mitra 2009 such models have used quota based approaches where growth depends on internal rather than environmental concentration of nutrients ward et al 2011 leles et al 2018 edwards 2019 future work could expand on our model to include multiple resource types in order to better account for other mixotroph metabolic strategies knowing that mixotrophs may be either more or less competitive than their specialized competitors as environmental factors are altered raises the question of what types of environments would generally favor mixotrophy over specialized phototrophy or phagotrophy hansson et al 2019 identified variables driving the success of mixotrophs using data collected from north american lakes they found that the success of mixotrophy was positively related to the concentration of colored dissolved organic matter cdom and dissolved co 2 they also pointed out that while water temperature and food abundance have a positive effect on mixotroph productivity as well these factors also favor specialized phototrophic phytoplanktons in the same way competition then may influence not only the optimal strategy of mixotrophic plankton but play a role in maintaining mixotrophy as a trophic strategy in general mixotrophs play a vital role in establishing the biogeochemical character of marine ecosystems here we have used a simple model of competition between a mixotroph and a specialized phototrophic phytoplankton to explore competitive trait displacement in mixotrophic metabolic strategy our results suggest that in the presence of phytoplankton mixotrophs should experience competitive displacement of their metabolic investment traits specifically mixotrophs should shift towards more phagotrophic investments to reduce niche overlap with strict phototrophs thus mixotrophs role in carbon cycling will depend upon the presence or absence of competitors this effect on mixotroph nutritional strategy is also temperature dependent suggesting a link between community level competitive mechanisms and global climate change given the unique biogeochemical nature of marine mixotrophs understanding this link is an important building block in constructing a comprehensive theory of how mixotrophs ecological role changes in the context of global warming credit authorship contribution statement tianyi chu model analysis writing original draft

24186,the terrestrial biosphere has a crucial role in controlling the rate of co2 accumulation in the atmosphere the quantification of net ecosystem exchange nee is critical to determine whether the regional terrestrial ecosystem is a net sink or source of co2 this study uses a satellite data derived light use efficiency model the vegetation photosynthesis and respiration model vprm to compute the biospheric co2 fluxes over india from 2011 2020 a very high resolution land use land cover lulc data from the irs p6 satellite and modis derived surface reflectance are utilised to compute the nee over distinct vegetation types at 9 km 9 km the vprm model for the indian region captures the spatial pattern and seasonal features of nee over the country the magnitude of annual mean nee over india from the vprm model is relatively high compared to that from carbon tracker fluxcom and soil moisture active passive level 4 carbon data products however the vprm model simulated nee agrees with the nee observations from the eddy covariance estimates which are accepted as the ground truth the fusion of high resolution lulc and surface reflectance data in vprm suggests that the average nee over the indian region during 2011 2020 is 0 16 0 02 pgc yr 1 among this the contribution from gross ecosystem exchange is about 0 47 0 02 pgc yr 1 and respiration is 0 31 0 01 pgc yr 1 the maximum biospheric co2 absorption is during the post monsoon season and the minimum is during the pre monsoon season the very high spatial resolution and heterogeneity resolved in the nee data derived in this

model data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the increasing atmospheric concentration of co2 is a major cause of global warming and climate change forster et al 2021 anthropogenic activities such as fossil fuel emission and cement production have substantially altered the carbon cycle since the dawn of the industrial era it has a lead buildup of co2 in the atmosphere perturbs the earth system s net radiative balance an additional radiative forcing of 2 16 0 26 w m 2 and triggers climate change forster et al 2021 the atmospheric co2 concentration reached 414 7 ppm in 2021 compared to 277 ppm at the beginning of the industrial era in 1750 dlugokencky and tans 2022 however compared to the increase in co2 emission the atmospheric growth rate of co2 is lesser it is due to the removal of co2 through natural processes operating in the land biosphere and ocean gurney et al 2004 valsala and maksyutov 2010 these natural sinks have roughly halved the atmospheric growth rate of co2 crisp et al 2022 terrestrial biosphere sequesters around 3 4 0 9 pgc yr 1 from the atmosphere almost 30 of the total annual anthropogenic co2 emission friedlingstein et al 2022 however this estimate s substantial uncertainty 25 calls for the need to improve our understanding of the terrestrial biospheric fluxes the terrestrial biosphere and soil are important storehouses of atmospheric carbon and hence have a crucial role in controlling the rate of co2 accumulation in the atmosphere the amount of carbon stored in the biosphere mainly depends on the equilibrium between co2 fixed through photosynthesis and removed through respiration and decomposition the exchange of co2 between the biosphere and atmosphere is based on complex biogeochemical processes which depend on several factors such as plant functional type plant phenology water availability air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation during 2011 2020 the biosphere sequestered 3 1 0 6 pgc yr 1 which is 0 5 pgc yr 1 higher than the amount of co2 removed from the atmosphere during 2000 2009 friedlingstein et al 2022 the co2 fluxes from the terrestrial biosphere exhibit considerable spatial and temporal variability compared to other carbon cycle components the inter annual variability of terrestrial biospheric absorption is about 1 pgc yr 1 friedlingstein et al 2022 however the current estimates lack the proper understanding of terrestrial carbon fluxes with their large uncertainty in large part this uncertainty stems from the tropical estimates of net land atmospheric co2 fluxes wherein the south asian estimates play a central role patra et al 2013 cervarich et al 2016 thompson et al 2016 varieties of climate zones characterise the indian landmass and hence a large diversity in the ecosystems exists over this region among the various vegetation types over the indian landmass cropland contributes 55 of the total geographical area while forests

established by the ministry of earth sciences moes the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm installed flux towers at three distinct ecosystems in india chakraborty et al 2020 these include observations from a deciduous forest kaziranga national park in assam 26 58 n 93 1 e an evergreen coniferous forest darjeeling in west bengal 27 04 n 88 08 e and a mangrove pichavaram in tamil nadu 11

exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere however these observations are sparse and severely insufficient for quantifying and analysing the contribution of net biospheric co2 fluxes from a tropical landmass such as india featuring diverse ecosystems largely driven by the asian monsoon system valsala et al 2013 apart from in situ observations many attempts have been made to assess the spatiotemporal variability and to quantify the biospheric co2 fluxes over india using modelling nayak et al 2009 banger et al 2015 rao et al 2019 nayak et al 2009 used the terrestrial biosphere model carnegie ames stanford approach casa to quantify the net primary production npp from the indian region they reported the total annual npp during 2003 from the indian region as 1 57 pgc with a rate of 544 gc m 2 in which 56 of the total npp is from croplands valsala et al 2013 studied the intraseasonal variability of nee from the indian region during the summer monsoon season of 2000 2009 at 30 60

as 0 83 pgc yr 1 for the period 1982 2006 based on the top down method patra et al 2013 estimated the net biospheric co2 flux over the south asia as 0 191 0 193 pgc yr 1 from 2000 to 2009 in that study they also showed that npp estimated from ten ecosystem models for the decades 1980s 1990s and 2000s were 2 1 0 37 2 1 0 37 and 2 2 0 36 pgc yr 1 respectively using dynamic land ecosystem model dlem banger et al 2015 assessed the inter annual variability of npp over the indian region during 1901 2010 in the range of 1 2 pgc yr 1 to 1 7 pgc yr 1 rao et al 2019 conducted a multi model assessment to analyse the trend and variability of npp and nee over india during 1901 2010 by utilising data from nine models they reported that the mean npp has a positive trend of 2 03 per decade global atmospheric co2 background measured based on tower based data suggests that the indian subcontinent nee is 0 20 0 39 pgc yr 1 halder et al 2021 most modelling studies concerning the indian terrestrial biospheric carbon uptake mainly focused on the npp or gpp while a few studies reported on the nee the quantification of nee over a region determines whether the regional terrestrial ecosystem is a net sink or source of co2 hence it is imperative to adequately quantify the nee and understand its spatial and temporal variabilities in an ecologically diverse country like india the biospheric co2 flux over the indian region from different sources shows large differences in magnitude and spatial distribution also most of them are in coarse resolution and thus lack many important spatial features of biospheric co2 fluxes nayak et al 2009 banger et al 2015 rao et al 2019 though a few high resolution data on biospheric flux are available jung et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 that are not covering the recent periods reliable biospheric co2 flux having proper spatiotemporal variability is an essential parameter while optimising the co2 fluxes from a region using inverse modelling top down method in this study the vegetation photosynthesis and respiration model vprm mahadevan et al 2008 is adapted to compute the biospheric co2 fluxes over india the vprm model has been used to estimate biospheric fluxes over different geographic regions of the world dayalu et al 2018 chen et al 2020 hu et al 2020 gourdji et al 2022 the advantage of the vprm is that it can produce reliable co2 flux with fine resolution using a minimum number of parameters this study developed a vprm model code to incorporate the high resolution land use land cover lulc data meteorological parameters and satellite derived surface reflectance over the indian region 2 data and methodology 2 1 vprm model 2 1 1 model framework the vprm model is an extended version of the vegetation photosynthesis model proposed by xiao et al 2004 in this study we used the model framework of mahadevan et al 2008 to estimate the nee at 9 km 9 km spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution over the indian domain the nee is calculated from the amount of co2 fixed through photosynthesis gee gross ecosystem exchange and co2 lost by plant and soil respiration collectively known as ecosystem respiration r 1 n e e g e e r here we followed the meteorological sign convention of surface flux flux to the atmosphere is considered positive and flux from the atmosphere is negative since co2 is removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis gee is defined as a negative quantity during ecosystem respiration co2 is released into the atmosphere hence r is positive the light dependent component gee is

rayment 2000 hence r is modelled as a linear function of near surface air temperature t 3 r α t β par0 in eq 2 represents the half saturation value of photosynthetically active radiation the parameters λ α β and par 0 depend on the vegetation type these parameters are usually estimated by calibrating the modelled nee with the observed nee for each vegetation class the present study uses values of λ α β and par 0 for different vegetation types from mahadevan et al 2008 and dayalu et al 2018 details about the values of those parameters for each vegetation class are provided in table 1 the vegetation index evi represents the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar absorbed by the photosynthetically active part of the vegetation the amount of liquid water in the canopy and its soil background is accounted for by calculating land surface water index lswi the evi and lswi are calculated using surface reflectance data from the moderate resolution imaging

where g 2 5 c 1 6 c 2 7 5 and l 1 the surface reflectance for red near infrared nir blue and shortwave infrared swir are represented as ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ b l u e and ρ s w i r respectively the evi

the effect of water stress on photosynthesis w s c a l e can be derived from lswi and lswi m a x here lswi m a x represents the maximum value of lswi in each grid cell during the plant growing season

used to calculate the evi and lswi the data product for this study is the 8 day composite data of modis level 3 product mod09a1 available at 500 m spatial resolution from 2011 2020 the mod09a1 data are provided with flags for cloud screening and data quality based on the flags the highest quality reflectance data under clear sky conditions only are selected to derive the evi and lswi data gaps in the evi and lswi due to the quality filtering are filled by taking the corresponding monthly mean value 2 1 3 vegetation classes the vegetation type is an important factor influencing the biosphere atmosphere co2 exchange in any region improper vegetation classification may lead to severe errors while modelling the biospheric flux the 25 category lulc data from us geological survey usgs is widely used data for numerical atmospheric modelling it was reported that the usgs lulc data contain miss classification of land categories over the indian region particularly forest regions water bodies and urban areas gharai et al 2018 using indian remote sensing satellite resourcesat 1 advanced wide field sensor irs p6 awifs data the national remote sensing centre nrsc india generated high resolution lulc data over the indian subcontinent to enhance the accuracy of vegetation classification and to track the land use changes over the years gharai et al 2018 in the present study the nrsc lulc data available at 5 min 9 km from 2012 to 2019 were used for the vegetation classification over india the dominant vegetation classifications over the indian region are evergreen forest includes broadleaf and needle leaf deciduous broadleaf forest mixed forest shrubland wooded wetland cropland includes dryland crop pasture and irrigation crop pasture vegetation mosaic and barren or sparsely vegetated area even though inter annual variability exists in the area covered by the different vegetation classes particularly the cropland the mean features are almost similar in all years fig 1 shows the vegetation classes in india during 2018 2019 cropland dominates other vegetation types comprising about 50 of total grids over india while forest regions occupy 24 of grids among the cropland area almost 31 is covered by irrigation cropland whereas the rest 19 is occupied by dryland cropland 2 1 4 near surface temperature and incoming shortwave radiation the 2 metre air temperature and mean surface downward shortwave radiation flux swr are taken from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era5 data hersbach et al 2020 shortwave radiation includes direct as well as diffuse radiation the hourly data at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution are re gridded to the resolution of lulc data since par shows a close correlation with downward shortwave radiation the relationship between par and swr is defined as swr 0 505 par here swr is in w m 2 and par is in μ mol m 2 s 1 mahadevan et al 2008 2 2 observations and estimates of the nee 2 2 1 in situ nee observations the nee measurements from three stations namely kaziranga national park knp haldwani hfs and kosi katarmal kkm are used to compare the nee from vprm the station knp is remotely located over a semi evergreen moist deciduous forest in northeast india the forest cover over knp is almost uniform and the canopy is characterised by an average height of 20 m deb burman et al 2021 the nee measurements at knp were carried out using an eddy covariance ec system including a 3d sonic anemometer thermometer windmaster pro gill instruments uk and an enclosed path co2 h2o infrared gas analyser li 7200 li cor inc usa with 10 hz measurement frequency installed at 37 m height on a micro meteorological tower the eddypro software v6 2 0 by li cor was used to process measurements the station hfs is located at 280 m above mean sea level in a plantation area classified as a man made mixed forest the plantation was started in 2004 and the average tree height is 10 m watham et al 2014 the ec system installed at hfs is 19 m from the surface around 9 m above the tree cover the measurement system includes an open path infrared gas analyser li 7500 for measuring the co2 h2o mixing ratio and windmaster 3d sonic anemometer gill instruments ltd england for wind speed and direction the co2 fluxes data were measured at an interval of 30 min the high altitude station kkm 29 38 n 79 37 e is located 1217 m above the mean sea level in a forest area the regions near the tower locations at kkm is mostly surrounded by mixed forest 75 and natural pine forest 25 the vegetation has an average height of 12 m the co2 flux measurements were taken from an ec system comprises of a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa and an infrared co2 h2o gas analyser ec150 campbell scientific inc usa installed at the height of 30 m mukherjee et al 2018 2020 2021 lohani and mukherjee 2021 2 2 2 carbon tracker carbon tracker ct is a state of the art data assimilation system that was developed by the earth system research laboratory esrl at national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa peters et al 2007 the present study uses optimised monthly mean biospheric co2 flux ct2019b version during 2011 2018 with a spatial resolution of 1 1 in ct the biogeochemical model casa potter et al 1993 calculates the prior global carbon fluxes the casa model calculates global carbon fluxes using input data from weather models to drive biophysical processes and the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi is derived from satellite observations to track plant phenology the casa model estimates monthly mean npp and heterotrophic respiration r h for each grid cell the difference between co2 uptake represented by npp and co2 release represented by r h provides nee from the terrestrial biosphere which is optimised in the ct by inverting observed mole fractions of atmospheric co2 2 2 3 fluxcom with machine learning techniques the fluxcom data aims to provide gridded estimates of co2 flux exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere on a global scale jung et al 2020 the methodology relies on upscaling the co2 flux measured by the ec systems which are distributed globally under the fluxnet upscaling ec flux observations requires certain predictor variables particularly meteorological parameters and satellite remote sensing data here modis satellite data the fluxcom generates a large ensemble of global flux data under two categories remote sensing rs and remote sensing plus meteorological climate forcing rs meteo in the rs meteo method three machine learning methods along with five different climate forcing datasets are used to generate monthly mean nee at 0 5 0 5 grid resolution among these five forcing datasets only era5 has broad temporal coverage up to 2018 hence we used co2 fluxes generated through rs meteo setup with era5 as the forcing data 2 2 4 smap l4 nee data the soil moisture active passive smap mission of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa is an orbiting observatory that measures soil moisture on earth the level 4 l4 carbon product spl4cmdl provides global gridded daily estimates of nee derived using a satellite data based terrestrial carbon flux model the parameters used by the model are smap l band microwave observations land cover and vegetation inputs from the modis and the goddard earth observing system model version 5 geos 5 land model assimilation system the data is in global cylindrical 9 km equal area scalable earth grid version 2 0 ease grid 2 0 projection details of the data are described in kimball et al 2022 3 results and discussions the vprm simulations were conducted over ten years from 2011 to 2020 at an hourly temporal resolution since the modis mod09a1 reflectance data are available at an interval of 8 days simulations were carried out only on those days the spatial resolution of the model is the same as that of lulc data 9 km 9 km daily seasonal and annual means of the nee are computed from hourly data 3 1 the vprm model vs observations it is worthwhile to compare the nee simulated by vprm with direct observations fig 2 depicts the eight day mean nee observations from three locations over the country and the corresponding nee from the vprm during 2016 over kkm the nee from observation and vprm show an almost similar pattern until october fig 2a after october the vprm exhibits higher biospheric uptake of co2 compared to the observation the mismatch between the observed and vprm simulated nee may be related to ecosystem respiration according to mukherjee et al 2018 ecosystem respiration over kkm increases during november december compared to the previous months whereas the vprm exhibits a gradual reduction in respiration during this period supplementary fig 1 in addition to that the gee from the model supplementary fig 1 and observation mukherjee et al 2018 show a reduction in co2 absorption after november hence the deviation in the nee is mainly attributed to the difference in the pattern of ecosystem respiration the nee from vprm over hfs could replicate the ec measured nee from mid june to december but exhibits a contradicting pattern from january to mid june fig 2b according to observations the biospheric uptake of atmospheric co2 is lesser during the winter than in the dry pre monsoon season on the other hand vprm shows minimum co2 uptake during the pre monsoon rather than the winter season watham et al 2014 mentioned that the plantation at hfs is leafless during the winter season and leaf growth starts in april thus april to september is the growing period for the vegetation over hfs hence hfs acts as a source of co2 during the winter season and as a sink from april september the evi derived from modis is almost constant during january february starts decreasing from march onwards and reaches a minimum during the end of march april supplementary fig 2 from may onwards the evi starts increasing and the maximum evi is obtained in september hence the mismatch between the observed and vprm derived nee during the period january may can be attributed to the difference in the representation of vegetation greenness the surface reflectance from modis over hfs during this part of the year may be led to the misrepresentation of evi which in turn caused a mismatch between the vprm derived nee and observation the vprm simulated nee is well matched with that observed over knp till april fig 2c from may till the end of the year the observed nee is close to zero or slightly positive whereas the modelled nee is less than zero in contrast to the typical characteristics of the biospheric co2 flux knp observation shows positive flux during the monsoon and post monsoon seasons generally the rainy season begins in the indian region during the monsoon season and the vegetation grows after that however the northeast part of india receives a good amount of rainfall during the pre monsoon season and vegetation greenness subsequently enhances the modelled evi could capture the early vegetation growth during march supplementary fig 2c from june to mid july the modelled nee decreased because of the reduced availability of shortwave radiation due to the cloud cover deb burman et al 2020 have shown that the nee from knp is positive in the winter due to the cold and dry conditions resulting from the lesser incoming solar radiation and leaf area index during the pre monsoon season precipitation air temperature and photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd increase and lead to a conducive condition for photosynthesis that shifts nee towards negative values during monsoon season the nee observation shifts from negative to positive in june and july knp gets high rainfall however the ppfd and temperature were reduced due to cloud cover which reduced the magnitude of nee compared to the pre monsoon season during august september the occurrence of cloud cover reduces which enhances ppfd and hence photosynthesis but the emission of co2 from the forest floor increases and leads to positive nee the positive nee during the post monsoon season is attributed to the decrease in air temperature ppfd and precipitation which reduce co2 uptake and respiration these local features need to be better incorporated into the model hence the simulated nee is closer to standard features of a vegetated forest area 3 2 comparison of the nee from the vprm fluxcom ct and smap 3 2 1 spatial variability of the mean nee fig 3 shows the mean spatial distribution of nee over the indian region from the vprm fluxcom ct and smap the mean nee is computed for 2016 to 2018 according to the common period data availability of fluxcom ct and smap a negative nee value represents co2 sink region while a positive value represents co2 source region considerable differences in the nee exist among the four data regarding the magnitude and spatial distribution over the indian region the nee from vprm and fluxcom show northwest and south central india as a source of biospheric co2 flux positive nee values whereas regions over the southwest coast of peninsular india northern and northeast india are seen as biospheric co2 sinks fig 3 a b the ct shows most of the indian region as a sink of biospheric co2 flux and positive values of the nee are confined to limited areas fig 3c the spatial heterogeneity of nee from the ct is lesser than the other data the smap data exhibits most of the indian region as a source of biospheric flux except southern peninsular india and eastern coastal region the highly vegetated areas such as forest regions over the western ghats close to the southwest coast of peninsular india and northeast india are expected to be a sink of biospheric co2 flux for most of the year the nee from fluxcom and vprm exhibit larger negative values over those regions as expected whereas in the ct the contrast between highly vegetated areas and other areas is not well reflected in the mean nee the magnitude of nee obtained from the vprm is higher than the fluxcom ct and smap even though the magnitude of nee differs among the fluxcom and vprm the spatial distribution of the nee is almost similar the nee from ct and smap differ from that of the vprm in magnitude and spatial variability one reason for the mismatch in magnitude and spatial pattern of the nee between the vprm and the other data sets is the difference in the representation of the indian lulc data biospheric flux in the ct is estimated from the casa model which uses a digitally classified land cover map prepared from the spot vegetation data set of the global land cover mapping project in addition the nee taken from the ct is an optimised product and it is to be noted that no observation of the atmospheric co2 mixing ratio from the indian region has been utilised in the optimisation process of prior co2 flux also the ct depends on ndvi data for tracking the phenology and vegetation greenness whereas the vprm uses evi instead of ndvi previous studies showed that the evi derived from modis closely correlated with photosynthesis and could track plant phenology xiao et al 2004 in a study to compare biospheric flux from the fluxcom with other dynamic global vegetation models dgvms jung et al 2020 reported that even though the nee from fluxcom matches in terms of the spatial pattern with other dgvms almost 70 of the terrestrial biosphere showed values outside the range of fluxcom even though the spatial resolution of smap data is comparable with that of vprm the regional features are distinct in both data 3 2 2 spatial variability at the seasonal scale biospheric co2 flux over the indian region undergoes a strong seasonal cycle owing to the availability of rainfall surface solar radiation near surface temperature and soil moisture nalini et al 2019 it is worthwhile to see the seasonal characteristics of nee over the indian region the present study follows the seasonal classifications from india meteorological department imd which defines january february as the winter season jf march may as the pre monsoon season mam june september as the monsoon season jjas and october december as the post monsoon season ond fig 4 depicts the seasonal pattern of nee over the indian region from the vprm fluxcom ct and smap during the winter the southern peninsular and northern india act as a net biospheric sink in all data fig 4a e i m the vprm exhibits a higher magnitude of negative nee over northern india than other data the enhanced negative values of the nee over northern india may be due to the increased rate of photosynthesis from the winter crops the sowing of winter crops usually happens during october november and harvesting during march or april the peak growing stage of the winter crops is in january and february since this winter cultivation is carried out after the summer monsoon rainy season the cultivation mainly depends on irrigation rao et al 2019 also reported that the biosphere uptake during the winter season negatively correlates precipitation and evinces that precipitation is not the major driving force of biospheric uptake in winter the ct represents most of the indian region as a biospheric sink during winter with lesser magnitude and spatial heterogeneity whereas the smap data show most of the indian region as biospheric source with magnitude more than that of fluxcom data the regions that act as a biospheric sink in smap data include southern peninsular india areas over the east coast and sparsely vegetated regions over northwest india the pre monsoon season is drier with higher atmospheric temperature lesser rainfall and reduced soil moisture these meteorological factors limit biospheric productivity during the season and considerably affecting the plant s ability to remove co2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis the spatial distribution of nee during the pre monsoon season over india is shown in fig 4b f j n the nee from vprm and fluxcom show more or less similar spatial patterns over the country with positive nee over central and peninsular india and negative nee over the western ghats and northeast india after the winter season the biospheric uptake from crops starts declining since it reaches senescence as a result ecosystem respiration dominates the nee and more positive nee is observed over the croplands the higher atmospheric temperature prevailing during this season also enhances respiration which may have a prominent role in reducing the nee the nee from forests over the western ghats and northeast india can still be negative during the pre monsoon season however the ct exhibits a different nee pattern during pre monsoon especially over the vegetated region in northeast india where the ct shows a source region also the ct indicates regions over western central india as a sink during the pre monsoon season while the other three data show it as a source region the nee from smap data during the pre monsoon period shows most of the indian region as a biospheric source similar to ct the smap data also shows a highly vegetated northeastern region as a biospheric source during the pre monsoon period the summer monsoon season begins over southern peninsular india during the last week of may or the first week of june with a sudden gush of rainfall over the region the monsoon rainfall covers india by the middle of july and the seasonal rainfall lasts up to september the indian region gets almost 75 of its annual rainfall during the summer monsoon season agricultural activities and vegetation growth over the region which was suppressed during the pre monsoon season begin after the onset of the monsoon this increase in vegetation over the region enhances the rate of photosynthesis thus during the monsoon season the indian region can be a sink of biospheric co2 flux compared to the pre monsoon season which satellite evi also supports the seasonal mean nee during the monsoon season from the four data is shown in fig 4c g k o the vprm model captures most of the expected features of nee over the region during the monsoon season central india a source of biospheric flux during the pre monsoon season turns into near neutral or a sink during the monsoon season southeast peninsular india remains a source region because this region experiences lesser rainfall during the summer monsoon season compared to other parts of the country the regions over the western ghats and northeast india the prevailing biospheric co2 sink regions during the pre monsoon season enhance their uptake of co2 during the monsoon season the fluxcom data also could exhibit the transition of biospheric co2 source during pre monsoon to sink during monsoon season over most parts of india at the same time the ct data show almost all over the indian region as a source of biospheric co2 during monsoon season including forest areas over the western ghats and northeast india this feature contradicts the expected enhancement in vegetation and photosynthesis during the season valsala et al 2013 reported that the nee from ct is positive during june and july since respiration dominates the npp during the monsoon period and from august to september the nee over indian landmass shifts to negative values seasonal mean nee from smap during the monsoon season shows distinct characteristics from the other three data the smap data shows northern india as a biospheric sink and southern india as a source of biospheric flux the rainfall rich area over the western ghats is shown as a source region in smap data which contradicts the known feature the mean nee over the indian region during the post monsoon season is depicted in fig 4d h l p the vprm shows negative nee over most parts of the country except the northwestern desert region after the monsoon season plants continue to grow and the maximum vegetation greenness is observed during the post monsoon season hence the rate of photosynthesis increases and an enhancement in carbon absorption is expected over most parts of the country during the post monsoon season the vprm well captures this feature the simulations show that the biospheric co2 sink enhances during the post monsoon season over most parts of the indian region the biospheric flux from ct also exhibits most of the indian region as a co2 sink during the post monsoon season in contrast the nee from fluxcom shows a positive flux over north northwestern and central india the enhanced biospheric uptake over the southern and eastern parts of india during the post monsoon season is well discerned by the smap data however the stronger biospheric source over northern india in smap data contradicts the other three data all four data sets depict southern peninsular india as a sink of biospheric co2 flux during the post monsoon season over southern peninsular india the post monsoon season is characterised by seasonal rainfall the eastern part of south peninsular india a rain shadow region during the summer monsoon season receives half of its annual rainfall during the post monsoon season the effect of this enhanced rainfall is visible with enhanced negative nee over the region during the post monsoon season compared to the summer monsoon season 3 3 spatially integrated biospheric nee over india since the vprm simulations show better and more realistic values of biospheric co2 flux over the indian region the area integrated fluxes are computed the mean area integrated nee over the indian region from vprm during 2011 2020 is 0 16 0 02 pgc yr 1 the gee contributes about 0 47 0 02 pgc yr 1 and respiration contributes about 0 31 0 01 pgc yr 1 the co2 flux from the biosphere is driven by several meteorological parameters including precipitation atmospheric temperature and incoming solar radiation since these parameters exhibit strong inter annual variability the biospheric flux is also expected to undergo inter annual variability the time series of area integrated annual mean modelled gee r and nee over the indian region from 2011 to 2020 are shown in fig 5 during this period the gee varies from 0 43 to 0 53 pgc yr 1 nee varies from 0 12 to 0 22 pgc yr 1 and r varies from 0 29 to 0 32 pgc yr 1 regarding the absolute magnitude of nee higher values were observed in 2020 while lower values were observed in 2012 and 2016 maximum gee 0 53 pgc yr 1 was observed in 2020 while the minimum gee 0 43 pgc yr 1 was obtained in 2012 the ecosystem respiration was maximum 0 32 pgc yr 1 in 2017 and the minimum 0 29 pgc yr 1 in 2013 the maximum nee 0 22 pgc yr 1 is obtained in 2020 and minimum nee 0 12 pgc yr 1 in 2016 from 2012 to 2018 all the years except 2013 show below average rainfall across the country it significantly limits vegetation growth reducing the photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric co2 by the biosphere and leads to reduction in the nee there has been an enhancement in ecosystem respiration from 2014 onwards since respiration is modelled as a function of near surface atmospheric temperature this increase could be attributed to an enhancement in atmospheric temperature the gee and nee were higher in 2020 owing to the above average rainfall obtained during 2019 and 2020 however the absolute gee obtained from the vprm is lower than the npp gee minus autotrophic respiration reported over the indian region by earlier studies for example nayak et al 2009 bala et al 2013 patra et al 2013 even with the low values of gee compared to previous studies the nee obtained from the vprm is higher in magnitude than that of fluxcom ct and smap 3 4 the nee from different vegetation types monthly mean nee from different vegetation categories over india during 2011 2020 are depicted in fig 6 since each vegetation type is spread over multiple regions of india area averaged nee is calculated over an area encompasses 3 3 grid 729 km 2 over a region where particular vegetation dominates to represent nee from that vegetation type the nee from evergreen forest represents an area centred at 28 n 94 e deciduous forest centred at 19 5 n 80 4 e an area centred at 18 8 n 77 e represents crops over southern india an area centred at 30 n 75 5 e represents crops over northern india vegetation mosaic represents an area centred at 14 3 n 76 9 e and an area centred at 27 n 70 4 e represents the barren region the evergreen forest is a net sink of biospheric co2 all the months while the deciduous forest acts as a net source during the summer months march to june the croplands over northern india shows biospheric co2 uptake during the winter period the maximum uptake occurs during february and march while the region acts as a source from april to july the southern croplands become a sink of co2 after july till the end of the year the regions represented by vegetation mosaic and barren areas act as a net source of biospheric co2 all over the year 3 5 diurnal variation of biosphere flux over distinct vegetation types the biospheric co2 flux is subjected to strong diurnal variation since the intensity of solar radiation drives photosynthesis in the vprm hourly variations of nee are tracked with hourly varying par and near surface air temperature here we attempted to see the nee s diurnal variations for different vegetation types over india as described in section 3 4 on a seasonal scale the seasonal mean diurnal cycles of nee from different vegetation types are shown in fig 7a f a positive value of nee indicates that respiration dominates the photosynthetic uptake of co2 and a negative nee indicates that the co2 uptake dominates respiration it is observed that during nighttime the nee is positive for all vegetation types the nee is equal to ecosystem respiration without solar radiation at night for all vegetation types the magnitude of nee during nighttime for each season follows the temperature during the season the nighttime nee during winter and post monsoon seasons show lesser values due to the lower atmospheric temperature prevailing evergreen forest shows the peak nee around 11 30 ist during all seasons the most plausible reason for this could be associated with the maximum par obtained at this time hence forests get enough sunlight for photosynthesis the nee during nighttime is almost constant for the evergreen forest for a particular season the amplitude of the diurnal variation of nee is maximum during post monsoon and minimum during the pre monsoon season which could be due to the evi variations fig 7a over the deciduous forests the nee during the pre monsoon season is almost positive except during a few hours in the morning fig 7b even though the incoming solar radiation is maximum in pre monsoon the nee values are close to positive due to the low vegetation greenness and higher temperature during the monsoon season the incoming solar radiation is reduced due to the large cloud cover prevailing in the season despite this the nee shows enhanced negative values compared to pre monsoon since the vegetation greenness is increased due to the monsoon rainfall the increased vegetation greenness during the post monsoon season results in enhanced nee fig 7b in the case of crops over the southern part of india seasonal variation of nee follows the variation in evi with maximum amplitude during post monsoon and minimum during pre monsoon fig 7c for crops over northern india substantial enhancement in the magnitude of nee is observed during the winter season and lesser during other seasons fig 7d moreover during the winter season the maximum absorption is just after the noon time while other seasons absorption peaks before noon the delayed sunrise over the northern region during the winter season could be the reason for the noon time peak the magnitude of nee from vegetation mosaic and the barren area is much lesser than other vegetation types fig 7e f the nee of the vegetation mosaic depicts seasonal variation even though the amplitude is lesser compared to the other vegetation classes the nee from the barren area is a source of biospheric flux during all seasons the magnitude of biospheric emission is higher during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons than during the other two seasons fig 7f the nighttime respiration is higher during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons for all vegetation classes due to the higher near surface air temperature 4 summary and conclusions the terrestrial biospheric co2 flux is an inevitable component in the optimisation process of co2 flux using inverse modelling the existing biospheric co2 flux data are coarse in resolution and also the availability of updated data is limited in this scenario the present work aimed to develop a biosphere model for the indian region by adopting the methodology from mahadevan et al 2008 the vprm for the indian region was configured by using high resolution satellite derived lulc irs p6 awifs and surface reflectance modis data along with meteorological parameters from the era5 the model has been simulated for a decade 2011 2020 to obtain ecosystem photosynthesis respiration and net co2 exchange the nee observations from three stations kaziranga national park knp haldwani hfs and kosi katarmal kkm are used to compare the nee from the model among these stations the nee from kkm shows very good agreement with model simulated nee during most of the year whereas other stations show a partial match over kkm the nee from observation and model show similar patterns until october while during november december the model indicated higher biospheric uptake of co2 compared to the observation the vprm could simulate well matched nee over hfs from mid june to december but the nee pattern from january to mid june needs to be better matched with observations that can be attributed to the difference in the representation of vegetation greenness the vprm model captures the nee over knp fairly well from january to april after that the observed nee is positive till the end of the year while the model simulated nee are negative values compared with other available gridded nee from fluxcom ct and smap data the vprm model performs reasonably well over the indian region the vprm captures the spatial pattern and the seasonal features of nee over the country better than the other three data the magnitude of nee from the vprm model is relatively high compared to the biospheric co2 flux from the ct fluxcom and smap however the magnitudes of the vprm simulated nee align with the observations over different vegetated regions in india using the ec systems which are accepted as the ground truth the biospheric flux shows inter annual variability in response to the variabilities of the different meteorological parameters the average nee integrated over the indian region from the vprm during 2011 2020 is 0 16 0 02 pgc yr 1 in this contribution from the gee is about 0 47 0 02 pgc yr 1 and respiration is 0 31 0 01 pgc yr 1 the values of gee during the period range between 0 43 to 0 53 pgc yr 1 nee varies from 0 12 to 0 22 pgc yr 1 and respiration from 0 29 to 0 32 pgc yr 1 the maximum gee 0 53 pgc yr 1 was observed in 2020 while the minimum gee 0 43 pgc yr 1 was obtained in 2012 the ecosystem respiration shows a maximum 0 32 pgc yr 1 in 2017 and a minimum 0 29 pgc yr 1 in 2013 the maximum nee 0 22 pgc yr 1 was obtained in 2020 and the minimum nee 0 12 pgc yr 1 in 2016 decadal mean monthly variations of the nee from different vegetation types show that the evergreen forest is a net sink of biospheric co2 throughout the year the deciduous forest also acts as a net sink of biospheric co2 except during the pre monsoon period the area covered by crops over north india acts as a strong sink of biospheric co2 during winter the crop area over the southern region acts as a source during the pre monsoon season and as a sink during the post monsoon season the biospheric co2 flux is subjected to strong diurnal variations since the intensity of solar radiation drives photosynthesis in the vprm hourly variations in the nee are driven by the hourly varying par and near surface temperature the diurnal cycle of nee from different vegetation types exhibits different patterns and undergoes seasonal changes most vegetation types show that the maximum co2 uptake occurs during the post monsoon season except for crops over northern india and barren areas the nee from all vegetation types except crops over northern india peaks before noon whereas the peak nee of these crops is observed at noon the nee over the barren area is much lesser than other land types and acts as a source during all seasons during the nighttime the nee is equal to ecosystem respiration which depends on the nighttime temperature for respective vegetation types accurate estimates of the high resolution spatiotemporal distribution of biospheric co2 flux are critical for minimising the uncertainty of co2 flux especially in the peak growing season in this regard the high resolution vprm generated biospheric co2 flux performs reasonably well over the indian region compared to the existing data a lacuna in the present study is that the vegetation depended model scaling parameters used are obtained from the literature the values of scaling parameters α and β taken from mahadevan et al 2008 are tuned for the climate of the usa and dayalu et al 2018 are tuned for china future studies can further improve the model performance by calibrating the model scaling parameters using the ec system based observations over different vegetation types in india also the model is validated with observations mainly over the highly vegetated forest regions however the high resolution biospheric co2 fluxes obtained from the vprm could well depict all seasonal and interannual features of net ecosystem exchange over india and can be used for a better estimation of the country s co2 flux credit authorship contribution statement

24186,the terrestrial biosphere has a crucial role in controlling the rate of co2 accumulation in the atmosphere the quantification of net ecosystem exchange nee is critical to determine whether the regional terrestrial ecosystem is a net sink or source of co2 this study uses a satellite data derived light use efficiency model the vegetation photosynthesis and respiration model vprm to compute the biospheric co2 fluxes over india from 2011 2020 a very high resolution land use land cover lulc data from the irs p6 satellite and modis derived surface reflectance are utilised to compute the nee over distinct vegetation types at 9 km 9 km the vprm model for the indian region captures the spatial pattern and seasonal features of nee over the country the magnitude of annual mean nee over india from the vprm model is relatively high compared to that from carbon tracker fluxcom and soil moisture active passive level 4 carbon data products however the vprm model simulated nee agrees with the nee observations from the eddy covariance estimates which are accepted as the ground truth the fusion of high resolution lulc and surface reflectance data in vprm suggests that the average nee over the indian region during 2011 2020 is 0 16 0 02 pgc yr 1 among this the contribution from gross ecosystem exchange is about 0 47 0 02 pgc yr 1 and respiration is 0 31 0 01 pgc yr 1 the maximum biospheric co2 absorption is during the post monsoon season and the minimum is during the pre monsoon season the very high spatial resolution and heterogeneity resolved in the nee data derived in this

model data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the increasing atmospheric concentration of co2 is a major cause of global warming and climate change forster et al 2021 anthropogenic activities such as fossil fuel emission and cement production have substantially altered the carbon cycle since the dawn of the industrial era it has a lead buildup of co2 in the atmosphere perturbs the earth system s net radiative balance an additional radiative forcing of 2 16 0 26 w m 2 and triggers climate change forster et al 2021 the atmospheric co2 concentration reached 414 7 ppm in 2021 compared to 277 ppm at the beginning of the industrial era in 1750 dlugokencky and tans 2022 however compared to the increase in co2 emission the atmospheric growth rate of co2 is lesser it is due to the removal of co2 through natural processes operating in the land biosphere and ocean gurney et al 2004 valsala and maksyutov 2010 these natural sinks have roughly halved the atmospheric growth rate of co2 crisp et al 2022 terrestrial biosphere sequesters around 3 4 0 9 pgc yr 1 from the atmosphere almost 30 of the total annual anthropogenic co2 emission friedlingstein et al 2022 however this estimate s substantial uncertainty 25 calls for the need to improve our understanding of the terrestrial biospheric fluxes the terrestrial biosphere and soil are important storehouses of atmospheric carbon and hence have a crucial role in controlling the rate of co2 accumulation in the atmosphere the amount of carbon stored in the biosphere mainly depends on the equilibrium between co2 fixed through photosynthesis and removed through respiration and decomposition the exchange of co2 between the biosphere and atmosphere is based on complex biogeochemical processes which depend on several factors such as plant functional type plant phenology water availability air temperature and incoming shortwave radiation during 2011 2020 the biosphere sequestered 3 1 0 6 pgc yr 1 which is 0 5 pgc yr 1 higher than the amount of co2 removed from the atmosphere during 2000 2009 friedlingstein et al 2022 the co2 fluxes from the terrestrial biosphere exhibit considerable spatial and temporal variability compared to other carbon cycle components the inter annual variability of terrestrial biospheric absorption is about 1 pgc yr 1 friedlingstein et al 2022 however the current estimates lack the proper understanding of terrestrial carbon fluxes with their large uncertainty in large part this uncertainty stems from the tropical estimates of net land atmospheric co2 fluxes wherein the south asian estimates play a central role patra et al 2013 cervarich et al 2016 thompson et al 2016 varieties of climate zones characterise the indian landmass and hence a large diversity in the ecosystems exists over this region among the various vegetation types over the indian landmass cropland contributes 55 of the total geographical area while forests represent 21 forest survey of india 2021 the co2 fluxes are measured from india as part of different projects to monitor the greenhouse gas fluxes mainly the eddy covariance ec method is used for flux observations these fluxes are then partitioned into gross primary production gpp ecosystem respiration r and net ecosystem exchange nee using process based models as part of the metflux india project established by the ministry of earth sciences moes the indian institute of tropical meteorology iitm installed flux towers at three distinct ecosystems in india chakraborty et al 2020 these include observations from a deciduous forest kaziranga national park in assam 26 58 n 93 1 e an evergreen coniferous forest darjeeling in west bengal 27 04 n 88 08 e and a mangrove pichavaram in tamil nadu 11 2 n 79 47 e deb burman et al 2017 2020 chatterjee et al 2018 gnanamoorthy et al 2020 under the indian space research organisation isro geosphere biosphere program igbp micro meteorological flux towers were installed in different ecosystems such as mixed forests at haldwani 29 15 n 79 42 e watham et al 2014 and deciduous forests at barkot 30 11 n 78 21 e watham et al 2017 to monitor co2 flux exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere however these observations are sparse and severely insufficient for quantifying and analysing the contribution of net biospheric co2 fluxes from a tropical landmass such as india featuring diverse ecosystems largely driven by the asian monsoon system valsala et al 2013 apart from in situ observations many attempts have been made to assess the spatiotemporal variability and to quantify the biospheric co2 fluxes over india using modelling nayak et al 2009 banger et al 2015 rao et al 2019 nayak et al 2009 used the terrestrial biosphere model carnegie ames stanford approach casa to quantify the net primary production npp from the indian region they reported the total annual npp during 2003 from the indian region as 1 57 pgc with a rate of 544 gc m 2 in which 56 of the total npp is from croplands valsala et al 2013 studied the intraseasonal variability of nee from the indian region during the summer monsoon season of 2000 2009 at 30 60 days and 10 20 days timescales and found they range within 0 4 pgc yr 1 using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr derived terrestrial npp bala et al 2013 estimated the mean npp over india as 0 83 pgc yr 1 for the period 1982 2006 based on the top down method patra et al 2013 estimated the net biospheric co2 flux over the south asia as 0 191 0 193 pgc yr 1 from 2000 to 2009 in that study they also showed that npp estimated from ten ecosystem models for the decades 1980s 1990s and 2000s were 2 1 0 37 2 1 0 37 and 2 2 0 36 pgc yr 1 respectively using dynamic land ecosystem model dlem banger et al 2015 assessed the inter annual variability of npp over the indian region during 1901 2010 in the range of 1 2 pgc yr 1 to 1 7 pgc yr 1 rao et al 2019 conducted a multi model assessment to analyse the trend and variability of npp and nee over india during 1901 2010 by utilising data from nine models they reported that the mean npp has a positive trend of 2 03 per decade global atmospheric co2 background measured based on tower based data suggests that the indian subcontinent nee is 0 20 0 39 pgc yr 1 halder et al 2021 most modelling studies concerning the indian terrestrial biospheric carbon uptake mainly focused on the npp or gpp while a few studies reported on the nee the quantification of nee over a region determines whether the regional terrestrial ecosystem is a net sink or source of co2 hence it is imperative to adequately quantify the nee and understand its spatial and temporal variabilities in an ecologically diverse country like india the biospheric co2 flux over the indian region from different sources shows large differences in magnitude and spatial distribution also most of them are in coarse resolution and thus lack many important spatial features of biospheric co2 fluxes nayak et al 2009 banger et al 2015 rao et al 2019 though a few high resolution data on biospheric flux are available jung et al 2020 zeng et al 2020 that are not covering the recent periods reliable biospheric co2 flux having proper spatiotemporal variability is an essential parameter while optimising the co2 fluxes from a region using inverse modelling top down method in this study the vegetation photosynthesis and respiration model vprm mahadevan et al 2008 is adapted to compute the biospheric co2 fluxes over india the vprm model has been used to estimate biospheric fluxes over different geographic regions of the world dayalu et al 2018 chen et al 2020 hu et al 2020 gourdji et al 2022 the advantage of the vprm is that it can produce reliable co2 flux with fine resolution using a minimum number of parameters this study developed a vprm model code to incorporate the high resolution land use land cover lulc data meteorological parameters and satellite derived surface reflectance over the indian region 2 data and methodology 2 1 vprm model 2 1 1 model framework the vprm model is an extended version of the vegetation photosynthesis model proposed by xiao et al 2004 in this study we used the model framework of mahadevan et al 2008 to estimate the nee at 9 km 9 km spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution over the indian domain the nee is calculated from the amount of co2 fixed through photosynthesis gee gross ecosystem exchange and co2 lost by plant and soil respiration collectively known as ecosystem respiration r 1 n e e g e e r here we followed the meteorological sign convention of surface flux flux to the atmosphere is considered positive and flux from the atmosphere is negative since co2 is removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis gee is defined as a negative quantity during ecosystem respiration co2 is released into the atmosphere hence r is positive the light dependent component gee is defined as the function of photosynthetically active radiation par enhanced vegetation index evi and sensitivities to temperature t s c a l e leaf phenology p s c a l e and water stress w s c a l e 2 g e e λ t s c a l e p s c a l e w s c a l e e v i 1 1 p a r p a r 0 p a r the light independent part of nee is ecosystem respiration r which is proportional to near surface air temperature grace and rayment 2000 hence r is modelled as a linear function of near surface air temperature t 3 r α t β par0 in eq 2 represents the half saturation value of photosynthetically active radiation the parameters λ α β and par 0 depend on the vegetation type these parameters are usually estimated by calibrating the modelled nee with the observed nee for each vegetation class the present study uses values of λ α β and par 0 for different vegetation types from mahadevan et al 2008 and dayalu et al 2018 details about the values of those parameters for each vegetation class are provided in table 1 the vegetation index evi represents the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar absorbed by the photosynthetically active part of the vegetation the amount of liquid water in the canopy and its soil background is accounted for by calculating land surface water index lswi the evi and lswi are calculated using surface reflectance data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor onboard the terra satellite using the following equations 4 e v i g ρ n i r ρ r e d ρ n i r c 1 ρ r e d c 2 ρ b l u e l 5 l s w i ρ n i r ρ s w i r ρ n i r ρ s w i r where g 2 5 c 1 6 c 2 7 5 and l 1 the surface reflectance for red near infrared nir blue and shortwave infrared swir are represented as ρ r e d ρ n i r ρ b l u e and ρ s w i r respectively the evi ranges from 0 to 1 while lswi ranges from 1 to 1 the sensitivity of photosynthesis to the air temperature is accounted for by t s c a l e and is defined by 6 t s c a l e t t m i n t t m a x t t m i n t t m a x t t o p t 2 where t m i n t m a x and t o p t are the minimum maximum and optimum temperatures for photosynthesis these temperature values for each vegetation class are provided in table 1 the effect of water stress on photosynthesis w s c a l e can be derived from lswi and lswi m a x here lswi m a x represents the maximum value of lswi in each grid cell during the plant growing season if multiyear data are available lswi m a x should be determined as the maximum value after taking the multiyear mean of lswi at temporal resolution 7 w s c a l e 1 l s w i 1 l s w i m a x leaf age and phenology are the two crucial factors that control the co2 uptake of plants through photosynthesis on seasonal and annual timescales the parameter p s c a l e is defined to get the effect of plant phenology on photosynthesis it is set to 1 for the evergreen vegetation class throughout the year for other classifications such as shrubland cropland and wetlands p s c a l e is calculated as a function of lswi during the bud burst to full leaf expansion and senescence whereas p s c a l e is set to 1 when the greenness is maximum for vegetation mosaic p s c a l e is always calculated as a linear function of lswi 8 p s c a l e 1 l s w i 2 the timing of different phenology phases can be determined by comparing the evi with a threshold value derived as a function of maximum and minimum evi for each grid cell 2 1 2 modis surface reflectance the modis derived surface reflectance for red in 620 670 nm wavelength nir in 841 876 nm blue in 459 479 nm and swir in 1628 1652 nm bands were used to calculate the evi and lswi the data product for this study is the 8 day composite data of modis level 3 product mod09a1 available at 500 m spatial resolution from 2011 2020 the mod09a1 data are provided with flags for cloud screening and data quality based on the flags the highest quality reflectance data under clear sky conditions only are selected to derive the evi and lswi data gaps in the evi and lswi due to the quality filtering are filled by taking the corresponding monthly mean value 2 1 3 vegetation classes the vegetation type is an important factor influencing the biosphere atmosphere co2 exchange in any region improper vegetation classification may lead to severe errors while modelling the biospheric flux the 25 category lulc data from us geological survey usgs is widely used data for numerical atmospheric modelling it was reported that the usgs lulc data contain miss classification of land categories over the indian region particularly forest regions water bodies and urban areas gharai et al 2018 using indian remote sensing satellite resourcesat 1 advanced wide field sensor irs p6 awifs data the national remote sensing centre nrsc india generated high resolution lulc data over the indian subcontinent to enhance the accuracy of vegetation classification and to track the land use changes over the years gharai et al 2018 in the present study the nrsc lulc data available at 5 min 9 km from 2012 to 2019 were used for the vegetation classification over india the dominant vegetation classifications over the indian region are evergreen forest includes broadleaf and needle leaf deciduous broadleaf forest mixed forest shrubland wooded wetland cropland includes dryland crop pasture and irrigation crop pasture vegetation mosaic and barren or sparsely vegetated area even though inter annual variability exists in the area covered by the different vegetation classes particularly the cropland the mean features are almost similar in all years fig 1 shows the vegetation classes in india during 2018 2019 cropland dominates other vegetation types comprising about 50 of total grids over india while forest regions occupy 24 of grids among the cropland area almost 31 is covered by irrigation cropland whereas the rest 19 is occupied by dryland cropland 2 1 4 near surface temperature and incoming shortwave radiation the 2 metre air temperature and mean surface downward shortwave radiation flux swr are taken from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf reanalysis era5 data hersbach et al 2020 shortwave radiation includes direct as well as diffuse radiation the hourly data at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution are re gridded to the resolution of lulc data since par shows a close correlation with downward shortwave radiation the relationship between par and swr is defined as swr 0 505 par here swr is in w m 2 and par is in μ mol m 2 s 1 mahadevan et al 2008 2 2 observations and estimates of the nee 2 2 1 in situ nee observations the nee measurements from three stations namely kaziranga national park knp haldwani hfs and kosi katarmal kkm are used to compare the nee from vprm the station knp is remotely located over a semi evergreen moist deciduous forest in northeast india the forest cover over knp is almost uniform and the canopy is characterised by an average height of 20 m deb burman et al 2021 the nee measurements at knp were carried out using an eddy covariance ec system including a 3d sonic anemometer thermometer windmaster pro gill instruments uk and an enclosed path co2 h2o infrared gas analyser li 7200 li cor inc usa with 10 hz measurement frequency installed at 37 m height on a micro meteorological tower the eddypro software v6 2 0 by li cor was used to process measurements the station hfs is located at 280 m above mean sea level in a plantation area classified as a man made mixed forest the plantation was started in 2004 and the average tree height is 10 m watham et al 2014 the ec system installed at hfs is 19 m from the surface around 9 m above the tree cover the measurement system includes an open path infrared gas analyser li 7500 for measuring the co2 h2o mixing ratio and windmaster 3d sonic anemometer gill instruments ltd england for wind speed and direction the co2 fluxes data were measured at an interval of 30 min the high altitude station kkm 29 38 n 79 37 e is located 1217 m above the mean sea level in a forest area the regions near the tower locations at kkm is mostly surrounded by mixed forest 75 and natural pine forest 25 the vegetation has an average height of 12 m the co2 flux measurements were taken from an ec system comprises of a 3d sonic anemometer csat3 campbell scientific inc usa and an infrared co2 h2o gas analyser ec150 campbell scientific inc usa installed at the height of 30 m mukherjee et al 2018 2020 2021 lohani and mukherjee 2021 2 2 2 carbon tracker carbon tracker ct is a state of the art data assimilation system that was developed by the earth system research laboratory esrl at national oceanographic and atmospheric administration noaa peters et al 2007 the present study uses optimised monthly mean biospheric co2 flux ct2019b version during 2011 2018 with a spatial resolution of 1 1 in ct the biogeochemical model casa potter et al 1993 calculates the prior global carbon fluxes the casa model calculates global carbon fluxes using input data from weather models to drive biophysical processes and the normalised difference vegetation index ndvi is derived from satellite observations to track plant phenology the casa model estimates monthly mean npp and heterotrophic respiration r h for each grid cell the difference between co2 uptake represented by npp and co2 release represented by r h provides nee from the terrestrial biosphere which is optimised in the ct by inverting observed mole fractions of atmospheric co2 2 2 3 fluxcom with machine learning techniques the fluxcom data aims to provide gridded estimates of co2 flux exchange between the biosphere and atmosphere on a global scale jung et al 2020 the methodology relies on upscaling the co2 flux measured by the ec systems which are distributed globally under the fluxnet upscaling ec flux observations requires certain predictor variables particularly meteorological parameters and satellite remote sensing data here modis satellite data the fluxcom generates a large ensemble of global flux data under two categories remote sensing rs and remote sensing plus meteorological climate forcing rs meteo in the rs meteo method three machine learning methods along with five different climate forcing datasets are used to generate monthly mean nee at 0 5 0 5 grid resolution among these five forcing datasets only era5 has broad temporal coverage up to 2018 hence we used co2 fluxes generated through rs meteo setup with era5 as the forcing data 2 2 4 smap l4 nee data the soil moisture active passive smap mission of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa is an orbiting observatory that measures soil moisture on earth the level 4 l4 carbon product spl4cmdl provides global gridded daily estimates of nee derived using a satellite data based terrestrial carbon flux model the parameters used by the model are smap l band microwave observations land cover and vegetation inputs from the modis and the goddard earth observing system model version 5 geos 5 land model assimilation system the data is in global cylindrical 9 km equal area scalable earth grid version 2 0 ease grid 2 0 projection details of the data are described in kimball et al 2022 3 results and discussions the vprm simulations were conducted over ten years from 2011 to 2020 at an hourly temporal resolution since the modis mod09a1 reflectance data are available at an interval of 8 days simulations were carried out only on those days the spatial resolution of the model is the same as that of lulc data 9 km 9 km daily seasonal and annual means of the nee are computed from hourly data 3 1 the vprm model vs observations it is worthwhile to compare the nee simulated by vprm with direct observations fig 2 depicts the eight day mean nee observations from three locations over the country and the corresponding nee from the vprm during 2016 over kkm the nee from observation and vprm show an almost similar pattern until october fig 2a after october the vprm exhibits higher biospheric uptake of co2 compared to the observation the mismatch between the observed and vprm simulated nee may be related to ecosystem respiration according to mukherjee et al 2018 ecosystem respiration over kkm increases during november december compared to the previous months whereas the vprm exhibits a gradual reduction in respiration during this period supplementary fig 1 in addition to that the gee from the model supplementary fig 1 and observation mukherjee et al 2018 show a reduction in co2 absorption after november hence the deviation in the nee is mainly attributed to the difference in the pattern of ecosystem respiration the nee from vprm over hfs could replicate the ec measured nee from mid june to december but exhibits a contradicting pattern from january to mid june fig 2b according to observations the biospheric uptake of atmospheric co2 is lesser during the winter than in the dry pre monsoon season on the other hand vprm shows minimum co2 uptake during the pre monsoon rather than the winter season watham et al 2014 mentioned that the plantation at hfs is leafless during the winter season and leaf growth starts in april thus april to september is the growing period for the vegetation over hfs hence hfs acts as a source of co2 during the winter season and as a sink from april september the evi derived from modis is almost constant during january february starts decreasing from march onwards and reaches a minimum during the end of march april supplementary fig 2 from may onwards the evi starts increasing and the maximum evi is obtained in september hence the mismatch between the observed and vprm derived nee during the period january may can be attributed to the difference in the representation of vegetation greenness the surface reflectance from modis over hfs during this part of the year may be led to the misrepresentation of evi which in turn caused a mismatch between the vprm derived nee and observation the vprm simulated nee is well matched with that observed over knp till april fig 2c from may till the end of the year the observed nee is close to zero or slightly positive whereas the modelled nee is less than zero in contrast to the typical characteristics of the biospheric co2 flux knp observation shows positive flux during the monsoon and post monsoon seasons generally the rainy season begins in the indian region during the monsoon season and the vegetation grows after that however the northeast part of india receives a good amount of rainfall during the pre monsoon season and vegetation greenness subsequently enhances the modelled evi could capture the early vegetation growth during march supplementary fig 2c from june to mid july the modelled nee decreased because of the reduced availability of shortwave radiation due to the cloud cover deb burman et al 2020 have shown that the nee from knp is positive in the winter due to the cold and dry conditions resulting from the lesser incoming solar radiation and leaf area index during the pre monsoon season precipitation air temperature and photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd increase and lead to a conducive condition for photosynthesis that shifts nee towards negative values during monsoon season the nee observation shifts from negative to positive in june and july knp gets high rainfall however the ppfd and temperature were reduced due to cloud cover which reduced the magnitude of nee compared to the pre monsoon season during august september the occurrence of cloud cover reduces which enhances ppfd and hence photosynthesis but the emission of co2 from the forest floor increases and leads to positive nee the positive nee during the post monsoon season is attributed to the decrease in air temperature ppfd and precipitation which reduce co2 uptake and respiration these local features need to be better incorporated into the model hence the simulated nee is closer to standard features of a vegetated forest area 3 2 comparison of the nee from the vprm fluxcom ct and smap 3 2 1 spatial variability of the mean nee fig 3 shows the mean spatial distribution of nee over the indian region from the vprm fluxcom ct and smap the mean nee is computed for 2016 to 2018 according to the common period data availability of fluxcom ct and smap a negative nee value represents co2 sink region while a positive value represents co2 source region considerable differences in the nee exist among the four data regarding the magnitude and spatial distribution over the indian region the nee from vprm and fluxcom show northwest and south central india as a source of biospheric co2 flux positive nee values whereas regions over the southwest coast of peninsular india northern and northeast india are seen as biospheric co2 sinks fig 3 a b the ct shows most of the indian region as a sink of biospheric co2 flux and positive values of the nee are confined to limited areas fig 3c the spatial heterogeneity of nee from the ct is lesser than the other data the smap data exhibits most of the indian region as a source of biospheric flux except southern peninsular india and eastern coastal region the highly vegetated areas such as forest regions over the western ghats close to the southwest coast of peninsular india and northeast india are expected to be a sink of biospheric co2 flux for most of the year the nee from fluxcom and vprm exhibit larger negative values over those regions as expected whereas in the ct the contrast between highly vegetated areas and other areas is not well reflected in the mean nee the magnitude of nee obtained from the vprm is higher than the fluxcom ct and smap even though the magnitude of nee differs among the fluxcom and vprm the spatial distribution of the nee is almost similar the nee from ct and smap differ from that of the vprm in magnitude and spatial variability one reason for the mismatch in magnitude and spatial pattern of the nee between the vprm and the other data sets is the difference in the representation of the indian lulc data biospheric flux in the ct is estimated from the casa model which uses a digitally classified land cover map prepared from the spot vegetation data set of the global land cover mapping project in addition the nee taken from the ct is an optimised product and it is to be noted that no observation of the atmospheric co2 mixing ratio from the indian region has been utilised in the optimisation process of prior co2 flux also the ct depends on ndvi data for tracking the phenology and vegetation greenness whereas the vprm uses evi instead of ndvi previous studies showed that the evi derived from modis closely correlated with photosynthesis and could track plant phenology xiao et al 2004 in a study to compare biospheric flux from the fluxcom with other dynamic global vegetation models dgvms jung et al 2020 reported that even though the nee from fluxcom matches in terms of the spatial pattern with other dgvms almost 70 of the terrestrial biosphere showed values outside the range of fluxcom even though the spatial resolution of smap data is comparable with that of vprm the regional features are distinct in both data 3 2 2 spatial variability at the seasonal scale biospheric co2 flux over the indian region undergoes a strong seasonal cycle owing to the availability of rainfall surface solar radiation near surface temperature and soil moisture nalini et al 2019 it is worthwhile to see the seasonal characteristics of nee over the indian region the present study follows the seasonal classifications from india meteorological department imd which defines january february as the winter season jf march may as the pre monsoon season mam june september as the monsoon season jjas and october december as the post monsoon season ond fig 4 depicts the seasonal pattern of nee over the indian region from the vprm fluxcom ct and smap during the winter the southern peninsular and northern india act as a net biospheric sink in all data fig 4a e i m the vprm exhibits a higher magnitude of negative nee over northern india than other data the enhanced negative values of the nee over northern india may be due to the increased rate of photosynthesis from the winter crops the sowing of winter crops usually happens during october november and harvesting during march or april the peak growing stage of the winter crops is in january and february since this winter cultivation is carried out after the summer monsoon rainy season the cultivation mainly depends on irrigation rao et al 2019 also reported that the biosphere uptake during the winter season negatively correlates precipitation and evinces that precipitation is not the major driving force of biospheric uptake in winter the ct represents most of the indian region as a biospheric sink during winter with lesser magnitude and spatial heterogeneity whereas the smap data show most of the indian region as biospheric source with magnitude more than that of fluxcom data the regions that act as a biospheric sink in smap data include southern peninsular india areas over the east coast and sparsely vegetated regions over northwest india the pre monsoon season is drier with higher atmospheric temperature lesser rainfall and reduced soil moisture these meteorological factors limit biospheric productivity during the season and considerably affecting the plant s ability to remove co2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis the spatial distribution of nee during the pre monsoon season over india is shown in fig 4b f j n the nee from vprm and fluxcom show more or less similar spatial patterns over the country with positive nee over central and peninsular india and negative nee over the western ghats and northeast india after the winter season the biospheric uptake from crops starts declining since it reaches senescence as a result ecosystem respiration dominates the nee and more positive nee is observed over the croplands the higher atmospheric temperature prevailing during this season also enhances respiration which may have a prominent role in reducing the nee the nee from forests over the western ghats and northeast india can still be negative during the pre monsoon season however the ct exhibits a different nee pattern during pre monsoon especially over the vegetated region in northeast india where the ct shows a source region also the ct indicates regions over western central india as a sink during the pre monsoon season while the other three data show it as a source region the nee from smap data during the pre monsoon period shows most of the indian region as a biospheric source similar to ct the smap data also shows a highly vegetated northeastern region as a biospheric source during the pre monsoon period the summer monsoon season begins over southern peninsular india during the last week of may or the first week of june with a sudden gush of rainfall over the region the monsoon rainfall covers india by the middle of july and the seasonal rainfall lasts up to september the indian region gets almost 75 of its annual rainfall during the summer monsoon season agricultural activities and vegetation growth over the region which was suppressed during the pre monsoon season begin after the onset of the monsoon this increase in vegetation over the region enhances the rate of photosynthesis thus during the monsoon season the indian region can be a sink of biospheric co2 flux compared to the pre monsoon season which satellite evi also supports the seasonal mean nee during the monsoon season from the four data is shown in fig 4c g k o the vprm model captures most of the expected features of nee over the region during the monsoon season central india a source of biospheric flux during the pre monsoon season turns into near neutral or a sink during the monsoon season southeast peninsular india remains a source region because this region experiences lesser rainfall during the summer monsoon season compared to other parts of the country the regions over the western ghats and northeast india the prevailing biospheric co2 sink regions during the pre monsoon season enhance their uptake of co2 during the monsoon season the fluxcom data also could exhibit the transition of biospheric co2 source during pre monsoon to sink during monsoon season over most parts of india at the same time the ct data show almost all over the indian region as a source of biospheric co2 during monsoon season including forest areas over the western ghats and northeast india this feature contradicts the expected enhancement in vegetation and photosynthesis during the season valsala et al 2013 reported that the nee from ct is positive during june and july since respiration dominates the npp during the monsoon period and from august to september the nee over indian landmass shifts to negative values seasonal mean nee from smap during the monsoon season shows distinct characteristics from the other three data the smap data shows northern india as a biospheric sink and southern india as a source of biospheric flux the rainfall rich area over the western ghats is shown as a source region in smap data which contradicts the known feature the mean nee over the indian region during the post monsoon season is depicted in fig 4d h l p the vprm shows negative nee over most parts of the country except the northwestern desert region after the monsoon season plants continue to grow and the maximum vegetation greenness is observed during the post monsoon season hence the rate of photosynthesis increases and an enhancement in carbon absorption is expected over most parts of the country during the post monsoon season the vprm well captures this feature the simulations show that the biospheric co2 sink enhances during the post monsoon season over most parts of the indian region the biospheric flux from ct also exhibits most of the indian region as a co2 sink during the post monsoon season in contrast the nee from fluxcom shows a positive flux over north northwestern and central india the enhanced biospheric uptake over the southern and eastern parts of india during the post monsoon season is well discerned by the smap data however the stronger biospheric source over northern india in smap data contradicts the other three data all four data sets depict southern peninsular india as a sink of biospheric co2 flux during the post monsoon season over southern peninsular india the post monsoon season is characterised by seasonal rainfall the eastern part of south peninsular india a rain shadow region during the summer monsoon season receives half of its annual rainfall during the post monsoon season the effect of this enhanced rainfall is visible with enhanced negative nee over the region during the post monsoon season compared to the summer monsoon season 3 3 spatially integrated biospheric nee over india since the vprm simulations show better and more realistic values of biospheric co2 flux over the indian region the area integrated fluxes are computed the mean area integrated nee over the indian region from vprm during 2011 2020 is 0 16 0 02 pgc yr 1 the gee contributes about 0 47 0 02 pgc yr 1 and respiration contributes about 0 31 0 01 pgc yr 1 the co2 flux from the biosphere is driven by several meteorological parameters including precipitation atmospheric temperature and incoming solar radiation since these parameters exhibit strong inter annual variability the biospheric flux is also expected to undergo inter annual variability the time series of area integrated annual mean modelled gee r and nee over the indian region from 2011 to 2020 are shown in fig 5 during this period the gee varies from 0 43 to 0 53 pgc yr 1 nee varies from 0 12 to 0 22 pgc yr 1 and r varies from 0 29 to 0 32 pgc yr 1 regarding the absolute magnitude of nee higher values were observed in 2020 while lower values were observed in 2012 and 2016 maximum gee 0 53 pgc yr 1 was observed in 2020 while the minimum gee 0 43 pgc yr 1 was obtained in 2012 the ecosystem respiration was maximum 0 32 pgc yr 1 in 2017 and the minimum 0 29 pgc yr 1 in 2013 the maximum nee 0 22 pgc yr 1 is obtained in 2020 and minimum nee 0 12 pgc yr 1 in 2016 from 2012 to 2018 all the years except 2013 show below average rainfall across the country it significantly limits vegetation growth reducing the photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric co2 by the biosphere and leads to reduction in the nee there has been an enhancement in ecosystem respiration from 2014 onwards since respiration is modelled as a function of near surface atmospheric temperature this increase could be attributed to an enhancement in atmospheric temperature the gee and nee were higher in 2020 owing to the above average rainfall obtained during 2019 and 2020 however the absolute gee obtained from the vprm is lower than the npp gee minus autotrophic respiration reported over the indian region by earlier studies for example nayak et al 2009 bala et al 2013 patra et al 2013 even with the low values of gee compared to previous studies the nee obtained from the vprm is higher in magnitude than that of fluxcom ct and smap 3 4 the nee from different vegetation types monthly mean nee from different vegetation categories over india during 2011 2020 are depicted in fig 6 since each vegetation type is spread over multiple regions of india area averaged nee is calculated over an area encompasses 3 3 grid 729 km 2 over a region where particular vegetation dominates to represent nee from that vegetation type the nee from evergreen forest represents an area centred at 28 n 94 e deciduous forest centred at 19 5 n 80 4 e an area centred at 18 8 n 77 e represents crops over southern india an area centred at 30 n 75 5 e represents crops over northern india vegetation mosaic represents an area centred at 14 3 n 76 9 e and an area centred at 27 n 70 4 e represents the barren region the evergreen forest is a net sink of biospheric co2 all the months while the deciduous forest acts as a net source during the summer months march to june the croplands over northern india shows biospheric co2 uptake during the winter period the maximum uptake occurs during february and march while the region acts as a source from april to july the southern croplands become a sink of co2 after july till the end of the year the regions represented by vegetation mosaic and barren areas act as a net source of biospheric co2 all over the year 3 5 diurnal variation of biosphere flux over distinct vegetation types the biospheric co2 flux is subjected to strong diurnal variation since the intensity of solar radiation drives photosynthesis in the vprm hourly variations of nee are tracked with hourly varying par and near surface air temperature here we attempted to see the nee s diurnal variations for different vegetation types over india as described in section 3 4 on a seasonal scale the seasonal mean diurnal cycles of nee from different vegetation types are shown in fig 7a f a positive value of nee indicates that respiration dominates the photosynthetic uptake of co2 and a negative nee indicates that the co2 uptake dominates respiration it is observed that during nighttime the nee is positive for all vegetation types the nee is equal to ecosystem respiration without solar radiation at night for all vegetation types the magnitude of nee during nighttime for each season follows the temperature during the season the nighttime nee during winter and post monsoon seasons show lesser values due to the lower atmospheric temperature prevailing evergreen forest shows the peak nee around 11 30 ist during all seasons the most plausible reason for this could be associated with the maximum par obtained at this time hence forests get enough sunlight for photosynthesis the nee during nighttime is almost constant for the evergreen forest for a particular season the amplitude of the diurnal variation of nee is maximum during post monsoon and minimum during the pre monsoon season which could be due to the evi variations fig 7a over the deciduous forests the nee during the pre monsoon season is almost positive except during a few hours in the morning fig 7b even though the incoming solar radiation is maximum in pre monsoon the nee values are close to positive due to the low vegetation greenness and higher temperature during the monsoon season the incoming solar radiation is reduced due to the large cloud cover prevailing in the season despite this the nee shows enhanced negative values compared to pre monsoon since the vegetation greenness is increased due to the monsoon rainfall the increased vegetation greenness during the post monsoon season results in enhanced nee fig 7b in the case of crops over the southern part of india seasonal variation of nee follows the variation in evi with maximum amplitude during post monsoon and minimum during pre monsoon fig 7c for crops over northern india substantial enhancement in the magnitude of nee is observed during the winter season and lesser during other seasons fig 7d moreover during the winter season the maximum absorption is just after the noon time while other seasons absorption peaks before noon the delayed sunrise over the northern region during the winter season could be the reason for the noon time peak the magnitude of nee from vegetation mosaic and the barren area is much lesser than other vegetation types fig 7e f the nee of the vegetation mosaic depicts seasonal variation even though the amplitude is lesser compared to the other vegetation classes the nee from the barren area is a source of biospheric flux during all seasons the magnitude of biospheric emission is higher during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons than during the other two seasons fig 7f the nighttime respiration is higher during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons for all vegetation classes due to the higher near surface air temperature 4 summary and conclusions the terrestrial biospheric co2 flux is an inevitable component in the optimisation process of co2 flux using inverse modelling the existing biospheric co2 flux data are coarse in resolution and also the availability of updated data is limited in this scenario the present work aimed to develop a biosphere model for the indian region by adopting the methodology from mahadevan et al 2008 the vprm for the indian region was configured by using high resolution satellite derived lulc irs p6 awifs and surface reflectance modis data along with meteorological parameters from the era5 the model has been simulated for a decade 2011 2020 to obtain ecosystem photosynthesis respiration and net co2 exchange the nee observations from three stations kaziranga national park knp haldwani hfs and kosi katarmal kkm are used to compare the nee from the model among these stations the nee from kkm shows very good agreement with model simulated nee during most of the year whereas other stations show a partial match over kkm the nee from observation and model show similar patterns until october while during november december the model indicated higher biospheric uptake of co2 compared to the observation the vprm could simulate well matched nee over hfs from mid june to december but the nee pattern from january to mid june needs to be better matched with observations that can be attributed to the difference in the representation of vegetation greenness the vprm model captures the nee over knp fairly well from january to april after that the observed nee is positive till the end of the year while the model simulated nee are negative values compared with other available gridded nee from fluxcom ct and smap data the vprm model performs reasonably well over the indian region the vprm captures the spatial pattern and the seasonal features of nee over the country better than the other three data the magnitude of nee from the vprm model is relatively high compared to the biospheric co2 flux from the ct fluxcom and smap however the magnitudes of the vprm simulated nee align with the observations over different vegetated regions in india using the ec systems which are accepted as the ground truth the biospheric flux shows inter annual variability in response to the variabilities of the different meteorological parameters the average nee integrated over the indian region from the vprm during 2011 2020 is 0 16 0 02 pgc yr 1 in this contribution from the gee is about 0 47 0 02 pgc yr 1 and respiration is 0 31 0 01 pgc yr 1 the values of gee during the period range between 0 43 to 0 53 pgc yr 1 nee varies from 0 12 to 0 22 pgc yr 1 and respiration from 0 29 to 0 32 pgc yr 1 the maximum gee 0 53 pgc yr 1 was observed in 2020 while the minimum gee 0 43 pgc yr 1 was obtained in 2012 the ecosystem respiration shows a maximum 0 32 pgc yr 1 in 2017 and a minimum 0 29 pgc yr 1 in 2013 the maximum nee 0 22 pgc yr 1 was obtained in 2020 and the minimum nee 0 12 pgc yr 1 in 2016 decadal mean monthly variations of the nee from different vegetation types show that the evergreen forest is a net sink of biospheric co2 throughout the year the deciduous forest also acts as a net sink of biospheric co2 except during the pre monsoon period the area covered by crops over north india acts as a strong sink of biospheric co2 during winter the crop area over the southern region acts as a source during the pre monsoon season and as a sink during the post monsoon season the biospheric co2 flux is subjected to strong diurnal variations since the intensity of solar radiation drives photosynthesis in the vprm hourly variations in the nee are driven by the hourly varying par and near surface temperature the diurnal cycle of nee from different vegetation types exhibits different patterns and undergoes seasonal changes most vegetation types show that the maximum co2 uptake occurs during the post monsoon season except for crops over northern india and barren areas the nee from all vegetation types except crops over northern india peaks before noon whereas the peak nee of these crops is observed at noon the nee over the barren area is much lesser than other land types and acts as a source during all seasons during the nighttime the nee is equal to ecosystem respiration which depends on the nighttime temperature for respective vegetation types accurate estimates of the high resolution spatiotemporal distribution of biospheric co2 flux are critical for minimising the uncertainty of co2 flux especially in the peak growing season in this regard the high resolution vprm generated biospheric co2 flux performs reasonably well over the indian region compared to the existing data a lacuna in the present study is that the vegetation depended model scaling parameters used are obtained from the literature the values of scaling parameters α and β taken from mahadevan et al 2008 are tuned for the climate of the usa and dayalu et al 2018 are tuned for china future studies can further improve the model performance by calibrating the model scaling parameters using the ec system based observations over different vegetation types in india also the model is validated with observations mainly over the highly vegetated forest regions however the high resolution biospheric co2 fluxes obtained from the vprm could well depict all seasonal and interannual features of net ecosystem exchange over india and can be used for a better estimation of the country s co2 flux credit authorship contribution statement

24187,as human influences on natural ecosystems continue to expand the utilization of natural resources is approaching a threshold where unsustainability threatens the security of human society as the challenging tradeoffs between human resource demand ecological sustainability and the security of human society have become more widely recognized ecological security issues have received extensive attention however despite the emergence of substantial body of scientific research on these broader issues there is still no broad consensus on the definition of ecological security and how it should be applied to mediate resource use and conservation dilemmas across the body of published research in this subject area the criteria and evaluation methods are often so different that the results of different studies are difficult to compare in this paper we propose that ecological security refers to the degree to which the condition of ecosystem can support a certain level of socioeconomic development or quality of life we propose a simple geometric model to quantify ecological security in two dimensions the availability of ecosystem services and the affordability of humans the availability dimension is determined by the supply and demand of ecosystem services and the affordability dimension is determined by the cost and the paying capacity balance to obtain ecosystem services then we applied this model to two hypothetical cases to demonstrate its usefulness the most important feature of the proposed model is that it enables the quick evaluation of important aspects of ecological security for a study area using eight key factors although the shape and geographic characteristics of a study area are usually more complex than the hypothetical case our model can be applied if the conditions are properly simplified or adjusted keywords ecological security ecological model mathematical solution availability affordability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the deepening of human utilization of the earth s ecosystems it has become a global consensus to balance socioeconomic development and nature conservation to achieve sustainable development marten 2010 therefore identifying the status of the ecosystem in terms of its ability to function in that dynamic and resilient range of conditions that supply necessary ecological goods and services is the basis for us to take proper management decisions regarding natural resource conservation development and restoration there have been various concepts and theories to describe the status of the ecosystems such as ecological security e g millennium ecosystem assessment 2003 chu et al 2017b ecosystem health e g robert and michael 1999 burkhard et al 2008 ecological integrity e g parrish et al 2003 grantham et al 2020 ecological resilience chambers et al 2019 samuel and kevin 2019 among these concepts ecological security has been widely discussed in recent years a variety of definitions defining the ecological security concept have been proposed for example in the millennium ecosystem assessment 2003 ecological security was defined as the minimum level of ecological stock required to provide the supporting services wu et al 2020 believed that the standard of ecological security should be that the ecological supply and ecological consumption remain balanced and can meet the needs of local survival and development xu et al 2014 suggested the ecological security degree should be the extent to which ecological resources satisfy human demand for security in general the availability of ecosystem services is the major factor in defining ecological security or even has equivalent implications for the ecological security degree however previous studies have seldom considered the affordability of humans to ecosystem services which reflects the paying capacity of humans to acquire ecosystem services a common understanding is most ecosystem services except for a few provisioning services traded in the market e g food and timber have neither markets nor market values e g costanza et al 1997 one of the preconditions for an item to be given the attributes of a commodity and thus have exchange value is its scarcity common and stagl 2005 kinzig et al 2011 an important reason why some categories of ecosystem services e g climate regulation biological control are not included in the market is the sheer volume of supply which makes the acquisition cost almost zero obviously with the expansion of the demand for ecosystem services and then by increasing technological and exploitation efficiency of human economies it is predictable that some ecosystem services will be gradually incorporated into the market an example is the signing of carbon emission agreements and the establishment of carbon trading markets falkner 2016 schleussner et al 2016 another main reason is the costs of some ecosystem services are not included in the market therefore the degrading of ecological integrity or sustainability is not included in the price of commodities it is an externality to the market which means a price that is not paid in the transaction but is paid by the citizens and or other species of the planet common and stagl 2005 in this regard the implementation of ecological protection policies is actually indirectly paying part of the costs of some ecosystem services kinzig et al 2011 for example the establishment and operation of a nature reserve as an ecosystem services provider actually costs money although there is usually no direct payment for the services coad et al 2008 watson et al 2014 aside from the categories of ecosystem services that are temporarily supplied in far greater quantities than needed there are at least some costs even if indirect for provisioning services e g food raw materials regulating services e g fresh water and cultural services e g tourism here the cost of acquiring ecosystem services can be either monetary or any other form such as labor energy land and equipment clearly the ability and willingness to pay for ecosystem services varies across regions or societies at different levels of development not having enough capacity to pay for it even if it is not lacking in quantity can also be a form of ecological insecurity therefore we believe the affordability dimension should also be considered in addition to the availability in the concept construction of ecological security since most of the definitions of ecological security in the existing studies are just about the comparison of supply and demand the affordability is not reflected in the ecological security evaluations for example the quantitative comparison method mainly calculates the supply and demand of ecosystem services and uses their ratio as the degree of ecological security e g guo and wang 2019 the composite indicators method refers to that a series of indicators are selected to calculate the performance and weights of them to get a composite index to represent the ecological security level which indicates the supply and demand balance e g zhang and xu 2017 du et al 2021 the spatial analysis method generally evaluates ecological security by analyzing landscape configuration e g landscape index that may affect important ecological processes e g rao et al 2021 the ultimate objective of the spatial analysis method is also to identify the availability of the ecosystem services but too often it does not consider to what extent people can afford to pay for the services some other limitations of the existing ecological security studies also inhibit the understanding of the interpretation and evaluation of results the indicators employed in the studies using the composite indicators method are usually very different which makes it impossible to compare the evaluation results of different cases and greatly reduces the promotion of a certain evaluation system e g chen et al 2020 ying and yan 2020 about the spatial analysis method no case study on ecological security that can give a strict mathematical solution has been found at present ecological security evaluations based on commonly used landscape indices were generally only qualitative e g zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 in order to enrich the definition of ecological security and propose corresponding evaluation schemes this study first defines the ecological security from both the perspectives of availability and affordability of ecosystem services then in response to this attentive definition we try to propose a simple geometric model to express the relationships of availability and affordability using mathematical formulas we also demonstrate how this new model of ecological security works in assessing the ecological security can be applied using two hypothetical cases 2 methodology 2 1 definition of ecological security we suggest that ecological security refers to whether the ecosystem is sufficient to guarantee a certain level of socioeconomic development or quality of life specifically this involves two levels of requirements first from the availability dimension supply potential of ecosystem services by the natural ecosystems should be greater than required consumption second from the affordability dimension the paying capacity for the consumed ecosystem services should cover the cost of acquiring these ecosystem services in the form of currency or energy etc although similar descriptions for ecological security exist in some previous studies e g the ecosystem provides sufficient services for the development of socioeconomic system chu et al 2017a hu et al 2019 the affordability dimension was neither clearly stressed in the explanation of the definitions nor applied in the evaluation methods these two requirements of availability and affordability dimensions for an alternative definition of ecological security we propose in this study are expressed by the following two equations respectively 1 q n q c 2 p c where qn and qc are the supply potential of ecosystem services of the natural ecosystems and consumption quantity of ecosystem services that are derived from the natural ecosystems respectively p and c are paying capacity and acquisition cost for ecosystem services respectively 2 2 the construction of the model 2 2 1 basic settings and assumptions for the two requirements of ecological security eq 1 and 2 to be quantified we designed a two concentric circles model fig 1 in which city is the service benefit area and the natural ecosystem is the service production area brendan et al 2009 the circle in red represents the city area and its radius is r the green ring around the city that has the same centroid with the city is the natural ecosystem and its outer radius is d we assume that the beneficiaries of the ecosystem services live in the city and ecosystem services benefited by the city residents are derived from the natural ecosystem r is the outer radius of the hinterland from which the ecosystem services are produced and derived to the city for consumption here for the sake of calculation we omit the semi natural ecosystems agricultural systems they can be divided into either the artificial systems or natural ecosystems according to the characteristics of a certain category of ecosystem service moreover we made the following assumptions for the model 1 the ecosystem services to be evaluated are evenly distributed across the natural ecosystem i e the supply intensities of the ecosystem services are uniform everywhere 2 the population is evenly distributed in the city thus the consumption intensities of ecosystem services equal everywhere 3 the transport flow destination of ecosystem services is unified as the center of the city 4 the flow resistance of ecosystem services is equal everywhere thus the unit transport cost is constant for a certain type of ecosystem service 5 consumption follows the principle of least cost 6 imports and exports of the ecosystem services are not considered before proceeding with further modeling it must be emphasized that our model is not applicable to all ecosystem types but rather to those types that with appropriate adjustments can roughly conform to the above assumptions even among the existing mature evaluation tools such as invest natural capital project 2022 there is hardly a model that can be used for many types of ecosystem services an important reason for our modeling is to explain our definition of ecological security the assumptions we list also presuppose the scope of its use which is primarily ecosystem services that are produced locally and consumed locally for the types of global flows involved more sophisticated methods are needed to calculate the ecological security coefficients in the following sections we introduce the formulas to quantify the two dimensions quantity relationship of ecosystem services between supply and consumption availability dimension and the balance between the paying capacity and acquisition cost affordability dimension respectively 2 2 2 quantity relationship between supply and consumption to derive the quantity relationship between supply and consumption we introduce two concepts the consumption intensity of a certain category of ecosystem service from natural ecosystem x unit km2 and the supply intensity for it y unit km2 the unit depends on the category of ecosystem services which could be kg ton m3 and capita etc here based on assumption 1 to 5 the hinterland or supply area should be concentric ring which has the same centroid of the city and natural ecosystem the annular area between radius r and r in fig 1 in addition no imports and exports of ecosystem services are considered assumption 6 thus the supply quantity qs unit is equal to the consumption quantity qc unit 3 q c q s the supply quantity can be expressed as the supply intensity multiplied by the area and so does the consumption intensity 4 q c x a c 5 q s y a s where ac km2 is city area and as km2 is the supply area hinterland area of the natural ecosystem then from eq 3 to 5 we have 6 x a c y a s express the areas using radiuses 7 x π r 2 y π r 2 r 2 hence the relationship between r km and r km is 8 r r 1 x y 2 2 3 acquisition cost of ecosystem servcies the acquisition of ecosystem services is a complex process the cost of acquisition includes exploitation collection transportation processing etc here for simplicity we assume the acquisition cost is primarily determined by the transport cost is this study and all the other costs are equalized to the transport cost in this way the unit transport cost reflects the comprehensive acquisition cost level thus the acquisition cost is approximately proportional to the distance the unit transport cost is t unit km which means transporting one unit of ecosystem service for one kilometer costs t further destination of transport is set as the center of the city and the transportation of ecosystem services follows the principle of minimum cost therefore the transportation route is the straight line between the producing location of ecosystem services and the center of the city the integral form of the relationship between c and qs can be expressed as 9 c t l d q s where c is the total acquisition cost t unit km is the unit transport cost qs unit is supply quantity of the ecosystem service l km is the distance to the center of the city due to the relationship between qs and as eq 5 hence 10 c t l d y a s y and t are constants thus the total c can be expressed as 11 c y t l d a s about how to calculate c eq 11 can be regarded as the integral of the ring das with respect to its inner radius l which ranges from r to r fig 2 the area of das is 12 d a s 2 π l d l π d l 2 2 π l d l π dl 2 is a higher order infinitesimal of dl thus π dl 2 can be omitted when using element method in the integral calculation substitute das to eq 10 and for the supplying ring the l is from r and r hence 13 c y t r r l 2 π l d l y t r r 2 π l 2 d l y t 2 3 π l 3 r r 2 3 π y t r 3 r 3 substitute r expressed by eq 8 to eq 13 then 14 c 2 3 π y t r 1 x y 3 r 3 2 3 π y t 1 x y 1 5 1 r 3 eq 14 indicates c is determined by x y t and r if x y and t keep constant the total acquisition cost c is proportional to the cube city radius r 3 2 2 4 paying capacity the paying capacity of human beings for ecosystem services is affected by various factors e g environmental awareness khan et al 2019 legislative design jack et al 2008 market mechanisms roesch mcnally and rabotyagov 2016 which is highly related to the type of social regime and development level of the study area in this study we assume that the paying capacity is proportional to the local economic development level or quality of life which is reflected by gdp per capita i capita the ratio between paying capacity per capita p capita and gdp per capita is w unitless which ranges from 0 to 1 to represent how much proportion of the gdp per capita do people use for consuming ecosystem services the equation for individual paying capacity is 15 p i w use i to represent gdp of the city h and h to represent the population and population density respectively then the total paying capacity p is 16 p i w i h w i h π d 2 w 2 2 5 ecological security criteria based on above formulation we can use equations to represent the criteria of ecological security for the first condition the supply potential should be greater than the consumption eq 1 here we can use the area relationship to replace the quantity relationship since the supply intensity is even everywhere i e the hinterland area as should be less than the area of natural ecosystem an 17 a s a n we use the ratio between an and as to represent the availability dimension of ecological security and call it quantity security coefficient sq unitless it is expressed as 18 s q a n a s π d 2 r 2 π r 2 r 2 d 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 substitute r in eq 8 hence 19 s q x y d 2 r 2 r 2 for the second condition as eq 2 shows the acquisition cost should be lower than the paying capacity we use the ratio between p and c to represent the affordability dimension of ecological security sp unitless and call it paying capacity security coefficient it can be calculated as fallows by substituting eq 14 and 16 20 s p p c i h π d 2 w 2 3 π y t r 3 1 x y 1 5 1 i h d 2 w 2 3 y t r 3 1 x y 1 5 1 we believe that insufficient quantity and paying capacity may lead to ecological security problems and thus we define the final ecological security coefficient s unitless is the smaller one of sq and sp it is expressed as follows 21 s m i n s q s p thus the ecological security criterion for coefficient s is 22 s m i n s q s p 1 if s is greater than 1 it means that the natural ecosystem provides enough ecosystem services but also we can afford them in contrast if s is less than 1 we either have not enough ecosystem services or can t not afford them or both our formulation of ecological security will help identify which dimension is the primary constraint of the ecological security by comparing sq and sp if sq is larger than sp it means that the ecosystem services are enough but we cannot afford the consumption and vice versa however it should be emphasized that we do not recommend a threshold of 1 as a criterion for ecological security because of the uncertainties involved in social ecological systems it is necessary to leave a sufficient margin of the ecological security coefficient s the margin required for different ecosystem services may also be different we believe that the empirical value of ecological security coefficient obtained through the accumulation of practical experience may be a solution we can either calculate the ecological security coefficients for a certain category or several categories of ecosystem services or use average values to calculate a comprehensive ecological security coefficient for all required ecosystem services correspondingly the ecological security coefficient reflects the equivalent scope from eq 19 to 21 it is clear that the ecological security coefficient can be easily calculated by just eight factors in this model x consumption intensity y supply intensity r city radius d outer radius of the natural ecosystem i gdp per capita h population density w paying ratio t unit transport cost this is the biggest advantage of this model it should be noted that for factors that involve time periods e g consumption and supply intensity and gdp per capita the computation period should be consistent such as a year or a month 2 3 an application example 1 a hypothetical case to assess the ecological security of freshwater provision to show how this model works in assessing the ecological security we introduce a hypothetical case study area the ecosystem service to be considered in this hypothetical case is fresh water which comes from precipitation and furtherly purified by the natural ecosystem we focuses on fresh water because it reflects the linkage of different ecosystem services including both provisioning and regulating services millennium ecosystem assessment 2003 all the values and units for factors used in the calculation of hypothetical case are listed in table 1 before giving the specific values we must claim that the calculation period is one year the city radius and the outer radius of the natural ecosystem is 10 and 30 km respectively we referred to the standard for the design of city water supply in china to determine the consumption intensity of fresh water ministry of housing and urban rural development 2016 we use the following equation to translate the per capita water consumption to area based quantity 23 x w q h d a y s a c where x t km2 is the consumption intensity wq l day capita is the comprehensive day water quota for one person h capita is population days is the calculation period and ac is the city area here as mentioned above the time is set as one year thus the days is 365 the comprehensive day water quota for one person wq is set to be 400 l day capita when population and city area are provided the annual consumption intensity can be calculated according to other values in table 1 and eq 23 the original x is approximately 270 000 t km2 the supply of fresh water ultimately comes from precipitation the supply intensity is proportional to the precipitation the precipitation is set as 1500 mm per year and 5 can be finally collected effectively then after changing the unit the annual water supply intensity is 75 000 t km2 the determination of unit transport cost of fresh water is most challenging which varies depending on the local conditions referring to the comprehensive water acquisition cost of small and medium sized cities zhou and tol 2005 florian and lisa maria 2020 we select 0 05 t km as the average unit transport cost which represents the comprehensive acquisition unit price that includes all the other costs such as extraction and purification the gdp per capita is assumed to be 10 000 capita the population density is assumed to be 200 capita km2 which refers to a moderate density of a country or region united nations 2019 it should be noted that to make this value intuitive the area base of the population density is the whole system including the city and natural ecosystem the paying proportion for fresh water is assumed to be 0 01 people can spend 1 of the gdp on the consumption of freshwater ecosystem services 2 4 an application example 2 a hypothetical case to further assess the impact of urban growth to further show the usefulness of this model based on the previous example a few values are modified to simulate the urbanization brought by a period of social economic development e g 10 years first the city radius changes from 10 km to 12 km the gdp per capita changes form 10 000 year to 15 000 year the population density changes from 200 to 250 capita km2 in total three values are changed and the others keep as they were all the values for the factors are shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 results of example 1 the calculation results of the ecological security coefficients and the intermediate factors are shown in table 3 the consumption radius is 21 4 km which doesn t exceed the outer radius of the natural ecosystem 30 km this indicates that quantitatively the natural ecosystem can provide sufficient fresh water accordingly the availability coefficient of ecological security is 2 22 which is the quotient of the area of natural ecosystem and supply area hinterland the paying capacity 5 7 107 which is greater than the acquisition cost is 2 8 107 thus as the quotient of them the affordability coefficient of ecological security is 2 03 this indicates that the quality of life 10 000 per capita gdp can support the acquisition cost of fresh water the affordability coefficient is lower than the availability coefficient thus the ecological security coefficient equals to the affordability coefficient 2 03 3 2 results of example 2 the calculation results of the ecological security coefficients and the intermediate factors are shown in table 4 the consumption radius increases from 21 4 to 25 7 km and the supply area hinterland increases from 1130 to 1628 km2 the area of natural ecosystem which is the source of freshwater ecosystem services decreases from 2512 to 2374 km2 thus the availability coefficient which is the quotient of the area of natural ecosystem and supply area decreases from 2 22 to 1 46 the expansion of the city and supply area hinter land is illustrated by fig 3 with the increases of gdp per capita 10 000 to 15 000 and population density 200 to 250 capita km2 the paying capacity increases from 5 7 107 to 1 1 108 while the acquisition cost increases from 2 8 107 to 4 8 107 since the increment of paying capacity is greater than that of acquisition cost finally the affordability coefficient increases slightly from 2 03 to 2 20 finally the ecological security coefficient is 1 46 which is equal to availability coefficient since affordability coefficient overcomes the availability coefficient 4 discussion 4 1 the necessity of affordability in the evaluation of ecological security in this study we proposed a new definition of ecological security and stressed the importance of affordability which was usually ignored by previous studies e g chu et al 2017a hu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 to incorporate both the dimension of availability and affordability in the evaluation of ecological security we designed a two concentric circles model to calculate the ecological security coefficients and derived corresponding formulas this model was used to calculate a hypothetical case and compare the differences in ecological security status at different development levels in the application examples the ecological security was determined by the affordability in the former state table 3 and then determined by the availability after a period of urbanization table 4 this is obviously different from the availability comparison using only ecological footprint and biocapacity e g xu et al 2014 guo and wang 2019 in example 1 although the total supply quantity is 2 22 times the consumption quantity the paying capacity determines that they cannot be fully purchased because the paying capacity is only 2 03 times the acquisition cost theoretically the security surplus is 1 03 2 03 1 times of consumption quantity rather than 1 22 2 22 1 in example 2 although the economic level has developed and the total paying capacity has been improved the paying capacity is 2 20 times of the acquisition cost however the ratio of supply to consumption has also decreased from 2 22 to 1 43 due to the increase of population and expansion of the city this indicates that although economic development has brought higher paying capacity the natural ecosystem cannot necessarily provide more ecosystem services in equal proportion and the ecological security coefficient cannot be improved accordingly even though we used hypothetical values we believe that the utilization of ecosystem services is not only a matter of availability but also affordability and they may shift as conditions change therefore when analyzing the causes of ecological security problems we should start from these two aspects building a model that can simultaneously evaluate these two aspects can bring greater convenience which is the main motivation of this study 4 2 advantages of this model with the new model proposed in this article we can evaluate ecological security quickly by eight key factors all functions in the model are explicit functions thus all results can be derived directly instead of being expressed by implicit functions we have also tried some more complicated geometries or position relationships and the resulting acquisition cost may not be easily integrated as explicit equations for example if the city circle and the natural ecosystem ring don t share the same center the expression of the acquisition cost would be an implicit function so that it cannot be directly derived from other factors thus the ecological security cannot be directly calculated that was one of the reasons why we determined to use two concentric circles in the past studies about the evaluation of ecological security composite indicators evaluation method was extremely popular in which ecosystem services were usually regarded as indicators e g hu et al 2019 scoring each indicator is one of the core parts of the evaluation process oecd 2013 qiu and liu 2021 however it is often challenging or even ignored to give concrete evidence for scoring e g xu et al 2014 guo et al 2020 our model can deal with this challenge to some extent because our model can calculate the specific values for the availability and affordability of a given ecosystem service in other words our mathematical formulations help to improve the transparency of the calculation process and comparability of evaluation results of ecological security except for the comparison between different development stages of the same study area simple predictions can be made by applying different assumptions with corresponding factor values for example when keeping other factors fixed there is a maximum city radius and the corresponding conditions are that either the biocapacity is exhausted or the paying capacity is exhausted i e availability coefficient equals to 1 or affordability equals to 1 even both other thresholds such as maximum consumption intensity and population density can also be predicted using similar methods 4 3 limitations for application and a way forward like most models ours has a scope of applicability from the assumptions in the building of the model we can identify the limitations here we would like to explain at least the following three points first by reasonable simplification or assumption the shape and location of cities and natural ecosystems need to be as similar as possible to the geometric features of the model fig 1 second the ecosystem services should be as widely and evenly distributed in this case the cost calculated as the integral of the supply over the distance traveled from source to destination is meaningful if the production of a category of ecosystem service is concentrated the equations in this model may not lead to high accuracy third this model applies primarily to medium and small scales and ecosystem services which are mainly produced locally and consumed locally for ecosystem services with distinct off site production or consumption characteristics import and export quantities need to be added to the equations to use this model in addition to theory or structure parameters play a key role that determines the success of a model hritonenko and yatsenko 1999 jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 we must admit that the determination of the parameters of some factors in the example is somewhat subjective however this does not affect the rationality of the model because it can be gradually solved by accumulating experience in future practical applications several key factors in our model can be considered as averages that represent the overall level such as the supply and consumption intensities of ecosystem services although there is almost no ideal uniform distribution in reality using appropriate statistical methods to determine representative values is also one of the methods to improve the accuracy of the model the simplification of the model undoubtedly has advantages and disadvantages real situations are generally more complex than the model we have the following suggestions on how to deal with the difference between model and reality when the difference is relatively small some features of the real situation can be adjusted slightly so that it can take advantage of the model as analysis on the limitations of the model to make complicated situations applicable we need to improve the model irregular shapes and complex positions are most common cases explicit equations are usually impossible to achieve rasterizing the graph and then using accumulation and trial algorithms in supply and demand analysis may be a solution another question is the acquisition cost of ecosystem services this model assumes that the friction is even everywhere and the cost is just determined by the linear distance between the source and movement destination in real situations friction is determined by a variety of factors e g land use or land cover category height slope thus the costs usually vary at different points or areas stillwell and clarke 2004 in such cases the transport routes are no longer straight lines building the resistance surface and planning the cost path is also one of the problems to be solved in the future in addition it should be noted that to make the calculation of the ecological security coefficients concise enough we do not consider imports and exports by default thus the equations can be applied only if the supply is greater than or equal to consumption if supply is less than consumption i e the area of natural ecosystems is less than the supply area then the availability coefficient will be less than one meanwhile for the calculation of the affordability coefficient it is necessary to add the import cost to the acquisition cost admittedly the inclusion of these factors may not be entirely explained in a single paper in the follow up studies we will incorporate more factors to improve this model for example the acquisition cost in the current version of the model is the product of total consumption quantity and unit transport cost which adopts the assumption that the distribution of ecosystem services this can be improved by integrating the transport costs at different locations when considering the non uniform distribution our roadmap is to eliminate the limitations resulted from aggressive or idealized assumptions gradually by replacing the assumptions with practical conditions case studies using real study areas are also one of the main tasks in the next stage finally the definition of ecological security in this paper adopts the anthropocentric perspective the environmental or ecological ethics plays an important role in the definitions of any related concepts cherry 1995 believed that the philosophical perspective can be divided into three categories according to the human s attitude to nature human centric human centric and eclectic the evaluation methods of ecological security are also correspondingly based on the ecological values whether more inclusive definitions and evaluation methods should be adopted may also be one of the topics of future research 5 conclusions this study proposed a new definition of ecological security whether the ecosystem is sufficient to guarantee a certain level of socioeconomic development or quality of life based on this definition we built a simple geometric model using two concentric circles to calculate the ecological security then we gave the expressions of availability coefficient and affordability coefficient through a series of equations derivation and defined the smaller one of them as the final ecological security coefficient the ecological security coefficients of water supply of a hypothetical study area at two different development stages were successfully calculated this demonstrated that the definition of ecological security proposed in this study is reasonable and the corresponding model is applicable although the shapes and locations of cities and natural ecosystems are usually irregular in practice this model can be used under some situations after appropriate simplification or adjustment credit authorship contribution statement

24187,as human influences on natural ecosystems continue to expand the utilization of natural resources is approaching a threshold where unsustainability threatens the security of human society as the challenging tradeoffs between human resource demand ecological sustainability and the security of human society have become more widely recognized ecological security issues have received extensive attention however despite the emergence of substantial body of scientific research on these broader issues there is still no broad consensus on the definition of ecological security and how it should be applied to mediate resource use and conservation dilemmas across the body of published research in this subject area the criteria and evaluation methods are often so different that the results of different studies are difficult to compare in this paper we propose that ecological security refers to the degree to which the condition of ecosystem can support a certain level of socioeconomic development or quality of life we propose a simple geometric model to quantify ecological security in two dimensions the availability of ecosystem services and the affordability of humans the availability dimension is determined by the supply and demand of ecosystem services and the affordability dimension is determined by the cost and the paying capacity balance to obtain ecosystem services then we applied this model to two hypothetical cases to demonstrate its usefulness the most important feature of the proposed model is that it enables the quick evaluation of important aspects of ecological security for a study area using eight key factors although the shape and geographic characteristics of a study area are usually more complex than the hypothetical case our model can be applied if the conditions are properly simplified or adjusted keywords ecological security ecological model mathematical solution availability affordability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the deepening of human utilization of the earth s ecosystems it has become a global consensus to balance socioeconomic development and nature conservation to achieve sustainable development marten 2010 therefore identifying the status of the ecosystem in terms of its ability to function in that dynamic and resilient range of conditions that supply necessary ecological goods and services is the basis for us to take proper management decisions regarding natural resource conservation development and restoration there have been various concepts and theories to describe the status of the ecosystems such as ecological security e g millennium ecosystem assessment 2003 chu et al 2017b ecosystem health e g robert and michael 1999 burkhard et al 2008 ecological integrity e g parrish et al 2003 grantham et al 2020 ecological resilience chambers et al 2019 samuel and kevin 2019 among these concepts ecological security has been widely discussed in recent years a variety of definitions defining the ecological security concept have been proposed for example in the millennium ecosystem assessment 2003 ecological security was defined as the minimum level of ecological stock required to provide the supporting services wu et al 2020 believed that the standard of ecological security should be that the ecological supply and ecological consumption remain balanced and can meet the needs of local survival and development xu et al 2014 suggested the ecological security degree should be the extent to which ecological resources satisfy human demand for security in general the availability of ecosystem services is the major factor in defining ecological security or even has equivalent implications for the ecological security degree however previous studies have seldom considered the affordability of humans to ecosystem services which reflects the paying capacity of humans to acquire ecosystem services a common understanding is most ecosystem services except for a few provisioning services traded in the market e g food and timber have neither markets nor market values e g costanza et al 1997 one of the preconditions for an item to be given the attributes of a commodity and thus have exchange value is its scarcity common and stagl 2005 kinzig et al 2011 an important reason why some categories of ecosystem services e g climate regulation biological control are not included in the market is the sheer volume of supply which makes the acquisition cost almost zero obviously with the expansion of the demand for ecosystem services and then by increasing technological and exploitation efficiency of human economies it is predictable that some ecosystem services will be gradually incorporated into the market an example is the signing of carbon emission agreements and the establishment of carbon trading markets falkner 2016 schleussner et al 2016 another main reason is the costs of some ecosystem services are not included in the market therefore the degrading of ecological integrity or sustainability is not included in the price of commodities it is an externality to the market which means a price that is not paid in the transaction but is paid by the citizens and or other species of the planet common and stagl 2005 in this regard the implementation of ecological protection policies is actually indirectly paying part of the costs of some ecosystem services kinzig et al 2011 for example the establishment and operation of a nature reserve as an ecosystem services provider actually costs money although there is usually no direct payment for the services coad et al 2008 watson et al 2014 aside from the categories of ecosystem services that are temporarily supplied in far greater quantities than needed there are at least some costs even if indirect for provisioning services e g food raw materials regulating services e g fresh water and cultural services e g tourism here the cost of acquiring ecosystem services can be either monetary or any other form such as labor energy land and equipment clearly the ability and willingness to pay for ecosystem services varies across regions or societies at different levels of development not having enough capacity to pay for it even if it is not lacking in quantity can also be a form of ecological insecurity therefore we believe the affordability dimension should also be considered in addition to the availability in the concept construction of ecological security since most of the definitions of ecological security in the existing studies are just about the comparison of supply and demand the affordability is not reflected in the ecological security evaluations for example the quantitative comparison method mainly calculates the supply and demand of ecosystem services and uses their ratio as the degree of ecological security e g guo and wang 2019 the composite indicators method refers to that a series of indicators are selected to calculate the performance and weights of them to get a composite index to represent the ecological security level which indicates the supply and demand balance e g zhang and xu 2017 du et al 2021 the spatial analysis method generally evaluates ecological security by analyzing landscape configuration e g landscape index that may affect important ecological processes e g rao et al 2021 the ultimate objective of the spatial analysis method is also to identify the availability of the ecosystem services but too often it does not consider to what extent people can afford to pay for the services some other limitations of the existing ecological security studies also inhibit the understanding of the interpretation and evaluation of results the indicators employed in the studies using the composite indicators method are usually very different which makes it impossible to compare the evaluation results of different cases and greatly reduces the promotion of a certain evaluation system e g chen et al 2020 ying and yan 2020 about the spatial analysis method no case study on ecological security that can give a strict mathematical solution has been found at present ecological security evaluations based on commonly used landscape indices were generally only qualitative e g zhang et al 2010 zhou et al 2014 in order to enrich the definition of ecological security and propose corresponding evaluation schemes this study first defines the ecological security from both the perspectives of availability and affordability of ecosystem services then in response to this attentive definition we try to propose a simple geometric model to express the relationships of availability and affordability using mathematical formulas we also demonstrate how this new model of ecological security works in assessing the ecological security can be applied using two hypothetical cases 2 methodology 2 1 definition of ecological security we suggest that ecological security refers to whether the ecosystem is sufficient to guarantee a certain level of socioeconomic development or quality of life specifically this involves two levels of requirements first from the availability dimension supply potential of ecosystem services by the natural ecosystems should be greater than required consumption second from the affordability dimension the paying capacity for the consumed ecosystem services should cover the cost of acquiring these ecosystem services in the form of currency or energy etc although similar descriptions for ecological security exist in some previous studies e g the ecosystem provides sufficient services for the development of socioeconomic system chu et al 2017a hu et al 2019 the affordability dimension was neither clearly stressed in the explanation of the definitions nor applied in the evaluation methods these two requirements of availability and affordability dimensions for an alternative definition of ecological security we propose in this study are expressed by the following two equations respectively 1 q n q c 2 p c where qn and qc are the supply potential of ecosystem services of the natural ecosystems and consumption quantity of ecosystem services that are derived from the natural ecosystems respectively p and c are paying capacity and acquisition cost for ecosystem services respectively 2 2 the construction of the model 2 2 1 basic settings and assumptions for the two requirements of ecological security eq 1 and 2 to be quantified we designed a two concentric circles model fig 1 in which city is the service benefit area and the natural ecosystem is the service production area brendan et al 2009 the circle in red represents the city area and its radius is r the green ring around the city that has the same centroid with the city is the natural ecosystem and its outer radius is d we assume that the beneficiaries of the ecosystem services live in the city and ecosystem services benefited by the city residents are derived from the natural ecosystem r is the outer radius of the hinterland from which the ecosystem services are produced and derived to the city for consumption here for the sake of calculation we omit the semi natural ecosystems agricultural systems they can be divided into either the artificial systems or natural ecosystems according to the characteristics of a certain category of ecosystem service moreover we made the following assumptions for the model 1 the ecosystem services to be evaluated are evenly distributed across the natural ecosystem i e the supply intensities of the ecosystem services are uniform everywhere 2 the population is evenly distributed in the city thus the consumption intensities of ecosystem services equal everywhere 3 the transport flow destination of ecosystem services is unified as the center of the city 4 the flow resistance of ecosystem services is equal everywhere thus the unit transport cost is constant for a certain type of ecosystem service 5 consumption follows the principle of least cost 6 imports and exports of the ecosystem services are not considered before proceeding with further modeling it must be emphasized that our model is not applicable to all ecosystem types but rather to those types that with appropriate adjustments can roughly conform to the above assumptions even among the existing mature evaluation tools such as invest natural capital project 2022 there is hardly a model that can be used for many types of ecosystem services an important reason for our modeling is to explain our definition of ecological security the assumptions we list also presuppose the scope of its use which is primarily ecosystem services that are produced locally and consumed locally for the types of global flows involved more sophisticated methods are needed to calculate the ecological security coefficients in the following sections we introduce the formulas to quantify the two dimensions quantity relationship of ecosystem services between supply and consumption availability dimension and the balance between the paying capacity and acquisition cost affordability dimension respectively 2 2 2 quantity relationship between supply and consumption to derive the quantity relationship between supply and consumption we introduce two concepts the consumption intensity of a certain category of ecosystem service from natural ecosystem x unit km2 and the supply intensity for it y unit km2 the unit depends on the category of ecosystem services which could be kg ton m3 and capita etc here based on assumption 1 to 5 the hinterland or supply area should be concentric ring which has the same centroid of the city and natural ecosystem the annular area between radius r and r in fig 1 in addition no imports and exports of ecosystem services are considered assumption 6 thus the supply quantity qs unit is equal to the consumption quantity qc unit 3 q c q s the supply quantity can be expressed as the supply intensity multiplied by the area and so does the consumption intensity 4 q c x a c 5 q s y a s where ac km2 is city area and as km2 is the supply area hinterland area of the natural ecosystem then from eq 3 to 5 we have 6 x a c y a s express the areas using radiuses 7 x π r 2 y π r 2 r 2 hence the relationship between r km and r km is 8 r r 1 x y 2 2 3 acquisition cost of ecosystem servcies the acquisition of ecosystem services is a complex process the cost of acquisition includes exploitation collection transportation processing etc here for simplicity we assume the acquisition cost is primarily determined by the transport cost is this study and all the other costs are equalized to the transport cost in this way the unit transport cost reflects the comprehensive acquisition cost level thus the acquisition cost is approximately proportional to the distance the unit transport cost is t unit km which means transporting one unit of ecosystem service for one kilometer costs t further destination of transport is set as the center of the city and the transportation of ecosystem services follows the principle of minimum cost therefore the transportation route is the straight line between the producing location of ecosystem services and the center of the city the integral form of the relationship between c and qs can be expressed as 9 c t l d q s where c is the total acquisition cost t unit km is the unit transport cost qs unit is supply quantity of the ecosystem service l km is the distance to the center of the city due to the relationship between qs and as eq 5 hence 10 c t l d y a s y and t are constants thus the total c can be expressed as 11 c y t l d a s about how to calculate c eq 11 can be regarded as the integral of the ring das with respect to its inner radius l which ranges from r to r fig 2 the area of das is 12 d a s 2 π l d l π d l 2 2 π l d l π dl 2 is a higher order infinitesimal of dl thus π dl 2 can be omitted when using element method in the integral calculation substitute das to eq 10 and for the supplying ring the l is from r and r hence 13 c y t r r l 2 π l d l y t r r 2 π l 2 d l y t 2 3 π l 3 r r 2 3 π y t r 3 r 3 substitute r expressed by eq 8 to eq 13 then 14 c 2 3 π y t r 1 x y 3 r 3 2 3 π y t 1 x y 1 5 1 r 3 eq 14 indicates c is determined by x y t and r if x y and t keep constant the total acquisition cost c is proportional to the cube city radius r 3 2 2 4 paying capacity the paying capacity of human beings for ecosystem services is affected by various factors e g environmental awareness khan et al 2019 legislative design jack et al 2008 market mechanisms roesch mcnally and rabotyagov 2016 which is highly related to the type of social regime and development level of the study area in this study we assume that the paying capacity is proportional to the local economic development level or quality of life which is reflected by gdp per capita i capita the ratio between paying capacity per capita p capita and gdp per capita is w unitless which ranges from 0 to 1 to represent how much proportion of the gdp per capita do people use for consuming ecosystem services the equation for individual paying capacity is 15 p i w use i to represent gdp of the city h and h to represent the population and population density respectively then the total paying capacity p is 16 p i w i h w i h π d 2 w 2 2 5 ecological security criteria based on above formulation we can use equations to represent the criteria of ecological security for the first condition the supply potential should be greater than the consumption eq 1 here we can use the area relationship to replace the quantity relationship since the supply intensity is even everywhere i e the hinterland area as should be less than the area of natural ecosystem an 17 a s a n we use the ratio between an and as to represent the availability dimension of ecological security and call it quantity security coefficient sq unitless it is expressed as 18 s q a n a s π d 2 r 2 π r 2 r 2 d 2 r 2 r 2 r 2 substitute r in eq 8 hence 19 s q x y d 2 r 2 r 2 for the second condition as eq 2 shows the acquisition cost should be lower than the paying capacity we use the ratio between p and c to represent the affordability dimension of ecological security sp unitless and call it paying capacity security coefficient it can be calculated as fallows by substituting eq 14 and 16 20 s p p c i h π d 2 w 2 3 π y t r 3 1 x y 1 5 1 i h d 2 w 2 3 y t r 3 1 x y 1 5 1 we believe that insufficient quantity and paying capacity may lead to ecological security problems and thus we define the final ecological security coefficient s unitless is the smaller one of sq and sp it is expressed as follows 21 s m i n s q s p thus the ecological security criterion for coefficient s is 22 s m i n s q s p 1 if s is greater than 1 it means that the natural ecosystem provides enough ecosystem services but also we can afford them in contrast if s is less than 1 we either have not enough ecosystem services or can t not afford them or both our formulation of ecological security will help identify which dimension is the primary constraint of the ecological security by comparing sq and sp if sq is larger than sp it means that the ecosystem services are enough but we cannot afford the consumption and vice versa however it should be emphasized that we do not recommend a threshold of 1 as a criterion for ecological security because of the uncertainties involved in social ecological systems it is necessary to leave a sufficient margin of the ecological security coefficient s the margin required for different ecosystem services may also be different we believe that the empirical value of ecological security coefficient obtained through the accumulation of practical experience may be a solution we can either calculate the ecological security coefficients for a certain category or several categories of ecosystem services or use average values to calculate a comprehensive ecological security coefficient for all required ecosystem services correspondingly the ecological security coefficient reflects the equivalent scope from eq 19 to 21 it is clear that the ecological security coefficient can be easily calculated by just eight factors in this model x consumption intensity y supply intensity r city radius d outer radius of the natural ecosystem i gdp per capita h population density w paying ratio t unit transport cost this is the biggest advantage of this model it should be noted that for factors that involve time periods e g consumption and supply intensity and gdp per capita the computation period should be consistent such as a year or a month 2 3 an application example 1 a hypothetical case to assess the ecological security of freshwater provision to show how this model works in assessing the ecological security we introduce a hypothetical case study area the ecosystem service to be considered in this hypothetical case is fresh water which comes from precipitation and furtherly purified by the natural ecosystem we focuses on fresh water because it reflects the linkage of different ecosystem services including both provisioning and regulating services millennium ecosystem assessment 2003 all the values and units for factors used in the calculation of hypothetical case are listed in table 1 before giving the specific values we must claim that the calculation period is one year the city radius and the outer radius of the natural ecosystem is 10 and 30 km respectively we referred to the standard for the design of city water supply in china to determine the consumption intensity of fresh water ministry of housing and urban rural development 2016 we use the following equation to translate the per capita water consumption to area based quantity 23 x w q h d a y s a c where x t km2 is the consumption intensity wq l day capita is the comprehensive day water quota for one person h capita is population days is the calculation period and ac is the city area here as mentioned above the time is set as one year thus the days is 365 the comprehensive day water quota for one person wq is set to be 400 l day capita when population and city area are provided the annual consumption intensity can be calculated according to other values in table 1 and eq 23 the original x is approximately 270 000 t km2 the supply of fresh water ultimately comes from precipitation the supply intensity is proportional to the precipitation the precipitation is set as 1500 mm per year and 5 can be finally collected effectively then after changing the unit the annual water supply intensity is 75 000 t km2 the determination of unit transport cost of fresh water is most challenging which varies depending on the local conditions referring to the comprehensive water acquisition cost of small and medium sized cities zhou and tol 2005 florian and lisa maria 2020 we select 0 05 t km as the average unit transport cost which represents the comprehensive acquisition unit price that includes all the other costs such as extraction and purification the gdp per capita is assumed to be 10 000 capita the population density is assumed to be 200 capita km2 which refers to a moderate density of a country or region united nations 2019 it should be noted that to make this value intuitive the area base of the population density is the whole system including the city and natural ecosystem the paying proportion for fresh water is assumed to be 0 01 people can spend 1 of the gdp on the consumption of freshwater ecosystem services 2 4 an application example 2 a hypothetical case to further assess the impact of urban growth to further show the usefulness of this model based on the previous example a few values are modified to simulate the urbanization brought by a period of social economic development e g 10 years first the city radius changes from 10 km to 12 km the gdp per capita changes form 10 000 year to 15 000 year the population density changes from 200 to 250 capita km2 in total three values are changed and the others keep as they were all the values for the factors are shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 results of example 1 the calculation results of the ecological security coefficients and the intermediate factors are shown in table 3 the consumption radius is 21 4 km which doesn t exceed the outer radius of the natural ecosystem 30 km this indicates that quantitatively the natural ecosystem can provide sufficient fresh water accordingly the availability coefficient of ecological security is 2 22 which is the quotient of the area of natural ecosystem and supply area hinterland the paying capacity 5 7 107 which is greater than the acquisition cost is 2 8 107 thus as the quotient of them the affordability coefficient of ecological security is 2 03 this indicates that the quality of life 10 000 per capita gdp can support the acquisition cost of fresh water the affordability coefficient is lower than the availability coefficient thus the ecological security coefficient equals to the affordability coefficient 2 03 3 2 results of example 2 the calculation results of the ecological security coefficients and the intermediate factors are shown in table 4 the consumption radius increases from 21 4 to 25 7 km and the supply area hinterland increases from 1130 to 1628 km2 the area of natural ecosystem which is the source of freshwater ecosystem services decreases from 2512 to 2374 km2 thus the availability coefficient which is the quotient of the area of natural ecosystem and supply area decreases from 2 22 to 1 46 the expansion of the city and supply area hinter land is illustrated by fig 3 with the increases of gdp per capita 10 000 to 15 000 and population density 200 to 250 capita km2 the paying capacity increases from 5 7 107 to 1 1 108 while the acquisition cost increases from 2 8 107 to 4 8 107 since the increment of paying capacity is greater than that of acquisition cost finally the affordability coefficient increases slightly from 2 03 to 2 20 finally the ecological security coefficient is 1 46 which is equal to availability coefficient since affordability coefficient overcomes the availability coefficient 4 discussion 4 1 the necessity of affordability in the evaluation of ecological security in this study we proposed a new definition of ecological security and stressed the importance of affordability which was usually ignored by previous studies e g chu et al 2017a hu et al 2019 wu et al 2020 to incorporate both the dimension of availability and affordability in the evaluation of ecological security we designed a two concentric circles model to calculate the ecological security coefficients and derived corresponding formulas this model was used to calculate a hypothetical case and compare the differences in ecological security status at different development levels in the application examples the ecological security was determined by the affordability in the former state table 3 and then determined by the availability after a period of urbanization table 4 this is obviously different from the availability comparison using only ecological footprint and biocapacity e g xu et al 2014 guo and wang 2019 in example 1 although the total supply quantity is 2 22 times the consumption quantity the paying capacity determines that they cannot be fully purchased because the paying capacity is only 2 03 times the acquisition cost theoretically the security surplus is 1 03 2 03 1 times of consumption quantity rather than 1 22 2 22 1 in example 2 although the economic level has developed and the total paying capacity has been improved the paying capacity is 2 20 times of the acquisition cost however the ratio of supply to consumption has also decreased from 2 22 to 1 43 due to the increase of population and expansion of the city this indicates that although economic development has brought higher paying capacity the natural ecosystem cannot necessarily provide more ecosystem services in equal proportion and the ecological security coefficient cannot be improved accordingly even though we used hypothetical values we believe that the utilization of ecosystem services is not only a matter of availability but also affordability and they may shift as conditions change therefore when analyzing the causes of ecological security problems we should start from these two aspects building a model that can simultaneously evaluate these two aspects can bring greater convenience which is the main motivation of this study 4 2 advantages of this model with the new model proposed in this article we can evaluate ecological security quickly by eight key factors all functions in the model are explicit functions thus all results can be derived directly instead of being expressed by implicit functions we have also tried some more complicated geometries or position relationships and the resulting acquisition cost may not be easily integrated as explicit equations for example if the city circle and the natural ecosystem ring don t share the same center the expression of the acquisition cost would be an implicit function so that it cannot be directly derived from other factors thus the ecological security cannot be directly calculated that was one of the reasons why we determined to use two concentric circles in the past studies about the evaluation of ecological security composite indicators evaluation method was extremely popular in which ecosystem services were usually regarded as indicators e g hu et al 2019 scoring each indicator is one of the core parts of the evaluation process oecd 2013 qiu and liu 2021 however it is often challenging or even ignored to give concrete evidence for scoring e g xu et al 2014 guo et al 2020 our model can deal with this challenge to some extent because our model can calculate the specific values for the availability and affordability of a given ecosystem service in other words our mathematical formulations help to improve the transparency of the calculation process and comparability of evaluation results of ecological security except for the comparison between different development stages of the same study area simple predictions can be made by applying different assumptions with corresponding factor values for example when keeping other factors fixed there is a maximum city radius and the corresponding conditions are that either the biocapacity is exhausted or the paying capacity is exhausted i e availability coefficient equals to 1 or affordability equals to 1 even both other thresholds such as maximum consumption intensity and population density can also be predicted using similar methods 4 3 limitations for application and a way forward like most models ours has a scope of applicability from the assumptions in the building of the model we can identify the limitations here we would like to explain at least the following three points first by reasonable simplification or assumption the shape and location of cities and natural ecosystems need to be as similar as possible to the geometric features of the model fig 1 second the ecosystem services should be as widely and evenly distributed in this case the cost calculated as the integral of the supply over the distance traveled from source to destination is meaningful if the production of a category of ecosystem service is concentrated the equations in this model may not lead to high accuracy third this model applies primarily to medium and small scales and ecosystem services which are mainly produced locally and consumed locally for ecosystem services with distinct off site production or consumption characteristics import and export quantities need to be added to the equations to use this model in addition to theory or structure parameters play a key role that determines the success of a model hritonenko and yatsenko 1999 jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 we must admit that the determination of the parameters of some factors in the example is somewhat subjective however this does not affect the rationality of the model because it can be gradually solved by accumulating experience in future practical applications several key factors in our model can be considered as averages that represent the overall level such as the supply and consumption intensities of ecosystem services although there is almost no ideal uniform distribution in reality using appropriate statistical methods to determine representative values is also one of the methods to improve the accuracy of the model the simplification of the model undoubtedly has advantages and disadvantages real situations are generally more complex than the model we have the following suggestions on how to deal with the difference between model and reality when the difference is relatively small some features of the real situation can be adjusted slightly so that it can take advantage of the model as analysis on the limitations of the model to make complicated situations applicable we need to improve the model irregular shapes and complex positions are most common cases explicit equations are usually impossible to achieve rasterizing the graph and then using accumulation and trial algorithms in supply and demand analysis may be a solution another question is the acquisition cost of ecosystem services this model assumes that the friction is even everywhere and the cost is just determined by the linear distance between the source and movement destination in real situations friction is determined by a variety of factors e g land use or land cover category height slope thus the costs usually vary at different points or areas stillwell and clarke 2004 in such cases the transport routes are no longer straight lines building the resistance surface and planning the cost path is also one of the problems to be solved in the future in addition it should be noted that to make the calculation of the ecological security coefficients concise enough we do not consider imports and exports by default thus the equations can be applied only if the supply is greater than or equal to consumption if supply is less than consumption i e the area of natural ecosystems is less than the supply area then the availability coefficient will be less than one meanwhile for the calculation of the affordability coefficient it is necessary to add the import cost to the acquisition cost admittedly the inclusion of these factors may not be entirely explained in a single paper in the follow up studies we will incorporate more factors to improve this model for example the acquisition cost in the current version of the model is the product of total consumption quantity and unit transport cost which adopts the assumption that the distribution of ecosystem services this can be improved by integrating the transport costs at different locations when considering the non uniform distribution our roadmap is to eliminate the limitations resulted from aggressive or idealized assumptions gradually by replacing the assumptions with practical conditions case studies using real study areas are also one of the main tasks in the next stage finally the definition of ecological security in this paper adopts the anthropocentric perspective the environmental or ecological ethics plays an important role in the definitions of any related concepts cherry 1995 believed that the philosophical perspective can be divided into three categories according to the human s attitude to nature human centric human centric and eclectic the evaluation methods of ecological security are also correspondingly based on the ecological values whether more inclusive definitions and evaluation methods should be adopted may also be one of the topics of future research 5 conclusions this study proposed a new definition of ecological security whether the ecosystem is sufficient to guarantee a certain level of socioeconomic development or quality of life based on this definition we built a simple geometric model using two concentric circles to calculate the ecological security then we gave the expressions of availability coefficient and affordability coefficient through a series of equations derivation and defined the smaller one of them as the final ecological security coefficient the ecological security coefficients of water supply of a hypothetical study area at two different development stages were successfully calculated this demonstrated that the definition of ecological security proposed in this study is reasonable and the corresponding model is applicable although the shapes and locations of cities and natural ecosystems are usually irregular in practice this model can be used under some situations after appropriate simplification or adjustment credit authorship contribution statement

24188,the yaghooti grape is the most important garden product in sistan county sistan and baluchestan province iran and plays a significant role in the region s economy and way of life this novel study employs the emergy ecological footprint method to investigate the sustainability of the yaghooti grape production system towards this end this study employs data collected in 2019 from grape production systems in five cities located in iran s sistan region including zabol zahak hamoun hirmand and nimroz counties using the emergy environmental burden index this study attempts for the first time to quantify the nonrenewable environmental resources that are lost during the production process emergy carrying capacity was calculated to be 3 93e 08 gha for all grape fields in this study the emergy ecological footprint in this study was 1 125e 08 gha the grape production system in this region has an emergy ecological burden of 0 401 and an emergy ecological footprint intensity of 0 286 as a result of its prominent role in environmental protection the production system maintains an ecological surplus does not face significant ecological pressure and is thus ecologically secure despite these positive effects of the production system 1 35e 09 ha of fertile land is unavailable annually in the sistan region due to grape production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural and economic inputs resource efficiency emergy carrying capacity ecological degradation ecological security grape production system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the sistan region is in southeast iran it is located in the northern part of the sistan and baluchestan province in this area agriculture and gardening are limited to irrigated cultivation and the area under cultivation varies across the years based on available water from the hirmand river lombroso et al 2005 the region s harsh climatic conditions have forced farmers to choose suitable crops agricultural activities in this region begin in the autumn or winter and end in the early summer before the environmental stresses become severe this characteristic has earned sistan s yaghooti grapes the region s most important garden product the distinction of being the country s earliest harvested grapes due to the novelty and high marketability of the grape produced in sistan it has become a significant part of the region s economy fanaei and mahmoudzadeh 2019 given the region s limited natural resources especially water focusing exclusively on economic factors can have many consequences for sustainable development as human activities geared toward economic growth threaten ecosystem services bekun et al 2019 all growth and development must be guided by sustainable development which considers both economic and environmental issues bastianoni et al 2001 sustainability is measured in several ways the ecological footprint measures sustainability and humanity s impact on nature by comparing natural resource use to biologically productive area alvarado et al 2021 specifically the ecological footprint quantifies the area of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems needed to provide all consumed resources and absorb all produced emissions during the manufacturing of products cerutti et al 2010 in ecological footprint analysis various land uses are converted to a common unit i e global hectares gha which represents a biologically productive hectare with the world average biological productivity for a given year kharrazi et al 2014 the ecological costs of all consumer goods and services produced during manufacturing and environmental carrying capacity must be considered when assessing sustainability mcdonald and patterson 2004 environmental carrying capacity is the maximum resource use a region can sustain indefinitely without compromising its conservation capacity nakajima and ortega 2016 the ecological footprint is a simple way to determine environmental systems carrying capacity and can reveal human ecosystem interactions pan et al 2019 numerous studies have been conducted worldwide using the ecological footprint several of these studies have been conducted in the agricultural sector and it has been determined that the use of environmentally friendly methods can aid in mitigating the environmental impact of this sector s activities for example feng and zhao 2020 reported that organic agriculture has a smaller carbon footprint water footprint and nitrogen footprint than conventional agriculture they concluded that organic farming had a greater impact on ecological safety in the study area pata 2021 also highlighted the two way connection between agricultural activities and environmental issues in the findings of his study of the bric countries brazil russia india and china from 1971 to 2016 he recommended that these governments promote techniques such as organic farming to reduce environmental pressure for the bric t countries brazil russia india china and turkey it was also recommended that the policymakers manage agriculture through the use of renewable energy as opposed to nonrenewable energy sources recycling agricultural waste increasing sustainable production with long term policy measures and strengthening efforts to reduce pollution levels usman et al 2021 conservation tilling is also an important management technique used to mitigate the negative effects of agricultural activities using conservation tillage iran s wheat production left a smaller carbon footprint than conventional tillage naderi mahdei et al 2015 61 of all grains consumed in iran are wheat and this food group has the second largest footprint in iran after the protein group kouchaki et al 2017 the traditional model of ecological footprint assessment has several flaws including the following 1 it ignores regional differences in ecological advantages and the impact of socioeconomic factors on bio productivity 2 it lacks an accurate calculation of ecological performance for any type of land use 3 it doesn t pay enough attention to greenhouse gas emissions 4 it disregards the ecological performance of unproductive land 5 it disregards the impact of immaterial items 6 it limits the dynamic analysis of ecological flows and 7 ecological footprint doesn t account for socioeconomic factors affecting bio productivity pan et al 2019 to address these flaws researchers have proposed models that combine ecological footprint with other environmental assessment techniques such as using emergy analysis to assess ecological footprint and environmental capacity chen and chen 2006 pan et al 2019 ecologists define environmental capacity as the maximum sustainable use of a region s natural resources over an indefinite period of time without compromising its ability to sustain itself nakajima and ortega 2016 zhao et al 2005 coined the term emergy ecological footprint eef for the first time by combining ecological footprint and emergy in order to illustrate a modified method of calculating ecological footprints that includes emergy analysis the hybrid model better mimics real world conditions such as the contribution of various inputs to the manufacturing process li et al 2019 by assessing the emergy ecological footprint human pressures and the environment s tolerable capacity can be compared peng et al 2018 emergy ecological footprint first measures the impact of human activities and then determines whether those activities exceed or fall within the ecosystem s limits yao et al 2022 water soil and energy are agricultural production sources and conscious and scientific use of these resources ensures their sustainability unfortunately farmers who employ standard agricultural practices exploit these resources to maximize profits considering that agricultural activities are dependent on and have an impact on the environment and also due to the economic effects of agriculture on a large portion of the population giving importance to the issues of sustainability and ecological security ecological security is defined as a state in which the structure function and ecological processes of the ecosystem are not threatened can play a crucial role in the continuation of activities in this sector to evaluate the grape production system the most important garden product in sistan we use the emergy ecological footprint technique this study s findings can help gardeners make informed decisions about natural resource input management to achieve ecological security the purpose of this study is to investigate the sustainability of grape production in the sistan region of iran this study reveals that a substantial amount of fertile production supporting soil was lost due to the improper application of production techniques consequently this conclusion alerts gardeners to the fact that if production management continues in the same manner the sustainability of production will gradually experience difficulties in light of the significance of grapes to the regional economy gardeners can conserve resources and maintain production by modifying traditional techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 the system under study this research looks into the sustainability of the yaghooti grape production system in the sistan region which includes the cities of zabol zahak hamoun hirmand and nimruz the region is located in the southeast of iran and the northern portion of the sistan and baluchestan province with longitudes ranging from 30 50 to 31 28 e and latitudes ranging from 60 15 to 61 50 n and 481 m above sea level fig 1 this region has a hot and dry climate with an average temperature of 22 7 c 1988 2018 36 3 percent humidity 51 4 mm of precipitation and 4683 1 mm of potential evapotranspiration in sistan where agriculture is a major part of the economy low annual rainfall high temperatures and high evapotranspiration combine to create difficult conditions for agriculture farmers in the region have been selecting compatible species and reproducing them for many years relying on indigenous knowledge jahantighi et al 2006 this is demonstrated by the cultivation of yaghooti grapes the region s most important garden product which has played a significant economic role due to its resistance to harsh climatic conditions and optimal timing for leaf emergence and yield with early maturity the region s yaghooti grape production system is traditional and manpower plays a significant role in the processes of weeding spraying and fertilizing this product has a low yield due to factors such as small clusters high compaction and small berries as well as a short active growth period when compared to global and national grape yields fanaei and mahmoudzadeh 2019 2 2 data collection this research is descriptive in terms of control field based in terms of data collection method and a survey type in terms of the generalizability of the findings this study s statistical population comprised all yaghooti grape cultivators in the sistan region s five cities of zabol zahak hirmand hamoun and nimroz face to face interviews with vineyard managers in the sistan region were used to gather data for this study the number of vineyards in the study area was chosen as the study population and cochran s formula was used to determine the sample size cochran 1942 n z 2 p q d 2 1 1 n z 2 p q d 2 1 where the allowable error d is 0 5 and z is 1 96 at a 5 error level the target population has a size of n the sample has a size of n the population s ratio of an attribute is p and the population s percentage of people without that attribute is q 1 p to obtain samples and fill out questionnaires the stratified random method with proportional allocation study areas as classes was utilized and after the computation the number of samples was allotted to each of the research areas as shown in table 1 cochran s formula resulted in a sample size of 282 individuals referring to the sample frame the number of farm owners in each class is then selected at random and the gathering of the necessary data began with the completion of the questionnaires two approaches were used to collect the inputs and outputs of the greenhouse system s inputs and outputs first verbal estimations derived from a questionnaire administered between march 2019 and may 2019 appendix b and second field measurements and observations conducted by the authors within the same time frame it was found that the information provided by the farm manager and crew was accurate because the staff had sufficient work experience and provided detailed information about each production stage in addition to the data acquired from the questionnaires prior studies of the ministry of agricultural jihad of iran maj 2020 including statistics on the area under cultivation and production of yaghooti grape the main yaghooti grape producing areas in sistan and other researchers regarding the parameters of the universal soil loss equation usle model in the country ostovari et al 2016 and sistan afrasiab and delbari 2013 were also incorporated in this study 2 3 emergy ecological footprint assessment eefa the eefa has been proposed to link environmental and economic systems as a result of integrating emergy synthesis and ecological footprint analysis pan et al 2019 the emergy ecological footprint is a better technique for assessing ecological security because it incorporates emergy accounting and avoids any incomplete assessments in conventional ecological footprint analysis li et al 2019 the eefa includes the evaluation of three components the emergy carrying capacity ecc which measures the potential provided by the natural environment to the system the emergy ecological footprint eef which evaluates the amount of non free inputs used in the system peng et al 2018 and the emergy environmental burden eeb which evaluates the contribution of non renewable free environmental inputs for the first time environmental input and free non renewable soil erosion are taken into account as the environmental load index when evaluating the emergy ecological footprint the main steps to evaluate the emergy ecological footprint of the target systems are shown in fig 2 2 3 1 calculation of emergy ecological footprint components emergy carrying capacity ecc is the global average tolerance capacity for the exploitation of renewable resources it refers to an ecosystem that is capable of providing adequate space and resources for human survival zhao et al 2013 eq 1 is used to calculate ecc 1 e c c 1 12 r p 1 where ecc denotes the emergy carrying capacity of the total grape vineyard gha r denotes the emergy of all renewable environmental inputs sej and p1 denotes the annual global emergy density sej m 2 i e the ratio of the amount of emergy transferred across the earth to the area covered by the earth s surface p1 is computed using eq 2 2 p 1 t o t a l e m e r g y o f t h e e a r t h a r e a o f t h e e a r t h 1 20 e 25 sej 5 1 e 14 m 2 2 35 e 10 s e j m 2 the amount of

implement the world commission on environment and development s recommendation to protect biodiversity zhang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 pan et al 2019 renewable inputs include solar energy wind energy chemical and geopotential energy of rain evapotranspiration energy and earth cycle energy appendix a based on emergy theory r sunlight emergy earth cycle emergy maximum renewable environmental emergy the emergy ecological footprint eef reflects the production system s demand for resources and the intensity of resource use the following procedure is used to determine the eef in the grape production systems in the first stage we collect data on all renewable and non renewable inputs both free and purchased fig 3 after converting the above inputs to one of the three units of j g or currency appendix a they are then converted to the integrated unit of sej by multiplying the corresponding transformities unit emergy value per input or uev as determined in previous studies using eq 3 energy inputs ew are converted to the eef 3 eef e w p 2 p2 is the regional emergy density sej m 2 yr 1 which is calculated using eq 4 4 p 2 t o t a l e m e r g y i n s i s t a n a r e a s o f t h e s i s t a

needed to analyze various production systems using the emergy ecological footprint technique were limited to renewable and economical environmental inputs while despite their undeniable contribution to the production process non renewable environmental resources were ignored however because this study is examining an agricultural system whose outputs are highly reliant on non renewable environmental resources it intends to quantify the loss of these valuable resources on a global scale through the use of a new indicator called emergy environmental burden eba the agricultural sector relies on non renewable resources such as soil organic matter and groundwater the impact of agricultural activities on these valuable resources must be investigated this study aims to determine using the eba indicator the amount of these resources lost during the production process the ebe indicator is a novel indicator developed for the purposes of this study and is calculated using eq 5 5 ebe n p 1 where n denotes the nonrenewable inputs and p1 denotes the annual global emergy density 2 3 2 eef based indicators indicators are effective tools for determining the sustainability of a specific area or a production system bockstaller et al 2015 the study will examine indicators including the emergy ecological deficit surplus eed ees the ecological pressure index epi the ecological footprint intensity efi and the ecological and economic coordination index eeci all of which were derived from previous research the effectiveness of environmental emergy capacity eeec and productivity of the emergy ecological footprint peef are being used for the first time in this study table 2 summarizes the mathematical relationships and definitions of the indicators considered in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 eef components of grape production systems the emergy ecological footprint demonstrates the critical nature of protecting natural resources for economic development zhao et al 2013 this study unlike previous ones includes three components ecc which is the global capacity of renewable resources available zhao et al 2013 eef which indicates the intensity of human load peng et al 2018 and eeb which accounts for non renewable environmental resources lost during production fig 4 depicts the structure of the ecological footprint components for the grape production systems in sistan 3 1 1 emergy carrying capacity ecc as a type of potential created by the integration of several ecological factors found in nature the ecc demonstrates an ecosystem s capacity to provide the space and resources necessary for the production of goods and services peng et al 2018 table 3 summarizes the free renewable resources that contribute to the carrying capacity of grape fields in the sistan region wind emergy was used to determine the emergy carrying capacity because it is the largest renewable input among other environmental renewable resources the studied system s emergy carrying capacity was calculated to be 3 93e 08 gha given that the emergy carrying capacity refers to the equivalent of the global average capacity of renewable resources expressed in the form of production support area zhao et al 2013 the grape production system in the sistan region is supported by 3 93e 08 hectares of ecological area 3 1 2 emergy ecological footprint eef the emergy ecological footprint reflects the demand placed on the ecosystem by humans liu et al 2021 for sistan s grape production system the eef was calculated to be 1 125e 08 gha manpower electricity manure seedlings chemical fertilizers pesticides and machinery are all considered inputs that affect eef in this study manpower had the greatest impact on the amount of footprint created in this study agricultural tasks in sistan such as tree pruning weeding and harvesting are typically performed manually along with reducing reliance on chemical pesticides and adapting to the environment manual weeding results in soil crust breaking and aeration however the inefficiency of worker weeding and high worker wages impose significant economic costs on gardeners the second factor affecting the ecological footprint of the grape production system is the environmental cost associated with seedling production phosphorus is the third most common economic input used to improve nutrition in the production system despite the fact that phosphorus is required to produce agricultural products and to achieve optimal yields its exit from the agricultural system and entry into surface water streams results in eutrophication and the formation of low oxygen zones le noe et al 2018 3 1 3 emergy environmental burden environmental load is a term that refers to the area of non renewable natural resources that become unavailable during the manufacturing process in a production system sistan s grape production had an emergy environmental burden of 1 35e 09 gha in other words 1 35e 09 gha of fertile grape growing land has lost its ability to compensate for production related consequences the most significant environmental burden imposed by sistan s grape production systems was soil erosion in agricultural lands factors such as poor agricultural practices rainfall regimes and topographic conditions contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for soil erosion ahmad et al 2020 in addition to affecting soil hydrology and chemical processes gavers et al 2014 agricultural soil erosion can result in surface soil depletion and decreased soil fertility if sediments enter surface water they cause flooding and if they are contaminated with chemicals used in the field they contaminate aquatic organisms and degrade water quality ahmad et al 2020 following soil erosion soil organic matter losses play a significant role organic matter is a critical component of soil because it has significant physical chemical and biological properties organic matter improves water retention capacity soil quality nutrient cycling drainage and soil compaction reddy 2016 organic matter depletion in the soil diminishes or eliminates these properties 3 2 eef based indicators indices can be used to quantify a production system s ecological structural and functional characteristics and contribute to our understanding of resource efficiency and sustainability thus examining eef based indicators via resource assessment can inform farmers about their activities environmental impact table 4 shows the results of eef based indicators in sistan s yaghooti grape production systems 3 2 1 emergy ecological deficiency surplus eed ees this index is calculated as the difference between the ecc and the eef and it quantifies the pressure exerted on the environment by a system during a particular process these indices are used by the system to monitor its use of environmental services and its impact on the environment during production li et al 2019 in terms of a system s eed ees and its sustainability a value greater than zero positive indicates that the system has an ecological surplus and the ecosystem s capacity is sufficient to withstand environmental pressures as a result natural capital in the region exceeds demand and consumption patterns are relatively sustainable if this index is less than zero negative the system has an ecological deficit i e the system s burden has exceeded its ecological capacity and the system s development is unsustainable finally a value of zero indicates a balance between human consumption and ecological capacity pan et al 2019 due to the smaller eef in comparison to the ecc in this study this index is positive 2 805e 08 gha and indicates an ecological surplus indicating that the capacity of the ecosystem to withstand human caused pressures is sufficient furrow irrigation meets the water requirements of grape production systems in the region this method coupled with the close spacing between irrigations results in highwater consumption in a region that is experiencing a water shortage this ongoing trend has a negative impact on carrying capacity resulting in an emergy ecological deficiency therefore water management should be considered in agricultural systems because it increases irrigation water efficiency chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 water management is critical in agriculture without it the millennium development goals for poverty reduction hunger alleviation and a sustainable environment will not be achieved molden 2013 3 2 2 ecological pressure index epi the epi measures how a production system uses natural resources and its reliance on the natural environment the epi is the inverse of the sustainability of regional development and has a value between 0 and 1 the following are the epi evaluation criteria when the epi is less than 0 5 the system s consumption of environmental resources is less than the system s capacity indicating that there is more productive area available to support the production system when epi 0 5 the available renewable resources are in balance with the production system s requirements indicating that the region is on the verge of sustainability when the 0 5 epi 1 the ecological footprint exceeds the emergy carrying capacity indicating that the production system is unsustainable if the epi approaches one socioeconomic development will exacerbate environmental pressures peng et al 2018 in the study area the epi of the grape production system is calculated to be 0 222 due to the emergy ecological surplus the system does not face significant ecological pressure 3 2 3 ecological footprint intensity efi ecological footprint intensity efi quantifies the degree to which a given system exerts pressure on ecosystems li et al 2019 if the eef is less than its carrying capacity the production system is ecologically secure if the opposite is true the production system s demand for resources exceeds the area it can support putting high pressure on ecosystems liu et al 2021 the efi was calculated to be 0 286 in the current study if the efi value is between 0 and 1 the yaghooti grape production system is considered ecologically secure when efi exceeds one the system is unable to achieve ecological safety and when it equals one the system is in ecological equilibrium zhang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 pan et al 2019 as a result the efi value calculated in this study indicates that grape production in the sistan region is ecologically secure as a result because the ecc exceeds the eff the grape production system does not have a significant ecological footprint 3 2 4 economic and ecological coordination index eeci the eeci was developed as a bridge between ecological and economic assessments in order to quantify the degree of coordination between a production system s ecological and economic needs pan et al 2019 this index is calculated as a function of the ecological footprint s intensity and has a value between 1 and 1 414 yang et al 2018 explain the index s results as follows the closer the eeci is to one the less coordination exists the closer the eeci is to 1 414 the more coordination exists and when the eeci equals 1 414 regional ecological demand and supply are in equilibrium and optimally coordinated the eeci value for sistan s yaghooti grape production was 1 24 given that the efi index was between zero and one and the eeci value was close to 1 414 it can be concluded that the studied system s ecological and economic coordination is nearly perfect ecological and economic coordination between 2006 and 2015 revealed that in environmentally hazardous provinces such as shanghai and tianjin the eeci is extremely low ranging between 1 030 to 1 038 and 1 068 to 1 0798 respectively this index is close to its maximum value of 1 414 in the most environmentally safe provinces such as sichuan yang et al 2018 sichuan s advantageous ecological and economic coordination can be attributed to the magnitude of its ecological footprint within the range of ecological security because the range of efi must be determined prior to analyzing the state of coordination systems with efi between zero and one are environmentally safe and their eeci values are close to the maximum the same holds true for grape production in the sistan region because the ecological footprint intensity index value in the studied system was within the range of ecological security between zero and one the calculated eeci was close to 1 414 indicating that the grape production is within ecological capacity 3 2 5 effectiveness of environmental emergy capacity eeec and productivity of emergy ecological footprint peef the eeec and the peef are used to quantify the efficiency of converting free environmental and non free economic inputs into system processes that result in the final product odum 2000 brown and ulgiati 2004 increased eeec and peef values indicate a process s economic and environmental efficiency as they imply a reduced reliance on free environmental or economic resources in the production of the same product the eeec and peef of studied system was calculated as 1 95e 11 and 6 80e 11 sej ha 1 the percentage of natural capital and human economy used in the grape production process in the sistan region is shown in table 2 as shown in this table the total input emergy to the production system is 7 65e 19 sej ha 1 with natural capital accounting for 64 35 of total input emergy and economic inputs accounting for 35 65 of total input emergy thus the high proportion of free inputs indicates that the majority of vineyards in the study are non industrial systems managed in a semi traditional low input fashion 4 conclusion the largest human ecological activity on earth agriculture has negative effects on natural ecosystems wratten et al 2012 therefore a shift in direction towards sustainable agriculture is required notably the sustainability of an agricultural system involves both natural resources such as sunlight and water and economic inputs hercher pasteur et al 2021 although a sustainability oriented system recognizes the necessity of economic development it also recognizes the repercussions of natural resource depletion wratten et al 2012 so it strives to maintain the sustainability of these resources throughout the production process this study demonstrates that by combining emergy analysis and ef accounting it was possible to distinguish the sustainability of the crop production system and the utilization efficiencies of agricultural and natural resources were evaluated by eef based indicators eed ees epi efi eeci eeec and peef using the current case study for sistan iran in 2019 in the meantime the results demonstrated that the various components of the emergy ecological footprint for the studied system in sistan differed significantly the emergy carrying capacity of the studied system was calculated to be 3 93e 08 gha for all yaghooti grape fields in the sistan region thus indicating that this amount of productive area supports the production system the emergy ecological footprint of the grape production system is 1 125e 08 gha and the pressure applied to non renewable resources as an environmental load in this system is 1 35e 09 gha consequently this quantity of fertile land loses its supporting properties during production the study considers the eef based indicators to determine the sustainability of the studied system including emergy ecological deficit and surplus eed ees ecological pressure index epi ecological footprint intensity efi effectiveness of environmental emergy capacity eeec and productivity of emergy ecological footprint peef the results of these indicators demonstrate that the studied system has an emergy ecological surplus due to its greater ecc in comparison to its calculated eef because this system places little strain on the region s ecosystem it enjoys ecological security and thus exhibits a high degree of ecological and economic coordination the capital of renewable environmental support for production exceeds the pressures imposed on the ecosystem by human activity when conducting an eef analysis to assess the sustainability of a system great care must be taken agricultural systems are diverse ecosystems with many complex above and below ground interactions as a result emergy analyses should be utilized in conjunction with other sustainability tools life cycle assessment lca exergy and other combinations e g exergoenvironmental exergoeconomic etc provide a more detailed and precise estimation of the energy flowing within these systems the future use of more comprehensive sustainability assessment tools may necessitate additional monitoring of additional input parameters incorporating these additional parameters into the detailed assessment tool for agricultural systems will provide a comprehensive view of solar energy flow within the system and reduce uncertainty associated with transformability values and the overall assessment of emergy as suggestions for future research implementing the current method for eef analysis with a greater variety of crop types and productive activities at a wider range of spatial scales is strongly recommended in addition to focusing on resource quantity it is essential to investigate the emergy analysis linking resource quality the following are some of the research s limitations in this study a questionnaire was utilized to collect data on the consumption of inputs and outputs as a result some participants may have refused to offer truthful responses or provided inaccurate ones in addition this research was conducted cross sectionally this makes it difficult to draw conclusions on causality the extensive number of questions on the questionnaires increased the time required to collect data and diminished the precision of the participants responses the results of the present research can be applied to the production of ruby grapes in settings comparable to sistan iran and if needed it should be done with prudence and sufficient

24188,the yaghooti grape is the most important garden product in sistan county sistan and baluchestan province iran and plays a significant role in the region s economy and way of life this novel study employs the emergy ecological footprint method to investigate the sustainability of the yaghooti grape production system towards this end this study employs data collected in 2019 from grape production systems in five cities located in iran s sistan region including zabol zahak hamoun hirmand and nimroz counties using the emergy environmental burden index this study attempts for the first time to quantify the nonrenewable environmental resources that are lost during the production process emergy carrying capacity was calculated to be 3 93e 08 gha for all grape fields in this study the emergy ecological footprint in this study was 1 125e 08 gha the grape production system in this region has an emergy ecological burden of 0 401 and an emergy ecological footprint intensity of 0 286 as a result of its prominent role in environmental protection the production system maintains an ecological surplus does not face significant ecological pressure and is thus ecologically secure despite these positive effects of the production system 1 35e 09 ha of fertile land is unavailable annually in the sistan region due to grape production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural and economic inputs resource efficiency emergy carrying capacity ecological degradation ecological security grape production system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the sistan region is in southeast iran it is located in the northern part of the sistan and baluchestan province in this area agriculture and gardening are limited to irrigated cultivation and the area under cultivation varies across the years based on available water from the hirmand river lombroso et al 2005 the region s harsh climatic conditions have forced farmers to choose suitable crops agricultural activities in this region begin in the autumn or winter and end in the early summer before the environmental stresses become severe this characteristic has earned sistan s yaghooti grapes the region s most important garden product the distinction of being the country s earliest harvested grapes due to the novelty and high marketability of the grape produced in sistan it has become a significant part of the region s economy fanaei and mahmoudzadeh 2019 given the region s limited natural resources especially water focusing exclusively on economic factors can have many consequences for sustainable development as human activities geared toward economic growth threaten ecosystem services bekun et al 2019 all growth and development must be guided by sustainable development which considers both economic and environmental issues bastianoni et al 2001 sustainability is measured in several ways the ecological footprint measures sustainability and humanity s impact on nature by comparing natural resource use to biologically productive area alvarado et al 2021 specifically the ecological footprint quantifies the area of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems needed to provide all consumed resources and absorb all produced emissions during the manufacturing of products cerutti et al 2010 in ecological footprint analysis various land uses are converted to a common unit i e global hectares gha which represents a biologically productive hectare with the world average biological productivity for a given year kharrazi et al 2014 the ecological costs of all consumer goods and services produced during manufacturing and environmental carrying capacity must be considered when assessing sustainability mcdonald and patterson 2004 environmental carrying capacity is the maximum resource use a region can sustain indefinitely without compromising its conservation capacity nakajima and ortega 2016 the ecological footprint is a simple way to determine environmental systems carrying capacity and can reveal human ecosystem interactions pan et al 2019 numerous studies have been conducted worldwide using the ecological footprint several of these studies have been conducted in the agricultural sector and it has been determined that the use of environmentally friendly methods can aid in mitigating the environmental impact of this sector s activities for example feng and zhao 2020 reported that organic agriculture has a smaller carbon footprint water footprint and nitrogen footprint than conventional agriculture they concluded that organic farming had a greater impact on ecological safety in the study area pata 2021 also highlighted the two way connection between agricultural activities and environmental issues in the findings of his study of the bric countries brazil russia india and china from 1971 to 2016 he recommended that these governments promote techniques such as organic farming to reduce environmental pressure for the bric t countries brazil russia india china and turkey it was also recommended that the policymakers manage agriculture through the use of renewable energy as opposed to nonrenewable energy sources recycling agricultural waste increasing sustainable production with long term policy measures and strengthening efforts to reduce pollution levels usman et al 2021 conservation tilling is also an important management technique used to mitigate the negative effects of agricultural activities using conservation tillage iran s wheat production left a smaller carbon footprint than conventional tillage naderi mahdei et al 2015 61 of all grains consumed in iran are wheat and this food group has the second largest footprint in iran after the protein group kouchaki et al 2017 the traditional model of ecological footprint assessment has several flaws including the following 1 it ignores regional differences in ecological advantages and the impact of socioeconomic factors on bio productivity 2 it lacks an accurate calculation of ecological performance for any type of land use 3 it doesn t pay enough attention to greenhouse gas emissions 4 it disregards the ecological performance of unproductive land 5 it disregards the impact of immaterial items 6 it limits the dynamic analysis of ecological flows and 7 ecological footprint doesn t account for socioeconomic factors affecting bio productivity pan et al 2019 to address these flaws researchers have proposed models that combine ecological footprint with other environmental assessment techniques such as using emergy analysis to assess ecological footprint and environmental capacity chen and chen 2006 pan et al 2019 ecologists define environmental capacity as the maximum sustainable use of a region s natural resources over an indefinite period of time without compromising its ability to sustain itself nakajima and ortega 2016 zhao et al 2005 coined the term emergy ecological footprint eef for the first time by combining ecological footprint and emergy in order to illustrate a modified method of calculating ecological footprints that includes emergy analysis the hybrid model better mimics real world conditions such as the contribution of various inputs to the manufacturing process li et al 2019 by assessing the emergy ecological footprint human pressures and the environment s tolerable capacity can be compared peng et al 2018 emergy ecological footprint first measures the impact of human activities and then determines whether those activities exceed or fall within the ecosystem s limits yao et al 2022 water soil and energy are agricultural production sources and conscious and scientific use of these resources ensures their sustainability unfortunately farmers who employ standard agricultural practices exploit these resources to maximize profits considering that agricultural activities are dependent on and have an impact on the environment and also due to the economic effects of agriculture on a large portion of the population giving importance to the issues of sustainability and ecological security ecological security is defined as a state in which the structure function and ecological processes of the ecosystem are not threatened can play a crucial role in the continuation of activities in this sector to evaluate the grape production system the most important garden product in sistan we use the emergy ecological footprint technique this study s findings can help gardeners make informed decisions about natural resource input management to achieve ecological security the purpose of this study is to investigate the sustainability of grape production in the sistan region of iran this study reveals that a substantial amount of fertile production supporting soil was lost due to the improper application of production techniques consequently this conclusion alerts gardeners to the fact that if production management continues in the same manner the sustainability of production will gradually experience difficulties in light of the significance of grapes to the regional economy gardeners can conserve resources and maintain production by modifying traditional techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 the system under study this research looks into the sustainability of the yaghooti grape production system in the sistan region which includes the cities of zabol zahak hamoun hirmand and nimruz the region is located in the southeast of iran and the northern portion of the sistan and baluchestan province with longitudes ranging from 30 50 to 31 28 e and latitudes ranging from 60 15 to 61 50 n and 481 m above sea level fig 1 this region has a hot and dry climate with an average temperature of 22 7 c 1988 2018 36 3 percent humidity 51 4 mm of precipitation and 4683 1 mm of potential evapotranspiration in sistan where agriculture is a major part of the economy low annual rainfall high temperatures and high evapotranspiration combine to create difficult conditions for agriculture farmers in the region have been selecting compatible species and reproducing them for many years relying on indigenous knowledge jahantighi et al 2006 this is demonstrated by the cultivation of yaghooti grapes the region s most important garden product which has played a significant economic role due to its resistance to harsh climatic conditions and optimal timing for leaf emergence and yield with early maturity the region s yaghooti grape production system is traditional and manpower plays a significant role in the processes of weeding spraying and fertilizing this product has a low yield due to factors such as small clusters high compaction and small berries as well as a short active growth period when compared to global and national grape yields fanaei and mahmoudzadeh 2019 2 2 data collection this research is descriptive in terms of control field based in terms of data collection method and a survey type in terms of the generalizability of the findings this study s statistical population comprised all yaghooti grape cultivators in the sistan region s five cities of zabol zahak hirmand hamoun and nimroz face to face interviews with vineyard managers in the sistan region were used to gather data for this study the number of vineyards in the study area was chosen as the study population and cochran s formula was used to determine the sample size cochran 1942 n z 2 p q d 2 1 1 n z 2 p q d 2 1 where the allowable error d is 0 5 and z is 1 96 at a 5 error level the target population has a size of n the sample has a size of n the population s ratio of an attribute is p and the population s percentage of people without that attribute is q 1 p to obtain samples and fill out questionnaires the stratified random method with proportional allocation study areas as classes was utilized and after the computation the number of samples was allotted to each of the research areas as shown in table 1 cochran s formula resulted in a sample size of 282 individuals referring to the sample frame the number of farm owners in each class is then selected at random and the gathering of the necessary data began with the completion of the questionnaires two approaches were used to collect the inputs and outputs of the greenhouse system s inputs and outputs first verbal estimations derived from a questionnaire administered between march 2019 and may 2019 appendix b and second field measurements and observations conducted by the authors within the same time frame it was found that the information provided by the farm manager and crew was accurate because the staff had sufficient work experience and provided detailed information about each production stage in addition to the data acquired from the questionnaires prior studies of the ministry of agricultural jihad of iran maj 2020 including statistics on the area under cultivation and production of yaghooti grape the main yaghooti grape producing areas in sistan and other researchers regarding the parameters of the universal soil loss equation usle model in the country ostovari et al 2016 and sistan afrasiab and delbari 2013 were also incorporated in this study 2 3 emergy ecological footprint assessment eefa the eefa has been proposed to link environmental and economic systems as a result of integrating emergy synthesis and ecological footprint analysis pan et al 2019 the emergy ecological footprint is a better technique for assessing ecological security because it incorporates emergy accounting and avoids any incomplete assessments in conventional ecological footprint analysis li et al 2019 the eefa includes the evaluation of three components the emergy carrying capacity ecc which measures the potential provided by the natural environment to the system the emergy ecological footprint eef which evaluates the amount of non free inputs used in the system peng et al 2018 and the emergy environmental burden eeb which evaluates the contribution of non renewable free environmental inputs for the first time environmental input and free non renewable soil erosion are taken into account as the environmental load index when evaluating the emergy ecological footprint the main steps to evaluate the emergy ecological footprint of the target systems are shown in fig 2 2 3 1 calculation of emergy ecological footprint components emergy carrying capacity ecc is the global average tolerance capacity for the exploitation of renewable resources it refers to an ecosystem that is capable of providing adequate space and resources for human survival zhao et al 2013 eq 1 is used to calculate ecc 1 e c c 1 12 r p 1 where ecc denotes the emergy carrying capacity of the total grape vineyard gha r denotes the emergy of all renewable environmental inputs sej and p1 denotes the annual global emergy density sej m 2 i e the ratio of the amount of emergy transferred across the earth to the area covered by the earth s surface p1 is computed using eq 2 2 p 1 t o t a l e m e r g y o f t h e e a r t h a r e a o f t h e e a r t h 1 20 e 25 sej 5 1 e 14 m 2 2 35 e 10 s e j m 2 the amount of energy received by the earth throughout the year includes solar energy geothermal energy and wave energy brown et al 2016 brown and ulgiati 2016 as indicated in eq 2 12 of the ecc is set aside to implement the world commission on environment and development s recommendation to protect biodiversity zhang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 pan et al 2019 renewable inputs include solar energy wind energy chemical and geopotential energy of rain evapotranspiration energy and earth cycle energy appendix a based on emergy theory r sunlight emergy earth cycle emergy maximum renewable environmental emergy the emergy ecological footprint eef reflects the production system s demand for resources and the intensity of resource use the following procedure is used to determine the eef in the grape production systems in the first stage we collect data on all renewable and non renewable inputs both free and purchased fig 3 after converting the above inputs to one of the three units of j g or currency appendix a they are then converted to the integrated unit of sej by multiplying the corresponding transformities unit emergy value per input or uev as determined in previous studies using eq 3 energy inputs ew are converted to the eef 3 eef e w p 2 p2 is the regional emergy density sej m 2 yr 1 which is calculated using eq 4 4 p 2 t o t a l e m e r g y i n s i s t a n a r e a s o f t h e s i s t a n 1 585 e 21 s e j 5 213 e 09 m 2 3 04 e 11 s e j m 2 to avoid double counting the total amount of renewable emergy was assumed to be equal to the highest emergy input prior to this study the data needed to analyze various production systems using the emergy ecological footprint technique were limited to renewable and economical environmental inputs while despite their undeniable contribution to the production process non renewable environmental resources were ignored however because this study is examining an agricultural system whose outputs are highly reliant on non renewable environmental resources it intends to quantify the loss of these valuable resources on a global scale through the use of a new indicator called emergy environmental burden eba the agricultural sector relies on non renewable resources such as soil organic matter and groundwater the impact of agricultural activities on these valuable resources must be investigated this study aims to determine using the eba indicator the amount of these resources lost during the production process the ebe indicator is a novel indicator developed for the purposes of this study and is calculated using eq 5 5 ebe n p 1 where n denotes the nonrenewable inputs and p1 denotes the annual global emergy density 2 3 2 eef based indicators indicators are effective tools for determining the sustainability of a specific area or a production system bockstaller et al 2015 the study will examine indicators including the emergy ecological deficit surplus eed ees the ecological pressure index epi the ecological footprint intensity efi and the ecological and economic coordination index eeci all of which were derived from previous research the effectiveness of environmental emergy capacity eeec and productivity of the emergy ecological footprint peef are being used for the first time in this study table 2 summarizes the mathematical relationships and definitions of the indicators considered in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 eef components of grape production systems the emergy ecological footprint demonstrates the critical nature of protecting natural resources for economic development zhao et al 2013 this study unlike previous ones includes three components ecc which is the global capacity of renewable resources available zhao et al 2013 eef which indicates the intensity of human load peng et al 2018 and eeb which accounts for non renewable environmental resources lost during production fig 4 depicts the structure of the ecological footprint components for the grape production systems in sistan 3 1 1 emergy carrying capacity ecc as a type of potential created by the integration of several ecological factors found in nature the ecc demonstrates an ecosystem s capacity to provide the space and resources necessary for the production of goods and services peng et al 2018 table 3 summarizes the free renewable resources that contribute to the carrying capacity of grape fields in the sistan region wind emergy was used to determine the emergy carrying capacity because it is the largest renewable input among other environmental renewable resources the studied system s emergy carrying capacity was calculated to be 3 93e 08 gha given that the emergy carrying capacity refers to the equivalent of the global average capacity of renewable resources expressed in the form of production support area zhao et al 2013 the grape production system in the sistan region is supported by 3 93e 08 hectares of ecological area 3 1 2 emergy ecological footprint eef the emergy ecological footprint reflects the demand placed on the ecosystem by humans liu et al 2021 for sistan s grape production system the eef was calculated to be 1 125e 08 gha manpower electricity manure seedlings chemical fertilizers pesticides and machinery are all considered inputs that affect eef in this study manpower had the greatest impact on the amount of footprint created in this study agricultural tasks in sistan such as tree pruning weeding and harvesting are typically performed manually along with reducing reliance on chemical pesticides and adapting to the environment manual weeding results in soil crust breaking and aeration however the inefficiency of worker weeding and high worker wages impose significant economic costs on gardeners the second factor affecting the ecological footprint of the grape production system is the environmental cost associated with seedling production phosphorus is the third most common economic input used to improve nutrition in the production system despite the fact that phosphorus is required to produce agricultural products and to achieve optimal yields its exit from the agricultural system and entry into surface water streams results in eutrophication and the formation of low oxygen zones le noe et al 2018 3 1 3 emergy environmental burden environmental load is a term that refers to the area of non renewable natural resources that become unavailable during the manufacturing process in a production system sistan s grape production had an emergy environmental burden of 1 35e 09 gha in other words 1 35e 09 gha of fertile grape growing land has lost its ability to compensate for production related consequences the most significant environmental burden imposed by sistan s grape production systems was soil erosion in agricultural lands factors such as poor agricultural practices rainfall regimes and topographic conditions contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for soil erosion ahmad et al 2020 in addition to affecting soil hydrology and chemical processes gavers et al 2014 agricultural soil erosion can result in surface soil depletion and decreased soil fertility if sediments enter surface water they cause flooding and if they are contaminated with chemicals used in the field they contaminate aquatic organisms and degrade water quality ahmad et al 2020 following soil erosion soil organic matter losses play a significant role organic matter is a critical component of soil because it has significant physical chemical and biological properties organic matter improves water retention capacity soil quality nutrient cycling drainage and soil compaction reddy 2016 organic matter depletion in the soil diminishes or eliminates these properties 3 2 eef based indicators indices can be used to quantify a production system s ecological structural and functional characteristics and contribute to our understanding of resource efficiency and sustainability thus examining eef based indicators via resource assessment can inform farmers about their activities environmental impact table 4 shows the results of eef based indicators in sistan s yaghooti grape production systems 3 2 1 emergy ecological deficiency surplus eed ees this index is calculated as the difference between the ecc and the eef and it quantifies the pressure exerted on the environment by a system during a particular process these indices are used by the system to monitor its use of environmental services and its impact on the environment during production li et al 2019 in terms of a system s eed ees and its sustainability a value greater than zero positive indicates that the system has an ecological surplus and the ecosystem s capacity is sufficient to withstand environmental pressures as a result natural capital in the region exceeds demand and consumption patterns are relatively sustainable if this index is less than zero negative the system has an ecological deficit i e the system s burden has exceeded its ecological capacity and the system s development is unsustainable finally a value of zero indicates a balance between human consumption and ecological capacity pan et al 2019 due to the smaller eef in comparison to the ecc in this study this index is positive 2 805e 08 gha and indicates an ecological surplus indicating that the capacity of the ecosystem to withstand human caused pressures is sufficient furrow irrigation meets the water requirements of grape production systems in the region this method coupled with the close spacing between irrigations results in highwater consumption in a region that is experiencing a water shortage this ongoing trend has a negative impact on carrying capacity resulting in an emergy ecological deficiency therefore water management should be considered in agricultural systems because it increases irrigation water efficiency chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 water management is critical in agriculture without it the millennium development goals for poverty reduction hunger alleviation and a sustainable environment will not be achieved molden 2013 3 2 2 ecological pressure index epi the epi measures how a production system uses natural resources and its reliance on the natural environment the epi is the inverse of the sustainability of regional development and has a value between 0 and 1 the following are the epi evaluation criteria when the epi is less than 0 5 the system s consumption of environmental resources is less than the system s capacity indicating that there is more productive area available to support the production system when epi 0 5 the available renewable resources are in balance with the production system s requirements indicating that the region is on the verge of sustainability when the 0 5 epi 1 the ecological footprint exceeds the emergy carrying capacity indicating that the production system is unsustainable if the epi approaches one socioeconomic development will exacerbate environmental pressures peng et al 2018 in the study area the epi of the grape production system is calculated to be 0 222 due to the emergy ecological surplus the system does not face significant ecological pressure 3 2 3 ecological footprint intensity efi ecological footprint intensity efi quantifies the degree to which a given system exerts pressure on ecosystems li et al 2019 if the eef is less than its carrying capacity the production system is ecologically secure if the opposite is true the production system s demand for resources exceeds the area it can support putting high pressure on ecosystems liu et al 2021 the efi was calculated to be 0 286 in the current study if the efi value is between 0 and 1 the yaghooti grape production system is considered ecologically secure when efi exceeds one the system is unable to achieve ecological safety and when it equals one the system is in ecological equilibrium zhang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 pan et al 2019 as a result the efi value calculated in this study indicates that grape production in the sistan region is ecologically secure as a result because the ecc exceeds the eff the grape production system does not have a significant ecological footprint 3 2 4 economic and ecological coordination index eeci the eeci was developed as a bridge between ecological and economic assessments in order to quantify the degree of coordination between a production system s ecological and economic needs pan et al 2019 this index is calculated as a function of the ecological footprint s intensity and has a value between 1 and 1 414 yang et al 2018 explain the index s results as follows the closer the eeci is to one the less coordination exists the closer the eeci is to 1 414 the more coordination exists and when the eeci equals 1 414 regional ecological demand and supply are in equilibrium and optimally coordinated the eeci value for sistan s yaghooti grape production was 1 24 given that the efi index was between zero and one and the eeci value was close to 1 414 it can be concluded that the studied system s ecological and economic coordination is nearly perfect ecological and economic coordination between 2006 and 2015 revealed that in environmentally hazardous provinces such as shanghai and tianjin the eeci is extremely low ranging between 1 030 to 1 038 and 1 068 to 1 0798 respectively this index is close to its maximum value of 1 414 in the most environmentally safe provinces such as sichuan yang et al 2018 sichuan s advantageous ecological and economic coordination can be attributed to the magnitude of its ecological footprint within the range of ecological security because the range of efi must be determined prior to analyzing the state of coordination systems with efi between zero and one are environmentally safe and their eeci values are close to the maximum the same holds true for grape production in the sistan region because the ecological footprint intensity index value in the studied system was within the range of ecological security between zero and one the calculated eeci was close to 1 414 indicating that the grape production is within ecological capacity 3 2 5 effectiveness of environmental emergy capacity eeec and productivity of emergy ecological footprint peef the eeec and the peef are used to quantify the efficiency of converting free environmental and non free economic inputs into system processes that result in the final product odum 2000 brown and ulgiati 2004 increased eeec and peef values indicate a process s economic and environmental efficiency as they imply a reduced reliance on free environmental or economic resources in the production of the same product the eeec and peef of studied system was calculated as 1 95e 11 and 6 80e 11 sej ha 1 the percentage of natural capital and human economy used in the grape production process in the sistan region is shown in table 2 as shown in this table the total input emergy to the production system is 7 65e 19 sej ha 1 with natural capital accounting for 64 35 of total input emergy and economic inputs accounting for 35 65 of total input emergy thus the high proportion of free inputs indicates that the majority of vineyards in the study are non industrial systems managed in a semi traditional low input fashion 4 conclusion the largest human ecological activity on earth agriculture has negative effects on natural ecosystems wratten et al 2012 therefore a shift in direction towards sustainable agriculture is required notably the sustainability of an agricultural system involves both natural resources such as sunlight and water and economic inputs hercher pasteur et al 2021 although a sustainability oriented system recognizes the necessity of economic development it also recognizes the repercussions of natural resource depletion wratten et al 2012 so it strives to maintain the sustainability of these resources throughout the production process this study demonstrates that by combining emergy analysis and ef accounting it was possible to distinguish the sustainability of the crop production system and the utilization efficiencies of agricultural and natural resources were evaluated by eef based indicators eed ees epi efi eeci eeec and peef using the current case study for sistan iran in 2019 in the meantime the results demonstrated that the various components of the emergy ecological footprint for the studied system in sistan differed significantly the emergy carrying capacity of the studied system was calculated to be 3 93e 08 gha for all yaghooti grape fields in the sistan region thus indicating that this amount of productive area supports the production system the emergy ecological footprint of the grape production system is 1 125e 08 gha and the pressure applied to non renewable resources as an environmental load in this system is 1 35e 09 gha consequently this quantity of fertile land loses its supporting properties during production the study considers the eef based indicators to determine the sustainability of the studied system including emergy ecological deficit and surplus eed ees ecological pressure index epi ecological footprint intensity efi effectiveness of environmental emergy capacity eeec and productivity of emergy ecological footprint peef the results of these indicators demonstrate that the studied system has an emergy ecological surplus due to its greater ecc in comparison to its calculated eef because this system places little strain on the region s ecosystem it enjoys ecological security and thus exhibits a high degree of ecological and economic coordination the capital of renewable environmental support for production exceeds the pressures imposed on the ecosystem by human activity when conducting an eef analysis to assess the sustainability of a system great care must be taken agricultural systems are diverse ecosystems with many complex above and below ground interactions as a result emergy analyses should be utilized in conjunction with other sustainability tools life cycle assessment lca exergy and other combinations e g exergoenvironmental exergoeconomic etc provide a more detailed and precise estimation of the energy flowing within these systems the future use of more comprehensive sustainability assessment tools may necessitate additional monitoring of additional input parameters incorporating these additional parameters into the detailed assessment tool for agricultural systems will provide a comprehensive view of solar energy flow within the system and reduce uncertainty associated with transformability values and the overall assessment of emergy as suggestions for future research implementing the current method for eef analysis with a greater variety of crop types and productive activities at a wider range of spatial scales is strongly recommended in addition to focusing on resource quantity it is essential to investigate the emergy analysis linking resource quality the following are some of the research s limitations in this study a questionnaire was utilized to collect data on the consumption of inputs and outputs as a result some participants may have refused to offer truthful responses or provided inaccurate ones in addition this research was conducted cross sectionally this makes it difficult to draw conclusions on causality the extensive number of questions on the questionnaires increased the time required to collect data and diminished the precision of the participants responses the results of the present research can be applied to the production of ruby grapes in settings comparable to sistan iran and if needed it should be done with prudence and sufficient expertise to generalize to other agricultural systems compliance with ethical standards data available on request due to privacy ethical restrictions credit authorship contribution statement fatemeh

24189,representing about 8 of the world s oceans marine protected areas mpas are effective instruments for mitigating the damage that overfishing can do to ecological and economic systems yet less than 2 of the ocean is proclaimed an exclusive no take zone expecting their number and size to increase significantly in the coming years meticulous implementation of mpas is central to their success using a dynamic game model we explore the impact of designated no take marine reserves on fish stock and on fishing strategies our findings suggest that optimality can be achieved in a context of a combination of three marine zones i e an open access fishery a marine protected area and a fish bank our methodology consists of considering an infinite time horizon discrete fishing game with a migratory species between the three regions we analyze fishing strategies and characterize the model equilibria for different behaviors the fully non cooperative scheme the social optimum and the cartel setting our analytical results are supported by the use of a numerical simulation that compares different scenarios including the current state of the world in contrast to different sizes of mpas and fish bank areas keywords fisheries fish banks marine protected area marine reserves dynamic games data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as much as there has been a surge of interest in the introduction of marine protected areas mpas over the past two decades their coverage of the world s ocean remains modest in terms of both their size and number there are currently just over 18 400 mpas covering nearly 27 million km 2 or roughly 8 of the oceans yet fewer than 2 of the oceans are declared exclusively no take areas in contrast with an estimated 14 growth between 2000 and 2019 in mpas globally those implemented in national jurisdictions account for 17 of national waters with half of the new mpas initiated by either the united states the united kingdom or france other countries that have recently established mpas include australia and new zealand with a 30 increase in area moreover the 20 largest mpas in terms of size cover approximately 70 of all protected areas maestro et al 2019 since less than 2 of the oceans are presently fully protected waters efforts by local communities nations and international organizations to protect them are intensifying a new set of conservation goals calls for the full protection of a minimum of 10 of the world s marine and coastal ecosystems consistent with this trend it is anticipated that an increasing number of mpas will be established in the next decade however an mpa must be carefully designed using an ecosystem approach that incorporates fully and partially protected areas without excluding the right to fish for those whose livelihoods are dependent on the right to access the stocks in this paper we consider an infinite time horizon discrete fishing game with a migratory species between three regions i an open access fishing area with n symmetric players ii a mpa with limited fishing activities that is accessible to only one player iii and a fish bank area where fishing is completely prohibited recognizing that cooperation is environmentally preferable by the society and assuming that the goal of the players is to maximize their respective utilities over an infinite horizon our research aims to answer the following questions 1 what is the combined environmental and financial impact of a fish bank on each region and for each player 2 how does this impact vary across different game modes 3 how does the current state of the world compare to the different possible scenarios to this end we analyze fishing strategies for different behaviors i e a fully non cooperative scheme a social optimum and a cartel setting we characterize the model equilibria and show in terms of the environmental welfare of the resource the positive impact that the introduction of the fish bank can exert on the level of the steady state stocks in the three regions we show that the benefits of designing a fish bank is twofold that is the sustainability of the resource and an increase in income from the additional catching quantities over the time horizon for all fishers as a result of the spillover effect we also show that these results may not be obtained under certain conditions finally in terms of the marine spatial planning it will be concluded that a precautionary approach combining the three regions is capable of achieving environmentally friendly habitat for the resource while maintaining the financial stability of the fishers the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section we review the literature on the implementation of mpas and the game theoretic models dealing with this topic in section 3 we present the model the relevant assumptions the equilibrium steady states levels as well as the characterization of the equilibrium strategies in different game modes i e the feedback nash equilibrium the social optimum and in a cartel context in section 4 we provide a detailed discussion on the impact that the model parameters exert on the obtained solutions section 5 numerically illustrates our results including sensitivity analysis policy implications for various scenarios and a general discussion section 6 concludes and suggests potential future works the computational details are provided in the appendix 2 literature review the open ocean is a treasure chest of biological diversity harboring rich and diverse wildlife and unique species that deliver invaluable support to life on earth sala and giakoumi 2018 however continuous man made disturbances are jeopardizing the capacity of the ocean to perform these functions and have prompted a renewed interest in the development of a global system of mpas including the expansion of the mpa network sala et al 2021 as a result of the devastating decline of fish stocks in many parts of the world palomares et al 2020 a growing number of scientists economists and international environmental organizations are increasingly calling for action on the plight of global marine resources srinivasan et al 2012 fao 2020 after decades of negatively impacting biodiversity this alarming situation is no longer subject only to reduced catch levels early contributions concluded on how paramount it is that the practice of fishing be limited both in terms of fishing grounds and the right to access them ostrom et al 1992 ostrom 1990 clark et al 2010 although landings may be affected in the short term spatial limitation will fortunately not reduce the stocks available to fishers in the long run because despite prejudice it will help restore the biomass and create a more sophisticated marine ecosystem that will allow better access to larger quantities of fish in the future for example a study by marshall et al 2019 has found that on average and depending on the species studied fish reproduction in mpas is estimated to be five times that of an open access fishing area sala et al 2016 presents a pro forma business plan on the sustainable and economically profitable management of the fish banks witnessing an equivalent increase of 446 in fish biomass within just a decade when compared to non protected adjacent areas in a joint investment format the authors assign a recreational role to these closed areas where fishers are designated as stakeholders by the government to offset reduced catches the biological effect of fully protected marine reserves and their comparison with partially protected areas has been studied by lester and halpern 2008 and lester et al 2009 most scientists and practitioners argue that protected areas can play a key role in achieving this objective by providing a buffer zone where the ecosystem can regenerate and through spillover processes benefit the fishery a number of studies have been published in the literature demonstrating the spillover effect of an exclusive no take marine area for a full meta analytical evaluation of this phenomenon we refer the reader to di lorenzo et al 2020 however protected areas are not a panacea in the sense that it is necessary to also regulate fishing beyond the boundaries of the protected area on this point this paper provides an interesting modeling framework combining spatiality optimality steady states and game components recognized as the most effective class of mpas the establishment of an exclusively no take zone will create a marine recovery ground for species away from the fishing industry thereby creating healthy viable fish stocks and in turn increasing catches in a long term sustainable manner sala and giakoumi 2018 to date the demonstrated merits of mpas as an environmentally conscious instrument have been significantly underutilized for a variety of factors including the high cost of implementation mccrea strub et al 2011 the lack of patience on the part of fishers sumaila 2021 and the short sightedness of local authorities sala et al 2016 if hastings and botsford 1999 discusses why making marine reserves the preferred management approach janmaat 2005 shows that the tragedy of the commons can be magnified when economic agents are bound to harvest a renewable resource within a fixed geographic area other notable contributors to the design of the marine reserve include herrera et al 2016 sanchirico 2004 sanchirico and wilen 2002 costello and polasky 2008 hastings and botsford 1999 linh son et al 2014 cabral et al 2019 the use of strategic interaction frameworks in the context of fisheries spatial limitations has been broadly applied in the literature for example costello et al 2015 investigated an interaction between an open access and an owned area but does not count for the marine reserve a recent study costello and molina 2021 discusses two countries sharing the same marine reserve the overall study focuses on how the marine reserve can mitigate incentives for overextraction in the game takashina et al 2017 is closely related to our paper particularly in understanding the role of cooperation in implementing effective and successful mpas in a simplified non cooperative model their results argue in favor of a need for regulatory agreements to overcome the tragedy of the commons in our quest for answers we opt for an extended version of the model presented in mazalov and rettieva 2010 while they considered a two player two region game where the regulator incentivizes the maintenance of cooperation through a punishment method the model we propose differs in two aspects first from an ecological point of view three fish population dynamics are involved in the analysis including parameters that reflect the natural reproduction of fish the migratory impact between a pair of the three regions and their respective sizes second in terms of strategic interactions we adhere to the open access fishing method in the region with n players and the regulator is only involved in the restrictions that concern the partially protected area at this level it is noteworthy to mention that the objective of this paper is to isolate the ecological and economic effects of the fish bank size hence for the economic section of the analysis the logarithmic utility function is retained for its proven accuracy in the game theory literature as well as for its role in easing the calculations fischer and mirman 1992 1996 breton and keoula 2012 2014 fesselmeyer and santugini 2013 breton et al 2019 doyen et al 2018 dahmouni et al 2023 finally the contribution of our paper to the literature is twofold first it is the first study to address this issue from a game theoretic perspective which is an important approach for dealing with this topic given the strategic interactions of the fishers and given that the majority of the articles on marine reserves in the literature assume a single owner of the fishery this assumption is problematic for two reasons i in most dynamic models a single owner cannot gain much from a mpa because a rational agent is supposed to be fishing at an appropriate level ii most fisheries in the world at least those where mpas are being considered are not owned by a single owner the second contribution can be grasped by the novelty in the mathematical modeling i e since the seminal paper by levhari and mirman 1980 no study has treated all three regions in a single model an extension in this direction was missing and so this paper fills these gaps 3 a markovian discrete time model with migratory species consider a discrete time model with migration of a single species fishery with n 1 players the fish habitat is normalized to 1 and divided into three distinct areas an open access fishing area q a marine protected area with limited fishing opportunities r and a completely banned fish bank area s we denote by q r and s their respective sizes with q r s 1 and q r s 0 1 3 area q is exploited by n players in a perfect competition setting while the single player s catch in the r area is controlled and set at a socially acceptable environmental level 1 1 we consider a representative agent holding a license to operate in area r this player can be a single fisherman or a cooperative fishing coalition such as a local community that fishes together as a group when s 1 the fishing activity is totally forbidden whereas q 1 corresponds to the case where the players have access to the entirety of the fishing area and the restrictions are nonexistent in the absence of human activity the growth rate of the fish species in each area is defined by the following dynamics 1 x t 1 x t α 1 y t x t q β 1 z t x t q γ 1 x 0 x y t 1 y t α 2 x t y t r β 2 z t y t r γ 2 y 0 y z t 1 z t α 3 x t z t s β 3 y t z t s γ 3 z 0 z where x t 0 y t 0 and z t 0 are respectively the size of the population in the q r and s areas in period t the initial conditions x y and z are given following mazalov and rettieva 2010 the parameters α l 0 1 are the reproductive rates of fish species within the same area while β l 0 1 and γ l 0 1 are the migration coefficients between pairs of the three areas with l 1 2 3 restricting migration coefficients to strictly positive values ensures that fish will indeed move between areas the migration effect is represented by the ratio of stock sizes when this ratio is equal to 1 the population size is similar in both areas and therefore no fish will migrate between them a graphical illustration of the model is provided in fig 1 the utility of a player i 1 n operating in the q area at period t is given by the logarithmic form u i t l n c i t with 0 c i t x t k i n 1 c k t his catch at time t fischer and mirman 1992 1996 in the r area we respectively denote by c j t y t and u j t l n λ c j t the catch and the utility of player j in order to restrict the activities of player j we use the parameter λ 0 1 as the enforced portion of the total catch that is allowed to be landed on the shore 2 2 parameter λ can have different interpretations including seasonal restrictions on the number of days allowed for fishing or restrictions on the fishing effort such as the number of vessels the number of employees on board the financial expenditures the type of engine gear used the size of nets etc in the context of human activities each player maximizes the sum of her discounted utility over the infinite time horizon using the discount factor 0 δ 1 such as 2 j m t max c m t t 0 δ t u m t t m i j subject to 3 x t 1 x t i n c i t α ˆ 1 y t c j t β ˆ 1 z t γ ˆ 1 y t 1 x t i n c i t β ˆ 2 y t c j t α ˆ 2 z t γ ˆ 2 z t 1 x t

can be interpreted as the overall replication parameter once the borders between regions have been established note that these parameters are increasing with the α l parameters and decreasing with both the size of the same region and the migration coefficients β l and γ l for l 1 2 3 in contrast the parameters β ˆ l and γ ˆ l are respectively positively correlated with the migration coefficients β l and γ l whereas being increasing functions with respect to the size of the corresponding area we assume a markov information scheme where each player observes the state of the game in each period i e the decisions of the other players and the state of the fish stock in each area we solve the model for three scenarios i e n a fully non cooperative solution where the n 1 players individually seek their feedback nash equilibrium strategies c a fully cooperative solution where n 1 players coordinate their catches by jointly maximizing the sum of their discounted utilities over the infinite time horizon and setting k in which the n players form a cartel and cooperatively exploit the q area while playing noncooperatively against the only player in area r as explained above the purpose of examining these scenarios is twofold on the one hand to dissect the effect of the model s parameters and the implication of biological externalities and on the other hand to highlight the territorial externalities induced by the resizing of each region under study our ecological analysis is based on the steady state levels x y z of the fish stock in each region as a consequence of the players fish landings however the economic analysis is undertaken in terms of the value function which depends on the state variables 3 1 assumptions characterizing the different equilibria in such a model is not a straightforward process and requires strong assumptions regarding the behavior of players during their fishing activities on top of that additional restrictions on the biological behavior of the fish are needed to develop the comprehensive framework of the upcoming solutions the following assumptions are therefore necessary for our analysis 1 α l β l γ l l 1 2 3 we assume that the natural birth rate in each region accounts for a much larger contribution to the succeeding generation than the increase in the total number of stocks due to the migration effect consequently we have α ˆ l β ˆ l γ ˆ l 0 1 3 2 α l β l γ l 1 l 1 2 3 we guarantee that the unique positive steady state level is maintained when no fishing activity occurs i e x y z 1 1 1 as the degree of saturation of the fish species in its natural habitat 3 i 1 n c i μ i x and c j μ j y the interpretation of these linear forms is that the total catch in each region is defined by a share μ m 0 1 m i j of the available stock 4 μ i i 1 n ϵ i and c i ϵ i x the n symmetric players in the q region evenly share the total catch 3 2 steady states we initiate our analysis with the characterization of the steady state values as demonstrated in proposition 1 below first let us denote q ˆ 1 ā c d 1 c d q ˆ 2 b ē c 1 c d r ˆ 1 1 ā β ˆ 2 d γ ˆ 2 1 c d 1 α ˆ 2 r ˆ 2 β ˆ 2 b ē c γ ˆ 2 ē b d α ˆ 2 1 c d 1 c d 1 α ˆ

fishing strategies μ m 0 1 m i j the steady state level of the fish stocks in each region is given by 4 x 1 μ i q ˆ 1 1 λ μ j q ˆ 2 y 1 μ i r ˆ 1 1 λ μ j r ˆ 2 z 1 μ i s ˆ 1 1 λ μ j s ˆ 2 proof see the appendix remark 1 note that under assumption 2 1 1 1 is a stable steady state when μ m 0 m i j the solution in proposition 1 specifies the general formula by which the fish stock will be sustained in each region in the long term this specific form will vary depending on the level of fishing behavior according to the mode of play that the players choose to adopt as for the shares μ m they are adversely impacting these steady state levels however this impact is slowed by the λ parameter a detailed analysis about this effect is postponed to a subsequent section next we consider behavior in the context of non cooperation cooperation and cartel 3 3 feedback nash equilibrium suppose that each player is individually deciding on her strategies while considering other players catches in addition each agent observes the size of each region and the number of players n therefore given the definition of her utility function player m s maximization problem is given by 5 m a x c m v m t 0 δ t u m t m i j subject to 3 proposition 2 the total catch in a noncooperative setting is given by the couple of shares μ i n μ j n of the available resource stocks respectively x y such as μ i n x μ

b j n γ ˆ 3 c j n ln 1 λ μ j n the constants ρ m n θ m n ω m n are given in the appendix for m i j proof see appendix the results in the above proposition lead to the following remarks first the strategies are constants and consequently the catches are linear in the fish stock a result that is expected under assumptions 3 and 4 second the optimal catch of agent m i j corresponds to the situation where there is indifference between the marginal utility of consuming a unit of fish in the current period and the marginal utility of deferring this consumption to the next period this comment is well described by the form of the first order conditions in eqs b 5 and b 10 third a decrease in the ecological parameter α ˆ 1 as a result of an increase in α 1 or a decrease in parameters q β 1 or γ 1 increases the rate at which fish reproduce resulting in increased catch for player i 1 n the reason for this effect is that the value of uncaught fish drops the latter comment is valid for player j when considering an increase in α 2 or a decrease in parameters r β 2 or γ 2 3 4 social optimum consider now that all players are jointly coordinating their fishing strategies by forming a coalition that involves the n 1 members i 1 n and j the maximization problem for the joint coalition is given by 9 m a x c i c j v t 0 δ t i 1 n u i t u j t subject to 3 proposition 3 the total catch in a cooperative setting is given by the couple of shares μ i c μ j c of the available resource stocks respectively x y such as μ i c x μ j c y i 1 n c i c c j c assuming symmetric players the players optimal strategies are given by 10 μ i c n 2 n 2 δ α ˆ 1 a c β ˆ 2 b c β ˆ 3 c c 11 μ j c 1 λ 1 δ β ˆ 1 a c α ˆ 2 b c γ ˆ 3 c c player m s value function is given by 12 v m c x y z a c ln x b

β ˆ 1 a c α ˆ 2 b c γ ˆ 3 c c ln 1 λ μ j c the constants ρ 1 c ρ 2 c θ 1 c θ 2 c ω c are given in the appendix proof see appendix having a similar form to the non cooperative solution the same comments are offered for the cooperative strategies in the above proposition nevertheless it should be mentioned that the main difference is that the coalition incorporates the dynamic externality i e each player will consider the size of the coalition this behavior is reflected in the appearance of the parameter n in a very clear way in the expression of player i s strategies and through the parameters of the value functions for both types of players included in the grand coalition indeed the effect of an increase in the number of players will more affect the strategies of a cooperative player than the non cooperative one however it will less affect the steady states levels 3 5 cartel solution now suppose that the n players fishing in area q decide to form a cartel against the fishers in area r by unilaterally deciding on their fishing strategies they seek to maximize the sum of their discounted utilities while the remaining player continues to play à la nash the system of maximization problems in this context is given by 13 m a x c i i 1 n v i t 0 δ t i 1 n u i t i 1 n m a x c j v j t 0 δ t u j t subject to 3 proposition 4 the total catch in a cartel setting is given by the couple of shares μ i k μ j k of the available resource stocks respectively x y such as μ i k x μ j k y i 1 n c i k c j k assuming the n players to be symmetric the optimal strategies are given by 14 μ i k n 2 n 2 δ α ˆ 1 a i k β ˆ 2 b i k β ˆ 3 c i k 15 μ j k 1 λ 1 δ β ˆ 1 a j k α ˆ 2 b j k γ ˆ 3 c j k player m s value function is given by 16 v m k x y z a m k ln x b m k ln y c m k ln z d m

proof see appendix again the solution here has a similar form to the previous ones so we will refrain from duplicating the same remarks in a few words this result is interesting to highlight the advantage of extending coordination in particular by comparing this scenario with the cooperative case one will be able to examine this benefit at a higher level for example by discussing the case where all actors are involved in the action of saving the fish stock including those with access to different fishing grounds and jurisdictions this implies that careful implementation of mpas requires accompanying policies to mitigate competition among fishers operating in surrounding areas takashina et al 2017 4 impact of the model parameters to understand how the critical aspects of the problem in particular the size of each region the biological parameters and the degree of cooperation affect the levels of the stock at the equilibrium as well as the previously derived strategies we present in this section the general forms of the mathematical expressions associated with this impact proposition 5 provides the impact that the biological parameters as well as the fishing intensities will have on the values of the equilibrium steady states whereas proposition 6 defines the effect of the spatial parameters q r s on the fishing intensity μ m m i j proposition 5 i the impact of the fishing intensity on the steady state levels in each region is given by 17 x μ i q ˆ 1 x 1 μ i x μ j λ q ˆ 2 x 1 λ μ j y μ i r ˆ 1 y 1 μ i y μ j λ r ˆ 2 y 1 λ μ j z μ i s ˆ 1 z 1 μ i z μ j λ s ˆ 2 z 1 λ μ j ii the impact of the ecological parameters on the steady state levels is given by 18 x ν x ln 1 μ i q ˆ 1 ν ln 1 λ μ j q ˆ 2 ν x μ i μ i ν x μ j μ j ν y ν y ln 1 μ i r ˆ 1 ν ln 1 λ μ j r ˆ 2 ν y μ i μ i ν y μ j μ j ν z ν z ln 1 μ i s ˆ 1 ν ln 1 λ μ j s ˆ 2 ν z μ i μ i ν z μ j μ j ν where ν α ˆ l β ˆ l γ ˆ l for l 1 2 3 the first result of proposition 5 implies that under the assumption of non negativity of the parameters q ˆ l r ˆ l s ˆ l steady states decrease with fishing intensity regardless of who is fishing where for example fishing in area q will have a negative impact on all three areas similarly the direct effect that fishing in the r area will have on the levels of all steady states is negative but not as harmful as the previous one due to the regulation scheme of the mpa under the λ parameter intuitive as it is this result raises the prospect that increasing the size of the r area to the detriment of the q area could have a positive effect on the sustained level of fish stocks in the long run likewise the same insight can be concluded with respect to increasing the size of the fish bank area s the second result of proposition 5 presents the effect of biological parameters on steady state levels the aggregate effect of a decrease increase in fish reproductive capacity as well as a change in migration frequency is ambiguous since the two effects can point in contrary directions therefore this effect depends on the bilateral magnitude of the two impacts table 1 provides an example on the sign of some key terms in the system 18 using the same parameter constellations as for the numerical simulation in the next subsection proposition 6 let ξ q r s and m n k with n 1 when m n the impact of spacial parameter values on the optimal fishing strategies is given by 19 μ i m ξ δ α ˆ 1 ξ 1 ω i m β ˆ 2 ξ ρ i m ω i m β ˆ 3 ξ θ i m ω i m n 2 δ α ˆ 1 a i m β ˆ 2 b i m β ˆ 3 c i m 2 20 μ j m ξ δ β ˆ 1 ξ ρ j m ω j m α ˆ 2 ξ 1 ω j m γ ˆ 3 ξ

1 ω c θ 2 c ξ proof the results in propositions 5 and 6 are obtained by simple and straightforward calculations as complicated as they may seem the equations in the above proposition invite the following simplification the denominators are positive in all cases so examining the overall impact that the explicit spatial parameters will have on fishing intensity will depend on the sign of the numerators again as in proposition 5 the global effect is ambiguous and the different terms in each equation may have different signs this is not bad news for our analysis as the decision to fish more or less intensively will not only depend on the biological parameters but also on the size of each region table 2 illustrates this ambiguity in addition in the next subsection we will provide some examples showing effects with different signs 5 numerical simulation in this section we numerically evaluate the impact of the variations of some of the major variables on the results of the previous sections the purpose of this task is to understand the distinct contribution of each of them on fishing strategies and consequently on equilibrium levels to streamline the presentation we first analyze the impact of the bio economic parameters then we separately study the impact of the geographical parameters r q and s under different scenarios our baseline scenario consists of the following values n 5 α 1 0 52 α 2 0 56 α 3 0 6 β 1 0 2 β 2 0 269 β 3 0 2 γ 1 0 11 γ 2 0 12 γ 3 0 2 λ 0 75 δ 0 95 x 0 0 1 y 0 0 1 z 0 0 1 q 0 9056 r 0 0759 and s 0 0185 this constellation of parameters is based on a combination of proxies for real world conditions with a calibration process that ensures compliance with all our assumptions for example we choose a small number of actors that is sufficiently representative as most fisheries are shared among a small number of regions or countries top five countries catches count for more than 60 of the global catch fao 2020 in addition our choice of α 1 α 2 α 3 reflects the fact that fish are more successful at spawning when they relocate farther away from fishing areas where habitat disturbance is more frequent marshall et al 2019 migration coefficients are assumed to have the following relationship β 1 β 2 γ 2 γ 3 and γ 1 β 3 these choices provide the fish dynamics with a specific migration preference property in this sequence q r s boerder et al 2019 the λ parameter is set to approximate similar situations where the mpa rule is to prohibit fishing during three months of the year or where there exists a mandate to deploy only 75 of the fishing effort throughout the year such as the chinese summer moratorium in south china sea ding et al 2021 parameters q r and s are real numbers from the april 2019 world database of protected areas wdpa unep wcmc and iucn 2019 moreover these choices are driven by some of the counterintuitive findings that we will be addressing in the scenarios outlined below 5 1 sensitivity analysis we run the model for t 0 20 time interval represented by the x axis in the figures below our base case calculations return the following steady state values approximations x n 0 1379 x k 0 2291 x c 0 3120 y n 0 2394 y k 0 2618 y c 0 4925 z n 0 9228 z k 0 9408 z c 0 9544 at first glance two major but not surprising remarks can be deduced from these findings first the mode of play of the n open access players is crucial in defining the sustained level of the fish stock in all regions this result follows from the fact that cooperative solutions dominate cartel solutions which in turn dominate nash solutions second in the long run regardless of the mode of play adopted by the actors the level of the resource will be higher in the fish bank area and lower in the open access area fig 2 shows a comparison of the trajectories associated with all game modes under two different starting conditions the results show that even with a weaker starting condition our base case we can still observe more of the long term resource in particular in the fish bank region and especially when players jointly maximize their payoffs than when they play à la nash furthermore the fish bank is consistently seeing high levels of the resource nearing the saturation level next we perform comparative statics to understand the impact on the state and control variables of altering each of the parameter values relative to our baseline scenario to save space we will only display the cases of cooperation as the other game modes have a similar pattern preserving the same relationship presented in fig 2 first we focus on the impact of the non biological parameters of the model i e the number of players n the discount factor δ and the enforcement parameter λ their effects are illustrated in fig 3 where we vary the values of n from 1 to 10 players the values of δ from 0 78 to 0 95 and values of λ from 0 5 to 0 68 changes in the number of players have a significant effect on long term steady state values and fishing strategies indeed a larger number of players induces the open access players to catch more almost everything and the single player in the mpa area to catch significantly less the results are reflected in the fish stock levels where there is a decrease in the resource level in the q region and an increase in its level in the r region the level of the resource in the fish bank region slightly decreases with more players as some fish will escape to region q where more space is available to them the main findings from the impact of varying the δ and λ parameter levels are i the higher their values the weaker the r region player s fishing strategies ii while the strategies of the n players in the q region remain stable iii the steady state levels are higher in the q and r regions iv while the impact on their level in the s region is absent these observations are due on the one hand to the fact that the increase in the discount factor is accompanied by a greater value allocated to the stock of future resources as compared to the current stock by all players on the other hand allowing the player in the r region to keep more fish will decrease his fishing intensity since we are in a cooperative setting now we turn to the biological coefficients first the impact of an increase in the reproduction parameters α l is presented in fig 4 with l 1 2 3 we vary the parameter α 1 from 0 42 to 0 69 the parameter α 2 from 0 42 to 0 6 and the parameter α 3 from 0 48 to 0 57 the impact of α 1 is reflected in a decrease in the fishing strategies of all the players resulting in a decrease in the steady state of region q and an increase of the steady state of region r a possible explanation of these phenomena is that with region s almost saturated fish from region q will escape to region r as their biomass grow resulting in more stock for this region this is also making the player in region r catch less to comply with cooperative behavior as there is less fish in region q furthermore the effect of the α 2 parameter prompts almost the same comments as those made for the q region nevertheless with less catch from the r region player we observe no shift in the strategies of the n players this is mainly caused by the fact that the n players will be seeing some of the fish coming from the r region resulting in a stable stock of fish and stable fishing strategies furthermore we note that none of these parameters have a significant effect on the level of steady states in the fish bank region due to its heavy population levels the parameter α 3 has however no significant effect on our model second the impact of the migration coefficient β l and γ l is displayed in figs 5 and 6 we vary the parameter β 1 from 0 11 to 0 2 the parameter β 2 from 0 12 to 0 3 the parameter β 3 from 0 01 to 0 19 the parameter γ 1 from 0 07 to 0 25 the parameter γ 2 from 0 01 to 0 145 and the parameter γ 3 from 0 11 to 0 2 an increase in the level of the β 1 parameter is accompanied by a decrease in the strategies of the r region player and an increase in the strategies of the n players we also observe an increase in stocks in both regions coupled with no change in the fish bank area this is due to the escapement of fish from the r region to the q region resulting in less fishing for the mpa player and an increase in available fishing resources for the n players who fish more because there is much more fish in both regions another parameter with a significant impact recorded is the γ 1 parameter increasing its values will cause an increase in the strategies of all players we also witness a jump in the long term stock level in the q region this is probably due to more fish moving from the s region to the q region and de facto the mpa player has more freedom to catch more fish again no significant effect was observed regarding the level of the fish in the fish bank region finally the parameters β 2 β 3 γ 2 and γ 3 do not have a significant impact on our model so we will refrain from making any comments related to them finally we admit that some of the elements of the sensitivity analysis and some of the conclusions to come are not mainstream and puzzling to the reader as mentioned earlier this was one of the motivations for choosing this set of parameters for our illustrative example the role of this exercise is to raise awareness of the naïve practices behind some policy implementations we will elaborate on this in more detail below 5 2 policy implications in this subsection we will outline a few scenarios that are worth considering the idea here is to address the relative strength of different policies while concluding on the most successful way to implement a marine reserve mandate our analysis has clearly shown that not all mpa or fish bank sizes achieve the desired results below are some possibilities and ideas on how to take advantage of this model we start by running the model in business as usual mode for 10 periods and then in the eleventh period we consider that a new policy has been announced regarding the size of each region no fishing thus far we have assumed the hypothesis that this scenario has the potential to be achieved we have made this assumption concrete by allowing the lower bound on fishing strategies from being zero most interestingly we have arranged for the entire marine basin to be an s area when setting s 1 intriguing as it may seem one might infer that if fishing strategies are reduced to zero maintaining the role of the fishing ground as a fish bank is still essential to the recovery of the fish stock in most pessimistic cases in fact depending on how the game is played beforehand it may take more or less time to rebuild the stock but one thing is certain the stock will fully recover in the long term reaching steady state values equivalent to those in our model without human activities larger mpa we now examine how the previously calculated solutions vary with a larger size of the r region recall that our baseline scenario reflects the current state of the world where no more than 7 59 in 2019 of the world s marine oceans are designated as mpas from fig 7 we can draw the following conclusion if the mpa size is at best half of the entire marine basin i e r 0 5 then the resource level will significantly decrease with the exception of the cooperative solution in the q and s regions where increased biomass can be witnessed in fact this result is due to a greater decrease in the fishing strategies of the n players compared to the decrease in the strategies of the single player in the mpa technically this will result in a shift of fish to locations with the highest chance of survival larger fish bank as with the previous scenario we have worked so far with a fish bank size equivalent to 1 85 of the world ocean according to the same source to make this scenario comparable to the previous one we have similarly represented a situation where 50 of the ocean is a fish bank as shown in fig 8 the results show that the long term resource stocks have the same shape in the q and r regions for both the cartel and nash solutions with minor changes considered as insignificant moreover there is a considerable jump in these values for the cooperative solution in quantitative terms these changes are accompanied by a decrease in resource levels in the fish bank area this is because overall with these new adjustments there are more fish available throughout the basin and the n 1 players are catching more fish which in turn force fish to be maintained at a lower level this is good news again as we are witnessing a case where the fish bank is fulfilling its role of feeding other areas with more fish resulting in more caught fish for all players larger mpa and larger fish bank under this scenario we consider another albeit somewhat idealistic alternative what if by increasing the size of the fish bank we allow the creation of a larger mpa additionally we ask the next question does the outcome change dramatically with different rates of mpa increase we therefore consider with s 0 5 two cases r 0 1 displayed in the upper graphs of fig 9 and r 0 3 in the lower part of the same figure it is easy to notice that different results occur in the two cases however the main conclusions of this scenario are i with a smaller increase in mpa stock levels are larger in the q and r regions ii this increase in the q region s stock is larger under r 0 1 than under r 0 3 iii a larger increase in the size of the mpa resulted in worse cases for its stocks in all game modes even for the cooperative solution which shows a slight decrease iv finally the impact on the stocks of the fish bank is not different from the previous scenarios these results lead us to study the effect of varying the two variables simultaneously r and s see figs 11 and 12 smaller mpa and larger fish bank our final scenario is probably the one with the most intriguing and counterintuitive results while we envision an increase in the area of the fish bank we also assume a decrease in the mpa area in reality such a scenario is likely to occur when the policy maker decides to make most of the mpa a marine reserve exclusively closed to fishing in pursuit of a much larger fish bank here we execute the model with the following values r 0 01 and s 0 5 as in the previous scenarios this policy will result in many changes as displayed in fig 10 however the resource stock will increase remarkably and more interestingly for all types of strategies undertaken by the players 5 3 discussion 5 3 1 strategic considerations fish banks serve as an important element in the conservation of marine resources however it must not be blindly practiced as a one size fits all policy fisheries management that does not embrace a systemic approach by taking into account the biological and behavioral interactions of the surrounding areas and the activities that take place in them is most likely doomed to failure the first step in meeting this challenge is a broad assessment of each party s interest which is most naturally complemented by the application of cooperation among all parties and not just in terms of open access the grand coalition must encompass all actors involved in fishing the same resource here a specific mention to those who fish in an mpa their commitment to cooperative behavior is as important as anyone else s in this economy the second key step would be to understand in depth the biological behavior of the species including its breeding habits migration routes and mutual relationships with predators and prey in other words the behavior of a fishery in a well balanced biodiversity is indeed much easier to forecast and therefore to be managed most of our results were shaped around the values of the model parameters and their relative ratios while we cannot disavow that other numerical illustrations can be readily made to further hone the above sensitivity analysis the qualitative contribution we are seeking is already evident with our example the cascade effect is illustrated in figs 11 and 12 on the one hand the impact of the simultaneous increase in the size of the mpa and the fish bank is negative on the steady state values in the mpa on the other hand while the increase in the size of the fish bank is insignificant on the steady state values in the same region an increase in the mpa will have a negative impact on its values most interestingly the impact in the open access region only decreases with smaller values of r and s steady state values recover with much larger mpa and fish banks fig 11 moreover we observe other interesting results in fig 12 where the impact of varying the variables r and s on fishing strategies results in an increase in player strategies in the mpa area the n players however in the open access zone see a significant decrease in their catching rates in summary the main contribution we advocate is that continued increases in the size of an exclusively closed marine area do not necessarily result in substantial change unless the primary area of the fish bank is distant from the fishing area in the most practical scenario where the fish bank is not remote the stock of the resource is very low and the strategies of the open access and marine protected areas players are high what counts is probably not the full recovery of the stock in the long run but rather the potential to rapidly increase catches in the short run finally this rapid increase in fishing depends on how the actors play the game and whether or not the biological characteristics of the species are considered 5 3 2 a path forward our results are perceptive in many respects first the entire resource stock is affected by the fully protected area implying that the designation of the fish bank would amplify the protection of the high seas in the open ocean the mpas and within national marine territories second the effect on catches and fishers incomes is significant meaning that the fish bank will contribute to the supply of dietary protein especially in many small islands and developing nations where more than half of animal protein originates from the sea sumaila et al 2019 if properly enforced the cost benefit performance of a fish bank will be greater for these emerging economies than the global average as one example small scale fishing accounts for about 2 million jobs for women worldwide about half of whom are in africa and asia and fish for their daily meals harper et al 2020 a reliable source of seafood is crucial to their continued health and financial autonomy overfishing impacts are strongly correlated with the vulnerability of marine environments fragile ecosystems are usually the primary detectors of declining fish populations they are more sensitive to inaction than other regions of the oceans disregarding the call for wise stewardship of marine reserves inclusive of marginalized coastal communities will not only place the ecosystem at jeopardy but will also undermine the un s efforts to achieve the targets of some key un sustainable development goals sdg1 no poverty sdg2 zero hunger and sdg14 life below water 6 final remarks this paper sought to identify the strategies of players operating in a fishery when a section of the marine protected area is being designated as an exclusive no take zone referred to as a fish bank more specifically we show that the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 can be mitigated through spatial limitations to this end we adopted a dynamic game model with three state variables and two controls where the utility of the players is logarithmic in form we proved that when fish migrate freely between the open access fishing area the mpa and the fish bank increasing the size of the latter can contribute to a sustainable development of the resource in the long run from an economic point of view fishers may also see their profit increase similar to mazalov and rettieva 2010 we based our analysis on certain key assumptions relaxing some of these restrictions would certainly generate new opportunities for future work finally the model we have proposed in this paper can offer a basis for addressing a broader set of problems in fisheries management possible extensions include the category of models dealing with asymmetry of information and market powers dahmouni 2022 wild and farmed fish substitution dahmouni and sumaila 2021 or considering regime shifts as in miller and nkuiya 2016 sakamoto 2014 fesselmeyer and santugini 2013 dahmouni et al 2023 for instance one can possibly envision a model where players would anticipate a change in the size of the fish bank at the beginning of each period in conjunction with this on a rather biological basis more than one interacting species could be considered fischer and mirman 1992 1996 breton et al 2019 where each is characterized by a different migratory behavior in this regard one issue that springs to mind from this perspective is that of species that migrate in a single direction a common example is the behavior of the sockeye salmon moving up the fraser river british columbia canada declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a proof of proposition 1 the

24189,representing about 8 of the world s oceans marine protected areas mpas are effective instruments for mitigating the damage that overfishing can do to ecological and economic systems yet less than 2 of the ocean is proclaimed an exclusive no take zone expecting their number and size to increase significantly in the coming years meticulous implementation of mpas is central to their success using a dynamic game model we explore the impact of designated no take marine reserves on fish stock and on fishing strategies our findings suggest that optimality can be achieved in a context of a combination of three marine zones i e an open access fishery a marine protected area and a fish bank our methodology consists of considering an infinite time horizon discrete fishing game with a migratory species between the three regions we analyze fishing strategies and characterize the model equilibria for different behaviors the fully non cooperative scheme the social optimum and the cartel setting our analytical results are supported by the use of a numerical simulation that compares different scenarios including the current state of the world in contrast to different sizes of mpas and fish bank areas keywords fisheries fish banks marine protected area marine reserves dynamic games data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as much as there has been a surge of interest in the introduction of marine protected areas mpas over the past two decades their coverage of the world s ocean remains modest in terms of both their size and number there are currently just over 18 400 mpas covering nearly 27 million km 2 or roughly 8 of the oceans yet fewer than 2 of the oceans are declared exclusively no take areas in contrast with an estimated 14 growth between 2000 and 2019 in mpas globally those implemented in national jurisdictions account for 17 of national waters with half of the new mpas initiated by either the united states the united kingdom or france other countries that have recently established mpas include australia and new zealand with a 30 increase in area moreover the 20 largest mpas in terms of size cover approximately 70 of all protected areas maestro et al 2019 since less than 2 of the oceans are presently fully protected waters efforts by local communities nations and international organizations to protect them are intensifying a new set of conservation goals calls for the full protection of a minimum of 10 of the world s marine and coastal ecosystems consistent with this trend it is anticipated that an increasing number of mpas will be established in the next decade however an mpa must be carefully designed using an ecosystem approach that incorporates fully and partially protected areas without excluding the right to fish for those whose livelihoods are dependent on the right to access the stocks in this paper we consider an infinite time horizon discrete fishing game with a migratory species between three regions i an open access fishing area with n symmetric players ii a mpa with limited fishing activities that is accessible to only one player iii and a fish bank area where fishing is completely prohibited recognizing that cooperation is environmentally preferable by the society and assuming that the goal of the players is to maximize their respective utilities over an infinite horizon our research aims to answer the following questions 1 what is the combined environmental and financial impact of a fish bank on each region and for each player 2 how does this impact vary across different game modes 3 how does the current state of the world compare to the different possible scenarios to this end we analyze fishing strategies for different behaviors i e a fully non cooperative scheme a social optimum and a cartel setting we characterize the model equilibria and show in terms of the environmental welfare of the resource the positive impact that the introduction of the fish bank can exert on the level of the steady state stocks in the three regions we show that the benefits of designing a fish bank is twofold that is the sustainability of the resource and an increase in income from the additional catching quantities over the time horizon for all fishers as a result of the spillover effect we also show that these results may not be obtained under certain conditions finally in terms of the marine spatial planning it will be concluded that a precautionary approach combining the three regions is capable of achieving environmentally friendly habitat for the resource while maintaining the financial stability of the fishers the rest of the paper is organized as follows in the next section we review the literature on the implementation of mpas and the game theoretic models dealing with this topic in section 3 we present the model the relevant assumptions the equilibrium steady states levels as well as the characterization of the equilibrium strategies in different game modes i e the feedback nash equilibrium the social optimum and in a cartel context in section 4 we provide a detailed discussion on the impact that the model parameters exert on the obtained solutions section 5 numerically illustrates our results including sensitivity analysis policy implications for various scenarios and a general discussion section 6 concludes and suggests potential future works the computational details are provided in the appendix 2 literature review the open ocean is a treasure chest of biological diversity harboring rich and diverse wildlife and unique species that deliver invaluable support to life on earth sala and giakoumi 2018 however continuous man made disturbances are jeopardizing the capacity of the ocean to perform these functions and have prompted a renewed interest in the development of a global system of mpas including the expansion of the mpa network sala et al 2021 as a result of the devastating decline of fish stocks in many parts of the world palomares et al 2020 a growing number of scientists economists and international environmental organizations are increasingly calling for action on the plight of global marine resources srinivasan et al 2012 fao 2020 after decades of negatively impacting biodiversity this alarming situation is no longer subject only to reduced catch levels early contributions concluded on how paramount it is that the practice of fishing be limited both in terms of fishing grounds and the right to access them ostrom et al 1992 ostrom 1990 clark et al 2010 although landings may be affected in the short term spatial limitation will fortunately not reduce the stocks available to fishers in the long run because despite prejudice it will help restore the biomass and create a more sophisticated marine ecosystem that will allow better access to larger quantities of fish in the future for example a study by marshall et al 2019 has found that on average and depending on the species studied fish reproduction in mpas is estimated to be five times that of an open access fishing area sala et al 2016 presents a pro forma business plan on the sustainable and economically profitable management of the fish banks witnessing an equivalent increase of 446 in fish biomass within just a decade when compared to non protected adjacent areas in a joint investment format the authors assign a recreational role to these closed areas where fishers are designated as stakeholders by the government to offset reduced catches the biological effect of fully protected marine reserves and their comparison with partially protected areas has been studied by lester and halpern 2008 and lester et al 2009 most scientists and practitioners argue that protected areas can play a key role in achieving this objective by providing a buffer zone where the ecosystem can regenerate and through spillover processes benefit the fishery a number of studies have been published in the literature demonstrating the spillover effect of an exclusive no take marine area for a full meta analytical evaluation of this phenomenon we refer the reader to di lorenzo et al 2020 however protected areas are not a panacea in the sense that it is necessary to also regulate fishing beyond the boundaries of the protected area on this point this paper provides an interesting modeling framework combining spatiality optimality steady states and game components recognized as the most effective class of mpas the establishment of an exclusively no take zone will create a marine recovery ground for species away from the fishing industry thereby creating healthy viable fish stocks and in turn increasing catches in a long term sustainable manner sala and giakoumi 2018 to date the demonstrated merits of mpas as an environmentally conscious instrument have been significantly underutilized for a variety of factors including the high cost of implementation mccrea strub et al 2011 the lack of patience on the part of fishers sumaila 2021 and the short sightedness of local authorities sala et al 2016 if hastings and botsford 1999 discusses why making marine reserves the preferred management approach janmaat 2005 shows that the tragedy of the commons can be magnified when economic agents are bound to harvest a renewable resource within a fixed geographic area other notable contributors to the design of the marine reserve include herrera et al 2016 sanchirico 2004 sanchirico and wilen 2002 costello and polasky 2008 hastings and botsford 1999 linh son et al 2014 cabral et al 2019 the use of strategic interaction frameworks in the context of fisheries spatial limitations has been broadly applied in the literature for example costello et al 2015 investigated an interaction between an open access and an owned area but does not count for the marine reserve a recent study costello and molina 2021 discusses two countries sharing the same marine reserve the overall study focuses on how the marine reserve can mitigate incentives for overextraction in the game takashina et al 2017 is closely related to our paper particularly in understanding the role of cooperation in implementing effective and successful mpas in a simplified non cooperative model their results argue in favor of a need for regulatory agreements to overcome the tragedy of the commons in our quest for answers we opt for an extended version of the model presented in mazalov and rettieva 2010 while they considered a two player two region game where the regulator incentivizes the maintenance of cooperation through a punishment method the model we propose differs in two aspects first from an ecological point of view three fish population dynamics are involved in the analysis including parameters that reflect the natural reproduction of fish the migratory impact between a pair of the three regions and their respective sizes second in terms of strategic interactions we adhere to the open access fishing method in the region with n players and the regulator is only involved in the restrictions that concern the partially protected area at this level it is noteworthy to mention that the objective of this paper is to isolate the ecological and economic effects of the fish bank size hence for the economic section of the analysis the logarithmic utility function is retained for its proven accuracy in the game theory literature as well as for its role in easing the calculations fischer and mirman 1992 1996 breton and keoula 2012 2014 fesselmeyer and santugini 2013 breton et al 2019 doyen et al 2018 dahmouni et al 2023 finally the contribution of our paper to the literature is twofold first it is the first study to address this issue from a game theoretic perspective which is an important approach for dealing with this topic given the strategic interactions of the fishers and given that the majority of the articles on marine reserves in the literature assume a single owner of the fishery this assumption is problematic for two reasons i in most dynamic models a single owner cannot gain much from a mpa because a rational agent is supposed to be fishing at an appropriate level ii most fisheries in the world at least those where mpas are being considered are not owned by a single owner the second contribution can be grasped by the novelty in the mathematical modeling i e since the seminal paper by levhari and mirman 1980 no study has treated all three regions in a single model an extension in this direction was missing and so this paper fills these gaps 3 a markovian discrete time model with migratory species consider a discrete time model with migration of a single species fishery with n 1 players the fish habitat is normalized to 1 and divided into three distinct areas an open access fishing area q a marine protected area with limited fishing opportunities r and a completely banned fish bank area s we denote by q r and s their respective sizes with q r s 1 and q r s 0 1 3 area q is exploited by n players in a perfect competition setting while the single player s catch in the r area is controlled and set at a socially acceptable environmental level 1 1 we consider a representative agent holding a license to operate in area r this player can be a single fisherman or a cooperative fishing coalition such as a local community that fishes together as a group when s 1 the fishing activity is totally forbidden whereas q 1 corresponds to the case where the players have access to the entirety of the fishing area and the restrictions are nonexistent in the absence of human activity the growth rate of the fish species in each area is defined by the following dynamics 1 x t 1 x t α 1 y t x t q β 1 z t x t q γ 1 x 0 x y t 1 y t α 2 x t y t r β 2 z t y t r γ 2 y 0 y z t 1 z t α 3 x t z t s β 3 y t z t s γ 3 z 0 z where x t 0 y t 0 and z t 0 are respectively the size of the population in the q r and s areas in period t the initial conditions x y and z are given following mazalov and rettieva 2010 the parameters α l 0 1 are the reproductive rates of fish species within the same area while β l 0 1 and γ l 0 1 are the migration coefficients between pairs of the three areas with l 1 2 3 restricting migration coefficients to strictly positive values ensures that fish will indeed move between areas the migration effect is represented by the ratio of stock sizes when this ratio is equal to 1 the population size is similar in both areas and therefore no fish will migrate between them a graphical illustration of the model is provided in fig 1 the utility of a player i 1 n operating in the q area at period t is given by the logarithmic form u i t l n c i t with 0 c i t x t k i n 1 c k t his catch at time t fischer and mirman 1992 1996 in the r area we respectively denote by c j t y t and u j t l n λ c j t the catch and the utility of player j in order to restrict the activities of player j we use the parameter λ 0 1 as the enforced portion of the total catch that is allowed to be landed on the shore 2 2 parameter λ can have different interpretations including seasonal restrictions on the number of days allowed for fishing or restrictions on the fishing effort such as the number of vessels the number of employees on board the financial expenditures the type of engine gear used the size of nets etc in the context of human activities each player maximizes the sum of her discounted utility over the infinite time horizon using the discount factor 0 δ 1 such as 2 j m t max c m t t 0 δ t u m t t m i j subject to 3 x t 1 x t i n c i t α ˆ 1 y t c j t β ˆ 1 z t γ ˆ 1 y t 1 x t i n c i t β ˆ 2 y t c j t α ˆ 2 z t γ ˆ 2 z t 1 x t

can be interpreted as the overall replication parameter once the borders between regions have been established note that these parameters are increasing with the α l parameters and decreasing with both the size of the same region and the migration coefficients β l and γ l for l 1 2 3 in contrast the parameters β ˆ l and γ ˆ l are respectively positively correlated with the migration coefficients β l and γ l whereas being increasing functions with respect to the size of the corresponding area we assume a markov information scheme where each player observes the state of the game in each period i e the decisions of the other players and the state of the fish stock in each area we solve the model for three scenarios i e n a fully non cooperative solution where the n 1 players individually seek their feedback nash equilibrium strategies c a fully cooperative solution where n 1 players coordinate their catches by jointly maximizing the sum of their discounted utilities over the infinite time horizon and setting k in which the n players form a cartel and cooperatively exploit the q area while playing noncooperatively against the only player in area r as explained above the purpose of examining these scenarios is twofold on the one hand to dissect the effect of the model s parameters and the implication of biological externalities and on the other hand to highlight the territorial externalities induced by the resizing of each region under study our ecological analysis is based on the steady state levels x y z of the fish stock in each region as a consequence of the players fish landings however the economic analysis is undertaken in terms of the value function which depends on the state variables 3 1 assumptions characterizing the different equilibria in such a model is not a straightforward process and requires strong assumptions regarding the behavior of players during their fishing activities on top of that additional restrictions on the biological behavior of the fish are needed to develop the comprehensive framework of the upcoming solutions the following assumptions are therefore necessary for our analysis 1 α l β l γ l l 1 2 3 we assume that the natural birth rate in each region accounts for a much larger contribution to the succeeding generation than the increase in the total number of stocks due to the migration effect consequently we have α ˆ l β ˆ l γ ˆ l 0 1 3 2 α l β l γ l 1 l 1 2 3 we guarantee that the unique positive steady state level is maintained when no fishing activity occurs i e x y z 1 1 1 as the degree of saturation of the fish species in its natural habitat 3 i 1 n c i μ i x and c j μ j y the interpretation of these linear forms is that the total catch in each region is defined by a share μ m 0 1 m i j of the available stock 4 μ i i 1 n ϵ i and c i ϵ i x the n symmetric players in the q region evenly share the total catch 3 2 steady states we initiate our analysis with the characterization of the steady state values as demonstrated in proposition 1 below first let us denote q ˆ 1 ā c d 1 c d q ˆ 2 b ē c 1 c d r ˆ 1 1 ā β ˆ 2 d γ ˆ 2 1 c d 1 α ˆ 2 r ˆ 2 β ˆ 2 b ē c γ ˆ 2 ē b d α ˆ 2 1 c d 1 c d 1 α ˆ

fishing strategies μ m 0 1 m i j the steady state level of the fish stocks in each region is given by 4 x 1 μ i q ˆ 1 1 λ μ j q ˆ 2 y 1 μ i r ˆ 1 1 λ μ j r ˆ 2 z 1 μ i s ˆ 1 1 λ μ j s ˆ 2 proof see the appendix remark 1 note that under assumption 2 1 1 1 is a stable steady state when μ m 0 m i j the solution in proposition 1 specifies the general formula by which the fish stock will be sustained in each region in the long term this specific form will vary depending on the level of fishing behavior according to the mode of play that the players choose to adopt as for the shares μ m they are adversely impacting these steady state levels however this impact is slowed by the λ parameter a detailed analysis about this effect is postponed to a subsequent section next we consider behavior in the context of non cooperation cooperation and cartel 3 3 feedback nash equilibrium suppose that each player is individually deciding on her strategies while considering other players catches in addition each agent observes the size of each region and the number of players n therefore given the definition of her utility function player m s maximization problem is given by 5 m a x c m v m t 0 δ t u m t m i j subject to 3 proposition 2 the total catch in a noncooperative setting is given by the couple of shares μ i n μ j n of the available resource stocks respectively x y such as μ i n x μ

b j n γ ˆ 3 c j n ln 1 λ μ j n the constants ρ m n θ m n ω m n are given in the appendix for m i j proof see appendix the results in the above proposition lead to the following remarks first the strategies are constants and consequently the catches are linear in the fish stock a result that is expected under assumptions 3 and 4 second the optimal catch of agent m i j corresponds to the situation where there is indifference between the marginal utility of consuming a unit of fish in the current period and the marginal utility of deferring this consumption to the next period this comment is well described by the form of the first order conditions in eqs b 5 and b 10 third a decrease in the ecological parameter α ˆ 1 as a result of an increase in α 1 or a decrease in parameters q β 1 or γ 1 increases the rate at which fish reproduce resulting in increased catch for player i 1 n the reason for this effect is that the value of uncaught fish drops the latter comment is valid for player j when considering an increase in α 2 or a decrease in parameters r β 2 or γ 2 3 4 social optimum consider now that all players are jointly coordinating their fishing strategies by forming a coalition that involves the n 1 members i 1 n and j the maximization problem for the joint coalition is given by 9 m a x c i c j v t 0 δ t i 1 n u i t u j t subject to 3 proposition 3 the total catch in a cooperative setting is given by the couple of shares μ i c μ j c of the available resource stocks respectively x y such as μ i c x μ j c y i 1 n c i c c j c assuming symmetric players the players optimal strategies are given by 10 μ i c n 2 n 2 δ α ˆ 1 a c β ˆ 2 b c β ˆ 3 c c 11 μ j c 1 λ 1 δ β ˆ 1 a c α ˆ 2 b c γ ˆ 3 c c player m s value function is given by 12 v m c x y z a c ln x b

β ˆ 1 a c α ˆ 2 b c γ ˆ 3 c c ln 1 λ μ j c the constants ρ 1 c ρ 2 c θ 1 c θ 2 c ω c are given in the appendix proof see appendix having a similar form to the non cooperative solution the same comments are offered for the cooperative strategies in the above proposition nevertheless it should be mentioned that the main difference is that the coalition incorporates the dynamic externality i e each player will consider the size of the coalition this behavior is reflected in the appearance of the parameter n in a very clear way in the expression of player i s strategies and through the parameters of the value functions for both types of players included in the grand coalition indeed the effect of an increase in the number of players will more affect the strategies of a cooperative player than the non cooperative one however it will less affect the steady states levels 3 5 cartel solution now suppose that the n players fishing in area q decide to form a cartel against the fishers in area r by unilaterally deciding on their fishing strategies they seek to maximize the sum of their discounted utilities while the remaining player continues to play à la nash the system of maximization problems in this context is given by 13 m a x c i i 1 n v i t 0 δ t i 1 n u i t i 1 n m a x c j v j t 0 δ t u j t subject to 3 proposition 4 the total catch in a cartel setting is given by the couple of shares μ i k μ j k of the available resource stocks respectively x y such as μ i k x μ j k y i 1 n c i k c j k assuming the n players to be symmetric the optimal strategies are given

proof see appendix again the solution here has a similar form to the previous ones so we will refrain from duplicating the same remarks in a few words this result is interesting to highlight the advantage of extending coordination in particular by comparing this scenario with the cooperative case one will be able to examine this benefit at a higher level for example by discussing the case where all actors are involved in the action of saving the fish stock including those with access to different fishing grounds and jurisdictions this implies that careful implementation of mpas requires accompanying policies to mitigate competition among fishers operating in surrounding areas takashina et al 2017 4 impact of the model parameters to understand how the critical aspects of the problem in particular the size of each region the biological parameters and the degree of cooperation affect the levels of the stock at the equilibrium as well as the previously derived strategies we present in this section the general forms of the mathematical expressions associated with this impact proposition 5 provides the impact that the biological parameters as well as the fishing intensities will have on the values of the equilibrium steady states whereas proposition 6 defines the effect of the spatial parameters q r s on the fishing intensity μ m m i j proposition 5 i the impact of the fishing intensity on the steady state levels in each region is given by 17 x μ i q ˆ 1 x 1 μ i x μ j λ q ˆ 2 x 1 λ μ j y μ i r ˆ 1 y 1 μ i y μ j λ r ˆ 2 y 1 λ μ j z μ i s ˆ 1 z 1 μ i z μ j λ s ˆ 2 z 1 λ μ j ii the impact of the ecological parameters on the steady state levels is given by 18 x ν x ln 1 μ i q ˆ 1 ν ln 1 λ μ j q ˆ 2 ν x μ i μ i ν x μ j μ j ν y ν y ln 1 μ i r ˆ 1 ν ln 1 λ μ j r ˆ 2 ν y μ i μ i ν y μ j μ j ν z ν z ln 1 μ i s ˆ 1 ν ln 1 λ μ j s ˆ 2 ν z μ i μ i ν z μ j μ j ν where ν α ˆ l β ˆ l γ ˆ l for l 1 2 3 the first result of proposition 5 implies that under the assumption of non negativity of the parameters q ˆ l r ˆ l s ˆ l steady states decrease with fishing intensity regardless of who is fishing where for example fishing in area q will have a negative impact on all three areas similarly the direct effect that fishing in the r area will have on the levels of all steady states is negative but not as harmful as the previous one due to the regulation scheme of the mpa under the λ parameter intuitive as it is this result raises the prospect that increasing the size of the r area to the detriment of the q area could have a positive effect on the sustained level of fish stocks in the long run likewise the same insight can be concluded with respect to increasing the size of the fish bank area s the second result of proposition 5 presents the effect of biological parameters on steady state levels the aggregate effect of a decrease increase in fish reproductive capacity as well as a change in migration frequency is ambiguous since the two effects can point in contrary directions therefore this effect depends on the bilateral magnitude of the two impacts table 1 provides an example on the sign of some key terms in the system 18 using

following simplification the denominators are positive in all cases so examining the overall impact that the explicit spatial parameters will have on fishing intensity will depend on the sign of the numerators again as in proposition 5 the global effect is ambiguous and the different terms in each equation may have different signs this is not bad news for our analysis as the decision to fish more or less intensively will not only depend on the biological parameters but also on the size of each region table 2 illustrates this ambiguity in addition in the next subsection we will provide some examples showing effects with different signs 5 numerical simulation in this section we numerically evaluate the impact of the variations of some of the major variables on the results of the previous sections the purpose of this task is to understand the distinct contribution of each of them on fishing strategies and consequently on equilibrium levels to streamline the presentation we first analyze the impact of the bio economic parameters then we separately study the impact of the geographical parameters r q and s under different scenarios our baseline scenario consists of the following values n 5 α 1 0 52 α 2 0 56 α 3 0 6 β 1 0 2 β 2 0 269 β 3 0 2 γ 1 0 11 γ 2 0 12 γ 3 0 2 λ 0 75 δ 0 95 x 0 0 1 y 0 0 1 z 0 0 1 q 0 9056 r 0 0759 and s 0 0185 this constellation of parameters is based on a combination of proxies for real world conditions with a calibration process that ensures compliance with all our assumptions for example we choose a small number of actors that is sufficiently representative as most fisheries are shared among a small number of regions or countries top five countries catches count for more than 60 of the global catch fao 2020 in addition our choice of α 1 α 2 α 3 reflects the fact that fish are more successful at spawning when they relocate farther away from fishing areas where habitat disturbance is more frequent marshall et al 2019 migration coefficients are assumed to have the following relationship β 1 β 2 γ 2 γ 3 and γ 1 β 3 these choices provide the fish dynamics with a specific migration preference property in this sequence q r s boerder et al 2019 the λ parameter is set to approximate similar situations where the mpa rule is to prohibit fishing during three months of the year or where there exists a mandate to deploy only 75 of the fishing effort throughout the year such as the chinese summer moratorium in south china sea ding et al 2021 parameters q r and s are real numbers from the april 2019 world database of protected areas wdpa unep wcmc and iucn 2019 moreover these choices are driven by some of the counterintuitive findings that we will be addressing in the scenarios outlined below 5 1 sensitivity analysis we run the model for t 0 20 time interval represented by the x axis in the figures below our base case calculations return the following steady state values approximations x n 0 1379 x k 0 2291 x c 0 3120 y n 0 2394 y k 0 2618 y c 0 4925 z n 0 9228 z k 0 9408 z c 0 9544 at first glance two major but not surprising remarks can be deduced from these findings first the mode of play of the n open access players is crucial in defining the sustained level of the fish stock in all regions this result follows from the fact that cooperative solutions dominate cartel solutions which in turn dominate nash solutions second in the long run regardless of the mode of play adopted by the actors the level of the resource will be higher in the fish bank area and lower in the open access area fig 2 shows a comparison of the trajectories associated with all game modes under two different starting conditions the results show that even with a weaker starting condition our base case we can still observe more of the long term resource in particular in the fish bank region and especially when players jointly maximize their payoffs than when they play à la nash furthermore the fish bank is consistently seeing high levels of the resource nearing the saturation level next we perform comparative statics to understand the impact on the state and control variables of altering each of the parameter values relative to our baseline scenario to save space we will only display the cases of cooperation as the other game modes have a similar pattern preserving the same relationship presented in fig 2 first we focus on the impact of the non biological parameters of the model i e the number of players n the discount factor δ and the enforcement parameter λ their effects are illustrated in fig 3 where we vary the values of n from 1 to 10 players the values of δ from 0 78 to 0 95 and values of λ from 0 5 to 0 68 changes in the number of players have a significant effect on long term steady state values and fishing strategies indeed a larger number of players induces the open access players to catch more almost everything and the single player in the mpa area to catch significantly less the results are reflected in the fish stock levels where there is a decrease in the resource level in the q region and an increase in its level in the r region the level of the resource in the fish bank region slightly decreases with more players as some fish will escape to region q where more space is available to them the main findings from the impact of varying the δ and λ parameter levels are i the higher their values the weaker the r region player s fishing strategies ii while the strategies of the n players in the q region remain stable iii the steady state levels are higher in the q and r regions iv while the impact on their level in the s region is absent these observations are due on the one hand to the fact that the increase in the discount factor is accompanied by a greater value allocated to the stock of future resources as compared to the current stock by all players on the other hand allowing the player in the r region to keep more fish will decrease his fishing intensity since we are in a cooperative setting now we turn to the biological coefficients first the impact of an increase in the reproduction parameters α l is presented in fig 4 with l 1 2 3 we vary the parameter α 1 from 0 42 to 0 69 the parameter α 2 from 0 42 to 0 6 and the parameter α 3 from 0 48 to 0 57 the impact of α 1 is reflected in a decrease in the fishing strategies of all the players resulting in a decrease in the steady state of region q and an increase of the steady state of region r a possible explanation of these phenomena is that with region s almost saturated fish from region q will escape to region r as their biomass grow resulting in more stock for this region this is also making the player in region r catch less to comply with cooperative behavior as there is less fish in region q furthermore the effect of the α 2 parameter prompts almost the same comments as those made for the q region nevertheless with less catch from the r region player we observe no shift in the strategies of the n players this is mainly caused by the fact that the n players will be seeing some of the fish coming from the r region resulting in a stable stock of fish and stable fishing strategies furthermore we note that none of these parameters have a significant effect on the level of steady states in the fish bank region due to its heavy population levels the parameter α 3 has however no significant effect on our model second the impact of the migration coefficient β l and γ l is displayed in figs 5 and 6 we vary the parameter β 1 from 0 11 to 0 2 the parameter β 2 from 0 12 to 0 3 the parameter β 3 from 0 01 to 0 19 the parameter γ 1 from 0 07 to 0 25 the parameter γ 2 from 0 01 to 0 145 and the parameter γ 3 from 0 11 to 0 2 an increase in the level of the β 1 parameter is accompanied by a decrease in the strategies of the r region player and an increase in the strategies of the n players we also observe an increase in stocks in both regions coupled with no change in the fish bank area this is due to the escapement of fish from the r region to the q region resulting in less fishing for the mpa player and an increase in available fishing resources for the n players who fish more because there is much more fish in both regions another parameter with a significant impact recorded is the γ 1 parameter increasing its values will cause an increase in the strategies of all players we also witness a jump in the long term stock level in the q region this is probably due to more fish moving from the s region to the q region and de facto the mpa player has more freedom to catch more fish again no significant effect was observed regarding the level of the fish in the fish bank region finally the parameters β 2 β 3 γ 2 and γ 3 do not have a significant impact on our model so we will refrain from making any comments related to them finally we admit that some of the elements of the sensitivity analysis and some of the conclusions to come are not mainstream and puzzling to the reader as mentioned earlier this was one of the motivations for choosing this set of parameters for our illustrative example the role of this exercise is to raise awareness of the naïve practices behind some policy implementations we will elaborate on this in more detail below 5 2 policy implications in this subsection we will outline a few scenarios that are worth considering the idea here is to address the relative strength of different policies while concluding on the most successful way to implement a marine reserve mandate our analysis has clearly shown that not all mpa or fish bank sizes achieve the desired results below are some possibilities and ideas on how to take advantage of this model we start by running the model in business as usual mode for 10 periods and then in the eleventh period we consider that a new policy has been announced regarding the size of each region no fishing thus far we have assumed the hypothesis that this scenario has the potential to be achieved we have made this assumption concrete by allowing the lower bound on fishing strategies from being zero most interestingly we have arranged for the entire marine basin to be an s area when setting s 1 intriguing as it may seem one might infer that if fishing strategies are reduced to zero maintaining the role of the fishing ground as a fish bank is still essential to the recovery of the fish stock in most pessimistic cases in fact depending on how the game is played beforehand it may take more or less time to rebuild the stock but one thing is certain the stock will fully recover in the long term reaching steady state values equivalent to those in our model without human activities larger mpa we now examine how the previously calculated solutions vary with a larger size of the r region recall that our baseline scenario reflects the current state of the world where no more than 7 59 in 2019 of the world s marine oceans are designated as mpas from fig 7 we can draw the following conclusion if the mpa size is at best half of the entire marine basin i e r 0 5 then the resource level will significantly decrease with the exception of the cooperative solution in the q and s regions where increased biomass can be witnessed in fact this result is due to a greater decrease in the fishing strategies of the n players compared to the decrease in the strategies of the single player in the mpa technically this will result in a shift of fish to locations with the highest chance of survival larger fish bank as with the previous scenario we have worked so far with a fish bank size equivalent to 1 85 of the world ocean according to the same source to make this scenario comparable to the previous one we have similarly represented a situation where 50 of the ocean is a fish bank as shown in fig 8 the results show that the long term resource stocks have the same shape in the q and r regions for both the cartel and nash solutions with minor changes considered as insignificant moreover there is a considerable jump in these values for the cooperative solution in quantitative terms these changes are accompanied by a decrease in resource levels in the fish bank area this is because overall with these new adjustments there are more fish available throughout the basin and the n 1 players are catching more fish which in turn force fish to be maintained at a lower level this is good news again as we are witnessing a case where the fish bank is fulfilling its role of feeding other areas with more fish resulting in more caught fish for all players larger mpa and larger fish bank under this scenario we consider another albeit somewhat idealistic alternative what if by increasing the size of the fish bank we allow the creation of a larger mpa additionally we ask the next question does the outcome change dramatically with different rates of mpa increase we therefore consider with s 0 5 two cases r 0 1 displayed in the upper graphs of fig 9 and r 0 3 in the lower part of the same figure it is easy to notice that different results occur in the two cases however the main conclusions of this scenario are i with a smaller increase in mpa stock levels are larger in the q and r regions ii this increase in the q region s stock is larger under r 0 1 than under r 0 3 iii a larger increase in the size of the mpa resulted in worse cases for its stocks in all game modes even for the cooperative solution which shows a slight decrease iv finally the impact on the stocks of the fish bank is not different from the previous scenarios these results lead us to study the effect of varying the two variables simultaneously r and s see figs 11 and 12 smaller mpa and larger fish bank our final scenario is probably the one with the most intriguing and counterintuitive results while we envision an increase in the area of the fish bank we also assume a decrease in the mpa area in reality such a scenario is likely to occur when the policy maker decides to make most of the mpa a marine reserve exclusively closed to fishing in pursuit of a much larger fish bank here we execute the model with the following values r 0 01 and s 0 5 as in the previous scenarios this policy will result in many changes as displayed in fig 10 however the resource stock will increase remarkably and more interestingly for all types of strategies undertaken by the players 5 3 discussion 5 3 1 strategic considerations fish banks serve as an important element in the conservation of marine resources however it must not be blindly practiced as a one size fits all policy fisheries management that does not embrace a systemic approach by taking into account the biological and behavioral interactions of the surrounding areas and the activities that take place in them is most likely doomed to failure the first step in meeting this challenge is a broad assessment of each party s interest which is most naturally complemented by the application of cooperation among all parties and not just in terms of open access the grand coalition must encompass all actors involved in fishing the same resource here a specific mention to those who fish in an mpa their commitment to cooperative behavior is as important as anyone else s in this economy the second key step would be to understand in depth the biological behavior of the species including its breeding habits migration routes and mutual relationships with predators and prey in other words the behavior of a fishery in a well balanced biodiversity is indeed much easier to forecast and therefore to be managed most of our results were shaped around the values of the model parameters and their relative ratios while we cannot disavow that other numerical illustrations can be readily made to further hone the above sensitivity analysis the qualitative contribution we are seeking is already evident with our example the cascade effect is illustrated in figs 11 and 12 on the one hand the impact of the simultaneous increase in the size of the mpa and the fish bank is negative on the steady state values in the mpa on the other hand while the increase in the size of the fish bank is insignificant on the steady state values in the same region an increase in the mpa will have a negative impact on its values most interestingly the impact in the open access region only decreases with smaller values of r and s steady state values recover with much larger mpa and fish banks fig 11 moreover we observe other interesting results in fig 12 where the impact of varying the variables r and s on fishing strategies results in an increase in player strategies in the mpa area the n players however in the open access zone see a significant decrease in their catching rates in summary the main contribution we advocate is that continued increases in the size of an exclusively closed marine area do not necessarily result in substantial change unless the primary area of the fish bank is distant from the fishing area in the most practical scenario where the fish bank is not remote the stock of the resource is very low and the strategies of the open access and marine protected areas players are high what counts is probably not the full recovery of the stock in the long run but rather the potential to rapidly increase catches in the short run finally this rapid increase in fishing depends on how the actors play the game and whether or not the biological characteristics of the species are considered 5 3 2 a path forward our results are perceptive in many respects first the entire resource stock is affected by the fully protected area implying that the designation of the fish bank would amplify the protection of the high seas in the open ocean the mpas and within national marine territories second the effect on catches and fishers incomes is significant meaning that the fish bank will contribute to the supply of dietary protein especially in many small islands and developing nations where more than half of animal protein originates from the sea sumaila et al 2019 if properly enforced the cost benefit performance of a fish bank will be greater for these emerging economies than the global average as one example small scale fishing accounts for about 2 million jobs for women worldwide about half of whom are in africa and asia and fish for their daily meals harper et al 2020 a reliable source of seafood is crucial to their continued health and financial autonomy overfishing impacts are strongly correlated with the vulnerability of marine environments fragile ecosystems are usually the primary detectors of declining fish populations they are more sensitive to inaction than other regions of the oceans disregarding the call for wise stewardship of marine reserves inclusive of marginalized coastal communities will not only place the ecosystem at jeopardy but will also undermine the un s efforts to achieve the targets of some key un sustainable development goals sdg1 no poverty sdg2 zero hunger and sdg14 life below water 6 final remarks this paper sought to identify the strategies of players operating in a fishery when a section of the marine protected area is being designated as an exclusive no take zone referred to as a fish bank more specifically we show that the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 can be mitigated through spatial limitations to this end we adopted a dynamic game model with three state variables and two controls where the utility of the players is logarithmic in form we proved that when fish migrate freely between the open access fishing area the mpa and the fish bank increasing the size of the latter can contribute to a sustainable development of the resource in the long run from an economic point of view fishers may also see their profit increase similar to mazalov and rettieva 2010 we based our analysis on certain key assumptions relaxing some of these restrictions would certainly generate new opportunities for future work finally the model we have proposed in this paper can offer a basis for addressing a broader set of problems in fisheries management possible extensions include the category of models dealing with asymmetry of information and market powers dahmouni 2022 wild and farmed fish substitution dahmouni and sumaila 2021 or considering regime shifts as in miller and nkuiya 2016 sakamoto 2014 fesselmeyer and santugini 2013 dahmouni et al 2023 for instance one can possibly envision a model where players would anticipate a change in the size of the fish bank at the beginning of each period in conjunction with this on a rather biological basis more than one interacting species could be considered fischer and mirman 1992 1996 breton et al 2019 where each is characterized by a different migratory behavior in this regard one issue that springs to mind from this perspective is that of species that migrate in a single direction a common example is the behavior of the sockeye salmon moving up the fraser river british columbia canada declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a proof of proposition 1 the
