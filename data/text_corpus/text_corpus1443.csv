7215,for a highly developed urban area with complete drainage systems flood simulation is necessary for describing the flow dynamics from rainfall to surface runoff and to sewer flow in this study a coupled flood model based on diffusion wave equations was proposed to simulate one dimensional sewer flow and two dimensional overland flow simultaneously the overland flow model provides details on the rainfall runoff process to estimate the excess runoff that enters the sewer system through street inlets for sewer flow routing three types of inlet modelling are considered in this study including the manhole based approach that ignores the street inlets by draining surface water directly into manholes the inlet manhole approach that drains surface water into manholes that are each connected to multiple inlets and the inlet node approach that drains surface water into sewer nodes that are connected to individual inlets the simulation results were compared with a high intensity rainstorm event that occurred in 2015 in taipei city in the verification of the maximum flood extent the two approaches that considered street inlets performed considerably better than that without street inlets when considering the aforementioned models in terms of temporal flood variation using manholes as receivers leads to an overall inefficient draining of the surface water either by the manhole based approach or by the inlet manhole approach using the inlet node approach is more reasonable than using the inlet manhole approach because the inlet node approach greatly reduces the fluctuation of the sewer water level the inlet node approach is more efficient in draining surface water by reducing flood volume by 13 compared with the inlet manhole approach and by 41 compared with the manhole based approach the results show that inlet modeling has a strong influence on drainage efficiency in coupled flood simulation keywords flood simulation coupled model sewer drainage urban infiltration 1 introduction over the last two decades numerical modeling has become an essential tool in urban flood analysis compared with rural areas developing flood models for urban areas is more complicated due to the coupling of sewer drainage systems schmitt et al 2004 smith 2006 in the early days of the field due to computational limitations researchers commonly paired one dimensional 1d sewer flow models sfms with simplified depth volume relationships to simulate flooding caused by drainage surcharges djordjević et al 1999 maksimović et al 2009 however this approach is oversimplified because it ignores the dynamics of two dimensional 2d surface runoff mark et al 2004 in recent years improvements in computer power and data resolution have boosted the popularization of 2d overland flow models ofms bates et al 2010 chen et al 2012 halcrow 2012 leandro et al 2014 as a result coupling of 1d sfm and 2d ofm has been drawing considerable attention in urban flood simulations hunter et al 2007 kuiry et al 2010 seyoum et al 2012 jahanbazi and egger 2014 russo et al 2015 leandro and martins 2016 the coupling of sfm and ofm can be concluded into two methods based on different considerations of the rainfall runoff process as proposed by chang et al 2015 the sfm ofm approach and the ofm sfm approach the sfm ofm approach allows excess rainfall to flow directly into the sfm first to enable the sewer flow simulation when manhole surcharge occurs the ofm is triggered for overland flow simulation djordevićet al 2005 chen et al 2007 leandro et al 2009 this approach obviously deviates from reality because it does not consider surface runoff dynamics which underestimates the upstream flooding and overestimates the downstream flooding chang et al 2015 in the ofm sfm approach the simulated rainfall is first routed by the ofm to generate surface runoff that travels some distance on the ground before discharging into sewer systems through drainage inlets and then is modelled by sfm although the ofm sfm is physically reasonable because it incorporates rainfall runoff dynamics the interaction between surface runoff and sewer water requires further considerations to correspond accurately to field situation most sfms are semi distributed thus they use manholes instead of street inlets to receive runoff by a lumped relationship with rainfall this method deviates from the reality because runoff is not accumulated through manholes in the real world but is accumulated through street inlets into gullies on road curbs that connect to an underground pipe segment between two manholes fig 1 in recent years the drainage performance of gullies has been studied by a few researchers martins et al 2014 lopes et al 2016 chang et al 2018 however because of data complexity and inaccessibility gullies are rarely incorporated into sewer simulations to consider the function of street inlets without gullies chang et al 2015 and bertsch et al 2017 adopted an alternative method that drained inlet discharges directly into a nearby manhole hereinafter inlet manhole approach in this approach manual judgement is required to establish a synthetic connection between each manhole and nearby inlets especially when a street inlet sits in the middle of two manholes instead of using manholes as the receiver bazin et al 2014 and noh et al 2016 connected each street inlet to a corresponding node on a sewer pipe for flow communication hereinafter inlet node approach which have demonstrated to be applicable in laboratory scale experiments however the inlet node approach has yet to be field tested on a large scale because extensive labor would be required to set the parameters for tens of thousands of street inlets in a modern sewer system to discover how inlet modeling affects the drainage efficiency in this study the function of street inlets was simulated using the inlet manhole and inlet node approaches simultaneously in the coupling of sfm and ofm the sfm and ofm were both developed on the basis of diffusion wave equations and were coupled for flood routing at street level with the consideration of infiltration related to land uses the inlet node approach was tested in practical scenarios by intersecting 1d sewer pipelines with 2d grid meshes on a geographical information system gis the two approaches were compared with another approach that drains surface water directly into manholes without using street inlets martins et al 2017 fan et al 2017 simulation results from these approaches were compared in the verification of a historical flood event that occurred in 2015 in taipei city taiwan the influence of inlet modeling on drainage efficiency was quantified by using the flood coefficient defined in this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the theoretical considerations of the models are detailed the study area and the flood event are described in section 3 the spatial and temporal variations of flood extent and volume are verified in section 4 finally the research findings are concluded in section 5 2 methodology in this study both the sfm and ofm were constructed on the basis of diffusion wave equations which ignores the inertial terms because urban terrain tends to be relatively flat where the flow acceleration is small compared with gravity and friction mass exchange between the sfm and ofm is realized by adding corresponding discharge terms to the continuity equations the methodology is detailed as follows 2 1 simulation flow chart fig 3 displays the flowchart that provides the process of coupling the sfm and the ofm first the rainfall and land use data are read to determine the rainfall excesses after infiltration second the time step δ t determined by the courant friedrich lewy condition courant et al 1967 is employed to simultaneously initiate the 1d sfm and the 2d ofm for determining the velocity and flow depth respectively third the flow exchange rates q between 1d sfm and 2d ofm are calculated and then are introduced into the continuity equations for updating the flow depths on the surface and in the pipes for each grid cell and sewer node finally the whole process is repeated until the set final simulation time is reached 2 2 ofm for the overland flow simulation the 2d hydraulic model by hsu et al 2000 is adopted and modified by adding a source term to the continuity equation for receiving the flow surcharged from the 1d sfm the governing equations are expressed as 1 h t uh x vh y q q a o 2 h z x u n x 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 q hg 3 h z y v n y 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 q hg where eq 1 is the continuity equation eqs 2 and 3 are the diffusive momentum equations in x and y directions respectively u and v are the flow velocities in x and y directions respectively q is the effective rainfall h is the flow depth on the ground z is the elevation of ground surface g is the acceleration of gravity n x and n y are the manning s coefficient in x and y directions respectively a o is the area of 2d grid cell q is the sewer surcharge to the ground surface to solve eqs 1 3 hsu et al used the finite difference alternate direction explicit ade scheme that divides each time step δ t into two equivalent time intervals δ t 2 for alternatively updating the flow depth and velocity in x and y directions however in their scheme the v in eq 2 and the u in eq 3 in the friction terms were dropped so that the u in eq 2 and the v in eq 3 can be explicitly obtained in this study the scheme of hsu et al has been modified by solving the friction terms with the complete velocity expressions to increase the accuracy in the modified scheme the v in eq 2 and the u in eq 3 are known at the last time intervals while the u in eq 2 and the v in eq 3 are iteratively determined 2 3 sfm in this study a 1d sfm based on implicit finite difference algorithm has been developed for sewer flow simulation to calculate full and partially full pipe flows simultaneously the preissmann slot method cunge and wegner 1964 was adopted by creating a narrow slot above the sewer pipes by adding a sink term to the continuity equation that accounts for the flow surcharged to the ofm the continuity and diffusive momentum equation can be expressed as follows 4 a t va s q l 5 h z s n s 2 v v r 4 3 6 h f a if a a p d a a p b s if a a p where d is the pipe diameter a is the cross sectional area of flow a p is the cross sectional area of pipe l is the pipe length intersected within a grid cell h is the flow depth in the pipe z is the elevation of pipe bottom s is the flow direction r is the hydraulic radius n s is the manning s coefficient in s direction b s ga p a 2 and is the width of the slot a is the speed of pressure wave unlike the 2d model that uses an explicit ade scheme the 1d model employs the implicit backward euler method ascher and petzold 1998 which is solved by functional iteration piscard 1890 to improve its stability 2 4 interaction between the sfm and ofm three approaches were adopted in this study to consider the flow interaction between the sfm and ofm as shown in fig 2 fig 2 a displays the simplified manhole based approach that ignores the function of street inlets and infers that the surface water directly drains into the sewer system through manholes fig 2 b demonstrates the inlet manhole approach that drains surface water through multiple street inlets into a manhole via synthetic tubes fig 2 c illustrates the inlet node approach that drains surface water through individual street inlets into a corresponding sewer node at the center of the pipe segments that intersect with the 2d grid mesh in fig 2 b and c the street inlets are placed at the cell center to represent the summary cell inflow the intersection between the 1d pipelines and the 2d grid mesh is processed on a gis platform using this platform has the following benefits 1 the correspondence between the 1d and 2d elements is automatically established 2 the slope length elevation depth and diameter of the pipe segments within each cell are numerically determined without requiring any human intervention and 3 the intersection can be easily updated whenever a new version of pipe network or grid mesh is available in all the three approaches sewer water will surcharge through manholes to the nearest 2d cell center when the hydraulic head of sewer water exceeds that of surface water for a cell that has both manholes and street inlets the interactions between sewer water and surface water are bidirectional in this study inlet surcharge is not considered to mimic the function of gullies in the real world the gullies not only collect surface water from street inlets into sewer systems via lateral pipes but also play as a buffer storing the excessive water from sewer surcharges this explains why the sewer surcharges usually occur via manholes rather than inlets in the field although the gullies are not explicitly modelled in this study the sewer surcharges are only allowed to occur at manholes in order to fit the real situation the exchange rate between sewer and surface water is determined on the basis of the hydraulic heads of surface water z h z h and sewer water z h z h lee et al 2013 noh et al 2016 when z h z h the sewer water surcharges to the ground surface through manholes the surcharge can be estimated by using a weir or orifice equation as follows 7 q s 2 3 c w w m 2 g z h z h 3 2 for z h z h w 0 5 8 q s c o a m 2 g z h z h for z h z h w 0 5 where w m and a m are the perimeter and area of the manhole respectively c w is the weir coefficient and c o is the orifice coefficient when z h z h surface water discharges into sewer pipes through street inlets the discharge can be determined using the following equations 9 q i 2 3 c w w i 2 g z h z h 3 2 for z h z h w 0 5 10 q i c o a i 2 g z h z h for z h z h w 0 5 where w i and a i are the width and area of the street inlet respectively on the basis of eqs 7 10 the q in eqs 1 and 4 can be determined by varying the inlet modeling specifications for the manhole based approach q mq s where m is the number of manholes within a grid cell for the inlet node approach q mq s nq i where n is the number of street inlets within a grid cell according to the sewage design handbook of taiwan street inlets are installed in an interval of 5 m along each side of road curbs for the inlet manhole approach q mq s k 1 n nq i k where n is the number of cells that connect the street inlets to the manhole in all the three approaches m 0 and n 0 for grid cells without having manholes 2 5 boundary conditions in this study a structured grid mesh with a 5 5 m 2 cell resolution is adopted for the ofm simulation the elevation of the ground surface at each cell center is obtained from the data of a lidar derived digital elevation model that has 1 m resolution and 1 mm accuracy for the cells covered by buildings the ground elevations are elevated so that surface runoff will transport on the streets between buildings without traversing gironas et al 2009 the building roofs are set as flat without water retaining capability thus the water on the roofs will directly discharge into the neighbor ground cells by gravity to account for infiltration the runoff curve number cn method developed by united states department of agriculture hjelmfelt 1991 was adopted for calculating the rainfall excess the cn method was developed by considering the empirical relationship between rainfall runoff infiltration and potential maximum retention that varies with land use and antecedent moisture conditions the cn method is especially suitable for distributed 2d runoff simulation because it reflects the variation in permeability for each cell and has been widely used in practical applications with a detailed handbook for reference nrcs 2004 2 6 performance indicators the performance of the flood model is evaluated by comparing the simulated and post investigated maximum flood extents using the following performance indicators mason 1982 jang et al 2012 jang 2015 11 ocr h h m f c 12 htr h h m 13 far f f c where h hit represents the areas that are flooded and correctly predicted m miss alarm represents the areas that are flooded but are not predicted f false alarm represents the areas that are not flooded but are falsely predicted and c correct rejections denotes the areas that are not flooded and are not predicted the ocr htr and far denote the overall correctness rate hit rate and false alarm rate respectively meanwhile the coefficient c f f r is defined to quantify the efficiency of inlet on surface drainage where f is the maximum flood volume and r is the accumulated rainfall amount the coefficient c f is termed as the flood coefficient because it is conceptually similar to the discharge coefficient that is used to measure the ratio between outflow and inflow in a basin a smaller value of c f represents a higher efficiency of inlet drainage because more surface water has been drained into sewer systems 3 study area and flood event taipei city located in northern taiwan has a population of 2 7 million an area of 272 km 2 and well built drainage systems the entire drainage system was designed to prevent flooding under a rainfall intensity of 78 8 mm h the system comprises 769 km of sewer pipes and 87 pump stations that are capable of draining sewer water at a peak discharge of 2152 cm in this research daan and zhongzheng districts of taipei city are the areas adopted for study as shown in fig 4 the study area is bordered by the fanglan hill to the southeast and the levees along danshui river to the southwest which has an area of 19 km 2 and many important facilities such as traffic stations cultural centers and academic institutions fig 5 displays that the topography of the study area has an 160 m elevation drop from the south to the north the sewer system of the study area is shown in fig 6 which comprise two pump stations 141 km of pipe length 3571 manholes and more than 74 000 street inlets in the figure the sewer pipes are divided into eight sections that are responsible for conveying runoff water into the northern section of taipei s drainage system fig 7 illustrates seven basic types of land uses in the study area buildings for commercial residential school and hospital uses roads undeveloped green lands parks and forests this information is incorporated for the infiltration calculation by using the cn method the data of the flood event that occurred in the southern taipei city on june 14th 2015 hereinafter the 0614 event is adopted for the simulation the flood event was caused by a heavy rainstorm in the afternoon commonly seen in the summer seasons of taiwan to initiate runoff routing 10 min rainfall data retrieved from 55 rain stations in taipei are interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method idw to generate rainfall hyetographs at each 2d cell center fig 8 a displays the contour map of the accumulated rainfall and fig 8 b displays the rainfall hyetograph at the gongguan station where the maximum rainfall was observed the rainfall occurred at 13 20 and ended at 16 40 with a peak 10 min rainfall of 33 mm at around 14 50 hourly rainfall of 131 5 mm and total rainfall of 192 mm these values far exceed the design standard of taipei s drainage system 78 8 mm h during the 0614 event three areas experienced severe flooding these areas are displayed as zones i ii and iii in fig 8 a 4 model verification in model verification three scenarios are included for comparison the manhole based the inlet manhole and the inlet node approaches in fig 2 for all the scenarios the variables and parameters in the governing equations are the same for the ofm the manning s coefficients n x n y 0 035 for the sfm the manning s coefficient n s 0 017 the weir coefficient c w 0 48 and the orifice coefficient c o 0 57 the manhole capacity is determined according to the field data of manhole geometry given by the official engineering documents in the construction of sewer systems each pipe joint and manhole are integratively designed to meet the requirement of transporting a desired return period of flow discharge the manhole capacities are larger for larger drainage areas and are expanded at the joints of sewer pipes because they are responsible for receiving more surface water from more sewer inlets therefore in the study area each manhole capacity is not the same ranging from 0 5 m 3 to 217 m 3 with an mean of 14 m 3 since the influence of inlet capacity has been included in manhole design the manhole capacities are not modified for all the three scenarios from physical viewpoint this setting is reasonable because whether the sewer inlets are considered or not they do not change the drainage area for each manhole the same grid systems are applied as well for all the scenarios obtained from the intersection of 1d pipelines and 2d mesh the only difference lies in the setup of the number of cells that connect street inlets to the manhole n the value of n is set as zero for the manhole based approach one for the inlet node approach while the n value for the inlet manhole approach is determined according to the relative distances between the manhole and surrounding inlets the simulation time is similar for the three scenarios which are 1879 1880 and 1906 mins with an intel i7 processor at 4 2 ghz for the manhole based inlet manhole and inlet node approaches respectively 4 1 maximum flood extent table 1 summarizes the values of the performance indicators under the three scenarios for zone i zone ii and zone iii in general the htr far and ocr for inlet manhole and inlet node approaches shows no significant discrepancies the table reveals that when street inlet is considered the values of ocr for the inlet manhole and inlet node approaches exceed 0 8 slightly better than the ocr values for the manhole based approach meanwhile the value of far decreases from 0 3 for the manhole based approach to 0 18 for the inlet manhole and the inlet node approaches the htr represents the ratio of flooded area that is correctly predicted by simulation when the entire area is predicted flooded the htr equals to one even when the predictions are totally overestimated to prevent misinterpretation the htr should always be examined with far and ocr simultaneously the former often shows a pattern complementary to htr and the later combines the performance of htr and far although the htr values for the inlet manhole and inlet node approaches are slightly smaller than those for the manhole based approach in table 1 the ocr values for the inlet approaches are still higher due to a more significant decrease in the far value figs 9 11 display the satellite images and the comparison between the simulated and investigated flood extents under the three scenarios for zone i zone ii and zone iii respectively fig 9 a reveals that zone i is next to the daan mrt station and the chenggon public housing section accommodating nearly 2000 families the lanes between the buildings are only 5 10 m wide and do not have sufficient sewer pipes underneath as shown in fig 12 a fig 9 b d illustrates that the simulated flood extents are smaller when street inlets are taken into account fig 10 a displays that zone ii contains an mrt station to the east and a water park to the west although fig 5 indicates that zone ii has a higher elevation compared with the surrounding areas severe flooding still occurred because the zone was located at the rainfall center as displayed in fig 8 a fig 10 b d displays that the flooding on the main road in the middle of zone ii has been correctly predicted by all the three approaches however overestimations have been found on the small alleys between the buildings where the floodwater was trapped due to the absence of sewer pipes as shown in fig 13 a overall the flood extents are less overestimated by the inlet node approach especially on the alleys between the main roads and the mrt station this is because the surface water trapped upstream retreats faster when the floodwater downstream being drained more quickly by the inlet node approach compared with the former two zones fig 11 a shows that zone iii is mainly a campus area that is separated by two roads with less buildings and more green lands in the 0614 event severe flooding occurred on the intersection of keelung road and changxing street fig 11 b d displays that the flood extents are greatly overestimated by the manhole based approach compared with the flood extents of those scenarios that considered street inlets 4 2 flow exchange between sewer and surface water figs 12 14 illustrate the pipe network and the flow exchanges between sewer water and surface water for zone i zone ii and zone ii respectively for zone i the flow exchange rates at the given manhole in fig 12 a are displayed in fig 12 b d for the manhole based inlet manhole and inlet node approaches respectively where the water levels are the hydraulic heads related to the ground elevation when the street inlets are not considered the sewer water level increases much slower this is because the intervals between manholes are much larger than those between street inlets and the surface water must travel a longer distance before entering the sewer system thereby causing inefficient draining of surface water and overestimation of the flood extent the flow exchange rate switches rapidly between positive and negative for the inlet manhole approach indicating that discharge and surcharge occur alternatively this phenomenon is caused by the over draining of surface water from multiple street inlets thus causing a sudden rise in the hydraulic pressure at the manhole this pressure propagates along pipes to cause fluctuations in the sewer water level conversely the sewer water level for the inlet node approach remains constantly higher than the surface water level after surcharge this indicates that by draining surface water into distributed sewer nodes the hydraulic pressure along sewer pipes will be smoothly distributed without abrupt fluctuation at manholes fig 13 a d reveals that the flow exchanges between surface and sewer water in zone ii have similar patterns as those in zone i the water level in zone ii drops more rapidly than that in zone i because zone ii is located at a relative higher elevation and thus the water can be quickly drained downstream by gravity the rising and surcharging of sewer water is the least for the manhole based approach due to the inefficient draining of surface water whereas the fluctuations of sewer water are still the highest for the inlet manhole approach due to the over draining of surface water at manholes this fluctuation of the sewer water level causes discontinuous drawing of surface water which slows down the retreat of surface water in contrast even when the manhole surcharges are the highest for the inlet node approach the surface water retreats the fastest because the surcharge can be drained back to nearby sewer nodes immediately through street inlets in this case the continuous manhole surcharge is a positive sign that implies that the sewer system is functioning appropriately in fig 14 b c the manhole inflows for the manhole based and the inlet manhole approaches are much larger in zone iii than those in other zones this is because the output manhole in fig 14 a is located at the intersection of keelung road and changxing street which receives large amounts of runoff from the north campus the high discharges for the manhole based approach is a sign of inefficient draining due to the low level of sewer water thus implying that the sewer system does not reach its maximum capacity in gathering and transporting floodwater compared with the manhole based approach the manhole discharges for the inlet manhole approach are higher because it receives surface water from multiple street inlets the manhole discharge for the inlet manhole approach does not depend on the sewer and surface water levels at one point but depends on the sum of those at many points thus the manhole discharge in fig 14 c begins before surface flooding which is contributed by the street inlets at other points in a practical scenario such massive manhole discharges will not occur into a manhole because a manhole is not designed for draining surface water the discharge for the inlet node approach in fig 14 d is more reasonable because it is limited by the design capacity of individual street inlet overall the flow exchanges between sewer and surface water display a considerable amount of discrepancies for the inlet manhole and the inlet node approaches although the maximum flood extents are very similar 4 3 inlet efficiency on surface drainage to quantify the influence of inlet modeling on surface water reduction the temporal variations of flood volume for zone i zone ii and zone iii under the three aforementioned scenarios are displayed in fig 15 a c respectively the flood volumes decreases from the manhole based the inlet manhole to the inlet node approaches showing that draining surface water into manholes is less efficient than draining the water into distributed sewer nodes for flood reduction this inefficiency becomes more significant at the upstream areas such as zone ii where the surface water travels faster and the efficiency of inlet drainage becomes more crucial the flood coefficients for the three zones under different scenarios are summarized in table 2 the c f values for the inlet node approach are 0 57 0 52 and 0 54 for zone i zone ii and zone iii respectively which indicates that about half of the rainfall volumes are drained into sewer systems compared with the inlet node approach the c f values for inlet monhole approach are slightly larger increased by 0 08 for zone ii whereas the c f values for the manhole based approach are considerably higher increased by 0 38 for zone iii 5 conclusions in the last two decades the coupling between 1d sfm and 2d ofm has become an important research topic for sophisticated flood simulation in urban areas in the process of coupling the two models the dimensional difference between the models should be addressed because the ofm is a distributed model that uses hydraulic relationship but the sfm is a semi distributed model that uses hydrological relationship to determine surface runoff previous research has validated that rainfall should be first processed by an ofm for conducting runoff routing and then introduced into a sfm for sewer flow simulation however how to establish the correspondence between the street inlets on 2d grids and the nodes on 1d sewer pipes for receiving surface water has yet come to agreement some researchers have connected multiple street inlets to a manhole by using the inlet manhole approach whereas some others have connected each street inlet to a sewer node by using the inlet node approach to realize the influence of inlet modeling in a coupled flood simulation three approaches of coupling sfm and ofm are compared in this study the approaches include the inlet manhole approach which neglects street inlets and uses manholes for draining surface water the inlet node approach and the manhole based approach the methodology of coupling the sfm and ofm under different scenarios is developed and described in detail the flood event that occurred on june 14th 2015 in taipei city taiwan is adopted as study case in the comparison between simulated and investigated flood extents the flood extents for the manhole based approach are overestimated the most due to the lack of considering street inlets the flood extents are well predicted by the inlet manhole approach but the time series of the sewer water level fluctuates greatly due to the over draining of surface water into manholes this fluctuation results in discontinuous drainage of surface water through street inlets which leads to the inefficient draining of surface water into the sewer system in other words either for the manhole based or the inlet manhole approach the drainage efficiency eventually reduces when manholes are used as the final receivers of surface water by draining surface water into distributed sewer nodes rather than manholes the flood extents can be predicted more accurately and the fluctuation of sewer water level can be greatly reduced using the inlet node approach the time series of flood volume demonstrates that the flood volumes retreat the fastest by using the inlet node approach second by using the inlet manhole approach and the slowest by using the manhole based approach a flood coefficient c f is defined to quantify the efficiency of inlet drainage as the ratio between maximum flood volume and accumulated rainfall amount in a region the inlet modelled by the inlet node approach is the most efficient by having the smallest values of c f which are slightly smaller than those by the inlet manhole approach and much smaller than those by the manhole based approach the inlet node approach is more drainage efficient than the inlet manhole approach on draining surface water especially for areas at a higher ground overall the simulation results indicate that the distributed one to one relationship between street inlets and sewer nodes by the inlet node approach is the most efficient in draining surface water this finding is valuable for designing a new sewer system or for improving the performance of an existed one in real world by increasing the density of street inlets and the number of tubes between gullies and sewer pipes the connection between surface inlets and underground sewers will become more distributed and the efficiency of drainage system will increase significantly in addition the manholes should not be used as the only receivers for surface water and should not be connected to too many side tubes the balance between the budget the additional engineering cost and the potential benefit of modifying existed systems should be analyzed in engineering design acknowledgements the authors express sincere gratitude to the funding by ministry of science and technology grant no most 106 2221 e 006 248 and are thankful to the taipei city government for providing the drainage data and investigated flood extent data 
7215,for a highly developed urban area with complete drainage systems flood simulation is necessary for describing the flow dynamics from rainfall to surface runoff and to sewer flow in this study a coupled flood model based on diffusion wave equations was proposed to simulate one dimensional sewer flow and two dimensional overland flow simultaneously the overland flow model provides details on the rainfall runoff process to estimate the excess runoff that enters the sewer system through street inlets for sewer flow routing three types of inlet modelling are considered in this study including the manhole based approach that ignores the street inlets by draining surface water directly into manholes the inlet manhole approach that drains surface water into manholes that are each connected to multiple inlets and the inlet node approach that drains surface water into sewer nodes that are connected to individual inlets the simulation results were compared with a high intensity rainstorm event that occurred in 2015 in taipei city in the verification of the maximum flood extent the two approaches that considered street inlets performed considerably better than that without street inlets when considering the aforementioned models in terms of temporal flood variation using manholes as receivers leads to an overall inefficient draining of the surface water either by the manhole based approach or by the inlet manhole approach using the inlet node approach is more reasonable than using the inlet manhole approach because the inlet node approach greatly reduces the fluctuation of the sewer water level the inlet node approach is more efficient in draining surface water by reducing flood volume by 13 compared with the inlet manhole approach and by 41 compared with the manhole based approach the results show that inlet modeling has a strong influence on drainage efficiency in coupled flood simulation keywords flood simulation coupled model sewer drainage urban infiltration 1 introduction over the last two decades numerical modeling has become an essential tool in urban flood analysis compared with rural areas developing flood models for urban areas is more complicated due to the coupling of sewer drainage systems schmitt et al 2004 smith 2006 in the early days of the field due to computational limitations researchers commonly paired one dimensional 1d sewer flow models sfms with simplified depth volume relationships to simulate flooding caused by drainage surcharges djordjević et al 1999 maksimović et al 2009 however this approach is oversimplified because it ignores the dynamics of two dimensional 2d surface runoff mark et al 2004 in recent years improvements in computer power and data resolution have boosted the popularization of 2d overland flow models ofms bates et al 2010 chen et al 2012 halcrow 2012 leandro et al 2014 as a result coupling of 1d sfm and 2d ofm has been drawing considerable attention in urban flood simulations hunter et al 2007 kuiry et al 2010 seyoum et al 2012 jahanbazi and egger 2014 russo et al 2015 leandro and martins 2016 the coupling of sfm and ofm can be concluded into two methods based on different considerations of the rainfall runoff process as proposed by chang et al 2015 the sfm ofm approach and the ofm sfm approach the sfm ofm approach allows excess rainfall to flow directly into the sfm first to enable the sewer flow simulation when manhole surcharge occurs the ofm is triggered for overland flow simulation djordevićet al 2005 chen et al 2007 leandro et al 2009 this approach obviously deviates from reality because it does not consider surface runoff dynamics which underestimates the upstream flooding and overestimates the downstream flooding chang et al 2015 in the ofm sfm approach the simulated rainfall is first routed by the ofm to generate surface runoff that travels some distance on the ground before discharging into sewer systems through drainage inlets and then is modelled by sfm although the ofm sfm is physically reasonable because it incorporates rainfall runoff dynamics the interaction between surface runoff and sewer water requires further considerations to correspond accurately to field situation most sfms are semi distributed thus they use manholes instead of street inlets to receive runoff by a lumped relationship with rainfall this method deviates from the reality because runoff is not accumulated through manholes in the real world but is accumulated through street inlets into gullies on road curbs that connect to an underground pipe segment between two manholes fig 1 in recent years the drainage performance of gullies has been studied by a few researchers martins et al 2014 lopes et al 2016 chang et al 2018 however because of data complexity and inaccessibility gullies are rarely incorporated into sewer simulations to consider the function of street inlets without gullies chang et al 2015 and bertsch et al 2017 adopted an alternative method that drained inlet discharges directly into a nearby manhole hereinafter inlet manhole approach in this approach manual judgement is required to establish a synthetic connection between each manhole and nearby inlets especially when a street inlet sits in the middle of two manholes instead of using manholes as the receiver bazin et al 2014 and noh et al 2016 connected each street inlet to a corresponding node on a sewer pipe for flow communication hereinafter inlet node approach which have demonstrated to be applicable in laboratory scale experiments however the inlet node approach has yet to be field tested on a large scale because extensive labor would be required to set the parameters for tens of thousands of street inlets in a modern sewer system to discover how inlet modeling affects the drainage efficiency in this study the function of street inlets was simulated using the inlet manhole and inlet node approaches simultaneously in the coupling of sfm and ofm the sfm and ofm were both developed on the basis of diffusion wave equations and were coupled for flood routing at street level with the consideration of infiltration related to land uses the inlet node approach was tested in practical scenarios by intersecting 1d sewer pipelines with 2d grid meshes on a geographical information system gis the two approaches were compared with another approach that drains surface water directly into manholes without using street inlets martins et al 2017 fan et al 2017 simulation results from these approaches were compared in the verification of a historical flood event that occurred in 2015 in taipei city taiwan the influence of inlet modeling on drainage efficiency was quantified by using the flood coefficient defined in this study the remainder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the theoretical considerations of the models are detailed the study area and the flood event are described in section 3 the spatial and temporal variations of flood extent and volume are verified in section 4 finally the research findings are concluded in section 5 2 methodology in this study both the sfm and ofm were constructed on the basis of diffusion wave equations which ignores the inertial terms because urban terrain tends to be relatively flat where the flow acceleration is small compared with gravity and friction mass exchange between the sfm and ofm is realized by adding corresponding discharge terms to the continuity equations the methodology is detailed as follows 2 1 simulation flow chart fig 3 displays the flowchart that provides the process of coupling the sfm and the ofm first the rainfall and land use data are read to determine the rainfall excesses after infiltration second the time step δ t determined by the courant friedrich lewy condition courant et al 1967 is employed to simultaneously initiate the 1d sfm and the 2d ofm for determining the velocity and flow depth respectively third the flow exchange rates q between 1d sfm and 2d ofm are calculated and then are introduced into the continuity equations for updating the flow depths on the surface and in the pipes for each grid cell and sewer node finally the whole process is repeated until the set final simulation time is reached 2 2 ofm for the overland flow simulation the 2d hydraulic model by hsu et al 2000 is adopted and modified by adding a source term to the continuity equation for receiving the flow surcharged from the 1d sfm the governing equations are expressed as 1 h t uh x vh y q q a o 2 h z x u n x 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 q hg 3 h z y v n y 2 u 2 v 2 h 4 3 q hg where eq 1 is the continuity equation eqs 2 and 3 are the diffusive momentum equations in x and y directions respectively u and v are the flow velocities in x and y directions respectively q is the effective rainfall h is the flow depth on the ground z is the elevation of ground surface g is the acceleration of gravity n x and n y are the manning s coefficient in x and y directions respectively a o is the area of 2d grid cell q is the sewer surcharge to the ground surface to solve eqs 1 3 hsu et al used the finite difference alternate direction explicit ade scheme that divides each time step δ t into two equivalent time intervals δ t 2 for alternatively updating the flow depth and velocity in x and y directions however in their scheme the v in eq 2 and the u in eq 3 in the friction terms were dropped so that the u in eq 2 and the v in eq 3 can be explicitly obtained in this study the scheme of hsu et al has been modified by solving the friction terms with the complete velocity expressions to increase the accuracy in the modified scheme the v in eq 2 and the u in eq 3 are known at the last time intervals while the u in eq 2 and the v in eq 3 are iteratively determined 2 3 sfm in this study a 1d sfm based on implicit finite difference algorithm has been developed for sewer flow simulation to calculate full and partially full pipe flows simultaneously the preissmann slot method cunge and wegner 1964 was adopted by creating a narrow slot above the sewer pipes by adding a sink term to the continuity equation that accounts for the flow surcharged to the ofm the continuity and diffusive momentum equation can be expressed as follows 4 a t va s q l 5 h z s n s 2 v v r 4 3 6 h f a if a a p d a a p b s if a a p where d is the pipe diameter a is the cross sectional area of flow a p is the cross sectional area of pipe l is the pipe length intersected within a grid cell h is the flow depth in the pipe z is the elevation of pipe bottom s is the flow direction r is the hydraulic radius n s is the manning s coefficient in s direction b s ga p a 2 and is the width of the slot a is the speed of pressure wave unlike the 2d model that uses an explicit ade scheme the 1d model employs the implicit backward euler method ascher and petzold 1998 which is solved by functional iteration piscard 1890 to improve its stability 2 4 interaction between the sfm and ofm three approaches were adopted in this study to consider the flow interaction between the sfm and ofm as shown in fig 2 fig 2 a displays the simplified manhole based approach that ignores the function of street inlets and infers that the surface water directly drains into the sewer system through manholes fig 2 b demonstrates the inlet manhole approach that drains surface water through multiple street inlets into a manhole via synthetic tubes fig 2 c illustrates the inlet node approach that drains surface water through individual street inlets into a corresponding sewer node at the center of the pipe segments that intersect with the 2d grid mesh in fig 2 b and c the street inlets are placed at the cell center to represent the summary cell inflow the intersection between the 1d pipelines and the 2d grid mesh is processed on a gis platform using this platform has the following benefits 1 the correspondence between the 1d and 2d elements is automatically established 2 the slope length elevation depth and diameter of the pipe segments within each cell are numerically determined without requiring any human intervention and 3 the intersection can be easily updated whenever a new version of pipe network or grid mesh is available in all the three approaches sewer water will surcharge through manholes to the nearest 2d cell center when the hydraulic head of sewer water exceeds that of surface water for a cell that has both manholes and street inlets the interactions between sewer water and surface water are bidirectional in this study inlet surcharge is not considered to mimic the function of gullies in the real world the gullies not only collect surface water from street inlets into sewer systems via lateral pipes but also play as a buffer storing the excessive water from sewer surcharges this explains why the sewer surcharges usually occur via manholes rather than inlets in the field although the gullies are not explicitly modelled in this study the sewer surcharges are only allowed to occur at manholes in order to fit the real situation the exchange rate between sewer and surface water is determined on the basis of the hydraulic heads of surface water z h z h and sewer water z h z h lee et al 2013 noh et al 2016 when z h z h the sewer water surcharges to the ground surface through manholes the surcharge can be estimated by using a weir or orifice equation as follows 7 q s 2 3 c w w m 2 g z h z h 3 2 for z h z h w 0 5 8 q s c o a m 2 g z h z h for z h z h w 0 5 where w m and a m are the perimeter and area of the manhole respectively c w is the weir coefficient and c o is the orifice coefficient when z h z h surface water discharges into sewer pipes through street inlets the discharge can be determined using the following equations 9 q i 2 3 c w w i 2 g z h z h 3 2 for z h z h w 0 5 10 q i c o a i 2 g z h z h for z h z h w 0 5 where w i and a i are the width and area of the street inlet respectively on the basis of eqs 7 10 the q in eqs 1 and 4 can be determined by varying the inlet modeling specifications for the manhole based approach q mq s where m is the number of manholes within a grid cell for the inlet node approach q mq s nq i where n is the number of street inlets within a grid cell according to the sewage design handbook of taiwan street inlets are installed in an interval of 5 m along each side of road curbs for the inlet manhole approach q mq s k 1 n nq i k where n is the number of cells that connect the street inlets to the manhole in all the three approaches m 0 and n 0 for grid cells without having manholes 2 5 boundary conditions in this study a structured grid mesh with a 5 5 m 2 cell resolution is adopted for the ofm simulation the elevation of the ground surface at each cell center is obtained from the data of a lidar derived digital elevation model that has 1 m resolution and 1 mm accuracy for the cells covered by buildings the ground elevations are elevated so that surface runoff will transport on the streets between buildings without traversing gironas et al 2009 the building roofs are set as flat without water retaining capability thus the water on the roofs will directly discharge into the neighbor ground cells by gravity to account for infiltration the runoff curve number cn method developed by united states department of agriculture hjelmfelt 1991 was adopted for calculating the rainfall excess the cn method was developed by considering the empirical relationship between rainfall runoff infiltration and potential maximum retention that varies with land use and antecedent moisture conditions the cn method is especially suitable for distributed 2d runoff simulation because it reflects the variation in permeability for each cell and has been widely used in practical applications with a detailed handbook for reference nrcs 2004 2 6 performance indicators the performance of the flood model is evaluated by comparing the simulated and post investigated maximum flood extents using the following performance indicators mason 1982 jang et al 2012 jang 2015 11 ocr h h m f c 12 htr h h m 13 far f f c where h hit represents the areas that are flooded and correctly predicted m miss alarm represents the areas that are flooded but are not predicted f false alarm represents the areas that are not flooded but are falsely predicted and c correct rejections denotes the areas that are not flooded and are not predicted the ocr htr and far denote the overall correctness rate hit rate and false alarm rate respectively meanwhile the coefficient c f f r is defined to quantify the efficiency of inlet on surface drainage where f is the maximum flood volume and r is the accumulated rainfall amount the coefficient c f is termed as the flood coefficient because it is conceptually similar to the discharge coefficient that is used to measure the ratio between outflow and inflow in a basin a smaller value of c f represents a higher efficiency of inlet drainage because more surface water has been drained into sewer systems 3 study area and flood event taipei city located in northern taiwan has a population of 2 7 million an area of 272 km 2 and well built drainage systems the entire drainage system was designed to prevent flooding under a rainfall intensity of 78 8 mm h the system comprises 769 km of sewer pipes and 87 pump stations that are capable of draining sewer water at a peak discharge of 2152 cm in this research daan and zhongzheng districts of taipei city are the areas adopted for study as shown in fig 4 the study area is bordered by the fanglan hill to the southeast and the levees along danshui river to the southwest which has an area of 19 km 2 and many important facilities such as traffic stations cultural centers and academic institutions fig 5 displays that the topography of the study area has an 160 m elevation drop from the south to the north the sewer system of the study area is shown in fig 6 which comprise two pump stations 141 km of pipe length 3571 manholes and more than 74 000 street inlets in the figure the sewer pipes are divided into eight sections that are responsible for conveying runoff water into the northern section of taipei s drainage system fig 7 illustrates seven basic types of land uses in the study area buildings for commercial residential school and hospital uses roads undeveloped green lands parks and forests this information is incorporated for the infiltration calculation by using the cn method the data of the flood event that occurred in the southern taipei city on june 14th 2015 hereinafter the 0614 event is adopted for the simulation the flood event was caused by a heavy rainstorm in the afternoon commonly seen in the summer seasons of taiwan to initiate runoff routing 10 min rainfall data retrieved from 55 rain stations in taipei are interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method idw to generate rainfall hyetographs at each 2d cell center fig 8 a displays the contour map of the accumulated rainfall and fig 8 b displays the rainfall hyetograph at the gongguan station where the maximum rainfall was observed the rainfall occurred at 13 20 and ended at 16 40 with a peak 10 min rainfall of 33 mm at around 14 50 hourly rainfall of 131 5 mm and total rainfall of 192 mm these values far exceed the design standard of taipei s drainage system 78 8 mm h during the 0614 event three areas experienced severe flooding these areas are displayed as zones i ii and iii in fig 8 a 4 model verification in model verification three scenarios are included for comparison the manhole based the inlet manhole and the inlet node approaches in fig 2 for all the scenarios the variables and parameters in the governing equations are the same for the ofm the manning s coefficients n x n y 0 035 for the sfm the manning s coefficient n s 0 017 the weir coefficient c w 0 48 and the orifice coefficient c o 0 57 the manhole capacity is determined according to the field data of manhole geometry given by the official engineering documents in the construction of sewer systems each pipe joint and manhole are integratively designed to meet the requirement of transporting a desired return period of flow discharge the manhole capacities are larger for larger drainage areas and are expanded at the joints of sewer pipes because they are responsible for receiving more surface water from more sewer inlets therefore in the study area each manhole capacity is not the same ranging from 0 5 m 3 to 217 m 3 with an mean of 14 m 3 since the influence of inlet capacity has been included in manhole design the manhole capacities are not modified for all the three scenarios from physical viewpoint this setting is reasonable because whether the sewer inlets are considered or not they do not change the drainage area for each manhole the same grid systems are applied as well for all the scenarios obtained from the intersection of 1d pipelines and 2d mesh the only difference lies in the setup of the number of cells that connect street inlets to the manhole n the value of n is set as zero for the manhole based approach one for the inlet node approach while the n value for the inlet manhole approach is determined according to the relative distances between the manhole and surrounding inlets the simulation time is similar for the three scenarios which are 1879 1880 and 1906 mins with an intel i7 processor at 4 2 ghz for the manhole based inlet manhole and inlet node approaches respectively 4 1 maximum flood extent table 1 summarizes the values of the performance indicators under the three scenarios for zone i zone ii and zone iii in general the htr far and ocr for inlet manhole and inlet node approaches shows no significant discrepancies the table reveals that when street inlet is considered the values of ocr for the inlet manhole and inlet node approaches exceed 0 8 slightly better than the ocr values for the manhole based approach meanwhile the value of far decreases from 0 3 for the manhole based approach to 0 18 for the inlet manhole and the inlet node approaches the htr represents the ratio of flooded area that is correctly predicted by simulation when the entire area is predicted flooded the htr equals to one even when the predictions are totally overestimated to prevent misinterpretation the htr should always be examined with far and ocr simultaneously the former often shows a pattern complementary to htr and the later combines the performance of htr and far although the htr values for the inlet manhole and inlet node approaches are slightly smaller than those for the manhole based approach in table 1 the ocr values for the inlet approaches are still higher due to a more significant decrease in the far value figs 9 11 display the satellite images and the comparison between the simulated and investigated flood extents under the three scenarios for zone i zone ii and zone iii respectively fig 9 a reveals that zone i is next to the daan mrt station and the chenggon public housing section accommodating nearly 2000 families the lanes between the buildings are only 5 10 m wide and do not have sufficient sewer pipes underneath as shown in fig 12 a fig 9 b d illustrates that the simulated flood extents are smaller when street inlets are taken into account fig 10 a displays that zone ii contains an mrt station to the east and a water park to the west although fig 5 indicates that zone ii has a higher elevation compared with the surrounding areas severe flooding still occurred because the zone was located at the rainfall center as displayed in fig 8 a fig 10 b d displays that the flooding on the main road in the middle of zone ii has been correctly predicted by all the three approaches however overestimations have been found on the small alleys between the buildings where the floodwater was trapped due to the absence of sewer pipes as shown in fig 13 a overall the flood extents are less overestimated by the inlet node approach especially on the alleys between the main roads and the mrt station this is because the surface water trapped upstream retreats faster when the floodwater downstream being drained more quickly by the inlet node approach compared with the former two zones fig 11 a shows that zone iii is mainly a campus area that is separated by two roads with less buildings and more green lands in the 0614 event severe flooding occurred on the intersection of keelung road and changxing street fig 11 b d displays that the flood extents are greatly overestimated by the manhole based approach compared with the flood extents of those scenarios that considered street inlets 4 2 flow exchange between sewer and surface water figs 12 14 illustrate the pipe network and the flow exchanges between sewer water and surface water for zone i zone ii and zone ii respectively for zone i the flow exchange rates at the given manhole in fig 12 a are displayed in fig 12 b d for the manhole based inlet manhole and inlet node approaches respectively where the water levels are the hydraulic heads related to the ground elevation when the street inlets are not considered the sewer water level increases much slower this is because the intervals between manholes are much larger than those between street inlets and the surface water must travel a longer distance before entering the sewer system thereby causing inefficient draining of surface water and overestimation of the flood extent the flow exchange rate switches rapidly between positive and negative for the inlet manhole approach indicating that discharge and surcharge occur alternatively this phenomenon is caused by the over draining of surface water from multiple street inlets thus causing a sudden rise in the hydraulic pressure at the manhole this pressure propagates along pipes to cause fluctuations in the sewer water level conversely the sewer water level for the inlet node approach remains constantly higher than the surface water level after surcharge this indicates that by draining surface water into distributed sewer nodes the hydraulic pressure along sewer pipes will be smoothly distributed without abrupt fluctuation at manholes fig 13 a d reveals that the flow exchanges between surface and sewer water in zone ii have similar patterns as those in zone i the water level in zone ii drops more rapidly than that in zone i because zone ii is located at a relative higher elevation and thus the water can be quickly drained downstream by gravity the rising and surcharging of sewer water is the least for the manhole based approach due to the inefficient draining of surface water whereas the fluctuations of sewer water are still the highest for the inlet manhole approach due to the over draining of surface water at manholes this fluctuation of the sewer water level causes discontinuous drawing of surface water which slows down the retreat of surface water in contrast even when the manhole surcharges are the highest for the inlet node approach the surface water retreats the fastest because the surcharge can be drained back to nearby sewer nodes immediately through street inlets in this case the continuous manhole surcharge is a positive sign that implies that the sewer system is functioning appropriately in fig 14 b c the manhole inflows for the manhole based and the inlet manhole approaches are much larger in zone iii than those in other zones this is because the output manhole in fig 14 a is located at the intersection of keelung road and changxing street which receives large amounts of runoff from the north campus the high discharges for the manhole based approach is a sign of inefficient draining due to the low level of sewer water thus implying that the sewer system does not reach its maximum capacity in gathering and transporting floodwater compared with the manhole based approach the manhole discharges for the inlet manhole approach are higher because it receives surface water from multiple street inlets the manhole discharge for the inlet manhole approach does not depend on the sewer and surface water levels at one point but depends on the sum of those at many points thus the manhole discharge in fig 14 c begins before surface flooding which is contributed by the street inlets at other points in a practical scenario such massive manhole discharges will not occur into a manhole because a manhole is not designed for draining surface water the discharge for the inlet node approach in fig 14 d is more reasonable because it is limited by the design capacity of individual street inlet overall the flow exchanges between sewer and surface water display a considerable amount of discrepancies for the inlet manhole and the inlet node approaches although the maximum flood extents are very similar 4 3 inlet efficiency on surface drainage to quantify the influence of inlet modeling on surface water reduction the temporal variations of flood volume for zone i zone ii and zone iii under the three aforementioned scenarios are displayed in fig 15 a c respectively the flood volumes decreases from the manhole based the inlet manhole to the inlet node approaches showing that draining surface water into manholes is less efficient than draining the water into distributed sewer nodes for flood reduction this inefficiency becomes more significant at the upstream areas such as zone ii where the surface water travels faster and the efficiency of inlet drainage becomes more crucial the flood coefficients for the three zones under different scenarios are summarized in table 2 the c f values for the inlet node approach are 0 57 0 52 and 0 54 for zone i zone ii and zone iii respectively which indicates that about half of the rainfall volumes are drained into sewer systems compared with the inlet node approach the c f values for inlet monhole approach are slightly larger increased by 0 08 for zone ii whereas the c f values for the manhole based approach are considerably higher increased by 0 38 for zone iii 5 conclusions in the last two decades the coupling between 1d sfm and 2d ofm has become an important research topic for sophisticated flood simulation in urban areas in the process of coupling the two models the dimensional difference between the models should be addressed because the ofm is a distributed model that uses hydraulic relationship but the sfm is a semi distributed model that uses hydrological relationship to determine surface runoff previous research has validated that rainfall should be first processed by an ofm for conducting runoff routing and then introduced into a sfm for sewer flow simulation however how to establish the correspondence between the street inlets on 2d grids and the nodes on 1d sewer pipes for receiving surface water has yet come to agreement some researchers have connected multiple street inlets to a manhole by using the inlet manhole approach whereas some others have connected each street inlet to a sewer node by using the inlet node approach to realize the influence of inlet modeling in a coupled flood simulation three approaches of coupling sfm and ofm are compared in this study the approaches include the inlet manhole approach which neglects street inlets and uses manholes for draining surface water the inlet node approach and the manhole based approach the methodology of coupling the sfm and ofm under different scenarios is developed and described in detail the flood event that occurred on june 14th 2015 in taipei city taiwan is adopted as study case in the comparison between simulated and investigated flood extents the flood extents for the manhole based approach are overestimated the most due to the lack of considering street inlets the flood extents are well predicted by the inlet manhole approach but the time series of the sewer water level fluctuates greatly due to the over draining of surface water into manholes this fluctuation results in discontinuous drainage of surface water through street inlets which leads to the inefficient draining of surface water into the sewer system in other words either for the manhole based or the inlet manhole approach the drainage efficiency eventually reduces when manholes are used as the final receivers of surface water by draining surface water into distributed sewer nodes rather than manholes the flood extents can be predicted more accurately and the fluctuation of sewer water level can be greatly reduced using the inlet node approach the time series of flood volume demonstrates that the flood volumes retreat the fastest by using the inlet node approach second by using the inlet manhole approach and the slowest by using the manhole based approach a flood coefficient c f is defined to quantify the efficiency of inlet drainage as the ratio between maximum flood volume and accumulated rainfall amount in a region the inlet modelled by the inlet node approach is the most efficient by having the smallest values of c f which are slightly smaller than those by the inlet manhole approach and much smaller than those by the manhole based approach the inlet node approach is more drainage efficient than the inlet manhole approach on draining surface water especially for areas at a higher ground overall the simulation results indicate that the distributed one to one relationship between street inlets and sewer nodes by the inlet node approach is the most efficient in draining surface water this finding is valuable for designing a new sewer system or for improving the performance of an existed one in real world by increasing the density of street inlets and the number of tubes between gullies and sewer pipes the connection between surface inlets and underground sewers will become more distributed and the efficiency of drainage system will increase significantly in addition the manholes should not be used as the only receivers for surface water and should not be connected to too many side tubes the balance between the budget the additional engineering cost and the potential benefit of modifying existed systems should be analyzed in engineering design acknowledgements the authors express sincere gratitude to the funding by ministry of science and technology grant no most 106 2221 e 006 248 and are thankful to the taipei city government for providing the drainage data and investigated flood extent data 
7216,the estimation of evaporative fluxes and their effects on soil suction is assuming a prominent role in the field of interpretation and early warning prediction of rainfall induced landslides evaporation models refer essentially to sands or plastic silty and clayey soils models validated specifically for non plastic silty pyroclastic soils usually characterized by very high porosity are instead unavailable this deficit arises although silty pyroclastic covers are widely spread across the world increasingly involved in rainfall induced landslides and recognized showing particular hydrological behaviour a number of questions may be raised about the issue i may any evaporative models be reliably extended to silty pyroclastic soils ii what atmospheric variables need to be monitored at least to reliably predict evaporation fluxes in these soils and iii how accurate evaporation estimations are if they are referred to silty pyroclastic covers for early warning purposes this study addresses these questions by assessing the capabilities of several simplified models in estimating evaporative potential and actual fluxes for silty pyroclastic soils to this aim a large scale lysimeter consisting in a silty pyroclastic layer exposed to the atmosphere and comprehensively monitored for both weather forcing and hydrological soil variables is adopted it provides a dataset of observations suitable to calibrate and validate the selected evaporation models moreover the availability of weather observations makes it possible to define the minimum set of equipment required to attain reliable evaporation estimation this study shows that i the adoption of a literature based calibration can produce misleading estimates of actual evaporation whereas the model performances after a lysimeter based recalibration are satisfactory ii reducing the weather measurements can induce an overestimation of predicted fluxes up to 50 and iii the investigated models quite accurately predict water out coming fluxes while running in early warning predictions keywords bare soil evaporation pyroclastic soil landslide soil water storage landslide prediction 1 introduction the risk associated to rainfall induced landslides in loose pyroclastic soils widely spread across the world especially in the subtropical zones is recognized as increasing over the last decades brand 1984 cascini et al 2000 picarelli et al 2008 eichenberger et al 2013 shimizu and ono 2016 chávez et al 2016 yamao et al 2016 under the increasing heavy rainfalls likely to be caused by climate changes ng and leung 2016 and or due to an exposure growth of communities and assets located at the toe of vulnerable slopes research has recently accelerated in investigating the hydrological behaviour of these soils above all after the famous events occurred in sarno and quindici italy 1998 and numerous other minor events causing significant damage and even fatalities in highly vulnerable areas cascini and ferlisi 2003 olivares and damiano 2007 pagano et al 2008 pagano et al 2010 the thicknesses and specific stratigraphic alternations of these soil layers are strongly influenced by several factors such as the proximity to the eruptive centres wind direction and magnitude at eruption time and the gradient of the slope as a direct result of their genesis and mineralogy these soils exhibit non or only slightly plastic and cohesionless behaviour and usually are very porous with values up to 0 75 when the silty fraction is significant soil small size pores determine infiltrating rainfall water to be retained as meniscus water subject to suction which induces a strength contribution allowing the cover to be stable on slopes even steeper than the soil friction angle however such contribution decreases under increasing water content up to potentially attain slope instability conditions field monitoring has often been carried out in the attempt to characterize the evolution of the slope hydrological state and related stability conditions suction and soil moisture yielded by monitoring activities carried out within unsaturated slopes previously involved in rainfall induced landslides deliver interesting hydrological patterns comegna et al 2016 papa et al 2013 napolitano et al 2015 these latter along with numerical studies pagano et al 2010 cascini et al 2014 napolitano et al 2015 indicate that rainfall induced landslides are regulated by the coupling effect of a heavy rainfall over several hours after periods when soil water content has significantly increased over an antecedent period of months rianna et al 2014b provide a physical explanation about the effects related to this coupling the significant length of the antecedent time window estimated up to 4 months by pagano et al 2010 entails that not only rainfall infiltration but also evapotranspiration can significantly affect the soil water content within the pyroclastic soils on regional and global scales assessment of evapotranspirative fluxes and their effects on soil suction in the evaluation of slope stability conditions represents however a topic that has been addressed in a systematic and widespread way only relatively recently blight 2006 fredlund et al 2012 leung and ng 2013 calabresi et al 2013 rianna et al 2014a b both theoretical and experimental studies have highlighted that assuming evapotranspirative fluxes to be negligible compared with rainfall infiltration flux leads to a too conservative assessment of slope stability reder et al 2018 at present early warning predictive tools ewpts focus essentially on estimating rainfall effects baum and godt 2010 capparelli and tiranti 2010 sirangelo and versace 1996 terranova et al 2018 evapotranspiration effects are usually not properly considered e g adopting empirical or very simplified approaches or even completely neglected by these tools the present research attempts to provide such hints to properly manage the out coming flux component of evapotranspiration to this aim it investigates the reliability of models that in their simplicity are able to predict evapotranspiration fluxes with the promptness required by a ewpt the aim is achieved by calibrating and validating four simplified evaporation models characterized by four different control variables the range of their application to silty pyroclastic soils characterized by wide grain size distribution non plastic behaviour and high porosity is yet to be verified as the literature in this field provides no indication on the matter throughout the study the validation calibration procedures for the selected models are carried out using a comprehensive set of experimental records provided by a large scale lysimeter it consists of a silty pyroclastic layer put in place in a tank by pluvial deposition exposed to weather elements over several years and amply equipped with instruments for measuring evaporative fluxes along with other meteorological and hydrological variables rianna et al 2014a pagano et al 2014a b the research is conducted under the assumption of a bare surface this assumption is reasonable as part of the evaporative flux takes place through soil atmosphere contact also under vegetated conditions in addition model validation assessment is advised initially under simple conditions even in view of subsequent assessment under a more complex vegetated surface specifically the study attempts to address the following objectives for silty pyroclastic soils i addressing the accuracy of potential evaporation pe models 3 1 4 1 5 1 ii investigating the inaccuracy implications determined by a partial missing in atmospheric variable records required as input for evaporation models 3 2 4 2 5 2 iii addressing the accuracy of actual evaporation ae models 3 3 4 3 5 3 and iv broader implications for landslide early warning prediction investigating the accuracy that ae models have in their role of

the four items above recalled and those achieved in this study the potential improvements beyond the state of the art will be adequately discussed in 5 2 study site and materials the reference material adopted for this study is a typical ash erupted by the volcanic apparatus of vesuvius italy consisting of a non plastic silty pyroclastic soil fig 1 b the ash comes from the stratigraphic series of monteforte irpino campania region southern italy and its properties have been widely studied nicotera et al 2010 pirone et al 2015 its intrinsic properties fig 1b and soil porosity approximately equal to 70 are fully comparable to those of the volcanic sloping cover involved in the flowslide event that occurred in the nocera inferiore district campania region on 4th march 2005 the hydrological response of this material was investigated under the effects of actual weather conditions by a large scale lysimeter fig 1a rianna et al 2014a it consists of a wooden tank base 1 15 1 15 m height 0 75 m where the material itself was placed and exposed to weather element while observing weather variables regulating the soil state and soil atmosphere flux exchanges the layer s lateral boundaries are impervious the uppermost surface is left bare the lowermost surface behaves as a seepage surface thanks to a geotextile thickness 2 mm interposed between the layer and the holed tank base which behaves as a capillary barrier reder et al 2017 the large scale lysimiter is in particular equipped to best quantify evaporative fluxes and the soil s hydrological and thermal variables variations in water storage δws induced by infiltration i actual evaporation ae and deep drainage d flows are measured as weight changes in the layer thanks to three load cells sustaining the tank specifically for suction values at the bottom higher than zero drainage phenomena are prevented by the capillary barrier if this condition takes place in the absence of precipitation p decreases in ws correspond to ae ae δws while during precipitations the increase in ws corresponds to the amount of rainfall infiltration i i δws the occurrence layer drainage is detected collecting

totally or partially satisfy the evaporative demand returning the actual evaporation ae mm day hillel 2004 mcvicar et al 2012 3 1 estimating pe for bare soil using evaporation models pe is quantified using two models the first model namely the penman 1948 model is a physically based approach that combines the dalton type formulation gray 1970 with the heat budget equation to obtain a relationship

variables that govern the evaporative process are explicit in the formula mcvicar et al 2012 donohue et al 2010 showed that such model represents the most appropriate form of pe in a changing climate context the second model derives from the so called dual crop coefficient approach as provided by the fao guidelines see chapter 7 of the guidelines allen et al 1998 in its original release the fao guidelines provide a procedure to obtain actual evapotranspiration aet in mm days under standard conditions where no water limitations are placed on crop growth based on a reference evapotranspiration

suggest adopting kcmax 1 15 for the case of bare soil in the latter condition the potential evaporation is higher than the reference evapotranspiration due to an enhanced capacity for the shallower soil layers to store heat 3 2 estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 in partial missing of input atmospheric variables the pe models of 3 1 require primarily measurements of the following variables as input data net radiation rn solar radiation rs relative humidity rh temperature t wind velocity w and heat flux through the soil g all these variables are not always measured and available in practical application the absence of some of them has often addressed by adopting simplified assumptions as those provided by fao guidelines their effects are then investigated the cases analysed are the following allen et al 1998 i missing heat flux through the soil g simplified assumption g is assumed to vanish ii missing net radiation rn simplified assumption rn is estimated from measurements of solar radiation rs pyranometer data daily air temperature t and daily relative humidity rh iii missing net radiation rn and pyranometer data rs simplified assumption rn is estimated as in case 2 by replacing measured rs with the value rs provided by applying a procedure based on assessment of the duration of bright sunshine and the diurnal temperature range iv missing wind measurements w simplified assumption w is assumed to be at the constant rate of 2 m s v missing relative humidity measurements rh simplified assumption rh is derived from daily maximum and minimum air temperature vi missing all variables except air temperature t simplified assumptions all the simplified approaches above are adopted all together to estimate g case 1 rn case 3 w case 4 and rh case 5 sequentially since the effects of these assumptions depend exclusively on weather variables the investigation is carried out considering the reference evapotranspiration et0 as provided by fao guidelines allen et al 1998 3 3 estimating ae for bare soil using evaporation models two major types of models used to estimate actual evaporation ae in mm day are remote sensing based and ground measurement based models yang 2017 the first type considers models that estimate the components of the energy balance equation e g net radiation sensible heat flux heat flux through the ground surface assuming the latent heat as unknown yang 2017 kalma et al 2008 the models of second type include empirical micrometeorological and soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models in this study models of the second type based on preliminary estimation of potential evaporation pe and on a reduction of pe associated to topsoil water availability are selected to estimate ae for bare soil in this regard two main categories of model may be distinguished the first one concerns models estimating topsoil water availability through a water balance providing the amount of topsoil water available at time t as the difference between incoming infiltrating rainfalls i and out coming ae fluxes over antecedent time periods up to t the second category concerns models univocally relating topsoil water availability to a physical variable v which may be provided by monitoring activity or computed using theoretical models suitable v variables are water content θ water storage ws or suction s if v is detected experimentally ae estimation at a given time t usually considered on the daily scale does not require the knowledge of antecedent fluxes i and ae crossing the soil atmosphere interface while in the other case it has to be estimated through the assessment or the measure of fluxes through the boundaries this work analyses and validates four different approaches developed to quantify ae two of them ritchie 1972 r and boesten and stroosnijder 1986 bs fall into the first category the remaining aydin 1998 ay and allen et al 1998 al also known as the fao model fall into the second category these models were selected consistently with a presumed employment as components of ewpt the first two base merely on pe prediction resulting suitable for applications where only conventional atmospheric variables are monitored their prediction accuracy then strongly depends on what atmospheric variables are made available see 3 2 4 2 5 2 still basing on a preliminary pe prediction the second two give the opportunity of exploiting for more accurate predictions the availability of monitored hydrological soil variables r and bs models assume that actual evaporation ae is equal to potential evaporation pe only when the cumulative actual evaporation σae is below a specific limit indicated as u for the former and β2 for the latter as soon as this threshold is exceeded further ae fluxes occur at a rate lower than pe the two models differ in terms of the different falling law they implement in the r model the falling law is a simple and rough function of time 7 for ae u ae u α t ae α t α t 1 where ae cumulative actual evaporation mm pe cumulative potential evaporation mm t time s u limit below which ae pe mm α factor depending on the soil hydraulic properties mm s0 5 in the bs model on the other hand the falling law is wholly regulated by the evolution of pe and based on an explicit reduction of pe 8 for ae β 2 ae β 2 β pe ae β pe n β pe n 1 where in addition to the variables listed above β factor depending on the soil hydraulic properties mm0 5 n daily index in short the first model takes no account of the dependency of the actual evaporation rate on atmospheric forcing the opportunity it offers to run an estimation without atmospheric experimental data for pe reduction is appealing allowing computation in cases where meteorological data are unavailable on the other hand this advantage may be lost because of excessive loss of accuracy in ae estimation especially in the case of meteorological patterns departing from those normally expected under singular atmospheric conditions characterized by pe patterns well below the average trend for the period the model may generate physical inconsistency where ae pe the authors suggest solving this inconsistency by simply placing ae pe the bs model is obviously more complete rational and accurate as it explicitly accounts for atmospheric forcing regulating the evaporative demand the ay and al models assume that the actual evaporation is equivalent to the potential evaporation ae pe when the imbibition state of the topsoil expressed by a control variable v is higher than a threshold v in the former model v is identified with the topsoil suction level s so that ae pe occurs when s s ay in the latter model v is identified with the topsoil volumetric water content θ so that ae pe occurs for θ θ al for both models the same variable characterizing the topsoil imbibition level also regulates the ae falling law expressed as an explicit reduction of pe 9 ae kpe where ae actual evaporation mm day pe potential evaporation mm day k reduction coefficient ranging between 1 actual evaporation at the potential value and 0 actual evaporation at zero with imbibition level at the residual value θral or sray for the ay model the expression of the reduction coefficient is 10 k ay log s log s ray log s ay log s ray where k ay reduction coefficient for ay model s topsoil suction value kpa s ay topsoil suction value below which k ay 1 kpa s ray topsoil residual suction value corresponding to air dry water suction kpa such value may be estimated in the overlying atmosphere using the kelvin equation

rew so called readily evaporable water mm allen et al 1998 relate it to the soil type tew so called total evaporable water mm ze depth of the topsoil subject to drying due to evaporation mm typically set between 20 and 30 cm θwp water content below which root water uptake is inhibited is often conventionally identified as the value corresponding to suction values of 1500 kpa 3 4 broader implications for landslide early warning prediction ewpt for rainfall induced landslides require expeditious approaches predicting fluxes through the surface namely the amount of rainfall water infiltrating the cover i and that lost in runoff r and actual evaporation ae predicting water content reductions during dry periods to explore how and if the four selected models could work within an early warning prediction the layer in the large scale lysimeter has been considered to be a virtual cover subjected to the prediction of its hydrological state the layer water storage ws obtained by measuring continuously the layer weight has been assumed as a key variable identifying the hydrological state of the layer in relation to slope stability conditions fig 3 plots the four experimental ws time histories recorded for each hydrological year of the experiment it shows ws increases during the wet season october april and decreases during the dry season may september the attained ws peaks reach a same level except that in the second year which resulted significantly lower due to scarcer than average precipitations occurred during the wet season 4 results 4 1 estimating pe for bare soil using evaporation models for each hydrological year fig 4 plots the cumulated measurements of actual evaporation ae obtained by summing up the daily water storage decreases for dry days p 1 mm detected by measuring layer weight changes the same figure plots the cumulated values of potential evaporation pe carried out by adopting penman shuttleworth model and the modified dual crop coefficient model as provided by allen et al 2005 with literature based parameters ε 0 90 and kcmax 1 15 respectively both ae and pe are plotted against a control variable of the topsoil imbibition state as control variable the volumetric water content measured at the depth of 15 cm θ 15 has been assumed the layer field capacity θfc was estimated experimentally as equal to 0 485 rianna et al 2014a taken as the threshold below which drainage becomes negligible between θs 15 at saturation and θfc 15 the layer supplies full availability of water for evaporation so that changes in actual evaporation measured as water losses correspond to changes also in potential evaporation thus in this range of θ shaded areas in fig 4 pe is directly measured and as such it represents a reliable reference for validating the literature based parameters ε 0 90 and kcmax 1 15 within the range θs 15 θfc 15 the penman shuttleworth model set following literature based suggestions at ε 0 90 reproduces observations satisfactorily whereas the modified dual crop coefficient model set at kc 1 15 significantly departs from observations underestimating them the kcmax parameter has been then calibrated by minimizing the residual between the measured and predicted values within the range θs 15 θfc 15 the minimization procedure yielded kcmax 2 21 and results plotted fig 5 the updated value allows the modified dual crop coefficient model to yield predictions fully consistent with the observations within the calibration range except over the third year out of calibration range predictions yielded by both models fig 5 initially match the measurements and then gradually depart from them starting from a well identified θ 15 value this ability of the model to reproduce pe also outside the calibration range greatly encourages considering the departure point θ 15 to truly be threshold below which the atmospheric evaporative demand starts to be increasingly less sustained by water availability with decreasing θ actual evaporation becoming progressively lower than potential evaporation as expected the value of θ 15 is quite equivalent for all the years involved and corresponds to 0 425 4 2 estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 in partial missing of input atmospheric variables this section is devoted to assessing how simplified estimations for missing weather variables 3 2 could affect the et0 estimation compared to full availability of observed data the hydrological year 2012 2013 was selected for this purpose in fig 6 the left plots compare the measured and fao hypothesized trends for input variables the right plots compare the two related et0 trends in terms of both daily and cumulated values disregarding the contribution of soil heat flux g point i fig 6a and b only a slight variation in the et0 is estimated about 4 rarely exceeding 1 mm day fig 6b on the other hand the simplified assumptions suggested by the fao guidelines for rn and rs point ii and point iii respectively overestimate radiation components over the entire hydrological year and consistently overestimate et0 values fig 6c d and e f during the wetter period from the beginning of november until the end of april rn estimated as a function of measured rs point ii is about 2 mj m2 day fig 6c against observed rn values close to zero during the drier period from the beginning of may until the end of october spread increases with estimated rn of about 12 mj m2 day against observed rn of about 8 mj m2 day this leads to an overestimation of et0 fig 6c and d of 28 rn estimated as a function of rs is further overestimated as rs is systematically above observed rs point iii fig 6e during the wetter period values of rs are in the order of 7 8 mj m2 day against observed rs of 2 6 mj m2 day during the drier period the spread increases with estimated rs in the order of 20 22 against observed rs in the order of 16 18 mj m2 day this leads fig 6f to an overestimation of et0 of 36 the assumption of wind velocity equal to 2 m s point iv fig 6i also entails a marked overestimation of et0 fig 6l compared with the case of measured wind velocity for the investigated site a typical urban area the observed wind velocity is 0 4 m s on average which is significantly lower than the fao hypothesized value the simplified assumption consequently overestimates the drying power exerted by the wind resulting in a significant overestimation of et0 at 41 in this case no significant differences between wet and dry periods are recognizable replacing the observed rh values by the fao hypothesized ones point v fig 6i and l also produces only slight effects in terms of et0 estimation despite the remarkable overestimation of rh yielded by the fao prediction this result indicates the minor role played by relative humidity in the et0 estimation fig 7 compares et0 computed in the availability of all needed measurements and et0 computed in the not rare hypothesis that only air temperature records are made available if only temperature measurements fig 7 are available there is a combination of inaccuracies that increases the divergence between measured and fao hypothesized et0 this results on average 50 higher than measured et0 with a difference of 2 mm day over the dry seasons and 0 5 1 mm day in other periods from these results it is clear that evaporation assessments performed with limited weather datasets should be used with care overestimation of the atmospheric demand could lead to an underestimation of actual soil water content erring on the unsafe side in slope stability analysis 4 3 estimating ae for bare soil using evaporation models the performances of the four selected evaporation models for ae prediction 3 3 are tested from the point of view of their ability to reproduce ae trends detected experimentally by the large scale lysimeter this task was composed by two stages i model performance was tested by quantifying model parameters on the basis of literature based indications requiring details about grain size distribution volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity function table 2 and ii model performance was tested after recalibrating the models by best fitting ae experimental data provided by the large scale lysimeter over the first two hydrological years by a conventional minimization procedure validation has then been based on comparing prediction with measurements available over the two remaining hydrological years table 2 all the models were examined by computing potential evaporation using the penman shuttleworth model as this resulted more accurate in reproducing pe large scale lysimeter records over the entire time span of the experiment see fig 5 as regards stage a fig 8 plots experimental and theoretical trends of cumulative ae against volumetric water content θ 15 the same figure also represents potential evaporation trend calculated using the penman shuttleworth model fig 9 plots in the same format as in fig 8 results obtained after lysimeter based recalibration within the range between θfc 15 and θ 15 all ae predictions calibrated based on indications found in the literature match the penman shuttleworth pe prediction and consequently the measurements see also fig 5 except the r model prediction that yields a departure point θ r systematically higher than θ 15 table 2 for θ θ all predicted ae trends substantially depart from the observations returning poor performance specifically al ay and bs models overestimate the observed evaporation losses and under predict the departure point θ 15 with the exception of the bs model in the first year the r model underestimates evaporation losses except in the second year within the recalibration range first two years all models yield predictions slightly exceeding measurements fig 9a and b the predictive performance outside the recalibration range third and fourth years although satisfactory still results in a slight ae overestimation fig 9c and d with a cumulating maximum spreading between predicted and observed not exceeding 16 ay model in the first year for r and bs the departure points are similar to the observed θ 15 while for al and ay the departure point is higher than θ 15 overestimation of ae depends essentially on the models falling laws intrinsically reducing the losses less than they should to better fitting measurements 4 4 broader implications for landslide early warning prediction the ae predictions yielded by the four selected models adopting lysimeter based parameters have been used to estimate water storage ws reductions over all dry periods not involving drainage phenomena from the layer bottom to predict ws over time ae values should have been complemented by rainfall infiltration estimations over wet periods because the examination of the approaches modelling rainfall infiltration is outside the scope of the present work this aspect of the problem was treated simply by assuming the measured amounts as rainfall infiltration rather than those yielded by a theoretical prediction ws evolution obtained by alternating ae predictions with infiltration measurements was then compared with the fully observed ws evolution over the dry periods p 1 mm ws decreases have been predicted by each of the four selected models for each of them the specific controlling variable none for r pe for bs θ15 for al s15 for ay was quantified by experimental data monitored for the layer fig 10 compares for each hydrological year recorded ws trend with the four predicted trends yielded by the selected ae models it may be noted fig 10 that all the ae models are quite suitable for reproducing the observed ws reductions and consequently for working within an early warning prediction in particular also the models pertaining to the first category if suitably calibrated could result in reliable predictions of the hydrological behaviour of a silty pyroclastic layer encouraging is especially the ae agreement arising over the second year when the layer hydrological behaviour was in regulated by long ae phenomena occurring at low intensity during the autumnal and winter seasons due to the mentioned exceptionally rare precipitations 5 discussion 5 1 estimating pe for bare soil using evaporation models as already pointed out within the range θs 15 θfc 15 the penman shuttleworth model reproduces observations satisfactorily by adopting a literature based parameter ε 0 90 penman 1948 the modified dual crop coefficient model yields instead predictions inconsistent with observations for literature based parameter kcmax 1 15 allen et al 2005 matching observations only after a lysimeter based recalibration kcmax 2 21 the value provided by recalibration significantly exceeds further literature based values and reported in table 1 snyder et al 2000 ventura et al 2006 this systematic exceeding may partially be related to the porosity of the investigated soil 0 7 that since resulting well above soil porosities associated with the cited works should enhance soil atmosphere water exchange it is worth observing fig 5 that cumulating pe estimated by the adopted models over each hydrological year are well above cumulating ae the latter attains values between 650 and 750 mm against an estimated cumulating pe typically higher than 1000 1100 mm this simple comparison makes clear that it is not reliable at all to base an estimation of layer water losses on pe since especially during late spring and summer such an assumption would result in an overestimation of out coming fluxes 5 2 estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 in partial missing of input atmospheric variables considering the results of 4 2 figs 6 and 7 the most significant findings are that the simplified assumptions suggested by the fao guidelines overestimate radiation components over the entire hydrological year and consistently et0 values assuming wind velocity equal to 2 m s also results into a marked overestimation of et0 compared with the case of measured wind velocity similar researches were performed by tomas burguera et al 2017 in spain popova et al 2006 in bulgaria and boldini et al 2014 in central italy table 1 common features to all these studies are that i the inaccuracy in et0 prediction is quantified estimating divergences between et0 as resulting from full availability of atmospheric data and et0 as resulting from replacing lacking data with the estimations suggested in the fao guidelines ii the net radiation rn is not measured but obtained indirectly from measurements of solar radiation rs daily air temperature t and daily relative humidity rh and iii four cases among the six considered in the present work are investigated missing solar radiation rs missing wind measurements w missing relative humidity measurements rh missing all variables except air temperature t all these cases consider the same simplified assumptions of 3 2 for points iii iv v vi table 3 compares results of tomas burguera et al 2017 popova et al 2006 and boldini et al 2014 with those obtained in this work 4 2 the listed studies confirm the minor influence of relative humidity and the key role played by solar radiation and wind velocity except the work by tomas burguera et al 2017 which results are affected by relative humidity they also indicate that variations underestimation or overestimation of et0 determined by the unavailability of all measurements except t are consistent with those determined when only w is missing this further highlights the importance of w measurement availability and could be explained considering that temperature indirectly relates to all atmospheric variables affecting evaporation except w 5 3 estimating ae for bare soil using evaporation models for all the models recalibration stage improves the accuracy in ae prediction 4 3 returning a new set of parameters suitable for silty pyroclastic soils differences between literature based and lysimeter based parameters are discussed in this section for the r and bs models the literature suggests knisel 1980 quantifying u or β2 as a function of hydraulic conductivity k 10 corresponding to a suction level of s 10 kpa fig 11 a linear increasing trend is recommended within the k 10 range 5 8 10 9 and 2 0 10 8 m s of investigated materials ritchie 1972 constant trends linking to the linear trend are suggested outside this range the k 10 of the material in hand 3 5 10 8 m s falls within the upper constant trend returning u β2 13 2 mm such a value is in line with those provided by snyder et al 2000 and ventura et al 2006 for silty clay the recalibration of two models yields u 48 8 mm differing from β2 96 mm and both are significantly higher than literature based values see fig 8 recalibration thus suggests that outside the range investigated by ritchie 1972 the increasing trend persists and may follow an exponential rather than a linear pattern in terms of departure points the differences between the predicted and observed θ reduce significantly or vanish after re calibration table 2 for al model eqs 11 and 12 are considered for estimating the departure point θ al and the residual volumetric water content θral in both equations θfc is set equal to the value 0 485 provided by rianna et al 2014a the first parameter θ al is quantified 0 448 setting rew 11 mm as provided by allen et al 1998 for silty sand and ze 30 cm considering the fact that this value means that the tdr15 placed at the topsoil is mid height for the second parameter θral fao guidelines suggest it be quantified as θ corresponding to suction level 1500 kpa in the soil water retention curve the plot in fig 2a yielded θwp 0 227 under this assumption eq 12 provided tew 77 4 mm recalibration dropped rew to zero increased θ al to the value of θfc and increased tew by about 7 for ay model the departure point and residual state are quantified both expressed this time in terms of suction thresholds s ay and sray respectively to achieve a parameter setting consistent with that of the al model both thresholds were derived from the water content thresholds of the al model θ al and θral respectively referring to the soil water retention curve fig 2a the recalibration of the model resulted table 2 in a slight reduction of the departure point and a significant decreasing of the residual value sray 249 kpa corresponding however to a more contained increase in θray from 0 227 to 0 261 in fig 12 the ay parameters departure point s ay and residual state sray are compared with experimental points carried out by tran et al 2016 interpreting the column evaporation tests of wilson 1990 bruch 1993 and yanful and choo 1997 for different soil types mainly sand and silt on the basis of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat such a comparison shows that in terms of s ay fig 12a the investigated pyroclastic silty sand behaves as a sand material while in terms of sray fig 12b it tends to have a behaviour of a silty material to gain a deeper insight into the differences among the selected four models each of them was adopted using recalibrated parameters to simulate a much simpler full theoretical scenario starting from saturated conditions it was hypothesized that constant daily potential evaporation occurred over 500 days fig 13 plots the ae prediction yielded by each model over the defined reference time span for three different pe levels 5 3 and 1 mm day ae time trends appear to be in fewer agreements with respect to ae θ trends previously considered in fig 9 the models pertaining to the second category preserve a certain degree of reciprocal consistency in predicting ae evolution under all three pe levels considered testifying a certain objectivity characterizing their response the models pertaining to the first category yield reciprocal agreement to degree that differs pathologically for the three pe evolutions analysed all the plots in fig 13 indicate that the models pertaining to the first category show a drop at departure time this drop is due to the fact that ae prediction after departure time is related to time r model or pe bs models by a constant coefficient which can only induce abrupt changes in ae at departure time this drop is only apparently attenuated in the r model predictions in reality the model predicts an upward abrupt increase not represented in fig 13 characterized by ae being higher than pe at the departure time which was eliminated by forcing ae pe each model except r yields departure time that always corresponds to the same amount of cumulated ae so that decreasing pe results into a delayed departure time for the r model the represented departure time is further delayed with respect to that yielded by the prediction due to the inconsistency ae pe mentioned above this inconsistency increases with decreasing daily pe delaying the time at which the falling law produces a condition where ae pe in this way the cumulated ae amount at departure time increases as the daily pe intensity decreases generating physically unacceptable matter that translates into increasing disagreement with the predictions yielded by other models the bs model limit consists in relating departure time drop magnitude and post drop trend by adopting the same coefficient β in particular increasing β implies univocally delaying departure time and contextually attenuating ae drops after this time fig 14 models of the second category relate ae to pe through a coefficient that takes into consideration the imbibition state ranging between 1 ae pe and 0 ae 0 this provides continuity at departure time in ae evolution in addition the departure time and the post departure trend may be regulated independently of each other with the latter being physically controlled by the real availability of water in the topsoil this introduces an important feature with respect to models for the first category the possibility to control and calibrate the time at which daily ae becomes negligible realistically 5 4 broader implications for landslide early warning prediction as recalled in the introduction section the significance of antecedent hydrological conditions on triggering of landslide events in pyroclastic covers has been stressed in different works e g de vita and piscopo 2002 pagano et al 2010 albeit strongly related to geomorphological features stratigraphy slope angle exposition state conditions porosity and degree of saturation and evolution of meteorological variables antecedent periods two three months long at least have been recognized as significant in affecting soil hydrological conditions this time length is such to make water losses from cumulating aet significant these phenomena have then been increasingly taken into consideration in recent works aimed at developing ewpt for rainfall induced landslides in this field fiorillo and wilson 2004 estimated aet through the simplified approach proposed by thornthwaite 1948 its use was limited however to estimate the soil water budget for soil water content values lower than field capacity and within the root depth area 1 m laboratory based calibration of parameters was only carried out without any support of larger scale data and actual meteorological conditions for calibration and validation napolitano et al 2015 adopted a physically based approach for interpreting field monitoring data retrieved by a pyroclastic cover in sarno area interpretation of suction and water content measurements conducted by taking into account aet losses resulted into intensity duration thresholds required for landslide triggering provided thresholds are different for summer high atmospheric demand and low cumulating rainfalls and winter low atmospheric demand and high cumulating rainfalls and this difference represents just the way authors account for evapotranspiration phenomena the oversimplification in considering only two antipodal scenarios is supposed to not allow reliable predictions in interpreting complex meteorological evolutions especially those arising during the transition seasons autumn and spring typically characterized by high probability of landslide occurrence in several expeditious ewpt evapotranspiration losses are totally disregarded de vita and piscopo 2002 comegna et al 2017 this study shows how all the four different approaches if properly calibrated could reliably reproduce the soil evaporation experienced by a pyroclastic cover improving the assessment of antecedent hydrological conditions and requiring a low computational effort in line with constraints of ewpt 6 conclusion the research investigated the dynamics regulating evaporation phenomena in silty pyroclastic soils referring to the experimental data of a large scale lysimiter providing evaporative fluxes in relation to meteorological forcing topsoil state and selected models estimating potential and actual evaporation the experimental data the calibration of the different models and critical discussion of the results make it possible to draw the following conclusions i as regards estimating pe the available models provide accuracy in prediction if they are properly calibrated considering soil specific and climate features ii the accuracy in estimating evaporation is main function of availability of some key meteorological variables temperature wind and radiation recorded at the site involved in the prediction a rough assessment of merely temperature based estimation of et0 led to inaccuracy 50 wind velocity and net radiation observations in addition to temperature measurements resulted crucial in increasing accuracy in et0 estimation and are therefore strongly recommended this conclusion is not surprising as these elements regulate the main mechanisms driving evaporation the contribution of relative humidity and soil heat flux appears to be less significant iii as for ae the reliability of four selected models widely adopted to assess evaporation from bare soil were investigated literature based calibrations of their parameters led to poor performances while the recalibration based on experimental data specific for silty pyroclastic soils resulted in satisfactory performance regardless of the approach considered this brought to light the importance of providing updated and specific indications referring to the calibration of evaporative models for the soils considered in this study and iv although the selected models behave differently in predicting ae intensity over time they all show potential for working in ewpt as they contribute to reliably predict experimental water storage evolution although these findings represent the first available results for soils of this type they provide a basis for confidently adopting such models in developing expeditious tools to assess water content on slopes

7216,the estimation of evaporative fluxes and their effects on soil suction is assuming a prominent role in the field of interpretation and early warning prediction of rainfall induced landslides evaporation models refer essentially to sands or plastic silty and clayey soils models validated specifically for non plastic silty pyroclastic soils usually characterized by very high porosity are instead unavailable this deficit arises although silty pyroclastic covers are widely spread across the world increasingly involved in rainfall induced landslides and recognized showing particular hydrological behaviour a number of questions may be raised about the issue i may any evaporative models be reliably extended to silty pyroclastic soils ii what atmospheric variables need to be monitored at least to reliably predict evaporation fluxes in these soils and iii how accurate evaporation estimations are if they are referred to silty pyroclastic covers for early warning purposes this study addresses these questions by assessing the capabilities of several simplified models in estimating evaporative potential and actual fluxes for silty pyroclastic soils to this aim a large scale lysimeter consisting in a silty pyroclastic layer exposed to the atmosphere and comprehensively monitored for both weather forcing and hydrological soil variables is adopted it provides a dataset of observations suitable to calibrate and validate the selected evaporation models moreover the availability of weather observations makes it possible to define the minimum set of equipment required to attain reliable evaporation estimation this study shows that i the adoption of a literature based calibration can produce misleading estimates of actual evaporation whereas the model performances after a lysimeter based recalibration are satisfactory ii reducing the weather measurements can induce an overestimation of predicted fluxes up to 50 and iii the investigated models quite accurately predict water out coming fluxes while running in early warning predictions keywords bare soil evaporation pyroclastic soil landslide soil water storage landslide prediction 1 introduction the risk associated to rainfall induced landslides in loose pyroclastic soils widely spread across the world especially in the subtropical zones is recognized as increasing over the last decades brand 1984 cascini et al 2000 picarelli et al 2008 eichenberger et al 2013 shimizu and ono 2016 chávez et al 2016 yamao et al 2016 under the increasing heavy rainfalls likely to be caused by climate changes ng and leung 2016 and or due to an exposure growth of communities and assets located at the toe of vulnerable slopes research has recently accelerated in investigating the hydrological behaviour of these soils above all after the famous events occurred in sarno and quindici italy 1998 and numerous other minor events causing significant damage and even fatalities in highly vulnerable areas cascini and ferlisi 2003 olivares and damiano 2007 pagano et al 2008 pagano et al 2010 the thicknesses and specific stratigraphic alternations of these soil layers are strongly influenced by several factors such as the proximity to the eruptive centres wind direction and magnitude at eruption time and the gradient of the slope as a direct result of their genesis and mineralogy these soils exhibit non or only slightly plastic and cohesionless behaviour and usually are very porous with values up to 0 75 when the silty fraction is significant soil small size pores determine infiltrating rainfall water to be retained as meniscus water subject to suction which induces a strength contribution allowing the cover to be stable on slopes even steeper than the soil friction angle however such contribution decreases under increasing water content up to potentially attain slope instability conditions field monitoring has often been carried out in the attempt to characterize the evolution of the slope hydrological state and related stability conditions suction and soil moisture yielded by monitoring activities carried out within unsaturated slopes previously involved in rainfall induced landslides deliver interesting hydrological patterns comegna et al 2016 papa et al 2013 napolitano et al 2015 these latter along with numerical studies pagano et al 2010 cascini et al 2014 napolitano et al 2015 indicate that rainfall induced landslides are regulated by the coupling effect of a heavy rainfall over several hours after periods when soil water content has significantly increased over an antecedent period of months rianna et al 2014b provide a physical explanation about the effects related to this coupling the significant length of the antecedent time window estimated up to 4 months by pagano et al 2010 entails that not only rainfall infiltration but also evapotranspiration can significantly affect the soil water content within the pyroclastic soils on regional and global scales assessment of evapotranspirative fluxes and their effects on soil suction in the evaluation of slope stability conditions represents however a topic that has been addressed in a systematic and widespread way only relatively recently blight 2006 fredlund et al 2012 leung and ng 2013 calabresi et al 2013 rianna et al 2014a b both theoretical and experimental studies have highlighted that assuming evapotranspirative fluxes to be negligible compared with rainfall infiltration flux leads to a too conservative assessment of slope stability reder et al 2018 at present early warning predictive tools ewpts focus essentially on estimating rainfall effects baum and godt 2010 capparelli and tiranti 2010 sirangelo and versace 1996 terranova et al 2018 evapotranspiration effects are usually not properly considered e g adopting empirical or very simplified approaches or even completely neglected by these tools the present research attempts to provide such hints to properly manage the out coming flux component of evapotranspiration to this aim it investigates the reliability of models that in their simplicity are able to predict evapotranspiration fluxes with the promptness required by a ewpt the aim is achieved by calibrating and validating four simplified evaporation models characterized by four different control variables the range of their application to silty pyroclastic soils characterized by wide grain size distribution non plastic behaviour and high porosity is yet to be verified as the literature in this field provides no indication on the matter throughout the study the validation calibration procedures for the selected models are carried out using a comprehensive set of experimental records provided by a large scale lysimeter it consists of a silty pyroclastic layer put in place in a tank by pluvial deposition exposed to weather elements over several years and amply equipped with instruments for measuring evaporative fluxes along with other meteorological and hydrological variables rianna et al 2014a pagano et al 2014a b the research is conducted under the assumption of a bare surface this assumption is reasonable as part of the evaporative flux takes place through soil atmosphere contact also under vegetated conditions in addition model validation assessment is advised initially under simple conditions even in view of subsequent assessment under a more complex vegetated surface specifically the study attempts to address the following objectives for silty pyroclastic soils i addressing the accuracy of potential evaporation pe models 3 1 4 1 5 1 ii investigating the inaccuracy implications determined by a partial missing in atmospheric variable records required as input for evaporation models 3 2 4 2 5 2 iii addressing the accuracy of actual evaporation ae models 3 3 4 3 5 3 and iv broader implications for landslide early warning prediction investigating the accuracy that ae models have in their role of ewpt 3 4 4 4 5 4 these objectives provide the structural sub heading used the following methods results and discussions sections furthermore table 1 reports the main findings of key works dealing with the four items above recalled and those achieved in this study the potential improvements beyond the state of the art will be adequately discussed in 5 2 study site and materials the reference material adopted for this study is a typical ash erupted by the volcanic apparatus of vesuvius italy consisting of a non plastic silty pyroclastic soil fig 1 b the ash comes from the stratigraphic series of monteforte irpino campania region southern italy and its properties have been widely studied nicotera et al 2010 pirone et al 2015 its intrinsic properties fig 1b and soil porosity approximately equal to 70 are fully comparable to those of the volcanic sloping cover involved in the flowslide event that occurred in the nocera inferiore district campania region on 4th march 2005 the hydrological response of this material was investigated under the effects of actual weather conditions by a large scale lysimeter fig 1a rianna et al 2014a it consists of a wooden tank base 1 15 1 15 m height 0 75 m where the material itself was placed and exposed to weather element while observing weather variables regulating the soil state and soil atmosphere flux exchanges the layer s lateral boundaries are impervious the uppermost surface is left bare the lowermost surface behaves as a seepage surface thanks to a geotextile thickness 2 mm interposed between the layer and the holed tank base which behaves as a capillary barrier reder et al 2017 the large scale lysimiter is in particular equipped to best quantify evaporative fluxes and the soil s hydrological and thermal variables variations in water storage δws induced by infiltration i actual evaporation ae and deep drainage d flows are measured as weight changes in the layer thanks to three load cells sustaining the tank specifically for suction values at the bottom higher than zero drainage phenomena are prevented by the capillary barrier if this condition takes place in the absence of precipitation p decreases in ws correspond to ae ae δws while during precipitations the increase in ws corresponds to the amount of rainfall infiltration i i δws the occurrence layer drainage is detected collecting water flowing across the layer bottom through a flat tank placed below the base the atmospheric variables are fully monitored in terms of precipitation relative air humidity rh air temperature t air pressure pa and wind velocity w the energetic variables are monitored in terms of net radiation rn solar radiation rs and soil heat flux g monitored within the top soil within the layer soil

daily precipitation and volumetric water content at 15 cm of depth over 2010 2014 are shown in fig 2 b the soil water characteristic curve obtained by plotting suction against volumetric water content

totally or partially satisfy the evaporative demand returning the actual evaporation ae mm day hillel 2004 mcvicar et al 2012 3 1 estimating pe for bare soil using evaporation models pe is quantified using two models the first model namely the penman 1948 model is a physically based approach that combines the dalton type formulation gray 1970 with the heat budget equation to obtain a relationship dependent only on variables relative humidity air temperature wind velocity and net radiation that can be collected easily using a traditional weather station in its original release it derives the potential evaporation taking place from a free water surface pe0 in mm day in this study the penman model as provided by shuttleworth 1993 is considered donohue et al 2010 1 pe 0 γ γ η q n η γ η 6430

variables that govern the evaporative process are explicit in the formula mcvicar et al 2012 donohue et al 2010 showed that such model represents the most appropriate form of pe in a changing climate context the second model derives from the so called dual crop coefficient approach as provided by the fao guidelines see chapter 7 of the guidelines allen et al 1998 in its original release the fao guidelines provide a procedure to obtain actual evapotranspiration aet in mm days under standard conditions where no water limitations are placed on crop growth based on a reference evapotranspiration et0 in mm day and a crop coefficient kc 3 aet k c et 0 et0 represents the evaporation calculated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 for a reference surface defined as constituted by a

air temperature at 2 m c et0 is nothing more than an indicator of the atmosphere evaporative demand in this sense allen et al 1998 point out that et0 does not represent a formulation of potential evapotranspiration pet discouraging the use of other denominations such as pet due to ambiguities in their definitions kc is a coefficient accounting for crop characteristics and soil evaporation

suggest adopting kcmax 1 15 for the case of bare soil in the latter condition the potential evaporation is higher than the reference evapotranspiration due to an enhanced capacity for the shallower soil layers to store heat 3 2 estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 in partial missing of input atmospheric variables the pe models of 3 1 require primarily measurements of the following variables as input data net radiation rn solar radiation rs relative humidity rh temperature t wind velocity w and heat flux through the soil g all these variables are not always measured and available in practical application the absence of some of them has often addressed by adopting simplified assumptions as those provided by fao guidelines their effects are then investigated the cases analysed are the following allen et al 1998 i missing heat flux through the soil g simplified assumption g is assumed to vanish ii missing net radiation rn simplified assumption rn is estimated from measurements of solar radiation rs pyranometer data daily air temperature t and daily relative humidity rh iii missing net radiation rn and pyranometer data rs simplified assumption rn is estimated as in case 2 by replacing measured rs with the value rs provided by applying a procedure based on assessment of the duration of bright sunshine and the diurnal temperature range iv missing wind measurements w simplified assumption w is assumed to be at the constant rate of 2 m s v missing relative humidity measurements rh simplified assumption rh is derived from daily maximum and minimum air temperature vi missing all variables except air temperature t simplified assumptions all the simplified approaches above are adopted all together to estimate g case 1 rn case 3 w case 4 and rh case 5 sequentially since the effects of these assumptions depend exclusively on weather variables the investigation is carried out considering the reference evapotranspiration et0 as provided by fao guidelines allen et al 1998 3 3 estimating ae for bare soil using evaporation models two major types of models used to estimate actual evaporation ae in mm day are remote sensing based and ground measurement based models yang 2017 the first type considers models that estimate the components of the energy balance equation e g net radiation sensible heat flux heat flux through the ground surface assuming the latent heat as unknown yang 2017 kalma et al 2008 the models of second type include empirical micrometeorological and soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models in this study models of the second type based on preliminary estimation of potential evaporation pe and on a reduction of pe associated to topsoil water availability are selected to estimate ae for bare soil in this regard two main categories of model may be distinguished the first one concerns models estimating topsoil water availability through a water balance providing the amount of topsoil water available at time t as the difference between incoming infiltrating rainfalls i and out coming ae fluxes over antecedent time periods up to t the second category concerns models univocally relating topsoil water availability to a physical variable v which may be provided by monitoring activity or computed using theoretical models suitable v variables are water content θ water storage ws or suction s if v is detected experimentally ae estimation at a given time t usually considered on the daily scale does not require the knowledge of antecedent fluxes i and ae crossing the soil atmosphere interface while in the other case it has to be estimated through the assessment or the measure of fluxes through the boundaries this work analyses and validates four different approaches developed to quantify ae two of them ritchie 1972 r and boesten and stroosnijder 1986 bs fall into the first category the remaining aydin 1998 ay and allen et al 1998 al also known as the fao model fall into the second category these models were selected consistently with a presumed employment as components of ewpt the first two base merely on pe prediction resulting suitable for applications where only conventional atmospheric variables are monitored their prediction accuracy then strongly depends on what atmospheric variables are made available see 3 2 4 2 5 2 still basing on a preliminary pe prediction the second two give the opportunity of exploiting for more accurate predictions the availability of monitored hydrological soil variables r and bs models assume that actual evaporation ae is equal to potential evaporation pe only when the cumulative actual evaporation σae is below a specific limit indicated as u for the former and β2 for the latter as soon as this threshold is exceeded further ae fluxes occur at a rate lower than pe the two models differ in terms of the different falling law they implement in the r model the falling law is a simple and rough function of time 7 for ae u ae u α t ae α t α t 1 where ae cumulative actual evaporation mm pe cumulative potential evaporation mm t time s u limit below which ae pe mm α factor depending on the soil hydraulic properties mm s0 5 in the bs model on the other hand the falling law is wholly regulated by the evolution of pe and based on an explicit reduction of pe 8 for ae β 2 ae β 2 β pe ae β pe n β pe n 1 where in addition to the variables listed above β factor depending on the soil hydraulic properties mm0 5 n daily index in short the first model takes no account of the dependency of the actual evaporation rate on atmospheric forcing the opportunity it offers to run an estimation without atmospheric experimental data for pe reduction is appealing allowing computation in cases where meteorological data are unavailable on the other hand this advantage may be lost because of excessive loss of accuracy in ae estimation especially in the case of meteorological patterns departing from those normally expected under singular atmospheric conditions characterized by pe patterns well below the average trend for the period the model may generate physical inconsistency where ae pe the authors suggest solving this inconsistency by simply placing ae pe the bs model is obviously more complete rational and accurate as it explicitly accounts for atmospheric forcing regulating the evaporative demand the ay and al models assume that the actual evaporation is equivalent to the potential evaporation ae pe when the imbibition state of the topsoil expressed by a control variable v is higher than a threshold v in the former model v is identified with the topsoil suction level s so that ae pe occurs when s s ay in the latter model v is identified with the topsoil volumetric water content θ so that ae pe occurs for θ θ al for both models the same variable characterizing the topsoil imbibition level also regulates the ae falling law expressed as an explicit reduction of pe 9 ae kpe where ae actual evaporation mm day pe

implications for landslide early warning prediction ewpt for rainfall induced landslides require expeditious approaches predicting fluxes through the surface namely the amount of rainfall water infiltrating the cover i and that lost in runoff r and actual evaporation ae predicting water content reductions during dry periods to explore how and if the four selected models could work within an early warning prediction the layer in the large scale lysimeter has been considered to be a virtual cover subjected to the prediction of its hydrological state the layer water storage ws obtained by measuring continuously the layer weight has been assumed as a key variable identifying the hydrological state of the layer in relation to slope stability conditions fig 3 plots the four experimental ws time histories recorded for each hydrological year of the experiment it shows ws increases during the wet season october april and decreases during the dry season may september the attained ws peaks reach a same level except that in the second year which resulted significantly lower due to scarcer than average precipitations occurred during the wet season 4 results 4 1 estimating pe for bare soil using evaporation models for each hydrological year fig 4 plots the cumulated measurements of actual evaporation ae obtained by summing up the daily water storage decreases for dry days p 1 mm detected by measuring layer weight changes the same figure plots the cumulated values of potential evaporation pe carried out by adopting penman shuttleworth model and the modified dual crop coefficient model as provided by allen et al 2005 with literature based parameters ε 0 90 and kcmax 1 15 respectively both ae and pe are plotted against a control variable of the topsoil imbibition state as control variable the volumetric water content measured at the depth of 15 cm θ 15 has been assumed the layer field capacity θfc was estimated experimentally as equal to 0 485 rianna et al 2014a taken as the threshold below which drainage becomes negligible between θs 15 at saturation and θfc 15 the layer supplies full availability of water for evaporation so that changes in actual evaporation measured as water losses correspond to changes also in potential evaporation thus in this range of θ shaded areas in fig 4 pe is directly measured and as such it represents a reliable reference for validating the literature based parameters ε 0 90 and kcmax 1 15 within the range θs 15 θfc 15 the penman shuttleworth model set following literature based suggestions at ε 0 90 reproduces observations satisfactorily whereas the modified dual crop coefficient model set at kc 1 15 significantly departs from observations underestimating them the kcmax parameter has been then calibrated by minimizing the residual between the measured and predicted values within the range θs 15 θfc 15 the minimization procedure yielded kcmax 2 21 and results plotted fig 5 the updated value allows the modified dual crop coefficient model to yield predictions fully consistent with the observations within the calibration range except over the third year out of calibration range predictions yielded by both models fig 5 initially match the measurements and then gradually depart from them starting from a well identified θ 15 value this ability of the model to reproduce pe also outside the calibration range greatly encourages considering the departure point θ 15 to truly be threshold below which the atmospheric evaporative demand starts to be increasingly less sustained by water availability with decreasing θ actual evaporation becoming progressively lower than potential evaporation as expected the value of θ 15 is quite equivalent for all the years involved and corresponds to 0 425 4 2 estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 in partial missing of input atmospheric variables this section is devoted to assessing how simplified estimations for missing weather variables 3 2 could affect the et0 estimation compared to full availability of observed data the hydrological year 2012 2013 was selected for this purpose in fig 6 the left plots compare the measured and fao hypothesized trends for input variables the right plots compare the two related et0 trends in terms of both daily and cumulated values disregarding the contribution of soil heat flux g point i fig 6a and b only a slight variation in the et0 is estimated about 4 rarely exceeding 1 mm day fig 6b on the other hand the simplified assumptions suggested by the fao guidelines for rn and rs point ii and point iii respectively overestimate radiation components over the entire hydrological year and consistently overestimate et0 values fig 6c d and e f during the wetter period from the beginning of november until the end of april rn estimated as a function of measured rs point ii is about 2 mj m2 day fig 6c against observed rn values close to zero during the drier period from the beginning of may until the end of october spread increases with estimated rn of about 12 mj m2 day against observed rn of about 8 mj m2 day this leads to an overestimation of et0 fig 6c and d of 28 rn estimated as a function of rs is further overestimated as rs is systematically above observed rs point iii fig 6e during the wetter period values of rs are in the order of 7 8 mj m2 day against observed rs of 2 6 mj m2 day during the drier period the spread increases with estimated rs in the order of 20 22 against observed rs in the order of 16 18 mj m2 day this leads fig 6f to an overestimation of et0 of 36 the assumption of wind velocity equal to 2 m s point iv fig 6i also entails a marked overestimation of et0 fig 6l compared with the case of measured wind velocity for the investigated site a typical urban area the observed wind velocity is 0 4 m s on average which is significantly lower than the fao hypothesized value the simplified assumption consequently overestimates the drying power exerted by the wind resulting in a significant overestimation of et0 at 41 in this case no significant differences between wet and dry periods are recognizable replacing the observed rh values by the fao hypothesized ones point v fig 6i and l also produces only slight effects in terms of et0 estimation despite the remarkable overestimation of rh yielded by the fao prediction this result indicates the minor role played by relative humidity in the et0 estimation fig 7 compares et0 computed in the availability of all needed measurements and et0 computed in the not rare hypothesis that only air temperature records are made available if only temperature measurements fig 7 are available there is a combination of inaccuracies that increases the divergence between measured and fao hypothesized et0 this results on average 50 higher than measured et0 with a difference of 2 mm day over the dry seasons and 0 5 1 mm day in other periods from these results it is clear that evaporation assessments performed with limited weather datasets should be used with care overestimation of the atmospheric demand could lead to an underestimation of actual soil water content erring on the unsafe side in slope stability analysis 4 3 estimating ae for bare soil using evaporation models the performances of the four selected evaporation models for ae prediction 3 3 are tested from the point of view of their ability to reproduce ae trends detected experimentally by the large scale lysimeter this task was composed by two stages i model performance was tested by quantifying model parameters on the basis of literature based indications requiring details about grain size distribution volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity function table 2 and ii model performance was tested after recalibrating the models by best fitting ae experimental data provided by the large scale lysimeter over the first two hydrological years by a conventional minimization procedure validation has then been based on comparing prediction with measurements available over the two remaining hydrological years table 2 all the models were examined by computing potential evaporation using the penman shuttleworth model as this resulted more accurate in reproducing pe large scale lysimeter records over the entire time span of the experiment see fig 5 as regards stage a fig 8 plots experimental and theoretical trends of cumulative ae against volumetric water content θ 15 the same figure also represents potential evaporation trend calculated using the penman shuttleworth model fig 9 plots in the same format as in fig 8 results obtained after lysimeter based recalibration within the range between θfc 15 and θ 15 all ae predictions calibrated based on indications found in the literature match the penman shuttleworth pe prediction and consequently the measurements see also fig 5 except the r model prediction that yields a departure point θ r systematically higher than θ 15 table 2 for θ θ all predicted ae trends substantially depart from the observations returning poor performance specifically al ay and bs models overestimate the observed evaporation losses and under predict the departure point θ 15 with the exception of the bs model in the first year the r model underestimates evaporation losses except in the second year within the recalibration range first two years all models yield predictions slightly exceeding measurements fig 9a and b the predictive performance outside the recalibration range third and fourth years although satisfactory still results in a slight ae overestimation fig 9c and d with a cumulating maximum spreading between predicted and observed not exceeding 16 ay model in the first year for r and bs the departure points are similar to the observed θ 15 while for al and ay the departure point is higher than θ 15 overestimation of ae depends essentially on the models falling laws intrinsically reducing the losses less than they should to better fitting measurements 4 4 broader implications for landslide early warning prediction the ae predictions yielded by the four selected models adopting lysimeter based parameters have been used to estimate water storage ws reductions over all dry periods not involving drainage phenomena from the layer bottom to predict ws over time ae values should have been complemented by rainfall infiltration estimations over wet periods because the examination of the approaches modelling rainfall infiltration is outside the scope of the present work this aspect of the problem was treated simply by assuming the measured amounts as rainfall infiltration rather than those yielded by a theoretical prediction ws evolution obtained by alternating ae predictions with infiltration measurements was then compared with the fully observed ws evolution over the dry periods p 1 mm ws decreases have been predicted by each of the four selected models for each of them the specific controlling variable none for r pe for bs θ15 for al s15 for ay was quantified by experimental data monitored for the layer fig 10 compares for each hydrological year recorded ws trend with the four predicted trends yielded by the selected ae models it may be noted fig 10 that all the ae models are quite suitable for reproducing the observed ws reductions and consequently for working within an early warning prediction in particular also the models pertaining to the first category if suitably calibrated could result in reliable predictions of the hydrological behaviour of a silty pyroclastic layer encouraging is especially the ae agreement arising over the second year when the layer hydrological behaviour was in regulated by long ae phenomena occurring at low intensity during the autumnal and winter seasons due to the mentioned exceptionally rare precipitations 5 discussion 5 1 estimating pe for bare soil using evaporation models as already pointed out within the range θs 15 θfc 15 the penman shuttleworth model reproduces observations satisfactorily by adopting a literature based parameter ε 0 90 penman 1948 the modified dual crop coefficient model yields instead predictions inconsistent with observations for literature based parameter kcmax 1 15 allen et al 2005 matching observations only after a lysimeter based recalibration kcmax 2 21 the value provided by recalibration significantly exceeds further literature based values and reported in table 1 snyder et al 2000 ventura et al 2006 this systematic exceeding may partially be related to the porosity of the investigated soil 0 7 that since resulting well above soil porosities associated with the cited works should enhance soil atmosphere water exchange it is worth observing fig 5 that cumulating pe estimated by the adopted models over each hydrological year are well above cumulating ae the latter attains values between 650 and 750 mm against an estimated cumulating pe typically higher than 1000 1100 mm this simple comparison makes clear that it is not reliable at all to base an estimation of layer water losses on pe since especially during late spring and summer such an assumption would result in an overestimation of out coming fluxes 5 2 estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 in partial missing of input atmospheric variables considering the results of 4 2 figs 6 and 7 the most significant findings are that the simplified assumptions suggested by the fao guidelines overestimate radiation components over the entire hydrological year and consistently et0 values assuming wind velocity equal to 2 m s also results into a marked overestimation of et0 compared with the case of measured wind velocity similar researches were performed by tomas burguera et al 2017 in spain popova et al 2006 in bulgaria and boldini et al 2014 in central italy table 1 common features to all these studies are that i the inaccuracy in et0 prediction is quantified estimating divergences between et0 as resulting from full availability of atmospheric data and et0 as resulting from replacing lacking data with the estimations suggested in the fao guidelines ii the net radiation rn is not measured but obtained indirectly from measurements of solar radiation rs daily air temperature t and daily relative humidity rh and iii four cases among the six considered in the present work are investigated missing solar radiation rs missing wind measurements w missing relative humidity measurements rh missing all variables except air temperature t all these cases consider the same simplified assumptions of 3 2 for points iii iv v vi table 3 compares results of tomas burguera et al 2017 popova et al 2006 and boldini et al 2014 with those obtained in this work 4 2 the listed studies confirm the minor influence of relative humidity and the key role played by solar radiation and wind velocity except the work by tomas burguera et al 2017 which results are affected by relative humidity they also indicate that variations underestimation or overestimation of et0 determined by the unavailability of all measurements except t are consistent with those determined when only w is missing this further highlights the importance of w measurement availability and could be explained considering that temperature indirectly relates to all atmospheric variables affecting evaporation except w 5 3 estimating ae for bare soil using evaporation models for all the models recalibration stage improves the accuracy in ae prediction 4 3 returning a new set of parameters suitable for silty pyroclastic soils differences between literature based and lysimeter based parameters are discussed in this section for the r and bs models the literature suggests knisel 1980 quantifying u or β2 as a function of hydraulic conductivity k 10 corresponding to a suction level of s 10 kpa fig 11 a linear increasing trend is recommended within the k 10 range 5 8 10 9 and 2 0 10 8 m s of investigated materials ritchie 1972 constant trends linking to the linear trend are suggested outside this range the k 10 of the material in hand 3 5 10 8 m s falls within the upper constant trend returning u β2 13 2 mm such a value is in line with those provided by snyder et al 2000 and ventura et al 2006 for silty clay the recalibration of two models yields u 48 8 mm differing from β2 96 mm and both are significantly higher than literature based values see fig 8 recalibration thus suggests that outside the range investigated by ritchie 1972 the increasing trend persists and may follow an exponential rather than a linear pattern in terms of departure points the differences between the predicted and observed θ reduce significantly or vanish after re calibration table 2 for al model eqs 11 and 12 are considered for estimating the departure point θ al and the residual volumetric water content θral in both equations θfc is set equal to the value 0 485 provided by rianna et al 2014a the first parameter θ al is quantified 0 448 setting rew 11 mm as provided by allen et al 1998 for silty sand and ze 30 cm considering the fact that this value means that the tdr15 placed at the topsoil is mid height for the second parameter θral fao guidelines suggest it be quantified as θ corresponding to suction level 1500 kpa in the soil water retention curve the plot in fig 2a yielded θwp 0 227 under this assumption eq 12 provided tew 77 4 mm recalibration dropped rew to zero increased θ al to the value of θfc and increased tew by about 7 for ay model the departure point and residual state are quantified both expressed this time in terms of suction thresholds s ay and sray respectively to achieve a parameter setting consistent with that of the al model both thresholds were derived from the water content thresholds of the al model θ al and θral respectively referring to the soil water retention curve fig 2a the recalibration of the model resulted table 2 in a slight reduction of the departure point and a significant decreasing of the residual value sray 249 kpa corresponding however to a more contained increase in θray from 0 227 to 0 261 in fig 12 the ay parameters departure point s ay and residual state sray are compared with experimental points carried out by tran et al 2016 interpreting the column evaporation tests of wilson 1990 bruch 1993 and yanful and choo 1997 for different soil types mainly sand and silt on the basis of saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat such a comparison shows that in terms of s ay fig 12a the investigated pyroclastic silty sand behaves as a sand material while in terms of sray fig 12b it tends to have a behaviour of a silty material to gain a deeper insight into the differences among the selected four models each of them was adopted using recalibrated parameters to simulate a much simpler full theoretical scenario starting from saturated conditions it was hypothesized that constant daily potential evaporation occurred over 500 days fig 13 plots the ae prediction yielded by each model over the defined reference time span for three different pe levels 5 3 and 1 mm day ae time trends appear to be in fewer agreements with respect to ae θ trends previously considered in fig 9 the models pertaining to the second category preserve a certain degree of reciprocal consistency in predicting ae evolution under all three pe levels considered testifying a certain objectivity characterizing their response the models pertaining to the first category yield reciprocal agreement to degree that differs pathologically for the three pe evolutions analysed all the plots in fig 13 indicate that the models pertaining to the first category show a drop at departure time this drop is due to the fact that ae prediction after departure time is related to time r model or pe bs models by a constant coefficient which can only induce abrupt changes in ae at departure time this drop is only apparently attenuated in the r model predictions in reality the model predicts an upward abrupt increase not represented in fig 13 characterized by ae being higher than pe at the departure time which was eliminated by forcing ae pe each model except r yields departure time that always corresponds to the same amount of cumulated ae so that decreasing pe results into a delayed departure time for the r model the represented departure time is further delayed with respect to that yielded by the prediction due to the inconsistency ae pe mentioned above this inconsistency increases with decreasing daily pe delaying the time at which the falling law produces a condition where ae pe in this way the cumulated ae amount at departure time increases as the daily pe intensity decreases generating physically unacceptable matter that translates into increasing disagreement with the predictions yielded by other models the bs model limit consists in relating departure time drop magnitude and post drop trend by adopting the same coefficient β in particular increasing β implies univocally delaying departure time and contextually attenuating ae drops after this time fig 14 models of the second category relate ae to pe through a coefficient that takes into consideration the imbibition state ranging between 1 ae pe and 0 ae 0 this provides continuity at departure time in ae evolution in addition the departure time and the post departure trend may be regulated independently of each other with the latter being physically controlled by the real availability of water in the topsoil this introduces an important feature with respect to models for the first category the possibility to control and calibrate the time at which daily ae becomes negligible realistically 5 4 broader implications for landslide early warning prediction as recalled in the introduction section the significance of antecedent hydrological conditions on triggering of landslide events in pyroclastic covers has been stressed in different works e g de vita and piscopo 2002 pagano et al 2010 albeit strongly related to geomorphological features stratigraphy slope angle exposition state conditions porosity and degree of saturation and evolution of meteorological variables antecedent periods two three months long at least have been recognized as significant in affecting soil hydrological conditions this time length is such to make water losses from cumulating aet significant these phenomena have then been increasingly taken into consideration in recent works aimed at developing ewpt for rainfall induced landslides in this field fiorillo and wilson 2004 estimated aet through the simplified approach proposed by thornthwaite 1948 its use was limited however to estimate the soil water budget for soil water content values lower than field capacity and within the root depth area 1 m laboratory based calibration of parameters was only carried out without any support of larger scale data and actual meteorological conditions for calibration and validation napolitano et al 2015 adopted a physically based approach for interpreting field monitoring data retrieved by a pyroclastic cover in sarno area interpretation of suction and water content measurements conducted by taking into account aet losses resulted into intensity duration thresholds required for landslide triggering provided thresholds are different for summer high atmospheric demand and low cumulating rainfalls and winter low atmospheric demand and high cumulating rainfalls and this difference represents just the way authors account for evapotranspiration phenomena the oversimplification in considering only two antipodal scenarios is supposed to not allow reliable predictions in interpreting complex meteorological evolutions especially those arising during the transition seasons autumn and spring typically characterized by high probability of landslide occurrence in several expeditious ewpt evapotranspiration losses are totally disregarded de vita and piscopo 2002 comegna et al 2017 this study shows how all the four different approaches if properly calibrated could reliably reproduce the soil evaporation experienced by a pyroclastic cover improving the assessment of antecedent hydrological conditions and requiring a low computational effort in line with constraints of ewpt 6 conclusion the research investigated the dynamics regulating evaporation phenomena in silty pyroclastic soils referring to the experimental data of a large scale lysimiter providing evaporative fluxes in relation to meteorological forcing topsoil state and selected models estimating potential and actual evaporation the experimental data the calibration of the different models and critical discussion of the results make it possible to draw the following conclusions i as regards estimating pe the available models provide accuracy in prediction if they are properly calibrated considering soil specific and climate features ii the accuracy in estimating evaporation is main function of availability of some key meteorological variables temperature wind and radiation recorded at the site involved in the prediction a rough assessment of merely temperature based estimation of et0 led to inaccuracy 50 wind velocity and net radiation observations in addition to temperature measurements resulted crucial in increasing accuracy in et0 estimation and are therefore strongly recommended this conclusion is not surprising as these elements regulate the main mechanisms driving evaporation the contribution of relative humidity and soil heat flux appears to be less significant iii as for ae the reliability of four selected models widely adopted to assess evaporation from bare soil were investigated literature based calibrations of their parameters led to poor performances while the recalibration based on experimental data specific for silty pyroclastic soils resulted in satisfactory performance regardless of the approach considered this brought to light the importance of providing updated and specific indications referring to the calibration of evaporative models for the soils considered in this study and iv although the selected models behave differently in predicting ae intensity over time they all show potential for working in ewpt as they contribute to reliably predict experimental water storage evolution although these findings represent the first available results for soils of this type they provide a basis for confidently adopting such models in developing expeditious tools to assess water content on slopes

7217,sulphur plays a critical role in the biogeochemistry of wetlands so4 2 is the sulphur form that is most commonly assimilated by plants and it is the medium of sulphur transformation in wetland ecosystems the caohai wetland is an important ecosystem on the yunnan guizhou plateau sw china and karst water is the most important water source in this wetland in this study the compositions of multiple isotopes δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 were measured in groundwater river water and wetland water in the caohai catchment to elucidate the solute sources and behaviours of sulphate the results suggest that so4 2 in groundwater is mainly derived from sulphide oxidation groundwater contributes a significant amount of sulphate to river water and it is the main sulphate source of wetland water during the high flow season in contrast rain water is the main sulphate source of wetland water during the low flow season due to the reduction in groundwater recharge these data indicate that groundwater is not only an important water source in the karst dominated wetland catchment but also provides pathways by which sulphate is transported to the wetland in addition due to the effects of dissimilatory sulphate reduction in the wetland the sulphate isotope composition in wetland water was higher than those in the groundwater and inflowing rivers which indicates that biogeochemical processes in wetland ecosystems influence the sulphate content and composition in karst water keywords dissolved sulphate stable isotope karst water wetland 1 introduction sulphur is a ubiquitous element that is present in many sources in the environment brown 1982 and it is the fourth most important nutrient after nitrogen phosphorus and potassium mitsch and gosselink 2007 sulphur biogeochemistry is an important regulator of redox chemistry it is strongly linked with the growth processes of plants reddy and delaune 2008 and it influences the compositions of protein cysteine and methionine and the processes of photosynthesis and respiration among others li et al 2007 wetlands form at the interfaces of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and exhibit features of both environments keddy 2012 and they can be easily distinguished from other land forms or water bodies by their characteristic vegetation arunachalam et al 2013 organic sulphur e g carbon bonded sulphur and ester sulphate and inorganic sulphur e g sulphate sulphite sulphide so2 and h2s are the two main forms of sulphur in wetland ecosystems of which sulphate so4 2 which is the only important sulphur containing ion in oxidizing solutions reddy and delaune 2008 is the form that is most commonly assimilated by plants skrzypek et al 2008 under the influence of biogeochemistry in wetland systems sulphate can be converted into different forms of sulphur therefore it is necessary to determine the source of sulphate to deepen our understanding of the sulphur cycle in wetlands the associated sources and controls cannot always be distinguished based on traditional analyses of so4 2 concentrations or so4 2 to cl ratios dogramaci et al 2017 which must be coupled with isotopic data the latter of which may involve δ34sso4 2 and δ18sso4 2 this approach has been proven successful in tracing natural and anthropogenic inputs in groundwater surface water and wetland ecosystems mandernack et al 2000 novák et al 2003 otero et al 2008 skrzypek et al 2008 li et al 2011 lambán et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 to date although many studies have reported information about the sulphur cycle in different types of wetlands luther et al 1986 king 1988 urban et al 1989 spratt and morgan 1990 mandernack et al 2000 li et al 2007 burton et al 2011 sun et al 2013b little is known about the sulphur cycle in karst dominated wetland catchments globally approximately 15 of land comprises karst areas and as much as 25 of the global population depends on karst water supplies jiang and yan 2010 because karst features are often developed in areas with highly soluble rocks particularly carbonate rocks jiang et al 2009 karst geology is characterized by relatively high degrees of heterogeneity porosity and connectivity compared to other geologic settings sun et al 2013a nowadays studying the carbon sink capacity of karst processes is a priority in global carbon cycle research liu et al 2010 larson 2011 montety et al 2011 chen et al 2017 generally bicarbonate hco3 is the dominant anion in karst water han and liu 2004 han et al 2010a and so4 2 is the second major anion although many studies have focused on revealing the sources and transformations of sulphate in karst waters böttcher 1999 li and zeng 2006 lang et al 2011 pu et al 2013 lambán et al 2015 little is known about the effects of supergene environments such as wetlands on sulphate in karst water as an important component of the critical zone of the earth wetlands are not only an important source of sulphur in the atmosphere adams et al 1981 brimblecombe 2014 but are also a sink for various sulphur sources in a basin when deposited in wetland soils sulphate can undergo dissimilatory sulphate reduction dsr 2ch2o so4 2 h 2co2 h2s 2h2o which can generate an alkalinity effect that serves as a buffer for wetland water and may offset acid deposition urban et al 1989 mandernack et al 2000 moreover the presence of sulphate in wetlands may decrease methane production blodau et al 2007 however the reaction that converts organic carbon to inorganic carbon in karst wetland ecosystems weakens the stability of the karst carbon sink thus sulphur cycling has a close relationship with carbon cycling in wetland ecosystems in karst areas therefore it is important to study the characteristics of variations in sulphate concentrations and isotopic compositions in wetland watersheds in karst areas to reveal the sources of sulphate in the basin and to improve the knowledge base regarding the stability of carbon sinks in karst processes carbonate terrains occupy more than 70 of the land surface in guizhou southwest china which is the centre of the east asian karst zone wu et al 2009 the caohai wetland which is located in northwest guizhou is a nationally important nature reserve for migratory birds previous studies of water chemistry and stable isotope geochemistry c h and o have shown that the major ion chemical and stable isotopic compositions of wetland water are different than those of inflowing water due to the geochemical processes that occur in the wetland cao et al 2016a b 2018 this paper presents the s and o isotopic compositions of so4 2 in groundwater river water and wetland water discusses the sources of so4 2 in these waters and together with the results of previous studies presents a schematic diagram of the geochemical processes in the caohai wetland catchment the results of this paper improve our understanding of the geochemical processes in wetland ecosystems and their effects on catchment water chemistry in karst areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the caohai wetland the caohai wetland 26 49 26 53 n 104 12 104 18 e is located in the northwestern region of guizhou province southwest china it is located approximately 350 km west of guiyang which is the capital of guizhou province this region is characterized by a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation at lake caohai is approximately 951 mm 88 of which occurs between may and october the wetland covers an area of 25 km2 and drains a catchment area of 99 km2 the maximum wetland depth is 5 0 m and the average depth is 2 4 m zhu et al 2011 the wetland has four inflowing rivers of which river r4 is the largest and one outflowing river r2 groundwater is discharged through wells and springs around the caohai wetland the main structure in the study area is the weining shuicheng anticline and the study area contains numerous tectonic faults that preferentially trend in a ne sw direction fig 1 the underlying bedrock in the catchment is dominated by carboniferous sedimentary carbonate rock fig 1 including the c1d1 formation which comprises coal bearing carbonate strata and carbonate strata c1d2 that contain gypsiferous layers i e gypsum or anhydrite the county history compilation committee of the weining county 1994 2 2 sample collection and analysis river artesian well spring and surface wetland water samples were collected in september 2014 high flow season and april 2015 low flow season surface wetland water samples were collected from 49 locations by traversing almost all of the wetland area on a boat these locations are referred to in this study using numbers from 1 to 49 fig 1 details of the sample collection and storage procedures used for these samples as well as details of the analytical procedures and results of the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition and hydrogeochemical analyses of these water samples are given in cao et al 2016b 2018 the concentration of fe in the water samples was determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms 7500a agilent at the college of resource and environmental engineering guizhou university the groundwater river water and mixed surface wetland water samples appendix a were analysed to determine their δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 compositions these water samples were acidified to a ph of 2 using distilled 6 m hcl and the so4 2 in the acidified samples was collected as baso4 compounds by adding a 10 bacl2 solution to avoid the effects of baco3 on oxygen isotopes baso4 solutions were boiled on an electric furnace zhang et al 2015 and baso4 solids were obtained after the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm quantitative filter paper using ultrapure water milli q 18 2 mω cm to flush the residues until the filtrates did not contain cl as determined using the agno3 test then the residues were combusted at 850 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace the δ34sso4 composition of baso4 was determined by analysing so2 gas using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms gv instrument corp uk at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry in guiyang city china baso4 was loaded in a tin cup converted to so2 in an elemental analyser euro ea 3000 euro vector s p a italy at 1000 c and passed into the irms isoprime the δ18oso4 composition of baso4 was measured by analysing co gas using the same mass spectrometer the samples were combusted with excess glassy carbon at 1300 c using vanadium trioxide as a catalyst and they were then passed into the irms isoprime the resulting δ34sso4 values were expressed relative to the canyon diablo troilite v cdt standard and the resulting δ18sso4 values were expressed relative to the v smow standard the international sulphur standard nbs 127 was measured along with the samples the precisions of the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 analyses were estimated to be better than 0 2 and 0 5 respectively based on repeated analyses of internal standards 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical compositions the average ph value of the inflowing river water samples was 7 82 during the high flow season and 7 87 during the low flow season and that of the groundwater was 7 23 and 7 25 during the high flow and low flow seasons respectively the water in the wetland ranged from slightly acidic to alkaline ph 6 72 9 72 during the high flow season and it was alkaline ph 7 22 8 93 during the low flow season the major cations in the inflowing river groundwater and wetland water samples were ca2 and mg2 in these water samples the most abundant anion was hco3 and the second most abundant anion was so4 2 appendix a the chemical compositions of the inflowing river and groundwater samples were mainly characterized by ca hco3 although some of the groundwater wells were categorized by ca so4 in contrast wetland water samples were classified based on mg hco3 mg so4 ca hco3 and caso4 during periods of vegetation growth during the high flow season and characterized by cahco3 following the death of aquatic vegetation during the low flow season cao et al 2016b the sulphate concentrations of these water samples exhibited variable features the sulphate concentrations in the inflowing groundwater and river samples ranged from 0 16 to 1 99 mmol l during the high flow season and from 0 16 to 2 53 mmol l during the low flow season the sulphate concentrations in the wetland water samples ranged from 0 18 to 1 04 mmol l during the high flow season and from 0 21 to 0 74 mmol l during the low flow season table 1 3 2 sulphate isotopic δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 characteristics the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of groundwater in the study area ranged from 29 54 to 5 56 and from 3 79 to 2 51 respectively during both seasons the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of rivers ranged from 17 11 to 11 75 and from 0 77 to 2 55 respectively during both seasons table 1 however the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of wetland water ranged from 11 45 to 2 36 and from 0 16 to 9 24 respectively during the high flow season n 18 and from 3 51 to 7 50 and from 5 87 to 12 84 respectively during the low flow season n 19 the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of wetland water were higher than those of the inflowing water samples during both seasons fig 2 b c and the δ18oso4 values of the groundwater river and wetland samples fell between the δ18oh2o and atmospheric oxygen isotope values 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal variations in water chemistry and sources of sulphate in groundwater there are no obvious seasonal variations in the ph and ec values of groundwater as both plot close to the 1 1 line fig 3 a b dilution effects are common due to high precipitation during the high flow season in the karst areas of southwest china li et al 2008 therefore fig 3c e shows that the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the low flow season were higher than those during the high flow season which reflects the dilution effects of rainfall the concentrations and isotopic compositions of so4 2 fig 3f h in the groundwater plot close to the 1 1 line which may indicate that the so4 2 in groundwater has the same origin in both seasons generally sulphate in this groundwater has multiple origins which mainly include 1 anthropogenic origins sulphur compounds contributed from atmospheric pollution fertilizers sewage and mine drainage 2 geogenic origins sulphate mainly formed by the dissolution of evaporites and the oxidation of sulphide minerals and 3 biological origins sulphate produced by the decomposition and mineralization of organic matter contained in soils thus the sulphur isotopic compositions of these sources are highly different the results of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic analyses indicate that the groundwater is of meteoric origin cao et al 2018 and that the principal source of sulphate in rain water is seawater spray additionally the δ34s values of precipitation so4 in coastal areas tend to have a marine like signature of 21 newman et al 1991 because the study area is located in an inland area and the nearest coastline is located approximately 1000 km from the wetland the effect of seawater spray is negligible although no values of atmospherically deposited δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 have been measured in the study area δ34sso4 monitoring data were obtained from rain water near caohai xiao et al 2011 demonstrated that the δ34sso4 values of rain water in guiyang city range from 12 0 to 9 4 with a mean value of 2 8 values of δ18oso4 between 7 and 17 are frequently observed in precipitation based sulphate in temperate regions krouse and mayer 2000 fertilizer and sewage are also important factors that affect δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values zhang et al 2015 stated that the average δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of fertilizers were 4 9 6 7 n 102 and 12 6 3 3 n 41 respectively otero et al 2008 reported that the inflow and outflow waters of several sewage treatment plants recorded δ34sso4 values of 7 1 13 5 and δ18oso4 values of 8 2 12 5 in the llobregat catchment spain because mining activities are prohibited in national nature reserves in china there is no mine drainage in the study area the underlying bedrock in the catchment is dominated by carboniferous sedimentary carbonate rock the carbonate strata c1d2 contain a gypsiferous layer gypsum or anhydrite and these strata are mainly distributed in the southwestern and southern regions of the study area fig 1 the δ34sso4 values of gypsum exhibited long term variations reaching a maximum value of nearly 35 in the cambrian and a minimum value of less than 10 in the permian the δ18oso4 values of primary marine sulphate minerals have varied between 7 and 20 throughout the history of the earth krouse and mayer 2000 according to table 2 the average sulphur isotopic composition of groundwater in the caohai catchment is lower than that of groundwater in other karst areas and the sulphur isotopic compositions of karst waters from different karst areas vary widely indicating that the sulphate in karst waters can have many different origins the observed negative value of δ34sso4 may be related to the oxidation of sulphides for example the c1d1 formation comprises coal bearing carbonate strata that are widely distributed throughout the study area fig 1 in these strata sulphide rich i e pyrite rich coal is interbedded with carbonates the δ34s values of pyrite can range from 40 to 5 nielsen et al 1991 because the oxidation of pyrite to sulphate only produces minor isotopic fractionation the so4 2 that is produced maintains the δ34s value of the primary sulphide taylor et al 1984 moreover sulphates that form via sulphide oxidation exhibit a relationship between δ18oso4 and δ18oh2o as water is the source of 50 100 of the oxygen in so4 otero et al 2008 van stempvoort and krouse 1994 defined the area on a δ18oso4 vs δ18oh2o diagram where sulphates derived from sulphide oxidation must fall in addition sulphur mineralization is one of the key processes during the biogeochemical cycle of sulphur as sulphate produced by this process can be transported to groundwater by leaching the percentage of organic s in total s was high in limestone soil 75 7 92 9 and yellow soil 72 1 90 6 in the karst area of southwest china and the δ34s values of organic s in these soils ranged from 1 63 to 0 50 zhang et al 2010 this range indicates that no significant changes in δ34s values occurred during the oxidation process krouse and mayer 2000 the δ34sso4 value of groundwater was lower than the δ34s value of organic s which suggests that the organic s in soil may not be a major source of sulphate in groundwater previous studies have shown that some groundwater has been polluted by human activities based on the presence of high concentrations of no3 cao et al 2016b however the distribution of sulphate isotopes in groundwater shown in fig 4 a demonstrates that reduced inorganic sulphur compounds rather than rain water fertilizer or sewage were the main sulphate sources of groundwater during both seasons additionally fig 4b shows that almost all samples fall within the experimentally defined area of sulphates derived from sulphide oxidation and the groundwater samples plot in a range between 50 and 86 of sulphate oxygen derived from water fig 4c which is consistent with the results of otero et al 2008 these results suggest that the so4 contents of groundwater and river water are linked to sulphide oxidation generally sulphide oxidation not only decreases the δ34sso4 values of groundwater but also adds hydrogen ions to groundwater which in turn lower the ph e g oxidation of pyrite eqs 1 and 2 however the average ph value of groundwater during the high flow and low flow seasons was 7 23 and 7 25 respectively and the fe contents of the groundwater samples were 0 3 ppm table 1 these results may be related to the dissolution of carbonate in karst geological systems containing relatively soluble minerals in the solid phase such as calcite and dolomite groundwater acidity generated by the oxidation of pyrite can be buffered by carbonate dissolution eqs 3 and 4 1 fe 2 1 4 o 2 h fe 3 1 2 h 2 o 2 fes 2 14 fe 3 8 h 2 o 16 h 2 so 4 2 15 fe 2 3 2 h so 4 2 caco 3 2 h 2 o caso 4 2 h 2 o hco 3 4 2 h so 4 2 camg co 3 2 2 h 2 o caso 4 2 h 2 o hco 3 mg 2 in addition fig 5 shows that the so4 2 concentrations and δ34sso4 values in the caohai groundwater exhibit a significant inverse correlation high flow season r 0 59 p 0 05 low flow season r 0 77 p 0 01 this trend indicates that the contribution of biogenic sulphur is significant because previous studies have shown that coal from guizhou province has a low δ34s value and high sulphur content hong et al 1992 additionally the sulphur in high sulphur coal may come from bacterially reduced sulphates which can create a distinct bias towards negative δ34s values ni and hong 1999 moreover the concentrations and isotopic compositions of sulphate exhibit obvious spatial distribution characteristics as shown in fig 6 a b the groundwater in the southwestern and southern regions of the study area displayed low so4 2 concentrations and high δ34sso4 values and that in the southeastern and northern regions had high so4 2 concentrations and low δ34sso4 values this variation may be related to the stratigraphic distribution of the c1d2 formation in the study area as this formation contains a gypsiferous layer that is mainly distributed in the southwestern and southern regions of the study area fig 1 the groundwater from the southwestern and southern regions in the c1d1 formation may have mixed with some of the groundwater from the c1d2 formation during groundwater recharge 4 2 sources of sulphate in inflowing river water the average ph value of the inflowing river water was higher than that of groundwater in both seasons fig 3a which may have resulted in photosynthesis in the river via phytoplankton which assimilate dissolved co2 as soon as sunlight is available li et al 2005 the ec variations in river water were within the range of those observed in groundwater fig 3b the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the low flow season were higher than those in the high flow season fig 3c e these differences may have been influenced by evaporation in contrast the concentrations of so4 2 and its isotopes formed a nearly 1 1 line in both seasons fig 3f h dissolved sulphate in river water can have different origins such as the dissolution of evaporites the oxidation of reduced sulphur compounds air deposition rain water and anthropogenic sources otero et al 2007 groundwater and precipitation were the main water sources for river water in the studied area cao et al 2018 and they provide pathways to transport sulphate to the river however the concentrations of major ions in rain water are very low and generally range from 0 1 to 27 mg l in guizhou province han et al 2010b xiao et al 2011 wu et al 2012 there was little rain in the low flow season compared with the high flow season which suggests that atmospheric deposition was likely not a major source of the so4 2 in river water fig 4a b indicates that sulphide oxidation was the main sulphate source of the river water in both seasons and it exhibited the same characteristics as groundwater the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of rivers ranged from 17 11 to 11 75 and from 0 77 to 2 55 respectively in both seasons table 1 the variations in sulphate isotopes in the river water were within the range of those observed in groundwater the results presented above suggest that groundwater is a significant contributor of sulphate to river water 4 3 temporal and spatial variations in sulphate in the wetland water fig 3 demonstrates that the hydrogeochemistry of the caohai wetland water exhibits clear seasonal variations the average ph values of the wetland water were higher than those of the inflowing groundwater and river water in both seasons and the ph values of the wetland water during the high flow season were higher than those during the low flow season fig 3a the ec values and concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in wetland water were lower than those in groundwater and river water in both seasons additionally the ec values and concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in wetland water during the high flow season were lower than those during the low flow season fig 3b e previous studies have revealed that mg2 ions are mainly affected by evaporation and that changes in ec and ph values and the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 are associated with biogeochemical processes in wetlands cao et al 2016b such as photosynthesis by submerged plants and phytoplankton in contrast to these major ions the concentrations of the second most abundant anion so4 2 were slightly higher in the wetland water during the high flow season than during the low flow season fig 2a however the variations in the so4 2 content of the wetland water were within the ranges of those observed in groundwater and river water fig 3f in addition the so4 2 in wetland water exhibited clear spatial variations during the high flow season the water in the western and southern regions of the study area displayed low so4 2 contents and high δ34sso4 values and the water in the northern and eastern regions contained high so4 2 concentrations and low δ34sso4 values fig 6a these changes are consistent with the spatial variations in so4 2 and the associated isotopes in the surrounding river and spring water which further indicates that an so4 2 mixing process occurs within the wetland ecosystem during the low flow season seasonal variations in so4 2 and the associated isotopes in groundwater and river water are small fig 3f h but these variations in the wetland water did not correspond to the same spatial changes in groundwater and river water fig 6b additionally water in the southeastern region exhibited high so4 2 contents and low δ34sso4 values whereas water in the northwestern region displayed low so4 2 contents and high δ34sso4 values fig 4b demonstrates that almost all samples fall outside the experimental area of sulphates derived from the oxidation of sulphide during the low flow season additionally most of the wetland water samples plot inside this area during the high flow season and exhibit compositions that are similar to the isotopic composition of groundwater these results suggest that the sources of sulphate in the wetland water were different during both seasons generally surface water groundwater and rain water are the main water sources of wetland ecosystems mitsch and gosselink 2007 and these sources provide pathways that can be used to transport sulphate to the wetland the sulphate isotopic distribution of wetland water is shown in fig 7 these data indicate that groundwater and rain water are the main sulphate sources of wetland water in the high flow season and that rain water is the main sulphate source of wetland water in the low flow season this finding may be related to changes in the recharge water in the caohai wetland because the water source of the wetland in the high flow season is mainly groundwater with a secondary source of rain water conversely the main water source of the wetland during the low flow season is recharge from rain water cao et al 2018 studies have shown that the presence of aquatic vegetation and phytoplankton can change the concentration and isotopic composition of hco3 which indirectly affects the ec value ca2 concentration and do content of karst water liu et al 2008 montety et al 2011 the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values in the wetland were higher than those in the inflowing groundwater and river water samples in both seasons fig 3g h this result may also be related to the biogeochemistry of the wetland however the uptake and assimilation of sulphate by plants is known to involve a small degree of isotopic fractionation and the δ34s values of plants are 1 5 less than that of environmental sulphate trust and fry 1992 additionally the bacterial reduction of sulphate to sulphide is a ubiquitous process in wetlands mitsch and gosselink 2007 reddy and delaune 2008 under anaerobic conditions dissolved sulphate can be decomposed through a dsr reaction which is defined in the following chemical equation 5 so 4 2 2 ch 2 o h 2 s 2 hco 3 this process requires anaerobic conditions and is typically accompanied by a large degree of isotopic fractionation in which the sulphide product is depleted in the heavier 34s isotope relative to the reactant sulphate bottrell and coulson 2003 the large amount of isotopic fractionation involved in dsr means that a single step reduction process could produce sulphides with isotopic compositions ranging from 20 to 20 bottrell and raiswell 2000 depending on the proportion of sulphate that was reduced and the isotopic enrichment factor moreover the bacterial so4 reduction process also yields high δ18oso4 values because so4 reducing bacteria preferentially metabolize the light isotope of o 16o in dissolved so4 which causes the δ18oso4 values of the remaining so4 to increase van stempvoort and krouse 1994 in addition the dsr process shown in eq 5 can be applied to a variety of organic substrates and can generate alkalinity effects because protons are consumed during this reaction if this sequence represents the major geochemical process in the wetland the δ13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in wetland water should decrease however the δ13cdic values of wetland water 15 13 to 6 68 in the high flow season did not exhibit a significant decrease compared with that of inflowing water and the δ13cdic values of wetland water 6 23 to 0 06 were markedly higher than those of the inflowing groundwater and river water 12 61 to 7 80 during the low flow season cao et al 2016a factor analysis demonstrated that these factors only accounted for 9 97 and 10 47 respectively of the total observed variance in so4 2 cao et al 2016b this finding indicates that the dsr process likely has little effect on the chemical composition of wetland water in karst areas compared with processes such as photosynthesis and evaporation 5 conclusions in the present study processes that affect the contents and sources of sulphate in a karst dominated wetland caohai catchment in southwest china were identified using dual sulphate isotopic techniques the sulphate in inflowing groundwater was mainly derived from sulphide oxidation and the main source of sulphate in river water was groundwater the sources of sulphate in wetland water differed during the high and low flow seasons groundwater and rain water were the main sulphate sources of wetland water during the high flow season and rain water was the main sulphate source of wetland water during the low flow season this variation may be related to changes in recharge water in the caohai wetland in addition the sulphate isotopic values in the wetland were higher than those in the groundwater and inflowing rivers which suggests that a dsr reaction occurred in the wetland ecosystem however the effect of dsr on the chemical composition of wetland water may be small compared with the effects of other geochemical processes based on the results of hydrochemical and stable isotopic analyses performed in this study and published papers that studied the caohai wetland catchment a schematic diagram of the major pathways of major geochemical processes in this catchment is given in fig 8 the results presented above provide an improved understanding of the biogeochemical processes in wetland ecosystems the associated effects on catchment water chemistry in karst areas

7217,sulphur plays a critical role in the biogeochemistry of wetlands so4 2 is the sulphur form that is most commonly assimilated by plants and it is the medium of sulphur transformation in wetland ecosystems the caohai wetland is an important ecosystem on the yunnan guizhou plateau sw china and karst water is the most important water source in this wetland in this study the compositions of multiple isotopes δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 were measured in groundwater river water and wetland water in the caohai catchment to elucidate the solute sources and behaviours of sulphate the results suggest that so4 2 in groundwater is mainly derived from sulphide oxidation groundwater contributes a significant amount of sulphate to river water and it is the main sulphate source of wetland water during the high flow season in contrast rain water is the main sulphate source of wetland water during the low flow season due to the reduction in groundwater recharge these data indicate that groundwater is not only an important water source in the karst dominated wetland catchment but also provides pathways by which sulphate is transported to the wetland in addition due to the effects of dissimilatory sulphate reduction in the wetland the sulphate isotope composition in wetland water was higher than those in the groundwater and inflowing rivers which indicates that biogeochemical processes in wetland ecosystems influence the sulphate content and composition in karst water keywords dissolved sulphate stable isotope karst water wetland 1 introduction sulphur is a ubiquitous element that is present in many sources in the environment brown 1982 and it is the fourth most important nutrient after nitrogen phosphorus and potassium mitsch and gosselink 2007 sulphur biogeochemistry is an important regulator of redox chemistry it is strongly linked with the growth processes of plants reddy and delaune 2008 and it influences the compositions of protein cysteine and methionine and the processes of photosynthesis and respiration among others li et al 2007 wetlands form at the interfaces of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and exhibit features of both environments keddy 2012 and they can be easily distinguished from other land forms or water bodies by their characteristic vegetation arunachalam et al 2013 organic sulphur e g carbon bonded sulphur and ester sulphate and inorganic sulphur e g sulphate sulphite sulphide so2 and h2s are the two main forms of sulphur in wetland ecosystems of which sulphate so4 2 which is the only important sulphur containing ion in oxidizing solutions reddy and delaune 2008 is the form that is most commonly assimilated by plants skrzypek et al 2008 under the influence of biogeochemistry in wetland systems sulphate can be converted into different forms of sulphur therefore it is necessary to determine the source of sulphate to deepen our understanding of the sulphur cycle in wetlands the associated sources and controls cannot always be distinguished based on traditional analyses of so4 2 concentrations or so4 2 to cl ratios dogramaci et al 2017 which must be coupled with isotopic data the latter of which may involve δ34sso4 2 and δ18sso4 2 this approach has been proven successful in tracing natural and anthropogenic inputs in groundwater surface water and wetland ecosystems mandernack et al 2000 novák et al 2003 otero et al 2008 skrzypek et al 2008 li et al 2011 lambán et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 to date although many studies have reported information about the sulphur cycle in different types of wetlands luther et al 1986 king 1988 urban et al 1989 spratt and morgan 1990 mandernack et al 2000 li et al 2007 burton et al 2011 sun et al 2013b little is known about the sulphur cycle in karst dominated wetland catchments globally approximately 15 of land comprises karst areas and as much as 25 of the global population depends on karst water supplies jiang and yan 2010 because karst features are often developed in areas with highly soluble rocks particularly carbonate rocks jiang et al 2009 karst geology is characterized by relatively high degrees of heterogeneity porosity and connectivity compared to other geologic settings sun et al 2013a nowadays studying the carbon sink capacity of karst processes is a priority in global carbon cycle research liu et al 2010 larson 2011 montety et al 2011 chen et al 2017 generally bicarbonate hco3 is the dominant anion in karst water han and liu 2004 han et al 2010a and so4 2 is the second major anion although many studies have focused on revealing the sources and transformations of sulphate in karst waters böttcher 1999 li and zeng 2006 lang et al 2011 pu et al 2013 lambán et al 2015 little is known about the effects of supergene environments such as wetlands on sulphate in karst water as an important component of the critical zone of the earth wetlands are not only an important source of sulphur in the atmosphere adams et al 1981 brimblecombe 2014 but are also a sink for various sulphur sources in a basin when deposited in wetland soils sulphate can undergo dissimilatory sulphate reduction dsr 2ch2o so4 2 h 2co2 h2s 2h2o which can generate an alkalinity effect that serves as a buffer for wetland water and may offset acid deposition urban et al 1989 mandernack et al 2000 moreover the presence of sulphate in wetlands may decrease methane production blodau et al 2007 however the reaction that converts organic carbon to inorganic carbon in karst wetland ecosystems weakens the stability of the karst carbon sink thus sulphur cycling has a close relationship with carbon cycling in wetland ecosystems in karst areas therefore it is important to study the characteristics of variations in sulphate concentrations and isotopic compositions in wetland watersheds in karst areas to reveal the sources of sulphate in the basin and to improve the knowledge base regarding the stability of carbon sinks in karst processes carbonate terrains occupy more than 70 of the land surface in guizhou southwest china which is the centre of the east asian karst zone wu et al 2009 the caohai wetland which is located in northwest guizhou is a nationally important nature reserve for migratory birds previous studies of water chemistry and stable isotope geochemistry c h and o have shown that the major ion chemical and stable isotopic compositions of wetland water are different than those of inflowing water due to the geochemical processes that occur in the wetland cao et al 2016a b 2018 this paper presents the s and o isotopic compositions of so4 2 in groundwater river water and wetland water discusses the sources of so4 2 in these waters and together with the results of previous studies presents a schematic diagram of the geochemical processes in the caohai wetland catchment the results of this paper improve our understanding of the geochemical processes in wetland ecosystems and their effects on catchment water chemistry in karst areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the caohai wetland the caohai wetland 26 49 26 53 n 104 12 104 18 e is located in the northwestern region of guizhou province southwest china it is located approximately 350 km west of guiyang which is the capital of guizhou province this region is characterized by a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation at lake caohai is approximately 951 mm 88 of which occurs between may and october the wetland covers an area of 25 km2 and drains a catchment area of 99 km2 the maximum wetland depth is 5 0 m and the average depth is 2 4 m zhu et al 2011 the wetland has four inflowing rivers of which river r4 is the largest and one outflowing river r2 groundwater is discharged through wells and springs around the caohai wetland the main structure in the study area is the weining shuicheng anticline and the study area contains numerous tectonic faults that preferentially trend in a ne sw direction fig 1 the underlying bedrock in the catchment is dominated by carboniferous sedimentary carbonate rock fig 1 including the c1d1 formation which comprises coal bearing carbonate strata and carbonate strata c1d2 that contain gypsiferous layers i e gypsum or anhydrite the county history compilation committee of the weining county 1994 2 2 sample collection and analysis river artesian well spring and surface wetland water samples were collected in september 2014 high flow season and april 2015 low flow season surface wetland water samples were collected from 49 locations by traversing almost all of the wetland area on a boat these locations are referred to in this study using numbers from 1 to 49 fig 1 details of the sample collection and storage procedures used for these samples as well as details of the analytical procedures and results of the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition and hydrogeochemical analyses of these water samples are given in cao et al 2016b 2018 the concentration of fe in the water samples was determined using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms 7500a agilent at the college of resource and environmental engineering guizhou university the groundwater river water and mixed surface wetland water samples appendix a were analysed to determine their δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 compositions these water samples were acidified to a ph of 2 using distilled 6 m hcl and the so4 2 in the acidified samples was collected as baso4 compounds by adding a 10 bacl2 solution to avoid the effects of baco3 on oxygen isotopes baso4 solutions were boiled on an electric furnace zhang et al 2015 and baso4 solids were obtained after the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm quantitative filter paper using ultrapure water milli q 18 2 mω cm to flush the residues until the filtrates did not contain cl as determined using the agno3 test then the residues were combusted at 850 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace the δ34sso4 composition of baso4 was determined by analysing so2 gas using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms gv instrument corp uk at the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry in guiyang city china baso4 was loaded in a tin cup converted to so2 in an elemental analyser euro ea 3000 euro vector s p a italy at 1000 c and passed into the irms isoprime the δ18oso4 composition of baso4 was measured by analysing co gas using the same mass spectrometer the samples were combusted with excess glassy carbon at 1300 c using vanadium trioxide as a catalyst and they were then passed into the irms isoprime the resulting δ34sso4 values were expressed relative to the canyon diablo troilite v cdt standard and the resulting δ18sso4 values were expressed relative to the v smow standard the international sulphur standard nbs 127 was measured along with the samples the precisions of the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 analyses were estimated to be better than 0 2 and 0 5 respectively based on repeated analyses of internal standards 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical compositions the average ph value of the inflowing river water samples was 7 82 during the high flow season and 7 87 during the low flow season and that of the groundwater was 7 23 and 7 25 during the high flow and low flow seasons respectively the water in the wetland ranged from slightly acidic to alkaline ph 6 72 9 72 during the high flow season and it was alkaline ph 7 22 8 93 during the low flow season the major cations in the inflowing river groundwater and wetland water samples were ca2 and mg2 in these water samples the most abundant anion was hco3 and the second most abundant anion was so4 2 appendix a the chemical compositions of the inflowing river and groundwater samples were mainly characterized by ca hco3 although some of the groundwater wells were categorized by ca so4 in contrast wetland water samples were classified based on mg hco3 mg so4 ca hco3 and caso4 during periods of vegetation growth during the high flow season and characterized by cahco3 following the death of aquatic vegetation during the low flow season cao et al 2016b the sulphate concentrations of these water samples exhibited variable features the sulphate concentrations in the inflowing groundwater and river samples ranged from 0 16 to 1 99 mmol l during the high flow season and from 0 16 to 2 53 mmol l during the low flow season the sulphate concentrations in the wetland water samples ranged from 0 18 to 1 04 mmol l during the high flow season and from 0 21 to 0 74 mmol l during the low flow season table 1 3 2 sulphate isotopic δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 characteristics the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of groundwater in the study area ranged from 29 54 to 5 56 and from 3 79 to 2 51 respectively during both seasons the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of rivers ranged from 17 11 to 11 75 and from 0 77 to 2 55 respectively during both seasons table 1 however the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of wetland water ranged from 11 45 to 2 36 and from 0 16 to 9 24 respectively during the high flow season n 18 and from 3 51 to 7 50 and from 5 87 to 12 84 respectively during the low flow season n 19 the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of wetland water were higher than those of the inflowing water samples during both seasons fig 2 b c and the δ18oso4 values of the groundwater river and wetland samples fell between the δ18oh2o and atmospheric oxygen isotope values 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal variations in water chemistry and sources of sulphate in groundwater there are no obvious seasonal variations in the ph and ec values of groundwater as both plot close to the 1 1 line fig 3 a b dilution effects are common due to high precipitation during the high flow season in the karst areas of southwest china li et al 2008 therefore fig 3c e shows that the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the low flow season were higher than those during the high flow season which reflects the dilution effects of rainfall the concentrations and isotopic compositions of so4 2 fig 3f h in the groundwater plot close to the 1 1 line which may indicate that the so4 2 in groundwater has the same origin in both seasons generally sulphate in this groundwater has multiple origins which mainly include 1 anthropogenic origins sulphur compounds contributed from atmospheric pollution fertilizers sewage and mine drainage 2 geogenic origins sulphate mainly formed by the dissolution of evaporites and the oxidation of sulphide minerals and 3 biological origins sulphate produced by the decomposition and mineralization of organic matter contained in soils thus the sulphur isotopic compositions of these sources are highly different the results of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic analyses indicate that the groundwater is of meteoric origin cao et al 2018 and that the principal source of sulphate in rain water is seawater spray additionally the δ34s values of precipitation so4 in coastal areas tend to have a marine like signature of 21 newman et al 1991 because the study area is located in an inland area and the nearest coastline is located approximately 1000 km from the wetland the effect of seawater spray is negligible although no values of atmospherically deposited δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 have been measured in the study area δ34sso4 monitoring data were obtained from rain water near caohai xiao et al 2011 demonstrated that the δ34sso4 values of rain water in guiyang city range from 12 0 to 9 4 with a mean value of 2 8 values of δ18oso4 between 7 and 17 are frequently observed in precipitation based sulphate in temperate regions krouse and mayer 2000 fertilizer and sewage are also important factors that affect δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values zhang et al 2015 stated that the average δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of fertilizers were 4 9 6 7 n 102 and 12 6 3 3 n 41 respectively otero et al 2008 reported that the inflow and outflow waters of several sewage treatment plants recorded δ34sso4 values of 7 1 13 5 and δ18oso4 values of 8 2 12 5 in the llobregat catchment spain because mining activities are prohibited in national nature reserves in china there is no mine drainage in the study area the underlying bedrock in the catchment is dominated by carboniferous sedimentary carbonate rock the carbonate strata c1d2 contain a gypsiferous layer gypsum or anhydrite and these strata are mainly distributed in the southwestern and southern regions of the study area fig 1 the δ34sso4 values of gypsum exhibited long term variations reaching a maximum value of nearly 35 in the cambrian and a minimum value of less than 10 in the permian the δ18oso4 values of primary marine sulphate minerals have varied between 7 and 20 throughout the history of the earth krouse and mayer 2000 according to table 2 the average sulphur isotopic composition of groundwater in the caohai catchment is lower than that of groundwater in other karst areas and the sulphur isotopic compositions of karst waters from different karst areas vary widely indicating that the sulphate in karst waters can have many different origins the observed negative value of δ34sso4 may be related to the oxidation of sulphides for example the c1d1 formation comprises coal bearing carbonate strata that are widely distributed throughout the study area fig 1 in these strata sulphide rich i e pyrite rich coal is interbedded with carbonates the δ34s values of pyrite can range from 40 to 5 nielsen et al 1991 because the oxidation of pyrite to sulphate only produces minor isotopic fractionation the so4 2 that is produced maintains the δ34s value of the primary sulphide taylor et al 1984 moreover sulphates that form via sulphide oxidation exhibit a relationship between δ18oso4 and δ18oh2o as water is the source of 50 100 of the oxygen in so4 otero et al 2008 van stempvoort and krouse 1994 defined the area on a δ18oso4 vs δ18oh2o diagram where sulphates derived from sulphide oxidation must fall in addition sulphur mineralization is one of the key processes during the biogeochemical cycle of sulphur as sulphate produced by this process can be transported to groundwater by leaching the percentage of organic s in total s was high in limestone soil 75 7 92 9 and yellow soil 72 1 90 6 in the karst area of southwest china and the δ34s values of organic s in these soils ranged from 1 63 to 0 50 zhang et al 2010 this range indicates that no significant changes in δ34s values occurred during the oxidation process krouse and mayer 2000 the δ34sso4 value of groundwater was lower than the δ34s value of organic s which suggests that the organic s in soil may not be a major source of sulphate in groundwater previous studies have shown that some groundwater has been polluted by human activities based on the presence of high concentrations of no3 cao et al 2016b however the distribution of sulphate isotopes in groundwater shown in fig 4 a demonstrates that reduced inorganic sulphur compounds rather than rain water fertilizer or sewage were the main sulphate sources of groundwater during both seasons additionally fig 4b shows that almost all samples fall within the experimentally defined area of sulphates derived from sulphide oxidation and the groundwater samples plot in a range between 50 and 86 of sulphate oxygen derived from water fig 4c which is consistent with the results of otero et al 2008 these results suggest that the so4 contents of groundwater and river water are linked to sulphide oxidation generally sulphide oxidation not only decreases the δ34sso4 values of groundwater but also adds hydrogen ions to groundwater which in turn lower the ph e g oxidation of pyrite eqs 1 and 2 however the average ph value of groundwater during the high flow and low flow seasons was 7 23 and 7 25 respectively and the fe contents of the groundwater samples were 0 3 ppm table 1 these results may be related to the dissolution of carbonate in karst geological systems containing relatively soluble minerals in the solid phase such as calcite and dolomite groundwater acidity generated by the oxidation of pyrite can be buffered by carbonate dissolution eqs 3 and 4 1 fe 2 1 4 o 2 h fe 3 1 2 h 2 o 2 fes 2 14 fe 3 8 h 2 o 16 h 2 so 4 2 15 fe 2 3 2 h so 4 2 caco 3 2 h 2 o caso 4 2 h 2 o hco 3 4 2 h so 4 2 camg co 3 2 2 h 2 o caso 4 2 h 2 o hco 3 mg 2 in addition fig 5 shows that the so4 2 concentrations and δ34sso4 values in the caohai groundwater exhibit a significant inverse correlation high flow season r 0 59 p 0 05 low flow season r 0 77 p 0 01 this trend indicates that the contribution of biogenic sulphur is significant because previous studies have shown that coal from guizhou province has a low δ34s value and high sulphur content hong et al 1992 additionally the sulphur in high sulphur coal may come from bacterially reduced sulphates which can create a distinct bias towards negative δ34s values ni and hong 1999 moreover the concentrations and isotopic compositions of sulphate exhibit obvious spatial distribution characteristics as shown in fig 6 a b the groundwater in the southwestern and southern regions of the study area displayed low so4 2 concentrations and high δ34sso4 values and that in the southeastern and northern regions had high so4 2 concentrations and low δ34sso4 values this variation may be related to the stratigraphic distribution of the c1d2 formation in the study area as this formation contains a gypsiferous layer that is mainly distributed in the southwestern and southern regions of the study area fig 1 the groundwater from the southwestern and southern regions in the c1d1 formation may have mixed with some of the groundwater from the c1d2 formation during groundwater recharge 4 2 sources of sulphate in inflowing river water the average ph value of the inflowing river water was higher than that of groundwater in both seasons fig 3a which may have resulted in photosynthesis in the river via phytoplankton which assimilate dissolved co2 as soon as sunlight is available li et al 2005 the ec variations in river water were within the range of those observed in groundwater fig 3b the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in the low flow season were higher than those in the high flow season fig 3c e these differences may have been influenced by evaporation in contrast the concentrations of so4 2 and its isotopes formed a nearly 1 1 line in both seasons fig 3f h dissolved sulphate in river water can have different origins such as the dissolution of evaporites the oxidation of reduced sulphur compounds air deposition rain water and anthropogenic sources otero et al 2007 groundwater and precipitation were the main water sources for river water in the studied area cao et al 2018 and they provide pathways to transport sulphate to the river however the concentrations of major ions in rain water are very low and generally range from 0 1 to 27 mg l in guizhou province han et al 2010b xiao et al 2011 wu et al 2012 there was little rain in the low flow season compared with the high flow season which suggests that atmospheric deposition was likely not a major source of the so4 2 in river water fig 4a b indicates that sulphide oxidation was the main sulphate source of the river water in both seasons and it exhibited the same characteristics as groundwater the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values of rivers ranged from 17 11 to 11 75 and from 0 77 to 2 55 respectively in both seasons table 1 the variations in sulphate isotopes in the river water were within the range of those observed in groundwater the results presented above suggest that groundwater is a significant contributor of sulphate to river water 4 3 temporal and spatial variations in sulphate in the wetland water fig 3 demonstrates that the hydrogeochemistry of the caohai wetland water exhibits clear seasonal variations the average ph values of the wetland water were higher than those of the inflowing groundwater and river water in both seasons and the ph values of the wetland water during the high flow season were higher than those during the low flow season fig 3a the ec values and concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in wetland water were lower than those in groundwater and river water in both seasons additionally the ec values and concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 in wetland water during the high flow season were lower than those during the low flow season fig 3b e previous studies have revealed that mg2 ions are mainly affected by evaporation and that changes in ec and ph values and the concentrations of ca2 and hco3 are associated with biogeochemical processes in wetlands cao et al 2016b such as photosynthesis by submerged plants and phytoplankton in contrast to these major ions the concentrations of the second most abundant anion so4 2 were slightly higher in the wetland water during the high flow season than during the low flow season fig 2a however the variations in the so4 2 content of the wetland water were within the ranges of those observed in groundwater and river water fig 3f in addition the so4 2 in wetland water exhibited clear spatial variations during the high flow season the water in the western and southern regions of the study area displayed low so4 2 contents and high δ34sso4 values and the water in the northern and eastern regions contained high so4 2 concentrations and low δ34sso4 values fig 6a these changes are consistent with the spatial variations in so4 2 and the associated isotopes in the surrounding river and spring water which further indicates that an so4 2 mixing process occurs within the wetland ecosystem during the low flow season seasonal variations in so4 2 and the associated isotopes in groundwater and river water are small fig 3f h but these variations in the wetland water did not correspond to the same spatial changes in groundwater and river water fig 6b additionally water in the southeastern region exhibited high so4 2 contents and low δ34sso4 values whereas water in the northwestern region displayed low so4 2 contents and high δ34sso4 values fig 4b demonstrates that almost all samples fall outside the experimental area of sulphates derived from the oxidation of sulphide during the low flow season additionally most of the wetland water samples plot inside this area during the high flow season and exhibit compositions that are similar to the isotopic composition of groundwater these results suggest that the sources of sulphate in the wetland water were different during both seasons generally surface water groundwater and rain water are the main water sources of wetland ecosystems mitsch and gosselink 2007 and these sources provide pathways that can be used to transport sulphate to the wetland the sulphate isotopic distribution of wetland water is shown in fig 7 these data indicate that groundwater and rain water are the main sulphate sources of wetland water in the high flow season and that rain water is the main sulphate source of wetland water in the low flow season this finding may be related to changes in the recharge water in the caohai wetland because the water source of the wetland in the high flow season is mainly groundwater with a secondary source of rain water conversely the main water source of the wetland during the low flow season is recharge from rain water cao et al 2018 studies have shown that the presence of aquatic vegetation and phytoplankton can change the concentration and isotopic composition of hco3 which indirectly affects the ec value ca2 concentration and do content of karst water liu et al 2008 montety et al 2011 the δ34sso4 and δ18oso4 values in the wetland were higher than those in the inflowing groundwater and river water samples in both seasons fig 3g h this result may also be related to the biogeochemistry of the wetland however the uptake and assimilation of sulphate by plants is known to involve a small degree of isotopic fractionation and the δ34s values of plants are 1 5 less than that of environmental sulphate trust and fry 1992 additionally the bacterial reduction of sulphate to sulphide is a ubiquitous process in wetlands mitsch and gosselink 2007 reddy and delaune 2008 under anaerobic conditions dissolved sulphate can be decomposed through a dsr reaction which is defined in the following chemical equation 5 so 4 2 2 ch 2 o h 2 s 2 hco 3 this process requires anaerobic conditions and is typically accompanied by a large degree of isotopic fractionation in which the sulphide product is depleted in the heavier 34s isotope relative to the reactant sulphate bottrell and coulson 2003 the large amount of isotopic fractionation involved in dsr means that a single step reduction process could produce sulphides with isotopic compositions ranging from 20 to 20 bottrell and raiswell 2000 depending on the proportion of sulphate that was reduced and the isotopic enrichment factor moreover the bacterial so4 reduction process also yields high δ18oso4 values because so4 reducing bacteria preferentially metabolize the light isotope of o 16o in dissolved so4 which causes the δ18oso4 values of the remaining so4 to increase van stempvoort and krouse 1994 in addition the dsr process shown in eq 5 can be applied to a variety of organic substrates and can generate alkalinity effects because protons are consumed during this reaction if this sequence represents the major geochemical process in the wetland the δ13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in wetland water should decrease however the δ13cdic values of wetland water 15 13 to 6 68 in the high flow season did not exhibit a significant decrease compared with that of inflowing water and the δ13cdic values of wetland water 6 23 to 0 06 were markedly higher than those of the inflowing groundwater and river water 12 61 to 7 80 during the low flow season cao et al 2016a factor analysis demonstrated that these factors only accounted for 9 97 and 10 47 respectively of the total observed variance in so4 2 cao et al 2016b this finding indicates that the dsr process likely has little effect on the chemical composition of wetland water in karst areas compared with processes such as photosynthesis and evaporation 5 conclusions in the present study processes that affect the contents and sources of sulphate in a karst dominated wetland caohai catchment in southwest china were identified using dual sulphate isotopic techniques the sulphate in inflowing groundwater was mainly derived from sulphide oxidation and the main source of sulphate in river water was groundwater the sources of sulphate in wetland water differed during the high and low flow seasons groundwater and rain water were the main sulphate sources of wetland water during the high flow season and rain water was the main sulphate source of wetland water during the low flow season this variation may be related to changes in recharge water in the caohai wetland in addition the sulphate isotopic values in the wetland were higher than those in the groundwater and inflowing rivers which suggests that a dsr reaction occurred in the wetland ecosystem however the effect of dsr on the chemical composition of wetland water may be small compared with the effects of other geochemical processes based on the results of hydrochemical and stable isotopic analyses performed in this study and published papers that studied the caohai wetland catchment a schematic diagram of the major pathways of major geochemical processes in this catchment is given in fig 8 the results presented above provide an improved understanding of the biogeochemical processes in wetland ecosystems the associated effects on catchment water chemistry in karst areas

sulphate in wetland water it was not possible to precipitate enough baso4 for analysis from 500 ml of wetland water therefore based on the distribution of different types of aquatic vegetation and

7218,variability in micrometeorological conditions and their influence on estimated reference evapotranspiration ret rates were evaluated across a heterogeneous urban environment micrometeorological data sets incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were collected over a one year period at six weather stations in new york city ny usa weather stations are located at four new urban green space monitoring sites and two airports reference evapotranspiration ret rates were estimated from the micrometeorological data sets for a short reference surface at a daily time step using the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation a penman monteith based combination equation non parametric comparative statistical analyses kruskal wallis revealed statistically significant differences at significance level α 0 05 in micrometeorological conditions and estimated ret rates between the six sites on a cumulative annual basis estimated ret varied by up to 40 percent between the sites a new technique for adjusting weather data collected at one location e g regional airports for use at another location e g interior engineered urban green spaces was evaluated the study highlights the importance for accurate estimation of et of onsite micrometeorological data sets but concludes that additional research is needed to more thoroughly characterize micrometeorological variability across heterogeneous urban environments and also to evaluate the influence of non meteorological determinants e g vegetation type soil media type media moisture conditions and anthropogenic heat fluxes on urban et keywords micrometeorology evapotranspiration urban environment spatial variability ecohydrology urban microclimate 1 introduction 1 1 background micrometeorological conditions are known to vary due in part to land surface heterogeneity across urban environments oke 1988 quantification of this variability is important to better manage urban microclimatic conditions e g by developing approaches for mitigating urban heat islands or adapting to other forms of forecasted climate change and to improve the accuracy of urban hydrologic and energy flux models themselves used to forecast the effect that different actions e g afforestation projects could have on urban water and energy budgets hydrologic and energy balances are intimately linked through the evaporative or latent heat flux term while other factors including vegetation type and media moisture conditions can impact actual rates of evapotranspiration et the influence of micrometeorological conditions alone on et can be substantial for example urban tree transpiration rate studies conducted in beijing china over a two year consecutive monitoring period found that 80 of the daily variation in tree transpiration rates could be explained by atmospheric and climatic conditions wang et al 2012 al kofahi et al 2012 showed that reference evapotranspiration ret in albuquerque nm varied by zip code and was based in part on temperature differences between locations because of its influence on et the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions in urban environments also carries important implications for the planning design and management of urban landscapes for example differences in urban et imply different urban landscape irrigation needs feldhake et al 1983 nouri et al 2013 with a direct link to urban water resource management and water conservation planning differences in urban et also imply potential differences in the ecosystem services e g stormwater management microclimate regulation and carbon sequestration that can be extracted from urban landscapes jim and chen 2009 pwd 2009 nycdep 2010 metselaar 2012 suggested that understanding spatial variability in urban et rates can improve urban design by helping to match vegetation and substrate types to the hydrologic requirements dictated by local micrometeorological conditions lemonsu et al 2012 assert that to assess the benefits associated with et the role of micrometeorological variability and urban et needs better representation in urban et modeling table 1 summarizes all of existing studies known to the authors that attempt to measure or model the variation of meteorological conditions and or evapotranspiration latent heat fluxes across heterogeneous urban environments because spatial differences in micrometeorological conditions are poorly characterized in the urban environment accurate estimation of actual et fluxes is difficult the energy balance based lumps model grimmond and oke 2002 was used to simulate temperature changes under different greening scenarios and water usage rates in phoenix az usa as noted by the author a limitation of the study was that the lumps model used micrometeorological data from a single weather station and did not account for neighborhood level variations gober et al 2010 the same limitation was noted by middel et al 2012 in their attempts to parameterize lumps for surface energy balance seb studies in phoenix az usa and portland or usa digiovanni et al 2013 found that et estimates from regional weather stations did not perform as well as estimates from onsite micrometeorological data in comparison to actual et rates measured from a green roof in new york city ny usa though some urban energy water balance models include methods to account for site scale variability in micrometeorological conditions validation of these approaches is currently limited by the availability of observed data for example improvements to the town energy balance teb model lemonsu et al 2007 2012 now allow for the influence of urban green areas and differences in local microclimatic conditions to be modeled explicitly without actual urban data sets the model s performance cannot be evaluated similarly the weather research and forecasting model wrf urban model coupled with eulag cfd urban now enables downscaling for microscale 1 10 m site specific simulations chen et al 2011 but one of the challenges for executing the wrf urban modeling system is the specification of a potentially vast number of parameters which are rarely available chen et al 2011 using a reduced number of inputs in comparison to grimmond and oke 1991 the surface urban energy balance scheme suews järvi et al 2011 calculates urban energy and water balances at the neighborhood scale even so critical site specific micrometeorological inputs are difficult to parameterize with limited existing data sets other approaches for accounting for spatial variability in the urban microclimate were developed including recent advances but these too require more urban micrometeorological observations microclimate coefficients km were suggested to adapt estimates of ret computed from penman monteith based combination equations using offsite weather station data e g from airports to local conditions costello and jones 1994a b eching and snyder 2005 however eching and snyder 2005 noted that scientifically based information on these parameters microclimate etcetera is limited bean and pitt 2012 inventoried the locations of remote automated weather stations raws nationwide us revealing that readily available micrometeorological data and et estimates are lacking in urban areas particularly in the eastern usa at the site scale stewart and oke 2012 presented local climate zones lcz as a means for classifying sites based on site characteristics for temperature studies the lcz classification system can be used to build spatial databases of urban form and cover for cities worldwide once developed the lcz system can function easily and inexpensively for any city or region however the lcz classification system cannot be fully elaborated without actual urban microclimatic data because extensive networks of weather stations are not currently found in urban environments the independent variables driving et models are often by necessity obtained from regional climate stations typically located at airports and in other open spaces due to modifications of urban wind speed and direction as well as incoming solar radiation by the presence of buildings and other above ground structures oke 1982 1988 actual conditions at urban leaf and soil surfaces can differ significantly from those observed at regional weather station sites urban air temperatures in turn are tempered by the presence of low albedo impervious surfaces grimmond and oke 1999 takebayashi and moriyama 2007 shashua bar et al 2009 which may also contribute to differences between values measured at offsite weather stations and at the site level note that throughout this manuscript we use micrometeorological to refer to our site scale meteorological measurements based on scale and characteristic time definitions though our measurements are aggregated to daily values the definition of microscale in terms of horizontal scale and characteristic time as presented in orlanski 1975 are 2 km and 1 hr roughly most of the monitored sites fall into the micro γ scale at 20 m and observations made at hourly or shorter 5 min intervals 1 2 objectives using new york city usa as a case study the objectives of this paper are to i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions measured at the site scale and estimated ret rates ii determine the relative role of incoming solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed in influencing reference evapotranspiration ret rates at the site scale and iii develop methods for adapting offsite e g airport micrometeorological and et data sets to different urban conditions e g interior engineered urban green spaces to address the first objective micrometeorological data gathered at six different nyc weather station sites are used to estimate and statistically compare ret values across new york city the micrometeorological data included incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for short reference surfaces was used to calculate daily ret rates ret estimates are presented specifically to demonstrate the potential influence that micrometeorological variability and not other factors could have on urban et and thus no correction coefficients to the ret estimates are presented here the sensitivity of ret estimates to vegetation dependent parameters are however evaluated in this paper and presented in the supplementary materials the second objective is addressed to determine the relative role of each micrometeorological parameter in influencing ret rates by statistical analyses using correlation coefficients to address the third objective site specific microclimate coefficients are applied to ret estimates and new parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p are developed and evaluated 2 study sites micrometeorological data sets including incoming solar radiation rsin air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed uz were acquired from six sites located in nyc the locations physical characteristics and local climate zone lcz classification of the monitoring sites are presented in table 2 and their locations mapped in fig 1 the sites include one bioinfiltration area three green roofs and two airport locations the monitoring setups at the green roof sites and bioinfiltration area were installed by drexel university and columbia university as part of ongoing studies the monitoring setups at the two airport locations are maintained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws and the publicly available data sets were obtained from the northeast regional climate center nrcc monitoring equipment installed at the sites is listed in table 3 images of the weather stations are shown in fig 2 data presented here was collected between 1 aug 2010 and 31 july 2013 3 methods 3 1 objective i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions and estimated ret rates 3 1 1 reference evapotranspiration the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for short reference surfaces allen et al 2005 as shown in eq 1 was utilized for the estimation of daily reference evapotranspiration ret rates 1 et os 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t

incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed measured at five minute or hourly intervals were averaged between 00 00 and 23 59 to compute daily values per standard procedures outlined in the asce standardized reference equation allen et al 2005 for input into eq 1 as wind measurements at the monitored sites were taken above two meters height and above surfaces other than clipped grass the full logarithmic equation as presented in appendix b of the asce ewri standardized reference evapotranspiration equation was applied to adjust wind speed to two meters height allen et al 2005 terms not monitored at all sites e g soil heat flux were estimated using procedures laid out for the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation allen et al 2005 specifically soil heat flux was assumed to be zero over the daily time period since ret estimates are presented specifically to demonstrate the potential influence that micrometeorological variability and not other factors could have on urban et estimates standard methods are followed for all sites though the limitations of this application are acknowledged the sensitivity of ret to vegetation dependent parameters cn and cd are evaluated in this paper and presented in the supplementary materials according to the guidelines set by the allen et al 2005 task committee reference evapotranspiration is defined as the et rate from a uniform surface of dense actively growing vegetation having specified height and surface resistance not short of soil water and representing an expanse of at least 100 m of the same or similar vegetation such conditions often do not exist in urban environments including in the areas surrounding urban weather stations further according to allen et al 2005 many urban weather stations fail both the underlying surface requirement and the recommended separation distance from obstacles weather stations should be located in sites that closely approximate the reference conditions application of penman monteith based combination equations to estimate et from heterogeneous urban environments is thus challenging some researchers have used crop coefficients doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and non growing season coefficients allen et al 1998 to adjust ret estimates obtained from the asce equations to closer approximate actual et rates however allen et al 2005 does not recommend a methodology for the application of reference evapotranspiration during non growing seasons allen et al 2005 moreover because the goal of this study from micrometeorological variability alone no correction coefficients to the ret estimates are presented here further evaluation of the applicability of the asce reference evapotranspiration equation to urban green spaces is warranted though is considered beyond the scope of this study ret rates were calculated using matlab v 2012a and 2017b mathworks 2012 with a custom coded program developed by the authors and validated by hand calculation and through comparison to results obtained by ref et software v 3 1 08 allen 2012 per the developer s recommendation ref et software was used only as a validation program and not as the primary means for computing ret 3 1 2 statistics for statistical comparison of micrometeorological and ret data across sites non parametric statistical tests of daily data sets were employed since the data sets were not normally distributed especially u2 and ret the non parametric kruskal wallis test was used to compare rsin t rh and u2 and ret across the sites specifically the kruskal wallis test was used to test the hypotheses listed in table 4 each hypothesis was tested across all sites e g the distribution of reference evapotranspiration ret is the same across sites bio c gr c gr f air jfk air lg and gr qbg and across all pairs of sites e g the distribution of reference evapotranspiration ret is the same across sites bio c and gr f kruskal wallis tests were evaluated using ibm spss statistics software v 20 0 0 ibm corporation 2011 statistical analyses were performed on a sub set of the data collected for a total of 327 days between 26 jul 2011 and 5 aug 2012 for which data was simultaneously available from all of the six monitoring sites 3 2 objective ii determine the relative role of micrometeorological conditions in influencing ret rates the relationship between individual micrometeorological parameters rsin t rh and u2 and ret were evaluated using spearman s rank correlation coefficients spearman s rho coefficients were determined to rank the relative importance of the influence that each of the various micrometeorological determinants had on estimated ret correlation coefficients between 1 0 and 0 8 are considered strong those between 0 8 and 0 5 moderate and those less than 0 5 are considered weak devore 2004 spearman s rho correlation coefficients were evaluated using ibm spss statistics software v 20 0 0 ibm corporation 2011 spearman s rho correlation coefficients were developed based on data collected between 26 jul 2011 and 5 aug 2012 for which data was simultaneously available from all of the six monitoring sites 3 3 objective iii develop methods for adapting offsite micrometeorological data sets to different urban conditions 3 3 1 development of km and k m p microclimate coefficients km and new parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p were developed from data collected at all sites bio c gr c gr f air jfk air lg and gr qbg between 26 jul 2011 and 5 aug 2012 the use of a single microclimate coefficient to adjust ret estimated by penman monteith based methods for local microclimate differences was proposed by others costello and jones 1994a b eching and snyder 2005 and applied here as shown in eq 2 2 et m k m et o where etm is the reference evapotranspiration at the local site km is the microclimate coefficient eto is the reference evapotranspiration at the reference site e g airport here parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p are proposed to account for differences in local weather conditions given the relationship in eq 3 3 p j k m p j k p k where p is the parameter of interest in this case rsin t rh u2 or ret j is the site to which the data set is being adjusted to i e the local condition in this case j is bio c gr c gr f air jfk or gr qbg k m p j k is the parameter specific microclimate coefficient for parameter p for site j in relation to site k k is the site from which the data set is being adjusted from i e the offsite measurement in this case air lg we developed monthly microclimate coefficients for ret parameter specific microclimate coefficients for rsin t rh and u2 using eq 4 below an airport site air lg was selected as the reference site because operated and maintained weather stations providing publicly available data sets are often located at airports 4 k m p j k i 1 n x p j i x p k i n x p j i is the i th value of parameter p

k i must be equivalent n is the number of values of x in this case the number of days in a given month 3 3 2 validation to evaluate the performance of developed microclimate coefficients two validation periods were used comparing predicted vs observed onsite micrometeorological conditions and ret to determine predicted onsite conditions the monthly parameter specific microclimate coefficients developed from data collected 26 jul 2011 through 5 aug 2012 were applied to air lg data sets for separate validation periods for bio c and gr f the validation period was 1 aug 2012 through 31 july 2013 the year following the microclimate coefficient development period based on data availability the validation period for gr c air jfk and gr qbg was 1 aug 2010 through 31 july 2011 the year prior to the microclimate coefficient development period though data collection is ongoing at the sites the validation period was limited to one year to reduce potential temporal impacts specifically shifts in km and or k m p could occur over time with further urbanization development and or climate change and are considered beyond the scope of this paper root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe were all used to compare predicted and observed data to represent average errors with more weight on large errors in the case of rmse and bias errors with mbe 4 results 4 1 objective i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions and estimated ret rates 4 1 1 micrometeorological and ret data sets box and whisker plots of

observed data also seasonal box and whisker plots are shown in fig 13 of the supplementary materials cumulative ret for all of the sites is shown in fig 4 cumulative ret over the period of analysis at bio c gr c gr f air jfk and air lg respectively was 8 5 17 1 7 6 31 7 and 40 2 percent greater than gr qbg which had the lowest cumulative ret gaps in the curves depict days when data was unavailable

days for each month average 90 standard deviation 10 4 1 2 statistical results the results of kruskal wallis analyses for the period of analysis across all sites are presented in table 5 the results indicate that daily data sets of ret rsin t rh and u2 were statistically significantly different at the 0 05 significance level when compared across all sites tables 6 10 present the kruskal wallis test results also evaluated at the 0 05 significance level over the period of analysis for each of the paired site to site hypothesis tests seasonal results are presented in table 16 through table 20

table 6 10 for both the ten site pairs with statistically significant differences in ret and the five site pairs with no statistically significant differences in ret micrometeorological parameters differed significantly with respect to rsin t rh and u2 as seen in table 11 4 2 objective ii determine the relative role of micrometeorological conditions in influencing ret rates the spearman s rank

average correlation coefficients of 0 30 and 0 07 respectively seasonal spearman s rank correlation coefficients are shown in table 21 of the supplementary materials further a sensitivity analysis on input parameters for determining ret is included in the supplementary materials 4 3 objective iii develop methods for adapting offsite micrometeorological data sets to different urban conditions 4 3 1

annual averages presented in table 13 in the supplementary materials fig 15 shows plots of each data set ret rsin t rh and u2 for all sites relative to the reference site air lg 4 3 2 validation charts of predicted vs observed ret r s in t rh and u2 for the microclimate coefficient validation periods are shown in figs 7 11 respectively fig 6 presents the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and mean bias error mbe between observed and predicted ret rsin t rh and u2 application of microclimate coefficients reduced the rmse in daily observed vs predicted ret at the sites from 0 7 to 1 1 mm day to 0 3 0 5 mm day and mbe mean bias error from 0 92 through 0 12 to 0 19 through 0 09 mm day further the error in cumulative annual ret was reduced from a maximum of 40 to a maximum of 9 5 discussion 5 1 objective i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions and estimated ret rates our findings suggest that spatial variability in micrometeorological conditions specifically r s in t rh and u2 across heterogeneous urban environments is significant and that the variability in micrometeorological conditions impacts spatial variability in site scale reference evapotranspiration al kofahi et al 2012 also showed that ret varied across an urban area specifically albuquerque nm usa here we explore the relationship between ret r s in t rh and u2 for nyc ny usa highlighting the complex relationship between meteorological variability and variability in ret notably for the two thirds of site to site comparisons that showed statistically significant differences in ret the micrometeorological parameters differed significantly with respect to various sets of parameters e g rh and u2 t and u2 rsin t rh and u2 etc wind speed showed the greatest variability across sites with statistically significant differences between all site to site comparisons we highlight here that with average ratios of two meter wind speed between bio c gr c gr f gr qbg and air lg ranging from 0 25 to 0 67 and air jfk to air lg of 1 08 table 12 wind speed at all interior urban green spaces bio c gr c gr f and gr qbg was considerably lower than at the airport sites air jfk and air lg this observation is consistent with findings reported in an analysis of 652 stations across the monsoon regions of china which found that urban stations generally observed lower wind speeds than rural stations guo et al 2011 these findings are also consistent with studies which identified decreasing wind speed trends with urbanization in madrid valencia and alicante spain azorin molina et al 2014 and beijing china li et al 2011 lower wind speeds in urban areas are largely expected based on urban frictional effects oke 1988 mcvicar et al 2007 yet common practice dictates the use of regional weather stations commonly located in open areas at airports to represent interior urban spaces the variability of meteorological data sets across sites and particularly between airport and interior urban spaces emphasizes the need for methods to adequately represent actual urban site meteorological conditions especially for sites without in situ measurements and particularly in evaluating et the use of regional weather stations typically located at airports for the estimation of urban site scale reference evapotranspiration could introduce substantial errors due to micrometeorological variability over the 327 day period we analyzed cumulative ret fig 4 was 40 2 greater at air lg reference airport site than at gr qbg suggesting that among nyc sites errors on the magnitude of 40 in cumulative annual ret estimates could be introduced by not considering the local microclimate of individual sites this finding is significant considering the common practice of using data sets from regional climate stations usually airports to estimate et in a variety of water resource studies jacobs et al 2015 also highlighted from their evaluation of micrometeorological and evapotranspiration observations in dutch cities that estimation of urban evaporation from routine weather data using the concept of reference evaporation would be a particularly challenging task as the urban fabric results in strong microweather variability furthermore should methods of adapting airport data sets to interior urban spaces not be available or employable our findings indicate that the use of distributed networks of weather stations in urban areas as opposed to airport and other generally well exposed sites like nws cooperative observers http www nws noaa gov om coop recent obs htm or local networks like nycmetnet http nycmetnet ccny cuny edu may be more appropriate for evaluations in heterogeneous urban landscapes it would be of utmost importance however to identify weather stations similar and in close proximity to desired site conditions and carefully consider the quality and applicability of data sets obtained from alternative stations 5 2 objective ii determine the relative role of micrometeorological conditions in influencing ret rates our study underlines the importance of rh and u2 in influencing evapotranspiration as the magnitude of variation in rh and u2 though both weakly correlated to ret can impact the overall variability of ret between urban sites rsin and t were the strongest drivers in the determination of ret in our study sun et al 2013 take incoming solar radiation and surface temperature as the control parameters of the surface energy balance of which the latent heat flux evapotranspiration is one component we identified that even sites with no statistically significant differences in rsin and t could have statistically significant differences in ret due to the magnitude of variation in other determinants of ret specifically rh and u2 interestingly differences in parameters with strong correlation to ret did not always correspond to differences in ret bio c and gr c bio c and gr f gr c and gr f micrometeorological parameters that displayed the strongest correlation to ret on an annual basis namely rsin and t table 12 varied least amongst the sites and those with weak correlation rh and u2 varied the most though rh and u2 demonstrated the weakest correlation to ret with u2 showing the most variability the magnitude of the differences between some sites three 3 of ten 10 site to site comparisons that had differences in ret specifically bio c and air jfk bio c and air lg bio c and gr qbg was enough to account for statistically significant differences in ret data sets in these instances the average annual ratios of onsite wind speed at two meters in comparison to air lg were 0 67 and 1 08 0 67 and 1 00 and 0 67 and 0 25 respectively fig 5 the average annual ratios of onsite relative humidity in comparison to air lg were 1 15 and 1 09 1 15 and 1 00 and 1 15 and 1 22 respectively fig 5 further spearman s rho correlation coefficients shown in table 12 indicate a stronger correlation between rh and ret on a seasonal basis than t and ret which is stronger on an annual basis this may result from higher variation in rh on a seasonal basis compared to t donohue et al 2010 also highlight the importance of wind speed in determining the dynamics of penman potential evaporation analyzing data across australia between 1981 and 2006 donohue et al 2010 showed through an attribution analysis that air temperature wind speed measured at two meters height net radiation and vapor pressure respectively where the most important factors in influencing overall penman evaporation trends while air temperature had the strongest attribution and a positive trend negative trends in other variables particularly wind speed were of great enough magnitude to create overall negative trends in penman evaporation additionally a review of over 30 papers from various regions across the world evaluating the relative contributions of the four primary meteorological determinants of evapotranspiration found that wind speed is commonly in the top two most dominate variables influencing evaporative trends and that in most instances the evaporative demand due to stilling is larger than the evaporative increase due to warming mcvicar et al 2012 of particular interest from our study is the correlation between u2 and ret based on the relationship between u2 and ret it was expected that these two variables would be directly positively correlated at all sites however while at the airport locations the correlation was indeed direct and positive table 12 at the interior urban green spaces the wind speed sometimes had a negative correlation to ret table 21 this finding suggests that the interior urban green spaces are influenced by conditions that are not consistent with typical trends perhaps due to impacts of the surrounding and built environment for example the transport of air with higher relative humidity from surrounding vegetated areas to urban green spaces could adversely impact the evaporative capacity of the engineered urban green space kuang et al 2015a b concluded that the ability of urban green spaces to provide cooling benefits decreases with increased green space coverage wind direction and urban green space proximity to other wet surfaces may be important as vapor may be transported somewhat analogously to atmospheric rivers ralph and dettinger 2011 as augmentation of urban green spaces is being adopted in cities across the world as a means for climate change adaptation and mitigation further understanding of evapotranspiration will be required for effective planning using the local scale urban meteorological parameterization scheme lumps to model et middel et al 2012 concluded that under different climates land cover strategies will have variable impacts on surface energy balances seb 5 3 objective iii develop methods for adapting offsite micrometeorological data sets to different urban conditions the development of microclimate coefficients in our study advances the work of costello and jones 1994a b by providing quantitatively based values for microclimate coefficients further monthly coefficient values are defined and parameter specific microclimate coefficients proposed developed and validated applicability of the linear scaling approach used in our paper i e application of microclimate coefficients is evaluated for one year validation periods for each of the five sites and also by analyzing the variability in coefficients during different months for all interior urban spaces bio c gr c gr f and gr qbg the application of microclimate coefficients to reference site air lg data improved the prediction of observed local site data figs 7 11 for all parameters for example with application of microclimate coefficients the rmse of daily ret over the annual basis was reduced to 0 5 mm day or less for all sites and furthermore mbe also improved for all parameters further improvement in the prediction of local site ret may be possible if using adjusted microclimate coefficients to solve for ret though given the already very good performance this was not evaluated in our study while it is recognized that synoptic vs mesoscale conditions may impact the applicability of the linear scaling approach used in our paper e g a passing cloud on the local scale exerting a perturbation on incoming solar radiation gentine et al 2011 we do not distinguish between the impacts of synoptic vs mesoscale events as with the time scale analyzed in our study daily data over a roughly one year period the impacts do not seem relevant here our data are averaged over a day so perhaps these impacts would be more relevant at shorter time steps e g one 1 hr but over daily periods momentary perturbations seem generally masked in daily averages were the impacts of synoptic vs mesoscale conditions to be relevant on the daily time scale it would be expected that there would be notably more variability in daily coefficients during months when mesoscale conditions are more likely but this was not the case for nyc synoptic systems are more likely during the months of november through april and mesoscale events more likely from may through october bader 2017 however there appears to be no more variability in coefficient values by inspection of the 5th 95th percentile range in fig 5 during may oct than during nov april for ret r s in rh or u2 temperature has substantially more variability during the months of dec feb than other months however this is a result of temperature values being expressed in c with values near above and below zero possible thus small differences in temperature could result in large or even negative values of temperature microclimate coefficients it is suggested that future development of temperature based microclimate coefficients be based on absolute temperature scales e g kelvin or rankine to avoid such issues we do acknowledge areas for future work in the analysis of the applicability of the linear scaling approach at shorter time scales and also further evaluation of the linearity of wind speed which at high daily average wind speeds seems to deviate from the microclimate coefficient relationship we acknowledge the question of applicability of the microclimate coefficient approach to urban environments without in situ measurements in future work we propose pairing microclimate coefficients with local climate zones lczs such that a site could be classified by lcz and microclimate coefficients associated with that lcz applied to the site combined application of microclimate coefficients km parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p and lcz presents an opportunity for the systematic classification of city structure micrometeorological and evaporative zones and presents a clear application for the use of aerial and 3 d imagery burian et al 2006 as well as gis with a larger data set and number of sites than found in this study it would be possible to evaluate the applicability of standardized parameter specific microclimate coefficients on a regional basis e g for a particular city dependent on local climate zones lcz defined by stewart and oke 2012 though stewart and oke 2012 defined lcz for temperature and urban heat island studies based on local urban infrastructure and configuration it is possible that these zones present similarities applicable to other microclimate parameters as well which is supported by the results of our study both airport locations air jfk and air lg classified as lcz d low plants showed no statistical differences between ret r s in or t between sites and km k m p values close to one for all parameters range of averages 0 94 1 09 another challenge that exists and should be addressed in future work is the classification of lcz for building rooftops particularly considering green roof installations with representative data from lcz in cities coupled with the development of localized parameter specific microclimate coefficients or other methods vast advances would be made related to urban climate and urban water resource studies furthermore the proposed parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p provide flexibility in the application of different data sets e g downscaling of satellite et products transformation of et estimates determined using various methods from site to site urban heat island and climate change studies etc 6 conclusion the objectives of this paper are using novel urban weather station data sets from a heterogeneous urban environment new york city to i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions measured at the site scale and estimated ret rates ii determine the relative role of incoming solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed in influencing reference evapotranspiration ret rates at the site scale and iii develop methods for adapting offsite micrometeorological and et data sets to different urban conditions daily data sets of micrometeorological determinants of et specifically incoming solar radiation rsin air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed adjusted to two meters height u2 as well as ret rates were compared over a one year period collected from six sites located throughout new york city the six monitoring sites include urban green spaces and airport sites micrometeorological data sets acquired for analyses from the six monitoring sites were used as inputs for estimation of daily ret rates by the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation allen et al 2005 for short grass reference surfaces cumulative ret was evaluated over the period of analysis statistical tests including non parametric kruskal wallis test and spearman s rho correlation coefficients were utilized for comparative and correlative analyses non parametric kruskal wallis analyses were used for statistical comparison of data sets of micrometeorological determinants of et and ret rates across sites non parametric spearman s rho correlation coefficients were evaluated between data sets of micrometeorological parameters and ret rates to assess the relative role of each in influencing ret rates at the sites the development of parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p for the adjustment of offsite data sets to local conditions for individual micrometeorological parameters was demonstrated furthermore the pairing of k m p with local climate zones defined by stewart and oke 2012 is proposed our findings suggest that micrometeorological variability across heterogeneous spaces particularly urban environments is substantial and needs to be considered in evaluating et rates particularly in urban water and energy modeling oke 1973 eching and snyder 2005 middel et al 2012 micrometeorological variation across cities is an important factor in consideration of urban evapotranspiration and latent heat fluxes for example in evaluating ecosystem good and services offered by urban green spaces wadzuk et al 2013 changes in land use over time järvi et al 2011 climate change mitigation adaption strategies masson et al 2014 groot et al 2015 and the impact of climate change on engineered urban green space vegetation maria raquel et al 2016 the findings presented in this paper based on data sets collected at six monitored locations across new york city include over a 327 day non consecutive period cumulative ret was up to 40 percent greater in comparison between sites micrometeorological conditions rsin t rh and u2 and daily ret rates were statistically significantly different across sites when all sites were compared together all site wind speed at two meters were statistically significantly different from other sites based on site by site comparisons differences in micrometeorological data sets between sites resulted in statistically significant differences in ret rates between the majority but not all sites based on site by site comparisons rsin and t have the strongest correlation to ret on average 0 93 and 0 74 respectively and varied least across sites 7 of 15 site to site comparisons and 5 of 15 site to site comparisons showed statistically significant differences while rh and u2 had the weakest correlation to ret on average 0 30 and 0 07 respectively and showed the greatest variation amongst sites 10 of 15 and 15 of 15 site to site comparisons showed statistically significant differences respectively microclimate coefficients km and parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p were proposed developed and validated from daily data sets use of these coefficients at shorter time scale should be considered cautiously as e g a passing cloud could greatly impact site conditions and the exploration of non linear scaling techniques should be considered for future work building on the recommendations of others costello and jones 1994a b eching and snyder 2005 new parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p ranging from an average of 0 25 1 22 for the studied sites over the study period were developed for the adjustment of offsite data sets to local conditions there is clear potential for the pairing of these parameter specific microclimate coefficients with local climate zones lcz defined by stewart and oke 2012 we acknowledge that such paired coefficients could be an interim for representing variability across urban environments and adapting data from e g local airports to urban sites without meteorological measurements and would require a large data set over a range of climatic conditions to develop evaluation of long term data sets of urban micrometeorological conditions and urban et with representation from more sites and site types would lend further insights as is highlighted in the publication by vicente serrano et al 2014 data collection from the new urban green space monitoring sites in our study are ongoing 7 future work our paper focused on the relationship between micrometeorological conditions and ret in a heterogeneous urban environment and supports that micrometeorological variation across heterogeneous urban environments is an important factor in evaluating urban et rates a growing body of work kotthaus and grimmond 2014 vicente serrano et al 2014 jacobs et al 2015 van hove et al 2015 focuses attention on the variability of micrometeorological conditions across urban areas and recommends further research in this area consideration should also be given to the influence of non micrometeorological determinants e g vegetation type media soil type moisture conditions and anthropogenic heat fluxes oke 1982 on urban et rates as seen in the

7218,variability in micrometeorological conditions and their influence on estimated reference evapotranspiration ret rates were evaluated across a heterogeneous urban environment micrometeorological data sets incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed were collected over a one year period at six weather stations in new york city ny usa weather stations are located at four new urban green space monitoring sites and two airports reference evapotranspiration ret rates were estimated from the micrometeorological data sets for a short reference surface at a daily time step using the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation a penman monteith based combination equation non parametric comparative statistical analyses kruskal wallis revealed statistically significant differences at significance level α 0 05 in micrometeorological conditions and estimated ret rates between the six sites on a cumulative annual basis estimated ret varied by up to 40 percent between the sites a new technique for adjusting weather data collected at one location e g regional airports for use at another location e g interior engineered urban green spaces was evaluated the study highlights the importance for accurate estimation of et of onsite micrometeorological data sets but concludes that additional research is needed to more thoroughly characterize micrometeorological variability across heterogeneous urban environments and also to evaluate the influence of non meteorological determinants e g vegetation type soil media type media moisture conditions and anthropogenic heat fluxes on urban et keywords micrometeorology evapotranspiration urban environment spatial variability ecohydrology urban microclimate 1 introduction 1 1 background micrometeorological conditions are known to vary due in part to land surface heterogeneity across urban environments oke 1988 quantification of this variability is important to better manage urban microclimatic conditions e g by developing approaches for mitigating urban heat islands or adapting to other forms of forecasted climate change and to improve the accuracy of urban hydrologic and energy flux models themselves used to forecast the effect that different actions e g afforestation projects could have on urban water and energy budgets hydrologic and energy balances are intimately linked through the evaporative or latent heat flux term while other factors including vegetation type and media moisture conditions can impact actual rates of evapotranspiration et the influence of micrometeorological conditions alone on et can be substantial for example urban tree transpiration rate studies conducted in beijing china over a two year consecutive monitoring period found that 80 of the daily variation in tree transpiration rates could be explained by atmospheric and climatic conditions wang et al 2012 al kofahi et al 2012 showed that reference evapotranspiration ret in albuquerque nm varied by zip code and was based in part on temperature differences between locations because of its influence on et the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions in urban environments also carries important implications for the planning design and management of urban landscapes for example differences in urban et imply different urban landscape irrigation needs feldhake et al 1983 nouri et al 2013 with a direct link to urban water resource management and water conservation planning differences in urban et also imply potential differences in the ecosystem services e g stormwater management microclimate regulation and carbon sequestration that can be extracted from urban landscapes jim and chen 2009 pwd 2009 nycdep 2010 metselaar 2012 suggested that understanding spatial variability in urban et rates can improve urban design by helping to match vegetation and substrate types to the hydrologic requirements dictated by local micrometeorological conditions lemonsu et al 2012 assert that to assess the benefits associated with et the role of micrometeorological variability and urban et needs better representation in urban et modeling table 1 summarizes all of existing studies known to the authors that attempt to measure or model the variation of meteorological conditions and or evapotranspiration latent heat fluxes across heterogeneous urban environments because spatial differences in micrometeorological conditions are poorly characterized in the urban environment accurate estimation of actual et fluxes is difficult the energy balance based lumps model grimmond and oke 2002 was used to simulate temperature changes under different greening scenarios and water usage rates in phoenix az usa as noted by the author a limitation of the study was that the lumps model used micrometeorological data from a single weather station and did not account for neighborhood level variations gober et al 2010 the same limitation was noted by middel et al 2012 in their attempts to parameterize lumps for surface energy balance seb studies in phoenix az usa and portland or usa digiovanni et al 2013 found that et estimates from regional weather stations did not perform as well as estimates from onsite micrometeorological data in comparison to actual et rates measured from a green roof in new york city ny usa though some urban energy water balance models include methods to account for site scale variability in micrometeorological conditions validation of these approaches is currently limited by the availability of observed data for example improvements to the town energy balance teb model lemonsu et al 2007 2012 now allow for the influence of urban green areas and differences in local microclimatic conditions to be modeled explicitly without actual urban data sets the model s performance cannot be evaluated similarly the weather research and forecasting model wrf urban model coupled with eulag cfd urban now enables downscaling for microscale 1 10 m site specific simulations chen et al 2011 but one of the challenges for executing the wrf urban modeling system is the specification of a potentially vast number of parameters which are rarely available chen et al 2011 using a reduced number of inputs in comparison to grimmond and oke 1991 the surface urban energy balance scheme suews järvi et al 2011 calculates urban energy and water balances at the neighborhood scale even so critical site specific micrometeorological inputs are difficult to parameterize with limited existing data sets other approaches for accounting for spatial variability in the urban microclimate were developed including recent advances but these too require more urban micrometeorological observations microclimate coefficients km were suggested to adapt estimates of ret computed from penman monteith based combination equations using offsite weather station data e g from airports to local conditions costello and jones 1994a b eching and snyder 2005 however eching and snyder 2005 noted that scientifically based information on these parameters microclimate etcetera is limited bean and pitt 2012 inventoried the locations of remote automated weather stations raws nationwide us revealing that readily available micrometeorological data and et estimates are lacking in urban areas particularly in the eastern usa at the site scale stewart and oke 2012 presented local climate zones lcz as a means for classifying sites based on site characteristics for temperature studies the lcz classification system can be used to build spatial databases of urban form and cover for cities worldwide once developed the lcz system can function easily and inexpensively for any city or region however the lcz classification system cannot be fully elaborated without actual urban microclimatic data because extensive networks of weather stations are not currently found in urban environments the independent variables driving et models are often by necessity obtained from regional climate stations typically located at airports and in other open spaces due to modifications of urban wind speed and direction as well as incoming solar radiation by the presence of buildings and other above ground structures oke 1982 1988 actual conditions at urban leaf and soil surfaces can differ significantly from those observed at regional weather station sites urban air temperatures in turn are tempered by the presence of low albedo impervious surfaces grimmond and oke 1999 takebayashi and moriyama 2007 shashua bar et al 2009 which may also contribute to differences between values measured at offsite weather stations and at the site level note that throughout this manuscript we use micrometeorological to refer to our site scale meteorological measurements based on scale and characteristic time definitions though our measurements are aggregated to daily values the definition of microscale in terms of horizontal scale and characteristic time as presented in orlanski 1975 are 2 km and 1 hr roughly most of the monitored sites fall into the micro γ scale at 20 m and observations made at hourly or shorter 5 min intervals 1 2 objectives using new york city usa as a case study the objectives of this paper are to i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions measured at the site scale and estimated ret rates ii determine the relative role of incoming solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed in influencing reference evapotranspiration ret rates at the site scale and iii develop methods for adapting offsite e g airport micrometeorological and et data sets to different urban conditions e g interior engineered urban green spaces to address the first objective micrometeorological data gathered at six different nyc weather station sites are used to estimate and statistically compare ret values across new york city the micrometeorological data included incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for short reference surfaces was used to calculate daily ret rates ret estimates are presented specifically to demonstrate the potential influence that micrometeorological variability and not other factors could have on urban et and thus no correction coefficients to the ret estimates are presented here the sensitivity of ret estimates to vegetation dependent parameters are however evaluated in this paper and presented in the supplementary materials the second objective is addressed to determine the relative role of each micrometeorological parameter in influencing ret rates by statistical analyses using correlation coefficients to address the third objective site specific microclimate coefficients are applied to ret estimates and new parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p are developed and evaluated 2 study sites micrometeorological data sets including incoming solar radiation rsin air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed uz were acquired from six sites located in nyc the locations physical characteristics and local climate zone lcz classification of the monitoring sites are presented in table 2 and their locations mapped in fig 1 the sites include one bioinfiltration area three green roofs and two airport locations the monitoring setups at the green roof sites and bioinfiltration area were installed by drexel university and columbia university as part of ongoing studies the monitoring setups at the two airport locations are maintained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national weather service nws and the publicly available data sets were obtained from the northeast regional climate center nrcc monitoring equipment installed at the sites is listed in table 3 images of the weather stations are shown in fig 2 data presented here was collected between 1 aug 2010 and 31 july 2013 3 methods 3 1 objective i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions and estimated ret rates 3 1 1 reference evapotranspiration the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation for short reference surfaces allen et al 2005 as shown in eq 1 was utilized for the estimation of daily reference evapotranspiration ret rates 1 et os 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t

incoming solar radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed measured at five minute or hourly intervals were averaged between 00 00 and 23 59 to compute daily values per standard procedures outlined in the asce standardized reference equation allen et al 2005 for input into eq 1 as wind measurements at the monitored sites were taken above two meters height and above surfaces other than clipped grass the full logarithmic equation as presented in appendix b of the asce ewri standardized reference evapotranspiration equation was applied to adjust wind speed to two meters height allen et al 2005 terms not monitored at all sites e g soil heat flux were estimated using procedures laid out for the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation allen et al 2005 specifically soil heat flux was assumed to be zero over the daily time period since ret estimates are presented specifically to demonstrate the potential influence that micrometeorological variability and not other factors could have on urban et estimates standard methods are followed for all sites though the limitations of this application are acknowledged the sensitivity of ret to vegetation dependent parameters cn and cd are evaluated in this paper and presented in the supplementary materials according to the guidelines set by the allen et al 2005 task committee reference evapotranspiration is defined as the et rate from a uniform surface of dense actively growing vegetation having specified height and surface resistance not short of soil water and representing an expanse of at least 100 m of the same or similar vegetation such conditions often do not exist in urban environments including in the areas surrounding urban weather stations further according to allen et al 2005 many urban weather stations fail both the underlying surface requirement and the recommended separation distance from obstacles weather stations should be located in sites that closely approximate the reference conditions application of penman monteith based combination equations to estimate et from heterogeneous urban environments is thus challenging some researchers have used crop coefficients doorenbos and pruitt 1977 and non growing season coefficients allen et al 1998 to adjust ret estimates obtained from the asce equations to closer approximate actual et rates however allen et al 2005 does not recommend a methodology for the application of reference evapotranspiration during non growing seasons allen et al 2005 moreover because the goal of this study from micrometeorological variability alone no correction coefficients to the ret estimates are presented here further evaluation of the applicability of the asce reference evapotranspiration equation to urban green spaces is warranted though is considered beyond the scope of this study ret rates were calculated using matlab v 2012a and 2017b mathworks 2012 with a custom coded program developed by the authors and validated by hand calculation and through comparison to results obtained by ref et software v 3 1 08 allen 2012 per the developer s recommendation ref et software was used only as a validation program and not as the primary means for computing ret 3 1 2 statistics for statistical comparison of micrometeorological and ret data across sites non parametric statistical tests of daily data sets were employed since the data sets were not normally distributed especially u2 and ret the non parametric kruskal wallis test was used to compare rsin t rh and u2 and ret across the sites specifically the kruskal wallis test was used to test the hypotheses listed in table 4 each hypothesis was tested across all sites e g the distribution of reference evapotranspiration ret is the same across sites bio c gr c gr f air jfk air lg and gr qbg and across all pairs of sites e g the distribution of reference evapotranspiration ret is the same across sites bio c and gr f kruskal wallis tests were evaluated using ibm spss statistics software v 20 0 0 ibm corporation 2011 statistical analyses were performed on a sub set of the data collected for a total of 327 days between 26 jul 2011 and 5 aug 2012 for which data was simultaneously available from all of the six monitoring sites 3 2 objective ii determine the relative role of micrometeorological conditions in influencing ret rates the relationship between individual micrometeorological parameters rsin t rh and u2 and ret were evaluated using spearman s rank correlation coefficients spearman s rho coefficients were determined to rank the relative importance of the influence that each of the various micrometeorological determinants had on estimated ret correlation coefficients between 1 0 and 0 8 are considered strong those between 0 8 and 0 5 moderate and those less than 0 5 are considered weak devore 2004 spearman s rho correlation coefficients were evaluated using ibm spss statistics software v 20 0 0 ibm corporation 2011 spearman s rho correlation coefficients were developed based on data collected between 26 jul 2011 and 5 aug 2012 for which data was simultaneously available from all of the six monitoring sites 3 3 objective iii develop methods for adapting offsite micrometeorological data sets to different urban conditions 3 3 1 development of km and k m p microclimate coefficients km and new parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p were developed from data collected at all sites bio c gr c gr f air jfk air lg and gr qbg between 26 jul 2011 and 5 aug 2012 the use of a single microclimate coefficient to adjust ret estimated by penman monteith based methods for local microclimate differences was proposed by others costello and jones 1994a b eching and snyder 2005 and applied here as shown in eq 2 2 et m k m et o where etm is the reference evapotranspiration at the local site km is the microclimate coefficient eto is the reference evapotranspiration at the reference site e g airport here parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p are proposed to account for differences in local weather conditions given the relationship in eq 3 3 p j k m p j k p k where p is the parameter of interest in this case rsin t rh u2 or ret j is the site to which the data set is being adjusted to i e the local condition in this case j is bio c gr c gr f air jfk or gr qbg k m p j k is the parameter specific microclimate coefficient for parameter p for site j in relation to site k k is the site from which the data set is being adjusted from i e the offsite measurement in this case air lg we developed monthly microclimate coefficients for ret parameter specific microclimate coefficients for rsin t rh and u2 using eq 4 below an airport site air lg was selected as the reference site because operated and maintained weather stations providing publicly available data sets are often located at airports 4 k m p j k i 1 n x p j i x p k i n x p j i is the i th value of parameter p

k i must be equivalent n is the number of values of x in this case the number of days in a given month 3 3 2 validation to evaluate the performance of developed microclimate coefficients two validation periods were used comparing predicted vs observed onsite micrometeorological conditions and ret to determine predicted onsite conditions the monthly parameter specific microclimate coefficients developed from data collected 26 jul 2011 through 5 aug 2012 were applied to air lg data sets for separate validation periods for bio c and gr f the validation period was 1 aug 2012 through 31 july 2013 the year following the microclimate coefficient development period based on data availability the validation period for gr c air jfk and gr qbg was 1 aug 2010 through 31 july 2011 the year prior to the microclimate coefficient development period though data collection is ongoing at the sites the validation period was limited to one year to reduce potential temporal impacts

maximum of 9 5 discussion 5 1 objective i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions and estimated ret rates our findings suggest that spatial variability in micrometeorological conditions specifically r s in t rh and u2 across heterogeneous urban environments is significant and that the variability in micrometeorological conditions impacts spatial variability in site scale reference evapotranspiration al kofahi et al 2012 also showed that ret varied across an urban area specifically albuquerque nm usa here we explore the relationship between ret r s in t rh and u2 for nyc ny usa highlighting the complex relationship between meteorological variability and variability in ret notably for the two thirds of site to site comparisons that showed statistically significant differences in ret the micrometeorological parameters differed significantly with respect to various sets of parameters e g rh and u2 t and u2 rsin t rh and u2 etc wind speed showed the greatest variability across sites with statistically significant differences between all site to site comparisons we highlight here that with average ratios of two meter wind speed between bio c gr c gr f gr qbg and air lg ranging from 0 25 to 0 67 and air jfk to air lg of 1 08 table 12 wind speed at all interior urban green spaces bio c gr c gr f and gr qbg was considerably lower than at the airport sites air jfk and air lg this observation is consistent with findings reported in an analysis of 652 stations across the monsoon regions of china which found that urban stations generally observed lower wind speeds than rural stations guo et al 2011 these findings are also consistent with studies which identified decreasing wind speed trends with urbanization in madrid valencia and alicante spain azorin molina et al 2014 and beijing china li et al 2011 lower wind speeds in urban areas are largely expected based on urban frictional effects oke 1988 mcvicar et al 2007 yet common practice dictates the use of regional weather stations commonly located in open areas at airports to represent interior urban spaces the variability of meteorological data sets across sites and particularly between airport and interior urban spaces emphasizes the need for methods to adequately represent actual urban site meteorological conditions especially for sites without in situ measurements and particularly in evaluating et the use of regional weather stations typically located at airports for the estimation of urban site scale reference evapotranspiration could introduce substantial errors due to micrometeorological variability over the 327 day period we analyzed cumulative ret fig 4 was 40 2 greater at air lg reference airport site than at gr qbg suggesting that among nyc sites errors on the magnitude of 40 in cumulative annual ret estimates could be introduced by not considering the local microclimate of individual sites this finding is significant considering the common practice of using data sets from regional climate stations usually airports to estimate et in a variety of water resource studies jacobs et al 2015 also highlighted from their evaluation of micrometeorological and evapotranspiration observations in dutch cities that estimation of urban evaporation from routine weather data using the concept of reference evaporation would be a particularly challenging task as the urban fabric results in strong microweather variability furthermore should methods of adapting airport data sets to interior urban spaces not be available or employable our findings indicate that the use of distributed networks of weather stations in urban areas as opposed to airport and other generally well exposed sites like nws cooperative observers http www nws noaa gov om coop recent obs htm or local networks like nycmetnet http nycmetnet ccny cuny edu may be more appropriate for evaluations in heterogeneous urban landscapes it would be of utmost importance however to identify weather stations similar and in close proximity to desired site conditions and carefully consider the quality and applicability of data sets obtained from alternative stations 5 2 objective ii determine the relative role of micrometeorological conditions in influencing ret rates our study underlines the importance of rh and u2 in influencing evapotranspiration as the magnitude of variation in rh and u2 though both weakly correlated to ret can impact the overall variability of ret between urban sites rsin and t were the strongest drivers in the determination of ret in our study sun et al 2013 take incoming solar radiation and surface temperature as the control parameters of the surface energy balance of which the latent heat flux evapotranspiration is one component we identified that even sites with no statistically significant differences in rsin and t could have statistically significant differences in ret due to the magnitude of variation in other determinants of ret specifically rh and u2 interestingly differences in parameters with strong correlation to ret did not always correspond to differences in ret bio c and gr c bio c and gr f gr c and gr f micrometeorological parameters that displayed the strongest correlation to ret on an annual basis namely rsin and t table 12 varied least amongst the sites and those with weak correlation rh and u2 varied the most though rh and u2 demonstrated the weakest correlation to ret with u2 showing the most variability the magnitude of the differences between some sites three 3 of ten 10 site to site comparisons that had differences in ret specifically bio c and air jfk bio c and air lg bio c and gr qbg was enough to account for statistically significant differences in ret data sets in these instances the average annual ratios of onsite wind speed at two meters in comparison to air lg were 0 67 and 1 08 0 67 and 1 00 and 0 67 and 0 25 respectively fig 5 the average annual ratios of onsite relative humidity in comparison to air lg were 1 15 and 1 09 1 15 and 1 00 and 1 15 and 1 22 respectively fig 5 further spearman s rho correlation coefficients shown in table 12 indicate a stronger correlation between rh and ret on a seasonal basis than t and ret which is stronger on an annual basis this may result from higher variation in rh on a seasonal basis compared to t donohue et al 2010 also highlight the importance of wind speed in determining the dynamics of penman potential evaporation analyzing data across australia between 1981 and 2006 donohue et al 2010 showed through an attribution analysis that air temperature wind speed measured at two meters height net radiation and vapor pressure respectively where the most important factors in influencing overall penman evaporation trends while air temperature had the strongest attribution and a positive trend negative trends in other variables particularly wind speed were of great enough magnitude to create overall negative trends in penman evaporation additionally a review of over 30 papers from various regions across the world evaluating the relative contributions of the four primary meteorological determinants of evapotranspiration found that wind speed is commonly in the top two most dominate variables influencing evaporative trends and that in most instances the evaporative demand due to stilling is larger than the evaporative increase due to warming mcvicar et al 2012 of particular interest from our study is the correlation between u2 and ret based on the relationship between u2 and ret it was expected that these two variables would be directly positively correlated at all sites however while at the airport locations the correlation was indeed direct and positive table 12 at the interior urban green spaces the wind speed sometimes had a negative correlation to ret table 21 this finding suggests that the interior urban green spaces are influenced by conditions that are not consistent with typical trends perhaps due to impacts of the surrounding and built environment for example the transport of air with higher relative humidity from surrounding vegetated areas to urban green spaces could adversely impact the evaporative capacity of the engineered urban green space kuang et al 2015a b concluded that the ability of urban green spaces to provide cooling benefits decreases with increased green space coverage wind direction and urban green space proximity to other wet surfaces may be important as vapor may be transported somewhat analogously to atmospheric rivers ralph and dettinger 2011 as augmentation of urban green spaces is being adopted in cities across the world as a means for climate change adaptation and mitigation further understanding of evapotranspiration will be required for effective planning using the local scale urban meteorological parameterization scheme lumps to model et middel et al 2012 concluded that under different climates land cover strategies will have variable impacts on surface energy balances seb 5 3 objective iii develop methods for adapting offsite micrometeorological data sets to different urban conditions the development of microclimate coefficients in our study advances the work of costello and jones 1994a b by providing quantitatively based values for microclimate coefficients further monthly coefficient values are defined and parameter specific microclimate coefficients proposed developed and validated applicability of the linear scaling approach used in our paper i e application of microclimate coefficients is evaluated for one year validation periods for each of the five sites and also by analyzing the variability in coefficients during different months for all interior urban spaces bio c gr c gr f and gr qbg the application of microclimate coefficients to reference site air lg data improved the prediction of observed local site data figs 7 11 for all parameters for example with application of microclimate coefficients the rmse of daily ret over the annual basis was reduced to 0 5 mm day or less for all sites and furthermore mbe also improved for all parameters further improvement in the prediction of local site ret may be possible if using adjusted microclimate coefficients to solve for ret though given the already very good performance this was not evaluated in our study while it is recognized that synoptic vs mesoscale conditions may impact the applicability of the linear scaling approach used in our paper e g a passing cloud on the local scale exerting a perturbation on incoming solar radiation gentine et al 2011 we do not distinguish between the impacts of synoptic vs mesoscale events as with the time scale analyzed in our study daily data over a roughly one year period the impacts do not seem relevant here our data are averaged over a day so perhaps these impacts would be more relevant at shorter time steps e g one 1 hr but over daily periods momentary perturbations seem generally masked in daily averages were the impacts of synoptic vs mesoscale conditions to be relevant on the daily time scale it would be expected that there would be notably more variability in daily coefficients during months when mesoscale conditions are more likely but this was not the case for nyc synoptic systems are more likely during the months of november through april and mesoscale events more likely from may through october bader 2017 however there appears to be no more variability in coefficient values by inspection of the 5th 95th percentile range in fig 5 during may oct than during nov april for ret r s in rh or u2 temperature has substantially more variability during the months of dec feb than other months however this is a result of temperature values being expressed in c with values near above and below zero possible thus small differences in temperature could result in large or even negative values of temperature microclimate coefficients it is suggested that future development of temperature based microclimate coefficients be based on absolute temperature scales e g kelvin or rankine to avoid such issues we do acknowledge areas for future work in the analysis of the applicability of the linear scaling approach at shorter time scales and also further evaluation of the linearity of wind speed which at high daily average wind speeds seems to deviate from the microclimate coefficient relationship we acknowledge the question of applicability of the microclimate coefficient approach to urban environments without in situ measurements in future work we propose pairing microclimate coefficients with local climate zones lczs such that a site could be classified by lcz and microclimate coefficients associated with that lcz applied to the site combined application of microclimate coefficients km parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p and lcz presents an opportunity for the systematic classification of city structure micrometeorological and evaporative zones and presents a clear application for the use of aerial and 3 d imagery burian et al 2006 as well as gis with a larger data set and number of sites than found in this study it would be possible to evaluate the applicability of standardized parameter specific microclimate coefficients on a regional basis e g for a particular city dependent on local climate zones lcz defined by stewart and oke 2012 though stewart and oke 2012 defined lcz for temperature and urban heat island studies based on local urban infrastructure and configuration it is possible that these zones present similarities applicable to other microclimate parameters as well which is supported by the results of our study both airport locations air jfk and air lg classified as lcz d low plants showed no statistical differences between ret r s in or t between sites and km k m p values close to one for all parameters range of averages 0 94 1 09 another challenge that exists and should be addressed in future work is the classification of lcz for building rooftops particularly considering green roof installations with representative data from lcz in cities coupled with the development of localized parameter specific microclimate coefficients or other methods vast advances would be made related to urban climate and urban water resource studies furthermore the proposed parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p provide flexibility in the application of different data sets e g downscaling of satellite et products transformation of et estimates determined using various methods from site to site urban heat island and climate change studies etc 6 conclusion the objectives of this paper are using novel urban weather station data sets from a heterogeneous urban environment new york city to i evaluate the spatial variability of micrometeorological conditions measured at the site scale and estimated ret rates ii determine the relative role of incoming solar radiation temperature relative humidity and wind speed in influencing reference evapotranspiration ret rates at the site scale and iii develop methods for adapting offsite micrometeorological and et data sets to different urban conditions daily data sets of micrometeorological determinants of et specifically incoming solar radiation rsin air temperature t relative humidity rh and wind speed adjusted to two meters height u2 as well as ret rates were compared over a one year period collected from six sites located throughout new york city the six monitoring sites include urban green spaces and airport sites micrometeorological data sets acquired for analyses from the six monitoring sites were used as inputs for estimation of daily ret rates by the asce standardized reference evapotranspiration equation allen et al 2005 for short grass reference surfaces cumulative ret was evaluated over the period of analysis statistical tests including non parametric kruskal wallis test and spearman s rho correlation coefficients were utilized for comparative and correlative analyses non parametric kruskal wallis analyses were used for statistical comparison of data sets of micrometeorological determinants of et and ret rates across sites non parametric spearman s rho correlation coefficients were evaluated between data sets of micrometeorological parameters and ret rates to assess the relative role of each in influencing ret rates at the sites the development of parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p for the adjustment of offsite data sets to local conditions for individual micrometeorological parameters was demonstrated furthermore the pairing of k m p with local climate zones defined by stewart and oke 2012 is proposed our findings suggest that micrometeorological variability across heterogeneous spaces particularly urban environments is substantial and needs to be considered in evaluating et rates particularly in urban water and energy modeling oke 1973 eching and snyder 2005 middel et al 2012 micrometeorological variation across cities is an important factor in consideration of urban evapotranspiration and latent heat fluxes for example in evaluating ecosystem good and services offered by urban green spaces wadzuk et al 2013 changes in land use over time järvi et al 2011 climate change mitigation adaption strategies masson et al 2014 groot et al 2015 and the impact of climate change on engineered urban green space vegetation maria raquel et al 2016 the findings presented in this paper based on data sets collected at six monitored locations across new york city include over a 327 day non consecutive period cumulative ret was up to 40 percent greater in comparison between sites micrometeorological conditions rsin t rh and u2 and daily ret rates were statistically significantly different across sites when all sites were compared together all site wind speed at two meters were statistically significantly different from other sites based on site by site comparisons differences in micrometeorological data sets between sites resulted in statistically significant differences in ret rates between the majority but not all sites based on site by site comparisons rsin and t have the strongest correlation to ret on average 0 93 and 0 74 respectively and varied least across sites 7 of 15 site to site comparisons and 5 of 15 site to site comparisons showed statistically significant differences while rh and u2 had the weakest correlation to ret on average 0 30 and 0 07 respectively and showed the greatest variation amongst sites 10 of 15 and 15 of 15 site to site comparisons showed statistically significant differences respectively microclimate coefficients km and parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p were proposed developed and validated from daily data sets use of these coefficients at shorter time scale should be considered cautiously as e g a passing cloud could greatly impact site conditions and the exploration of non linear scaling techniques should be considered for future work building on the recommendations of others costello and jones 1994a b eching and snyder 2005 new parameter specific microclimate coefficients k m p ranging from an average of 0 25 1 22 for the studied sites over the study period were developed for the adjustment of offsite data sets to local conditions there is clear potential for the pairing of these parameter specific microclimate coefficients with local climate zones lcz defined by stewart and oke 2012 we acknowledge that such paired coefficients could be an interim for representing variability across urban environments and adapting data from e g local airports to urban sites without meteorological measurements and would require a large data set over a range of climatic conditions to develop evaluation of long term data sets of urban micrometeorological conditions and urban et with representation from more sites and site types would lend further insights as is highlighted in the publication by vicente serrano et al 2014 data collection from the new urban green space monitoring sites in our study are ongoing 7 future work our paper focused on the relationship between micrometeorological conditions and ret in a heterogeneous urban environment and supports that micrometeorological variation across heterogeneous urban environments is an important factor in evaluating urban et rates a growing body of work kotthaus and grimmond 2014 vicente serrano et al 2014 jacobs et al 2015 van hove et al 2015 focuses attention on the variability of micrometeorological conditions across urban areas and recommends further research in this area consideration should also be given to the influence of non micrometeorological determinants e g vegetation type media soil type moisture conditions and anthropogenic heat fluxes oke 1982 on urban et rates as seen in the

7219,as an extension of our recent study li et al taylor dispersion in wind driven current journal of hydrology 555 697 707 an analytical study based on spatial concentration moments is performed on contaminant transport in a gravity induced open channel flow under wind effect the zeroth to the fourth order spatial concentration moments are derived to describe the temporal evolution of spatial concentration distribution fitted by the fourth order hermite polynomials in initial stage convection dominates the contaminant transport leading to a large non uniformity of vertical concentration as time passes the contaminant transport gradually evolves to an asymptotic pattern following a diffusion like model of taylor dispersion the combined influence of gravity and wind effect on contaminant transport is investigated the tailwind effect will accelerate the development of taylor dispersion as well as the transport of contaminant while the conveyance capacity is weakened in a headwind circumstance keywords taylor dispersion open channel flow spatial concentration distribution method of concentration moments 1 introduction existing in most natural rivers and artificial streams open channel flows can drive a significant exchange of mass and momentum huang et al 2016 komori et al 1993 maxama and webber 2010 smith 1980 wang and chen 2016a zhang et al 2018 and are of vital importance in water management contaminant control ecological risk assessment and environmental preservation carvalho et al 2009 fried 1975 wang and chen 2017a wu et al 2011 zeng et al 2012 transport of contaminants in channel flows has attracted much attention as a result of its implications on water quality in addition contaminants transport cannot be accurately modeled with a fickian type diffusion approach habel et al 2002 numerous studies have investigated the distributions of velocity and contaminants transport in open channel flows fischer 1973 ng and yip 2001 sumer 1974 fischer et al 1979 described the variation of the concentration across the depth of an open channel and showed that the deviation of the concentration is largest near the channel bed a large eddy simulation study has been conducted to investigate the turbulent structure of an open channel flow relevant results were found to be responsible for the significant lateral exchange of mass and momentum in channel flows xie et al 2013 experiments have been intensively performed by huai et al 2017 to study the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in ecological channels the behavior of contaminant transport in open channel flows can be governed by gravity wind or their combined effect water flows in streams rivers and other channels are typical gravity induced flows due to height difference in aquatic environment a gravity induced flow plays an important role to transport nutrient and chemical substances ho and lin 2015 and extensive discussions of these issues could be found in gregorio et al 2011 mriaux and kurz besson 2012 simpson 1982 meanwhile the wind stress can be another dominant driving factor for the flows and circulations li et al 2017 wind blowing over the surface of water bodies can drive flows and bio hydrodynamic interactions especially in shallow water areas the surface wind stress and bottom friction tend to dominate hydrostatic pressure gradients and therefore the current is downwind in this region schoen et al 2014 de marchis et al 2014 presented a three dimensional numerical simulations on wind and tide induced currents and compared the numerical results with field measurements a recent study compared the relative importance of the wind driven currents and tidal circulations in malacca strait by numerical simulations it highlighted that the wind stress largely ignored in previous studies is an important driver of the circulation in this region even under strong tidal forcing chen et al 2014 however these researches have not taken the combined circumstance of gravity and wind effect into account in this paper we pay attention to the contaminant transport in a gravity induced open channel flow under wind effect and aim to explore the transport process by an analytical method of taylor dispersion taylor dispersion describes a process in which solute spreads longitudinally under the combined action of lateral solute diffusion and longitudinal velocity non uniformity taylor 1953 taylor pointed out that by the process of molecular diffusion across a shear flow the apparent diffusion coefficient is much larger than the ordinary molecular diffusivity wang et al 2017 since the gap is so remarkable the dispersion mechanism is of great interest as illustrated by extensive studies by experiments theoretical analyses and numerical simulations beard 2001 chen and wu 2012 li et al 2015 vandre et al 2008 wang et al 2015 a most remarkable contribution was made by aris 1956 who originally developed a fruitful approach of the concentration moments barton 1983 aimed to resolve technical difficulties that occur when solving aris s moment equations by separation of variables by the theory of taylor dispersion zeng et al 2011 deduced a solution for the typical case of a pulsed contaminant emission into a steady flow through a shallow channel based on the method of concentration moment wu et al 2011 and luo et al 2016 focused on the characteristic of contaminant transport process in wetlands of a multi layer structure the effect of wind on environmental dispersion was investigated by zeng et al 2012 and luo et al 2017 for a two layer wetland a concrete solution was derived and illustrated for the evolution of cross sectional mean concentration although plenty of solutions to the cross sectional mean concentration have been presented based on taylor s classical analysis an issue of crucial importance remained to be answered for the subsequent researchers to explore the distribution of spatial concentration especially when the real transport process cannot be regarded as one dimensional diffusion like problem by the mean concentration a recent study wu and chen 2014b revealed that the rate of approach to transverse uniformity can be much slower than that to longitudinal normality yasuda 1984 introduced spatially distributed concentration moments in a tidal flow this approach is an inspirational method but the potential of the method to pursue the spatial concentration distribution was not realized in yasuda s work by extending the method of spatial concentration moments wang and chen 2017b explored the spatial concentration distribution in a wetland flow with bulk degradation actually the spatial concentration distribution appears to be a much more practical concern for a wide range of applications such as the contaminant transport with absorption reaction induced by biophysical or biochemical processes jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 wang and chen 2017a meanwhile the spatial concentration distribution is also essential for revealing the initial behavior of dispersion process in this paper we focus on the contaminant transport in an open channel flow in a combined circumstance of gravity and wind effect and aim to illustrate the spatial concentration distribution by the method of concentration moments the specific objectives of this paper are i to investigate the combined influence of gravity and wind effect on contaminant transport process ii to obtain the temporal evolution of concentration distribution by the method of spatial concentration moments iii to illustrate the behavior of contaminant transport in the initial stage and discuss the dispersion mechanism under wind effect 2 method 2 1 formulation for contaminant transport consider contaminant transport in a gravity induced open channel laminar flow of depth h in a cartesian coordinate system with longitudinal x axis aligned with the flow direction and vertical z axis as shown in fig 1 a small dip angle β for the circumstance under wind effect the equation of velocity is given as 1 ρ du dt μ d 2 u dz 2 ρ g sin β 2 μ du dz z h c s ρ air u w 2 3 u z z 0 0 where t s is time u ms 1 is the longitudinal velocity of flow ρ kgm 3 and ρ air kgm 3 are the density of water and air respectively c s dimensionless is wind drag coefficient u w ms 1 represents the velocity of wind at height h 10 meters above the water surface g ms 2 is the gravitational acceleration and μ kgm 1 s 1 is dynamic viscosity the density of air density of water and dynamic viscosity are assumed to be constant for a steady flow eqs 1 3 give a velocity profile as 4 u z ρ g sin β 2 μ 2 hz z 2 c s ρ air u w 2 μ z the basic equation for the contaminant transport can be adopted as 5 c t u c x d 2 c x 2 d 2 c z 2 where c kgm 3 presents the concentration d m 2 s 1 molecular diffusivity is assumed to be constant for a uniform and instantaneous release of scalar substance with mass q kgm 2 at the cross section of x 0 at time t 0 the initial condition reads as 6 c x z t t 0 q δ x h where δ x is the dirac delta function the non penetrating conditions at z 0 and z h require 7 c x z t z z 0 c x z t z z h 0 because the distribution of concentration decays exponentially in space the auxiliary relation is added as aris 1956 barton 1983 fischer et al 1979 fried 1975 8 c x z t x 0 it is convenient to work with dimensionless variables defined by 9 ξ x h ζ z h ψ u u c τ d t h 2 c ξ ζ τ h 2 c x z t q where u c is the characteristic velocity in dimensionless coordinates eq 4 can be rewritten as 10 ψ ζ u u c 2 ζ

concentration distribution in the gravity induced current is illustrated by the method of concentration moments which was originally developed by aris 1956 by manipulations of concentration moments the exact statistical properties of concentration distribution could be obtained analytically the n th n 0 1 2 order concentration moment is defined as 16 m n ζ τ c ξ ζ τ ξ n d ξ applying the operator d ξ to eqs 12 14 with the boundary condition eq 15 gives 17 m 0 τ 2 m 0 ζ 2 18 m 0 τ 0 1 19 m 0 ζ ζ 0 m 0 ζ ζ 1 0 the eigenvalue problem for the equation of zero th concentration moment is taken as 20 d 2 x j d ζ 2 θ j 2 x j 0 j 1 2 3 21 d x j d ζ ζ 0 d x j d ζ ζ 1 0 where θ j j π is the eigenvalue and the general solution of the eigenvalue problem can be written as 22 x j ζ 2 cos j π ζ thus the integral transform for m 0 ζ τ can be defined as 23 m 0 θ j τ 0 1 m 0 ζ τ x j d ζ j 1 2 3 with j 0 24 m 0 θ 0 τ 0 1 m 0 ζ τ d ζ taking integral transform for eqs 17 and 18 with the boundary condition

concentration distributions can be obtained approximately by using the fourth order hermite polynomials to represent non gaussian curves andersson and berglin 1981 mazumder and das 1992 mehta et al

3 1 the influence of wind force and gravity on taylor dispersivity for a gravity induced open channel flow under wind effect the taylor dispersivity d t is obtained as 46 d t d 1 pe 2 j 1 φ j 2 θ j 2 1 e τ θ j 2 and for a long time evolution d t approaches an asymptotic value of 47 d a d 1 pe 2 j 1 φ j 2 θ j 2 the variation of taylor dispersivity with k is presented in fig 2 fig 2 b shows that the tailwind k 0 leads to a significant enhancement of taylor dispersivity and as the wind velocity u w increases d t increases accordingly on the contrary the headwind k 0 reduces the mean velocity of flow which implies the conveyance capacity becomes weaker d c presents the taylor dispersivity under windless circumstance fig 2 a illustrates the temporal evolution of d t at different k after a short transition stage the dispersivity asymptotically approaches its steady goal maxima meanwhile a larger asymptotic value of taylor dispersivity would be generally expected with a higher increasing rate fig 2 a 3 2 mean concentration distribution the longitudinal distribution of mean concentration in pe independent coordinate cpe ξ pe at different times is shown in fig 3 the mean concentration distribution under headwind effect is illustrated by red dash line the distribution under tailwind is presented by dot dash line and the solid line represents the windless circumstance compared with the windless circumstance the peak height of dot dash line is reduced by the effect of tailwind and the contaminant transport is weakened under the headwind which agrees with the results presented in fig 2 the present results could provide a useful estimation for ecological risk assessment when an instantaneous release of wastewater is injected into stream or river the contaminant cloud appears under the effect of hydraulic dispersion for environmental management what concerns is the peak concentration and transport velocity of pollutant the wind effect shifts the centroid position of the contaminant cloud accelerating tailwind effect or decelerating headwind effect the convection velocity of contaminant note that at large times the mean concentration curves commendably satisfy the taylor aris solution gaussian distribution as shown in fig 3 d e at the initial stage of dispersion process these concentration curves inevitably deviate normality and become asymmetrical fig 3 a b under the influence of convection with the fluid which dominates over diffusion in the initial stage of the dispersion cloud of contaminant is stretched by a non uniform shear just as the circumstance in the present study fig 3 a b show an obvious negative skewness indicating that the mass of the distribution is concentrated downstream leading to the tail on the left side of the distribution curve is longer than the right side as referred to as left skewed or left tailed 3 3 vertical variation of concentration distribution fig 4 illustrates the longitudinal concentration distribution at different ζ under a tailwind condition at the initial stage of dispersion process solute transport is mainly dominated by convection so that the centers of mass of solute matter at different ζ are stretched by velocity as presented in fig 4 a after τ 1 since the dispersion process fully develops the concentration distribution tends to normality meanwhile the deviation between curves relatively decreases as shown in fig 4 d qualitatively the same evolution characteristic of longitudinal concentration distribution is observed regardless of the wind direction or intensity the vertical concentration distributions is presented in fig 5 at initial stage of dispersion the convection dominates the process of solute transport at the top of channel solute with higher concentration is carried downstream by the flow so that the concentration at the top is much higher than that at the bottom of the channel as shown in fig 5 a the vertical concentration difference will remain for a very long time independent with the velocity profile tailwind or headwind circumstance and then gradually smeared out by molecular diffusion fig 5 d 3 4 spatial concentration distribution another focal point of this work is to illustrate the evolution of the spatial concentration distribution for a more intuitive illustration fig 6 illustrates the contaminant dispersion process at k 0 windless note that at small times a noteworthy concentration peak appeals near the top of the channel because the shear effect is weakest in this region as time processes the taylor dispersion develops and the substance transport gradually evolves to a diffusion like model the longitudinal distribution of mean concentration tends to normality and the vertical concentration tends to uniformity it is also observed that the vertical concentration difference remains remarkable for a quite long time which implies that the usual estimation based on the mean concentration does not work for a reliable ecological risk assessment in the initial stage wu and chen 2014a inferred a time scale up to τ 10 to characterize the stage of the transport process to approach vertical uniformity the tailwind effect k 0 will accelerate the development of taylor dispersion as well as the transport of contaminant fig 7 on the contrary the conveyance capacity is weakened by a headwind effect as shown in fig 8

7219,as an extension of our recent study li et al taylor dispersion in wind driven current journal of hydrology 555 697 707 an analytical study based on spatial concentration moments is performed on contaminant transport in a gravity induced open channel flow under wind effect the zeroth to the fourth order spatial concentration moments are derived to describe the temporal evolution of spatial concentration distribution fitted by the fourth order hermite polynomials in initial stage convection dominates the contaminant transport leading to a large non uniformity of vertical concentration as time passes the contaminant transport gradually evolves to an asymptotic pattern following a diffusion like model of taylor dispersion the combined influence of gravity and wind effect on contaminant

circumstance keywords taylor dispersion open channel flow spatial concentration distribution method of concentration moments 1 introduction existing in most natural rivers and artificial streams open channel flows can drive a significant exchange of mass and momentum huang et al 2016 komori et al 1993 maxama and webber 2010 smith 1980 wang and chen 2016a zhang et al 2018 and are of vital importance in water management contaminant control ecological risk assessment and environmental preservation carvalho et al 2009 fried 1975 wang and chen 2017a wu et al 2011 zeng et al 2012 transport of contaminants in channel flows has attracted much attention as a result of its implications on water quality in addition contaminants transport cannot be accurately modeled with a fickian type diffusion approach habel et al 2002 numerous studies have investigated the distributions of velocity and contaminants transport in open channel flows fischer 1973 ng and yip 2001 sumer 1974 fischer et al 1979 described the variation of the concentration across the depth of an open channel and showed that the deviation of the concentration is largest near the channel bed a large eddy simulation study has been conducted to investigate the turbulent structure of an open channel flow relevant results were found to be responsible for the significant lateral exchange of mass and momentum in channel flows xie et al 2013 experiments have been intensively performed by huai et al 2017 to study the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in ecological channels the behavior of contaminant transport in open channel flows can be governed by gravity wind or their combined effect water flows in streams rivers and other channels are typical gravity induced flows due to height difference in aquatic environment a gravity induced flow plays an important role to transport nutrient and chemical substances ho and lin 2015 and extensive discussions of these issues could be found in gregorio et al 2011 mriaux and kurz besson 2012 simpson 1982 meanwhile the wind stress can be another dominant driving factor for the flows and circulations li et al 2017 wind blowing over the surface of water bodies can drive flows and bio hydrodynamic interactions especially in shallow water areas the surface wind stress and bottom friction tend to dominate hydrostatic pressure gradients and therefore the current is downwind in this region schoen et al 2014 de marchis et al 2014 presented a three dimensional numerical simulations on wind and tide induced currents and compared the numerical results with field measurements a recent study compared the relative importance of the wind driven currents and tidal circulations in malacca strait by numerical simulations it highlighted that the wind stress largely ignored in previous studies is an important driver of the circulation in this region even under strong tidal forcing chen et al 2014 however these researches have not taken the combined circumstance of gravity and wind effect into account in this paper we pay attention to the contaminant transport in a gravity induced open channel flow under wind effect and aim to explore the transport process by an analytical method of taylor dispersion taylor dispersion describes a process in which solute spreads longitudinally under the combined action of lateral solute diffusion and longitudinal velocity non uniformity taylor 1953 taylor pointed out that by the process of molecular diffusion across a shear flow the apparent diffusion coefficient is much larger than the ordinary molecular diffusivity wang et al 2017 since the gap is so remarkable the dispersion mechanism is of great interest as illustrated by extensive studies by experiments theoretical analyses and numerical simulations beard 2001 chen and wu 2012 li et al 2015 vandre et al 2008 wang et al 2015 a most remarkable contribution was made by aris 1956 who originally developed a fruitful approach of the concentration moments barton 1983 aimed to resolve technical difficulties that occur when solving aris s moment equations by separation of variables by the theory of taylor dispersion zeng et al 2011 deduced a solution for the typical case of a pulsed contaminant emission into a steady flow through a shallow channel based on the method of concentration moment wu et al 2011 and luo et al 2016 focused on the characteristic of contaminant transport process in wetlands of a multi layer structure the effect of wind on environmental dispersion was investigated by zeng et al 2012 and luo et al 2017 for a two layer wetland a concrete solution was derived and illustrated for the evolution of cross sectional mean concentration although plenty of solutions to the cross sectional mean concentration have been presented based on taylor s classical analysis an issue of crucial importance remained to be answered for the subsequent researchers to explore the distribution of spatial concentration especially when the real transport process cannot be regarded as one dimensional diffusion like problem by the mean concentration a recent study wu and chen 2014b revealed that the rate of approach to transverse uniformity can be much slower than that to longitudinal normality yasuda 1984 introduced spatially distributed concentration moments in a tidal flow this approach is an inspirational method but the potential of the method to pursue the spatial concentration distribution was not realized in yasuda s work by extending the method of spatial concentration moments wang and chen 2017b explored the spatial concentration distribution in a wetland flow with bulk degradation actually the spatial concentration distribution appears to be a much more practical concern for a wide range of applications such as the contaminant transport with absorption reaction induced by biophysical or biochemical processes jiang et al 2017 li et al 2017 wang and chen 2017a meanwhile the spatial concentration distribution is also essential for revealing the initial behavior of dispersion process in this paper we focus on the contaminant transport in an open channel flow in a combined circumstance of gravity and wind effect and aim to illustrate the spatial concentration distribution by the method of concentration moments the specific objectives of this paper are i to investigate the combined influence of gravity and wind effect on contaminant transport process ii to obtain the temporal evolution of concentration distribution by the method of spatial concentration moments iii to illustrate the behavior of contaminant transport in the initial stage and discuss the dispersion mechanism under wind effect 2 method 2 1 formulation for contaminant transport consider contaminant transport in a gravity induced open channel laminar flow of depth h in a cartesian coordinate system with longitudinal x axis aligned with the flow direction and vertical z axis as shown in fig 1 a small dip angle β for the circumstance under wind effect the equation of velocity is given as 1 ρ du dt μ d 2 u dz 2 ρ g sin β 2 μ du dz z h c s ρ air u w 2 3 u z z 0 0 where t s is time u ms 1 is the longitudinal velocity of flow ρ kgm 3 and ρ air kgm 3 are the density of water and air respectively c s dimensionless is wind drag coefficient u w ms 1 represents the velocity of wind at height h 10

steady flow eqs 1 3 give a velocity profile as 4 u z ρ g sin β 2 μ 2 hz z 2 c s ρ air u w 2 μ z the basic equation for the contaminant transport can be adopted as 5 c t u c x d 2 c x 2 d 2 c z 2 where c kgm 3 presents the concentration d m 2 s 1 molecular diffusivity is assumed to be constant for a uniform and instantaneous release of scalar substance with mass q kgm 2 at the cross section of x 0 at time t 0 the initial condition reads as 6 c x z t t 0 q δ x h where δ x is the dirac delta function the non penetrating conditions at z 0 and z h require 7 c x z t z z 0 c x z t z z h 0 because the distribution of concentration decays exponentially in space the auxiliary relation is added as aris 1956 barton 1983 fischer et al 1979 fried 1975 8 c x z t x 0 it is convenient to work with dimensionless variables defined by 9 ξ x h ζ z h ψ u u c τ d t h 2 c ξ ζ τ h 2 c x z t q where u c is the characteristic velocity in dimensionless coordinates eq 4 can be rewritten as 10 ψ ζ u u c 2 ζ

d 2 x j d ζ 2 θ j 2 x j 0 j 1 2 3 21 d x j d ζ ζ 0 d x j d ζ ζ 1 0 where θ j j π is the eigenvalue and the general solution of the eigenvalue problem can be written as 22 x j ζ 2 cos j π ζ thus the integral transform for m 0 ζ τ can be defined as 23 m 0 θ j τ 0 1 m 0 ζ τ x j d ζ j 1 2 3 with j 0 24 m 0 θ 0 τ 0 1 m 0 ζ τ d ζ taking integral transform for eqs 17 and 18 with the boundary condition
