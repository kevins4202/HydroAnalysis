6120,glacial meltwater fed streamflow from the qilian mountains provides a much needed source of water for the northeastern margins of the tibetan plateau tp and surrounding regions we analyzed changes in glaciers located in the lenglongling mountains llm in the eastern qilian mountains in terms of glacier area and surface elevation these analyses were accomplished using multi temporal satellite images and studying digital elevation models dems based on topographic maps and zy 3 data the results showed that from 1972 to 2016 glacier coverage decreased by 41 1 km2 leaving only 62 1 km2 extant in 2016 the mean rate of change in glacier surface elevation asl was 18 7 1 2 m 0 43 0 03 m a 1 over the same period in situ measured data from ningchan no 1 glacier nc01 combined with meteorological records were also employed to develop a spatially distributed degree day model for the llm glaciers these two approaches yielded similar results allowing the reconstruction of a consistent time series that detailed annual changes in glacier mass over the past 44 years in addition we calculated that the mean annual glacial meltwater fed streamflow from 1972 to 2013 in the jiutiaoling basin jtlb northeast of the llm was equivalent to 1 4 107 m3 or 4 6 of the area s total annual streamflow it is remarkable that in years when streamflow was relatively lower such as 1972 1991 and 2013 glacial meltwater accounted for a higher proportion more than 8 of the streamflow keywords glacier mass balance glacier surface elevation lenglongling mountains geodetic method degree day method 1 introduction glaciers are known to act as a sensitive barometer of climate change and therefore play an important role in the climate system when they grow or shrink in response to changes in temperature and quantities of snowfall benn and evans 2010 mountains have been described as the water towers of the world immerzeel et al 2010 and thus provide vital sources of fresh water to many arid and semiarid regions pritchard 2019 such as western china yao et al 2004 ye et al 2016 over recent decades there have been multiple attempts to use geodetic surveying geographic information systems and remote sensing data to document changes in the lengths and areas of glaciers throughout the world fahnestock et al 2016 lüthi et al 2010 lopez et al 2010 pieczonka and bolch 2015 wu et al 2018 most research has indicated that as climate change occurs the rate at which glaciers are retreating has accelerated leading to the shrinkage of glaciers in most glaciated regions of the world guo et al 2015 ipcc 2013 ye et al 2017 furthermore changes in glacier mass are crucial for understanding how glaciers might respond to climate change and the concomitant implications of any such changes in glacier length and area for regional fresh water supplies and sea level rise ipcc 2013 gardner et al 2013 traditionally glacier mass balance measurements have been obtained using the glaciological method of stakes and pits cogley et al 2011 but the high elevations and harsh climatic conditions of the llm and its surrounding areas can make such fieldwork very difficult wu et al 2018 it has become established practice over recent years to use the calculated geodetic mass balance to assess changes to the surface elevations and mass volumes of glaciers over periods usually spanning from a few years to decades fischer et al 2015 li et al 2017 pieczonka et al 2013 shangguan et al 2015 ye et al 2015 this method can facilitate the calculation of the mean mass balance of a glacier or a region s glaciers over a long time series nevertheless if either the annual or the seasonal mass balance needs to be calculated continuous dems or other suitable methods provide the best bases for such calculations modeling is the principal technique used to assess glacier mass balance and a glacier s equilibrium line altitude ela spatially distributed degree day models are based on the empirical relation between glacier melting and near surface air temperatures hock 2003 the wide availability of air temperature data and the simplicity of its interpolation mean that such models are widely used when estimating single glacier mass balance values azam et al 2014 braithwaite and zhang 2000 engelhardt et al 2017 at present the reconstruction of such spatially distributed degree day models is subject to the considerable simplification that is employed in large scale modeling to estimate the contribution of glaciers to sea level change giesen and oerlemans 2013 liu and liu 2016 slangen et al 2016 wang et al 2017 such reconstructions have been widely used in mountain glacier meltwater research gardner and sharp 2009 wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2012a c these spatially distributed degree day models can provide the annual even the seasonal glacier mass balance for a particular glacier over a long time series braithwaite and zhang 2000 wang et al 2017 the crucial point about the usage of such models is that any parameters employed within the modeling process should be suitably determined using appropriate values obtained from short term observations in addition minor errors in these parameters may exert direct impacts on the reliability of any results obtained therefore if combined with a long term geodetic methodology spatially distributed degree day models may achieve higher degrees of accuracy reliability and thus credibility although the glaciers of the qilian mountains provide many water sources that can be used in the generation of hydroelectricity in agricultural irrigation and in the supply of potable water to both the human and farm animal population in the gansu corridor of northwest china pan et al 2012 they have been less monitored on a long term basis and little is therefore known about recent glacier trends or indeed these glaciers contributions to local and regional water supplies this study s objectives were as follows first to update decadal scale changes in glacier coverage using newly derived boundary data for glaciers in the llm in the eastern part of the qilian mountains for the period from 1972 to 2016 second to determine changes in glacier mass in the llm during the same period using two different methods viz geodetic methods based on topographic maps and ziyuan 3 zy 3 satellite data and spatially distributed degree day models simulating the glacier mass balance of llm glaciers and third to analyze the influence of glacial meltwater on streamflow in the jtlb 2 study area the llm are located on the northeastern tp they are 250 km long and 30 50 km wide fig 1 their mean elevation is 4000 m asl and the highest point in the llm is mount gangshika which reaches 5254 m asl this area is governed by an arid to semiarid climatic regime the llm glaciers have been classified as subcontinental or subpolar glaciers shi 2008 they are climatically influenced by the east asian monsoon eam the south asian monsoon sam and the westerlies tang and xu 1984 in 1972 244 glaciers were documented in the llm covering a total area of 103 2 km2 wang et al 1981 this area included 103 glaciers on the southwest facing slopes of the llm with a total coverage of 39 1 km2 these glaciers feed the datong river drainage basin the datong river is a tributary of the yellow river the remaining 141 glaciers covering a total area of 64 1 km2 were identified on the northeast facing slopes of the llm they feed the drainage basins of the shiyang river pan et al 2012 the glaciers found in the llm are highly sensitive to climate change and show a higher shrinkage rate than other glaciers studied in the qilian mountains pan et al 2012 the total area of all the glaciers found in the western llm decreased by 28 3 from 1972 to 2007 pan et al 2012 the maximum change in glacier surface elevation for the nine glaciers on the north facing slopes of the llm was 70 m between 1972 and 2010 cao et al 2014 3 data sources and methods 3 1 dems topographic maps can provide detailed glacier surface topographies and have been widely used for glaciological purposes wei et al 2015 in this study seven topographic maps from 1972 scale 1 50 000 acquired from the state bureau of surveying and mapping fig 1 were used to map glacier outlines and to analyze the local terrain we digitized 20 m contours and spot heights on the maps to generate a triangular irregular network tin map and produced a dem for 1972 dem1972 using the beijing 1954 datum next the dem was re projected onto the utm coordinate system based on the wgs84 datum make sure all data are under the same horizontal coordinate system during the projection we used a seven parameter datum transformation model with a 30 m resolution cao et al 2014 the uncertainty of this seven parameter transformation is estimated to be 0 5 m gao and zang 2009 wang et al 2018 in accordance with chinese national photogrammetrical mapping standards contour intervals were 16 m in the vertical dimension and 8 m in the horizontal dimension on slopes with gradients 25 gb t12343 1 2008 sac 2008 the zy 3 satellite launched in 2012 carries three pairs i e forward nadir and backward of stereo cameras with a resolution of 2 1 m zy 3 stereo pair images for july 16 2016 were collected and a dem of the study area was generated using the dem extraction model contained within the envi 5 0 software the wgs84 utm was the geographic reference system employed for the 47 n zone when generating the dem dem2016 at least 20 gcps for each zy 3 image were selected based on the coordinates and elevations that were extracted from both the landsat 8 oli image and the dem for 1972 3 2 dem coregistration and accuracy multitemporal dems require co registration to remove the horizontal and vertical offsets prior to any difference analysis pieczonka et al 2013 nuth and kääb 2011 proposed an analytical method that was later proven effective by paul et al 2015 this method was used in this study all dems were bilinearly resampled to the same 30 m cell size the observed relationships between elevational differences and aspect were used to make relative adjustments extreme outliers were not taken into account and were removed using a threshold method berthier et al 2010 gardelle et al 2013 the statistical characteristics of any resulting elevational differences were used to exclude the pixels that represented altitudinal differences outside of the 5 95 range to correct for any bias pieczonka et al 2013 wei et al 2015 the co registration between dems was conducted using a shifting vector dx 18 m dy 32 m and the shift in elevation was 18 3 m calculated based on the relationship between the elevational differences after the adjustments we estimated the uncertainty in the differences between dems by using the normalized median absolute deviation nmad expressed by 1 4826 med x x i x i elevational difference x median shangguan et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 for the non glaciated areas to convert elevation change to mass change an assumption about density was required a density of 850 60 kg m 3 was used cf huss 2013 the final mass balance uncertainty e was calculated as 1 e nmad t δ ρ ρ w 2 nmad t ρ i ρ w 2 where t is the observation period ρ i the ice density 850 kg m 3 δ ρ the ice density uncertainty 60 kg m 3 and ρ w the water density 999 92 kg m 3 3 3 changes in glacier area and surface elevation the glacier area in 1972 was taken from topographic maps 1 50000 pan et al 2012 the glacier area in 2016 was extracted from zy 3 satellite images and a landsat oli image p132 r34 2016 7 22 using artificial methods and repeatedly verified using google earth changes in glacier surface elevations were calculated using dem differentiation shangguan et al 2015 wei et al 2015 ye et al 2015 a density of 850 60 kg m 3 was employed to convert volume to actual mass cf huss 2013 3 4 climatic data and hydrological data we extracted the relevant meteorological data including daily air temperatures and precipitation values from the datasets recorded at the menyuan meteorological station 2924 m asl fig 1 in the llm between 1972 and 2017 an automatic weather station aws has been operating near glacier nc01 4500 m asl since august 2010 air temperature and precipitation values were recorded as half hourly means using a 30 min time step before being stored in a campbell cr1000 data logger another total precipitation gauge operating near this aws over the same period was also consulted a hydrologic station in the jtlb serving a total catchment area of 1043 km2 provided annual streamflow data for the 1972 2013 period the glacier mass balance for glacier nc01 for the period 2010 15 was measured following the glaciological methodology using a network of stakes the number of ablation stakes on nc01 progressively increased from 14 august 2010 to 22 september 2011 all stakes were located between 4250 and 4480 m asl and repositioned to represent nearly the entire glacier surface the cumulative mass balance was 4 50 1 1 m w e from september 2010 to september 2015 the annual mass balance varied between 1 48 0 5 m w e 2012 13 and 0 15 0 5 m w e 2014 15 with a mean of 0 90 0 5 m w e cao et al 2017 3 5 description of the mass balance model annual glacier wide mass balances were computed using a spatially distributed degree day model e g hock 2003 in addition to an accumulation model using the formula 2 b t 1 f m snow ice a s d t where b mm w e represents the glacier mass balance and f represents the meltwater fraction that refreezes there are no observed f data for this region thus we used a value of 0 076 from the central qilian mountains wang et al 2017 m snow ice mm w e is the melting of snow and ice as mm w e represents the snow accumulation and t is the period selected we run the model at daily temporal resolution for each grid m snow ice was calculated through a degree day model that is based on an empirical relationship between melt and air temperature braithwaite and zhang 2000 hock 2003 3 m s n o w i c e ddf ice s n o w t t t t t t 0 t t t where ddf denotes the degree day factor mm d 1 c 1 which is different for ice and snow and shows significant variability from site to site hock 2003 zhang et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 t is the extrapolated daily mean air temperature c at the glacier s surface and tt is the threshold air temperature c at which the snow and ice melts as is modelled from the precipitation value using a temperature threshold of ts to differentiate snow from rain at or below this temperature snow is considered to fall a mixture of snow and rain is assumed within a transition zone ranging from ts to tr within this temperature range the snow and rain percentages of total precipitation are obtained by linear interpolation the redistribution of snow by wind or avalanches is not considered in this study the accumulation as is computed using the following formula 4 a s p t t s p t t r t s t r t s t t r 0 t t r where p is precipitation mm and ts and tr are the threshold air temperatures for snow rain transitions 3 6 calibration of model parameters and model performance validation daily mean air temperatures extracted from the menyuan meteorological station and the glacier side aws for the overlapping period between 1 september 2010 and 30 june 2017 were used to calculate daily tlr values a marked seasonal cycle in tlrs was evident the highest mean monthly tlr 0 81 c 100 m 1 occurred in june and the lowest 0 33 c 100 m 1 occurred in december fig 2 in this study daily tlrs were calculated for a full year to determine the annual temporal variability azam et al 2014 if one assumes that precipitation increases linearly with elevation it becomes possible to calculate a precipitation gradient according to the menyuan station and aws station near the glacier the annual precipitation gradient was 22 1 mm 100 m 1 the monte carlo method was used to calibrate glacier mass balance data in total 10 000 parameter sets each consisting of five parameters were used these parameters varied independently from each other within what was taken to be a plausible range table 1 engelhardt et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 the model was calibrated using the available glacier mass balances measured for glacier nc01 for the period 2010 15 cao et al 2017 we selected the best 100 model runs that yielded the lowest rmse values between the measured and modeled glacier mass balances from the aforementioned 10 000 parameter sets each model parameter s uncertainty was expressed in relation to its specific range within the 100 best parameter sets engelhardt et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 4 results 4 1 changes in glacier coverage in the llm from 1972 to 2016 glacier coverage in the llm decreased by 41 1 km2 leaving only 62 1 km2 extant in 2016 the mean retreat rate was 0 93 km2 a 1 0 9 a 1 for 1972 2016 the statistical relations observed between the glacier area and surface elevation fig 3 suggest that most glaciers are distributed in the 4300 4700 m zone the glacier area in this elevation zone accounted for 70 80 of the total glacier coverage in both 1972 and 2016 however the change in glacier area appears much larger for the glaciers located in the 4300 4500 m asl zone glacier losses here accounted for 58 9 of the total area loss conversely no such significant loss in glacier area was observed above 4700 m asl here such losses made up just 12 of the total reduction in glacier coverage the majority of the glacier coverage in the llm could be found at elevations of 4450 m asl in 1972 but by 2016 the majority of the glacier coverage in the llm was found above 4550 m asl we analyzed the rates of change of glaciers of different sizes and of different slope directions the results showed that the relatively small glaciers of the llm decreased faster than the larger glaciers glaciers with areas of less than 0 5 km2 in 1972 decreased by 63 7 while the larger glaciers 1 km2 lost 24 6 of their total area in addition from 1972 to 2016 the annual area variation rate for glaciers facing southwest was 0 43 km2 slightly greater than for those facing northeast 0 36 km2 4 2 changes in glacier surface elevation using geodetic method according to the dem differentiation the glacier surfaces in the llm region appear to have experienced a significant elevational lowering of 18 7 1 2 m 0 43 0 03 m a 1 or a mean mass loss of 0 37 0 03 m w e a 1 equivalent to an overall mass change of 1 64 0 11 gt during the 1972 2016 period fig 4 a marked thinning is observed in the eastern part of the llm where nine glaciers are thinning at a mean rate of 0 7 m per year fig 4 determining the factors that control glacier melt is more difficult because along with the melt model they are highly complex and produce different levels of melt in different areas fig 5 represents the elevation and surface elevation change of each grid of glaciers in general glacial thinning is at its maximum at low elevations and at its minimum at higher elevations fig 5 it can be seen that in areas below 4800 m asl any changes in glacier surface elevations exhibit a linear relation with altitude asl above 4800 m asl this correlation is less apparent 4 3 modeled glacier elas and glacier mass balance values the ela is defined as the altitude at which a glacier s mass balance remains at 0 for two years running in areas above this elevation the glacier mass balance is expressed as positive and in areas below this elevation as negative during our modeling the altitude at which annual glacier mass accumulation and ablation were the same was taken to represent the ela fig 6 c our results show that at first the ela exhibited a decreasing trend descending to 4220 m asl in 1983 thereafter the ela rose intermittently reaching 4813 m asl in 2016 we subdivide the 1972 2016 period into five stages as follows 1972 1980 when the mean ela was 4421 m asl 1981 1990 when the mean ela was 4325 m asl 1991 2000 with a mean ela of 4446 m asl 2001 2010 when the mean ela was 4532 m asl and 2011 2016 with a mean ela of 4580 m asl fig 6 shows that the ela values were not greatly influenced by precipitation however compared to mean annual air temperatures mats mean summer air temperatures jja exerted a comparatively significant impact on the elas linear regression between ela and mean annual precipitation p and mean summer air temperature t at the menyuan meteorological station is as follows 5 ela 2989 133 4 t 0 17 p r 2 0 89 this relation shows that ela increases by 133 4 m if the mean summer air temperature increases by 1 c while ela decreases by 0 17 m if the annual precipitation increases by 1 mm in other words precipitation needs to increase by 784 mm in order to compensate for the effect of 1 c increase on ela using the degree day model we calculated that the glacier mass balance for the glaciers of the llm for the period 1972 2016 was 20 13 1 6 m w e slightly greater than the geodetically determined glacier mass balance results it can be seen from these simulated results that any annual changes in accumulations are unclear but annual ablation rates exert a comparatively significant impact upon annual glacier mass balance values before 1993 glacier mass balance values for the llm were stable with the 1982 1987 period showing a continuously positive balance however after 1993 this region experienced continuously negative glacier mass balance values after 2010 this negative trend accelerated particularly in 2016 when it reached an annual negative value of 1791 mm 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the two sets of results the geodetically determined results showed a mean lowering of glacier surface elevations of 18 7 1 2 m 0 43 0 03 m a 1 for 1972 2016 after accurately registering these geodetic results with our dems the geodetic result was taken as the actual glacier surface lowering values in this study we used mass balance data observations from the surface of glacier nc01 to validate the values of the model parameters therefore the mass balance if this glacier is universal was key to the accuracy of our model spatially distributed degree day modeling results gave a mean lowering in glacier surface elevations of 20 13 1 6 m w e which slightly overestimated glacier ablation rates at 7 6 nevertheless in general the difference between the geodetic method and our modeling was not particularly large and both methods produced relatively accurate glacier mass balance values for the llm for the period 1972 2016 5 2 comparison with other regions in glacier retreat and thinning many studies have shown that most of the glaciers on the tp have responded to climate change by decreasing in area and losing ice mass in recent decades with shrinkage varying spatially for example the glacier mean area has decreased by 0 57 a 1 in the southeastern tp 0 41 a 1 in the central himalayas 0 42 a 1 in the western himalayas 0 29 a 1 in the northeastern tp and 0 07 a 1 in the northwestern tp yao et al 2012 the rate of glacier retreat 0 9 a 1 in the llm region is faster than those in other parts of the tp in the southeastern tp the gongga mountains experienced a high thinning rate 0 54 m a 1 between 1966 and 2015 cao et al 2019 and the kangri karpo mountains also showed a significantly negative mass balance 0 46 m a 1 from 1980 to 2015 wu et al 2018 and in rongbuk catchment on the northern slopes of mt qomolangma in the central himalayas the glacier surface elevation change was 0 47 m a 1 between 1974 and 2006 ye et al 2015 the glacier thinning rate in these areas is similar to or slightly higher than that in our study area 0 43 m a 1 from 1972 to 2016 however in the interior or northwestern tp glacier thinning is less pronounced there is even thickening in some areas such as the karakoram hewitt 2005 and west kunlun mountains zhou et al 2018 5 3 the contribution of glacial meltwater to streamflow the spatially distributed degree day modeling was used to determine mean annual glacial meltwater rates for the period 1972 2013 and to explore the proportional contribution made by glacial meltwater to streamflow fig 7 the area of the jtlb is 1043 km2 and its mean area of glacier coverage from 1972 to 2014 is 14 6 km2 we determined that the glacier surface area accounted for 1 4 of the jtlb s surface area and that annual glacial meltwater fed streamflow was 1 4 107 m3 or 4 6 of the total streamflow fig 7 it is remarkable that in years when streamflow was relatively lower such as 1972 1991 and 2013 glacial meltwater accounted for a higher proportion more than 8 of the streamflow we would therefore suggest that although glacier coverage in the jtlb is comparatively insignificant glacial meltwater makes up a significant proportion of streamflow in this area in other words the glaciers of the jtlb act as one of the regulators of its water sources there are many published studies using satellite technology to detect glacier mass balance and quantify the proportional contribution of glacial meltwater to streamflow chen et al 2017 engelhardt et al 2017 han et al 2019 frans et al 2018 pohl et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 van beusekom and viger 2018 for instance rodell et al 2018 have used the grace satellites to detect total water storage changes globally indicating that all most of the depleted regions are associated with either glacier mass depletion or groundwater depletion which is a dominant factor in global water storage changes chen et al 2017 and han et al 2019 used gravity satellites and in situ measured glacier mass changes to calibrate a glacier hydrological model to simulate glacier melt runoff in the southwest tibetan plateau frans et al 2018 used remote sensing in situ measurement and modeling to detect glacier depletion and associated hydrological effects in the northwest us all of these studies provide a complete picture as how glacier mass balance can be detected using remote sensing and how to identify the hydrological signatures and effects using glacier hydrological models the degree day models are based on the empirical relationship between atmospheric temperature and glacier ablation hock 2003 they have the additional advantage of providing information about historic glacier meltwater contributions to discharge since temperature and discharge are generally the most readily available and highest quality data over decades past liu et al 2009 in several instances degree day models have been used as stand alone tools for estimating the current e g zhang et al 2008 2012a and future e g aizen et al 2007 zhang et al 2012a b c contribution of glacier meltwater 6 conclusions in this study we updated decadal scale changes in glacier coverage using newly derived boundary data for glaciers in the llm for the period from 1972 to 2016 the results showed that glacier coverage in the llm decreased by 41 1 km2 leaving only 62 1 km2 extant in 2016 the mean rate of retreat was calculated to be 0 93 km2 a 1 0 9 a 1 we used two independent ensemble based approaches to calculate the likely total change in glacier mass volume in the llm during the 1972 2016 period during this same period the mean surface elevation of glaciers in the llm changed by 18 7 1 2 m 0 43 0 03 m a 1 when calculated using geodetic method the results obtained using spatially distributed degree day modeling were almost the same as those derived from our geodetic determinations the modeling approaches clearly demonstrated that prior to 1993 glacier mass balance values in the llm were relatively stable but that after 1993 this region experienced a continuously negative balance which strengthened later glacier coverage in the jtlb accounted for only 1 4 of its surface area but 4 6 of its streamflow in addition in years when streamflow was relatively lower such as 1972 1991 and 2013 glacial meltwater accounted for a higher proportion more than 8 of the streamflow declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

6120,glacial meltwater fed streamflow from the qilian mountains provides a much needed source of water for the northeastern margins of the tibetan plateau tp and surrounding regions we analyzed changes in glaciers located in the lenglongling mountains llm in the eastern qilian mountains in terms of glacier area and surface elevation these analyses were accomplished using multi temporal satellite images and studying digital elevation models dems based on topographic maps and zy 3 data the results showed that from 1972 to 2016 glacier coverage decreased by 41 1 km2 leaving only 62 1 km2 extant in 2016 the mean rate of change in glacier surface elevation asl was 18 7 1 2 m 0 43 0 03 m a 1 over the same period in situ measured data from ningchan no 1 glacier nc01 combined with meteorological records were also employed to develop a spatially distributed degree day model for the llm glaciers these two approaches yielded similar results allowing the reconstruction of a consistent time series that detailed annual changes in glacier mass over the past 44 years in addition we calculated that the mean annual glacial meltwater fed streamflow from 1972 to 2013 in the jiutiaoling basin jtlb northeast of the llm was equivalent to 1 4 107 m3 or 4 6 of the area s total annual streamflow it is remarkable that in years when streamflow was relatively lower such as 1972

day method 1 introduction glaciers are known to act as a sensitive barometer of climate change and therefore play an important role in the climate system when they grow or shrink in response to changes in temperature and quantities of snowfall benn and evans 2010 mountains have been described as the water towers of the world immerzeel et al 2010 and thus provide vital sources of fresh water to many arid and semiarid regions pritchard 2019 such as western china yao et al 2004 ye et al 2016 over recent decades there have been multiple attempts to use geodetic surveying geographic

the world guo et al 2015 ipcc 2013 ye et al 2017 furthermore changes in glacier mass are crucial for understanding how glaciers might respond to climate change and the concomitant implications of any such changes in glacier length and area for regional fresh water supplies and sea level rise ipcc 2013 gardner et al 2013 traditionally glacier mass balance measurements have been obtained using the glaciological method of stakes and pits cogley et al 2011 but the high elevations and harsh climatic conditions of the llm and its surrounding areas can make such fieldwork very difficult wu et al 2018 it has become established practice over recent years to use the calculated geodetic mass balance to assess changes to the surface elevations and mass volumes of glaciers over periods usually spanning from a few years to decades fischer et al 2015 li et al 2017 pieczonka et al 2013 shangguan et al 2015 ye et al 2015 this method can facilitate the calculation of the mean mass balance of a

bases for such calculations modeling is the principal technique used to assess glacier mass balance and a glacier s equilibrium line altitude ela spatially distributed degree day models are based on the empirical relation between glacier melting and near surface air temperatures hock 2003 the wide availability of air temperature data and the simplicity of its interpolation mean that such models are widely used when estimating single glacier mass balance values azam et al 2014 braithwaite and zhang 2000 engelhardt et al 2017 at present the reconstruction of such spatially distributed degree day models is subject to the considerable simplification that is employed in large scale modeling to estimate the contribution of glaciers to sea level change giesen and oerlemans 2013 liu and liu 2016 slangen et al 2016 wang et al 2017 such reconstructions have been widely used in mountain glacier meltwater research gardner and sharp 2009 wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2012a c these spatially distributed degree day models can provide the annual even the seasonal glacier mass balance for a particular glacier over a long time series braithwaite and zhang 2000 wang et al 2017 the crucial point about the usage of such models is that any parameters employed within the modeling process should be suitably determined using appropriate values obtained from short term observations in addition minor errors in these parameters may exert direct impacts on the reliability of any results obtained therefore if combined with a long term geodetic methodology spatially distributed degree day models may achieve higher degrees of accuracy reliability and thus credibility although the glaciers of the qilian mountains provide many water sources that can be used in the generation of hydroelectricity in agricultural irrigation and in the supply of potable water to both the human and farm animal population in the gansu corridor of northwest china pan et al 2012 they have been less monitored on a long term basis and little is therefore known about recent glacier trends or indeed these glaciers contributions to local and regional water supplies this study s objectives were as follows first to update decadal scale changes in glacier coverage using newly derived boundary data for glaciers in the llm in the eastern part of the qilian mountains for the period from 1972 to 2016 second to determine changes in glacier mass in the llm during the same period using two different methods viz geodetic methods based on topographic maps and ziyuan 3 zy 3 satellite data and spatially distributed degree day models simulating the glacier mass balance of llm glaciers and third to analyze the influence of glacial meltwater on streamflow in the jtlb 2 study area the llm are located on the northeastern tp they are 250 km long and 30 50 km wide fig 1 their mean elevation is 4000 m asl and the highest point in the llm is mount gangshika which reaches 5254 m asl this area is governed by an arid to semiarid climatic regime the llm glaciers have been classified as subcontinental or subpolar glaciers shi 2008 they are climatically influenced by the east asian monsoon eam the south asian monsoon sam and the westerlies tang and xu 1984 in 1972 244 glaciers were documented in the llm covering a total area of 103 2 km2 wang et al 1981 this area included 103 glaciers on the southwest facing slopes of the llm with a total coverage of 39 1 km2 these glaciers feed the datong river drainage basin the datong river is a tributary of the yellow river the remaining 141 glaciers covering a total area of 64 1 km2 were identified on the northeast facing slopes of the llm they feed the drainage basins of the shiyang river pan et al 2012 the glaciers found in the llm are highly sensitive to climate change and show a higher shrinkage rate than other glaciers studied in the qilian mountains pan et al 2012 the total area of all the glaciers found in the western llm decreased by 28 3 from 1972 to 2007 pan et al 2012 the maximum change in glacier surface elevation for the nine glaciers on the north facing slopes of the llm was 70 m between 1972 and 2010 cao et al 2014 3 data sources and methods 3 1 dems topographic maps can provide detailed glacier surface topographies and have been widely used for glaciological purposes wei et al 2015 in this study seven topographic maps from 1972 scale 1 50 000 acquired from the state bureau of surveying and mapping fig 1 were used to map glacier outlines and to analyze the local terrain we digitized 20 m contours and spot heights on the maps to generate a triangular irregular network tin map and produced a dem for 1972 dem1972 using the beijing 1954 datum next the dem was re projected onto the utm coordinate system based on the wgs84 datum make sure all data are under the same horizontal coordinate system during the projection we used a seven parameter datum transformation model with a 30 m resolution cao et al 2014 the uncertainty of this seven parameter transformation is estimated to be 0 5 m gao and zang 2009 wang et al 2018 in accordance with chinese national photogrammetrical mapping standards contour intervals were 16 m in the vertical dimension and 8 m in the horizontal dimension on slopes with gradients 25 gb t12343 1 2008 sac 2008 the zy 3 satellite launched in 2012 carries three pairs i e forward nadir and backward of stereo cameras with a resolution of 2 1 m zy 3 stereo pair images for july 16 2016 were collected and a dem of the study area was generated using the dem extraction model contained within the envi 5 0 software the wgs84 utm was the geographic reference system employed for the 47 n zone when generating the dem dem2016 at least 20 gcps for each zy 3 image were selected based on the coordinates and elevations that were extracted from both the landsat 8 oli image and the dem for 1972 3 2 dem coregistration and accuracy multitemporal dems require co registration to remove the horizontal and vertical offsets prior to any difference analysis pieczonka et al 2013 nuth and kääb 2011 proposed an analytical method that was later proven effective by paul et al 2015 this method was used in this study all dems were bilinearly resampled to the same 30 m cell size the observed relationships between elevational differences and aspect were used to make relative adjustments extreme outliers were not taken into account and were removed using a threshold method berthier et al 2010 gardelle et al 2013 the statistical characteristics of any resulting elevational differences were used to exclude the pixels that represented altitudinal differences outside of the 5 95 range to correct for any bias pieczonka et al 2013 wei et al 2015 the co registration between dems was conducted using a shifting vector dx 18 m dy 32 m and the shift in elevation was 18 3 m calculated based on the relationship between the elevational differences after the adjustments we estimated the uncertainty in the differences between dems by using the normalized median absolute deviation nmad expressed by 1 4826 med x x i x i elevational difference x median shangguan et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 for the non glaciated areas to convert elevation change to mass change an assumption about density was required a density of 850 60 kg m 3 was used cf huss 2013 the final mass balance uncertainty e was calculated as 1 e nmad t δ ρ ρ w 2 nmad t ρ i ρ w 2 where t is the observation period ρ i the ice density 850 kg m 3 δ ρ the ice density uncertainty 60 kg m 3 and ρ w the water density 999 92 kg

and a landsat oli image p132 r34 2016 7 22 using artificial methods and repeatedly verified using google earth changes in glacier surface elevations were calculated using dem differentiation shangguan et al 2015 wei et al 2015 ye et al 2015 a density of 850 60 kg m 3 was employed to convert volume to actual mass cf huss 2013 3 4 climatic data and hydrological data we extracted the relevant meteorological data including daily air temperatures and precipitation values from the datasets recorded at the menyuan meteorological station 2924 m asl fig 1 in the llm between 1972 and 2017 an automatic weather station aws has been operating near glacier nc01 4500 m asl since august 2010 air temperature and precipitation values were recorded as half hourly means using a 30 min time step before being stored in a campbell cr1000 data logger another total precipitation gauge operating near this aws over the same period was also consulted a hydrologic station in the jtlb serving a total catchment area of 1043 km2 provided annual streamflow data for the 1972 2013 period the glacier mass balance for glacier nc01 for the period 2010 15 was measured following the glaciological methodology using a network of stakes the number of ablation stakes on nc01 progressively increased from 14 august 2010 to 22 september 2011 all stakes were located between 4250 and 4480 m asl and repositioned to represent nearly the entire glacier surface the cumulative mass balance was 4 50 1 1 m w e from september 2010 to september 2015 the annual mass balance varied between 1 48 0 5 m w e 2012 13 and 0 15 0 5 m w e 2014 15 with a mean of 0 90 0 5 m w e cao et al 2017 3 5 description of the mass balance model annual glacier wide mass balances were computed using a spatially distributed degree day model e g hock 2003 in addition to an accumulation model using the formula 2 b t 1 f m snow ice a s d t where b mm w e represents the glacier mass balance and f represents the meltwater fraction that refreezes there are no observed f data for this region thus we used a value of 0 076 from the central qilian mountains wang et al 2017 m snow ice mm w e is the melting of snow and ice as mm w e represents the snow accumulation and t is the period selected we run the model at daily temporal resolution for each grid m snow ice was calculated through a degree day model that is based on an empirical relationship between melt and air temperature braithwaite and zhang 2000 hock 2003 3 m s n o w i c e ddf ice s n o w t t t t t t 0 t t t where ddf denotes the degree day factor mm d 1 c 1 which is different for ice and snow and shows significant variability from site to site hock 2003 zhang et al 2006 zhang et al 2017 t is the extrapolated daily mean air temperature c at the glacier s surface and tt is the threshold air temperature c at which the snow and ice melts as is modelled from the precipitation value using a temperature threshold of ts to differentiate snow from rain at or below this temperature snow is considered to fall a mixture of snow and rain is assumed within a transition zone ranging from ts to tr within this temperature range the snow and rain percentages of total precipitation are obtained by linear interpolation the redistribution of snow by wind or avalanches is not considered in this study the accumulation as is computed using the following formula 4 a s p t t s p t t r t s t r t s t t r 0 t t r where p is precipitation mm and ts and tr are the threshold air temperatures for snow rain transitions 3 6 calibration of model parameters and model performance validation daily mean air temperatures extracted from the menyuan meteorological station and the glacier side aws for the overlapping period between 1 september 2010 and 30 june 2017 were used to calculate daily tlr values a marked seasonal cycle in tlrs was evident the highest mean monthly tlr 0 81 c 100 m 1 occurred in june and the lowest 0 33 c 100 m 1 occurred in december fig 2 in this study daily tlrs were calculated for a full year to determine the annual temporal variability azam et al 2014 if one assumes that precipitation increases linearly with elevation it becomes possible to calculate a precipitation gradient according to the menyuan station and aws station near the glacier the annual precipitation gradient was 22 1 mm 100 m 1 the monte carlo method was used to calibrate glacier mass balance data in total 10 000 parameter sets each consisting of five parameters were used these parameters varied independently from each other within what was taken to be a plausible range table 1 engelhardt et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 the model was calibrated using the available glacier mass balances measured for glacier nc01 for the period 2010 15 cao et al 2017 we selected the best 100 model runs that yielded the lowest rmse values between the measured and modeled glacier mass balances from the aforementioned 10 000 parameter sets each model parameter s uncertainty was expressed in relation to its specific range within the 100 best parameter sets engelhardt et al 2017 wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 4 results 4 1 changes in glacier coverage in the llm from 1972 to 2016 glacier coverage in the llm decreased by 41 1 km2 leaving only 62 1 km2 extant in 2016 the mean retreat rate was 0 93 km2 a 1 0 9 a 1 for 1972 2016 the statistical relations observed between the glacier area and surface elevation fig 3 suggest that most glaciers are distributed in the 4300 4700 m zone the glacier area in this elevation zone accounted for 70 80 of the total glacier coverage in both 1972 and 2016 however the change in glacier area appears much larger for the glaciers located in the 4300 4500 m asl zone glacier losses here accounted for 58 9 of the total area loss conversely no such significant loss in glacier area was observed above 4700 m asl here such losses made up just 12 of the total reduction in glacier coverage the majority of the glacier coverage in the llm could be found at elevations of 4450 m asl in 1972 but by 2016 the majority of the glacier coverage in the llm was found above 4550 m asl we analyzed the rates of change of glaciers of different sizes and of different slope directions the results showed that the relatively small glaciers of the llm decreased faster than the larger glaciers glaciers with areas of less than 0 5 km2 in 1972 decreased by 63 7 while the larger glaciers 1 km2 lost 24 6 of their total area in addition from 1972 to 2016 the annual area variation rate for glaciers facing southwest was 0 43 km2 slightly greater than for those facing northeast 0 36 km2 4 2 changes in glacier surface elevation using geodetic method according to the dem differentiation the glacier surfaces in the llm region appear to have experienced a significant elevational lowering of 18 7 1 2 m 0 43 0 03 m a 1 or a mean mass loss of 0 37 0 03 m w e a 1 equivalent to an overall mass change of 1 64 0 11 gt during the 1972 2016 period fig 4 a marked thinning is observed in the eastern part of the llm where nine glaciers are thinning at a mean rate of 0 7 m per year fig 4 determining the factors that control glacier melt is more difficult because along with the melt model they are highly complex and produce different levels of melt in different areas fig 5 represents the elevation and surface elevation change of each grid of glaciers in general glacial thinning is at its maximum at low elevations and at its minimum at higher elevations fig 5 it can be seen that in areas below 4800 m asl any changes in glacier surface elevations exhibit a linear relation with altitude asl above 4800 m asl this correlation is less apparent 4 3 modeled glacier elas and glacier mass balance values the ela is defined as the altitude at which a glacier s mass balance remains at 0 for two years running in areas above this elevation the glacier mass balance is expressed as positive and in areas below this elevation as negative during our modeling the altitude at which annual glacier mass accumulation and ablation were the same was taken to represent the ela fig 6 c our results show that at first the ela exhibited a decreasing trend descending to 4220 m asl in 1983 thereafter the ela rose intermittently reaching 4813 m asl in 2016 we subdivide the 1972 2016 period into five stages as follows 1972 1980 when the mean ela was 4421 m asl 1981 1990 when the mean ela was 4325 m asl 1991 2000 with a mean ela of 4446 m asl 2001 2010 when the mean ela was 4532 m asl and 2011 2016 with a mean ela of 4580 m asl fig 6 shows that the ela values were not greatly influenced by precipitation however compared to mean annual air temperatures mats mean summer air temperatures jja exerted a comparatively significant impact on the elas linear regression between ela and mean annual precipitation p and mean summer air temperature t at the menyuan meteorological station is as follows 5 ela 2989 133 4 t 0 17 p r 2 0 89 this relation shows that ela increases by 133 4 m if the mean summer air temperature increases by 1 c while ela decreases by 0 17 m if the annual precipitation increases by 1 mm in other words precipitation needs to increase by 784 mm in order to compensate for the effect of 1 c increase on ela using the degree day model we calculated that the glacier mass balance for the glaciers of the llm for the period 1972 2016 was 20 13 1 6 m w e slightly greater than the geodetically determined glacier mass balance results it can be seen from these simulated results that any annual changes in accumulations are unclear but annual ablation rates exert a comparatively significant impact upon annual glacier mass balance values before 1993 glacier mass balance values for the llm were stable with the 1982 1987 period showing a continuously positive balance however after 1993 this region experienced continuously negative glacier mass balance values after 2010 this negative trend accelerated particularly in 2016 when it reached an annual negative value of 1791 mm 5 discussion 5 1 comparison of the two sets of results the geodetically determined results showed a mean lowering of glacier surface elevations of 18 7 1 2 m 0 43 0 03 m a 1 for 1972 2016 after accurately registering these geodetic results with our dems the geodetic result was taken as the actual glacier surface lowering values in this study we used mass balance data observations from the surface of glacier nc01 to validate the values of the model parameters therefore the mass balance if this glacier is universal was key to the accuracy of our model spatially distributed degree day modeling results gave a mean lowering in glacier surface elevations of 20 13 1 6 m w e which slightly overestimated glacier ablation rates at 7 6 nevertheless in general the difference between the geodetic method and our modeling was not particularly large and both methods produced relatively accurate glacier mass balance values for the llm for the period 1972 2016 5 2 comparison with other regions in glacier retreat and thinning many studies have shown that most of the glaciers on the tp have responded to climate change by decreasing in area and losing ice mass in recent decades with shrinkage varying spatially for example the glacier mean area has decreased by 0 57 a 1 in the southeastern tp 0 41 a 1 in the central himalayas 0 42 a 1 in the western himalayas 0 29 a 1 in the northeastern tp and 0 07 a 1 in the northwestern tp yao et al 2012 the rate of glacier retreat 0 9 a 1 in the llm region is faster than those in other parts of the tp in the southeastern tp the gongga mountains experienced a high thinning rate 0 54 m a 1 between 1966 and 2015 cao et al 2019 and the kangri karpo mountains also showed a significantly negative mass balance 0 46 m a 1 from 1980 to 2015 wu et al 2018 and in rongbuk catchment on the northern slopes of mt qomolangma in the central himalayas the glacier surface elevation change was 0 47 m a 1 between 1974 and 2006 ye et al 2015 the glacier thinning rate in these areas is similar to or slightly higher than that in our study area 0 43 m a 1 from 1972 to 2016 however in the interior or northwestern tp glacier thinning is less pronounced there is even thickening in some areas such as the karakoram hewitt 2005 and west kunlun mountains zhou et al 2018 5 3 the contribution of glacial meltwater to streamflow the spatially distributed degree day modeling was used to determine mean annual glacial meltwater rates for the period 1972 2013 and to explore the proportional contribution made by glacial meltwater to streamflow fig 7 the area of the jtlb is 1043 km2 and its mean area of glacier coverage from 1972 to 2014 is 14 6 km2 we determined that the glacier surface area accounted for 1 4 of the jtlb s surface area and that annual glacial meltwater fed streamflow was 1 4 107 m3 or 4 6 of the total streamflow fig 7 it is remarkable that in years when streamflow was relatively lower such as 1972 1991 and 2013 glacial meltwater accounted for a higher proportion more than 8 of the streamflow we would therefore suggest that although glacier coverage in the jtlb is comparatively insignificant glacial meltwater makes up a significant proportion of streamflow in this area in other words the glaciers of the jtlb act as one of the regulators of its water sources there are many published studies using satellite technology to detect glacier mass balance and quantify the proportional contribution of glacial meltwater to streamflow chen et al 2017 engelhardt et al 2017 han et al 2019 frans et al 2018 pohl et al 2017 rodell et al 2018 van beusekom and viger 2018 for instance rodell et al 2018 have used the grace satellites to detect total water storage changes globally indicating that all most of the depleted regions are associated with either glacier mass depletion or groundwater depletion which is a dominant factor in global water storage changes chen et al 2017 and han et al 2019 used gravity satellites and in situ measured glacier mass changes to calibrate a glacier hydrological model to simulate glacier melt runoff in the southwest tibetan plateau frans et al 2018 used remote sensing in situ measurement and modeling to detect glacier depletion and associated hydrological effects in the northwest us all of these studies provide a complete picture as how glacier mass balance can be detected using remote sensing and how to identify the hydrological signatures and effects using glacier hydrological models the degree day models are based on the empirical relationship between atmospheric temperature and glacier ablation hock 2003 they have the additional advantage of providing information about historic glacier meltwater contributions to discharge since temperature and discharge are generally the most readily available and highest quality data over decades past liu et al 2009 in several instances degree day models have been used as stand alone tools for estimating the current e g zhang et al 2008 2012a and future e g aizen et al 2007 zhang et al 2012a b c contribution of glacier meltwater 6 conclusions in this study we updated decadal scale changes in glacier coverage using newly derived boundary data for glaciers in the llm for the period from 1972 to 2016 the results showed that glacier coverage in the llm decreased by 41 1 km2 leaving only 62 1 km2 extant in 2016 the mean rate of retreat was calculated to be 0 93 km2 a 1 0 9 a 1 we used two independent ensemble based approaches to calculate the likely total change in glacier mass volume in the llm during the 1972 2016 period during this same period the mean surface elevation of glaciers in the llm changed by 18 7 1 2 m 0 43 0 03 m a 1 when calculated using geodetic method the results obtained using spatially distributed degree day modeling were almost the same as those derived from our geodetic determinations the modeling approaches clearly demonstrated that prior to 1993 glacier mass balance values in the llm were relatively stable but that after 1993 this region experienced a continuously negative balance which strengthened later glacier coverage in the jtlb accounted for only 1 4 of its surface area but 4 6 of its streamflow in addition in years when streamflow was relatively lower such as 1972 1991 and 2013 glacial meltwater accounted for a higher proportion more than 8 of the streamflow declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

6121,daily stochastic streamflow simulation is widely used for the design of reservoirs evaluation of reservoir operation rules and risk evaluation of operation of water resources systems the major difficulties and challenges of daily streamflow are that there are 365 days that need to be simulated which entails much more calculation than does monthly streamflow simulation since lag 2 auto correlation is usually large the lag 2 correlations should be considered this paper therefore proposes a copula based method for daily stochastic streamflow simulation the contribution and novelty of this paper are that a the proposed method can consider lag 2 correlations compared with the currently used copula based method b the conditional copulas are used to build high dimensional copulas which make calculations easier and c the method can be used for daily streamflow simulation because of the simplified model structure and effective parameter estimation method seven gauging stations on the upper yangtze river and pearl river in china were selected as case studies results demonstrated that the proposed method preserved the basic statistics including mean daily flow standard deviation and coefficient of skewness of observed data of each day well comparison with the currently used seasonal autoregressive model sar 2 and bivariate copula based method considering lag 1 autocorrelation indicated that the proposed method produced smaller relative errors and was better overall therefore the proposed method can be regarded as an effective way for stochastic daily streamflow simulation and can be used for the design of reservoirs and risk analysis of water resources systems keywords daily streamflow stochastic simulation copula lag 2 correlations 1 introduction observed streamflow records are often used for water resources management decisions however since observed streamflow records are limited in length synthetic streamflow traces of longer length are generated preserving statistical characteristics including mean standard deviation coefficient of skewness and lag 1 correlation of the observed streamflow record reducing uncertainty in stochastic streamflow generation and reservoir sizing by combining observed reconstructed and projected streamflow patskoski et al 2018 therefore stochastic simulation of streamflow sequences may help simulate events that have not yet been observed in the past but can be expected in the future szilagyi et al 2006 which is needed for water resources planning and management stochastic streamflow simulation is therefore widely used for the design of reservoirs evaluation of alternative operating policies for a system of reservoirs and assessment of risk and reliability of operation of water resources systems srinivas and srinivasan 2005 lan et al 2018 lin et al 2010 chen et al 2016 several models have been developed for stochastic streamflow simulation the most commonly used method is the autoregressive ar model which reproduces the relationship between streamflow values at an instant in time t with the previous streamflow the widely used ar model is the first order markov model some improved methods based on ar model were also proposed such as autoregressive moving average arma autoregressive integrated moving average arima periodic autoregressive moving average parma srinivas and srinivasan 2001 and autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima models grimaldi 2004 sirangelo et al 2017 the advantage of these models is that the calculation procedure is simple and they are easy to apply however the limitation is that they require data to satisfy the assumptions of linearity and normal probability distribution chen et al 2015a b some disaggregation methods have also been used to simulate streamflow by sampling yearly streamflow values and disaggregating them into monthly or daily values as in portela and silva 2017 however these methods are difficult to extend to high dimensions recently the copula method has been used for stochastic simulation of hydrological data because copulas are flexible in choosing arbitrary marginal distributions representing the dependence structure extending to multivariate analysis and permitting a separate consideration of marginal distributions and dependence structure chen et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 lee and salas 2008 used the copula method for simulation of annual streamflow however in their method only dependence between time t and t 1 was considered which means that this method can only model the first order situation second the method is only used for monthly streamflow simulation in order to overcome this limitation this paper proposed a new copula based method in which the dependences among time t t 1 and t 2 were considered the lag time was extended to 2 days for daily streamflow simulation the conditional copula was used to establish the high dimensional copulas wang et al 2018 proposed a hierarchical network copula conditional models for monthly streamflow simulation however the calculation procedure is complex for these models which limits their application for daily streamflow simulation in which 365 high dimensional copulas need to be established the objective of this study therefore is to propose an efficient reliable and parsimonious method for generating daily streamflow which can preserve all the statistical characteristics exhibited by observed data lag 2 autocorrelations were considered in this new method the conditional copula was used to build high dimensional copulas which makes the calculation work much easier in order to validate the proposed method long term daily streamflow from several gauging stations in the yangzte river and pearl river basins of china were generated basic statistics of observed and simulated daily streamflow data were calculated and compared finally the performance of the proposed method was compared with that of the one order copula model and the traditional ar model 2 development of multivariate copulas copula function is a multivariate distribution function formed on 0 1 by connecting the marginal distribution functions of each variable and it describes multivariate correlation in this section the method for developing multivariate copulas is introduced in which high dimensional copulas are built based on bivariate and conditional copulas in this study the pearson type iii p iii distribution which has been recommended by the ministry of water resources of china mwr 2006 as a uniform procedure for flood frequency analysis was used to establish the marginal distributions chen et al 2012 some other distributions which are commonly used in hydrology were also considered as candidate distributions these distributions are the exponential exp generalized extreme value gev generalized logistic glo generalized pareto gpa generalized normal gno gumbel normal pearson type iii p iii wakeby and weibull distributions huang et al 2018a b chen et al 2015a b the best fitted distribution was selected based on the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic which

multivariate joint distribution the conditional distribution method was employed in this study to illustrate this method three variables x 1 x 2 and x 3 are taken as an example the joint distribution of these three variables can be expressed as 5 f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 f x 1 x 2 x 3 d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 f x 1 x 2 x 3 f x 3 d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 x 3 f x 3 x 1 x 2 f x 1 x 2 x 3 d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 x 3 f x 3 f x 1 x 2 x 3 d x 3 x 3 f x 1 x 2 x 3 d f x 3 the conditional probability distribution f x 1 x 2 x 3 can be described by a copula according to sklar s theorem nelsen 2007 there exists a unique copula c such that 6 f x 1 x 2 x 3 c f x 1 x 3 f x 2 x 3 where c represents the copula function f x 1 x 3 and f x 2 x 3 are the conditional probability distributions of variables x 1 and x 2 respectively given x 3 therefore the trivariate joint distribution can be built based on the bivariate and conditional copulas for the trivariate case eq 3 can be written as 7 f x 1 x 2 x 3 c u 1 u 2 u 3 x 3 c f x 1 x 3 f x 2 x 3 d f x 3 u 3 c c u 1 u 3 c u 2 u 3 d u 3 in order to obtain eq 7 the conditional copula needs to be specified the conditional copula for the bivariate case can be defined as 8 c u 1 u 3 c u 1 u 3 u 3 c u 2 u 3 c u 2 u 3 u 3 3 copula based method for daily streamflow simulation because the flow at the current time has a certain correlation with the flow at the previous time the copula function was used to characterize the correlation and establish the joint probability distribution to measure the dependence the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient was used in order to simulate daily streamflow considering lag 2 autocorrelation the correlations among streamflow at time t t 1 and t 2 were considered the streamflows at times t t 1 and t 2 were denoted as qt qt 1 and qt 2 respectively thus following eqs 5 and 6 the trivariate joint distribution can be established using a conditional bivariate joint distribution as 9 f q t q t 1 q t 2 c u 1 u 2 u 3 q t 2 c f q t q t 2 f q t 1 q t 2 d f q t 2 u 2 c c u 1 u 2 c u 3 u 2 d u 2 where q t q t 1 and q t 2 are the specific values of streamflows at times t t 1 and t 2 respectively and u 1 f q t 1 u 2 f q t 2 and u 3 f q t and u 1 u 2 and u 3 are the specific values corresponding to q t 1 q t 2 and q t from eq 8 the conditional copulas c u 1 u 2 and c u 3 u 2 given f q t 2 u 2 can be calculated as 10 c u 1 u 2 c u 1 u 2 u 2 w 1 c u 3 u 2 c u 2 u 3 u 2 w 2 therefore the trivariate copula can be written as 11 c u 1 u 2 u 3 u 2 c w 1 w 2 d u 2 in order to generate streamflow at time t q t the conditional distribution given q t 1 q t 1 and q t 2 q t 2 need to be formulated thus f q t q t 1 q t 2 can be calculated as 12 f q t q t 1 q t 2 0 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t f q t 1 q t 2 d q t from eq 3 the bivariate and trivariate joint pdfs of variables q t 1 q t 2 and q t can be given as 13 f q t 1 q t 2 c u 1 u 2 f q t 2 f q t 1 14 f q t 1 q t 2 q t c u 1 u 2 u 3 f q t 2 f q t 1 f q t then eq 12 can be calculated as 15 f q t q t 1 q t 2 0 q t c u 1 u 2 u 3 f q t 2 f q t 1 f q t c u 1 u 2 f q t 2 f q t 1 d q t 0 u 3 c u 1 u 2 u 3 c u 1 u 2 d u 3 c u 3 u 1 u 2 2 c u 1 u 2 u 3 u 1 u 2 2 c u 2 u 1 u 1 u 2 where c is the copula and c is the density function of copula from eq 11 c u 1 u 3 u 2 can be defined as 16 c u 1 u 3 u 2 c u 1 u 2 u 3 u 2 u 2 c w 1 w 2 d u 2 u 2 c w 1 w 2 substituting eqs 11 and 14 into eq 15 c u 3 u 2 u 1 can be calculated as 17 c u 3 u 2 u 1 c w 1 w 2 u 1 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 c w 1 w 2 w 1 w 1 u 1 w 1 u 1 c w 1 w 2 w 1 c w 2 w 1 thus only the parameters of bivariate copulas need to be estimated due to its simplicity the kendall tau method was used to measure the correlation between two random variables nelsen 2007 has given the relationship between kendall tau rank correlation coefficient and the parameter of copula function it is noted that when calculating the correlation between variables qt and qt 2 the effect of qt 1 should be removed the partial correlation coefficient pcc is introduced here the pcc corresponding to the kendall tau can be calculated as chen et al 2013 ebuh and oyeka 2012 kendall 1948 siegal 1956 as 18 τ q t q t 2 q t 1 τ q t q t 2 τ q t q t 1 τ q t 1 q t 2 1 τ q t q t 1 2 1 τ q t 1 q t 2 2 where τ q t q t 2 q t 1 is the pcc given the controlling variable qt 1 τ q t q t 2 is the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient between qt and qt 2 τ q t q t 1 is the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient between qt and qt 1 and τ q t 1 q t 2 is the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient between qt 1 and qt 2 the above procedure of deduction shows that daily streamflow at time t is conditioned on the previous streamflows at time t 1 and t 2 therefore the main steps for daily streamflow simulation considering lag 2 autocorrelation can be described as follows step 1 the pearson type iii p iii distribution was selected to fit the observed data denote u 1 f q t 1 u 2 f q t 2 and u 3 f q t step 2 establish the joint probability distributions c u 1 u 2 c u 1 u 3 and c u 2 u 3 based on bivariate copulas respectively the parameters of the first two copulas can be estimated using the kendall tau correlation coefficient and the parameters of the third one can be estimated based on pcc step 3 since streamflows at times t 1 and t 2 are known w 1 c u 1 u 2 u 2 can be calculated based on the conditional distribution step 4 generate a uniform random number ε and assign it by equating to ε c w 2 w 1 then the value of w 2 can be obtained from the inverse function c 1 w 2 w 1 step 5 when w 2 is obtained the subsequent u 3 is derived by solving the inverse function of w 2 c u 3 u 2 u 2 then streamflow at time t is obtained from the inverse function f 1 u 3 the overall framework of the proposed method is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the first daily streamflow values were obtained based on the inverse function q 1 f 1 u 1 the second data of the long term simulated series is related only to the first data therefore it can be directly derived based on the conditional copula c u 2 u 1 4 case study 4 1 data in this paper the upper yangtze river and the pearl river were selected as case studies the yangtze river basin is the third largest river basin in the world with a total area of 1 8 million square kilometers accounting for 18 8 of china s land area the yangtze river basin is basically in a subtropical humid climate zone with abundant precipitation and large runoff the main tributary rivers of the yangtze river in the upstream are the jinsha river min river tuo river jialing river and wu river chen et al 2014a b their concurrent mean daily flows data are available from the year 1952 to 2015 as shown in table 1 their corresponding gauging stations are the pingshan gaochang lijiawan beibei and wulong the length of daily streamflow data at yichang gauging station which is the control station of the three gorges reservoir tgr is from the year 1876 to 2015 as shown in table 1 a schematic of the rivers and gauging stations on the upper yangtze river is shown in fig 2 the pearl river basin is located in southern china and is in a tropical and subtropical region with distinct seasons and humid and rainy climate it comprises three tributaries namely xijiang beijiang and dongjiang the xijiang river basin covers an area of 35 31 km2 accounting for 77 8 of the pearl river basin the wuzhou gauging station located in the upstream of the xijiang river was selected in this study the length of the data at wuzhou gauging station is from the year 1962 to 2008 as shown in table 1 a schematic of pearl river basin and wuzhou gauging station is shown in fig 3 4 2 daily streamflow simulation using the proposed method in order to obtain the joint probability distribution of the three variables q t q t 1 and q t 2 three bivariate copulas need to be established the parameters of the copula models can be derived based on the kendall tau coefficient τ q t q t 1 and pcc τ q t q t 2 q t 1 measured by the kendall tau method first since the daily streamflow series do not always follow the normal distribution the skewed distributions are used in hydrology including the exponential exp generalized extreme value gev generalized logistic glo generalized pareto gpa generalized normal gno gumbel normal pearson type iii p iii wakeby and weibull distributions huang et al 2018a b chen et al 2015a b the l moment method was used to estimate the parameters of the marginal distributions of flow series the performance of the 10 marginal distributions was estimated based on the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic the mean values of rmse and aic for 365 days were calculated as given in table 2 it can be seen from table 2 that the mean rmse and aic values corresponding to p iii distribution are the smallest the smallest values in bold in table 2 therefore the p iii distribution was selected as the marginal distribution for daily streamflow series second daily streamflow was simulated using the trivariate copula method the trivariate copula was created by three bivariate copulas and the conditional probability distributions the performance of the selected gumbel copula and other copulas frank copula and clayton copula were compared first the gumbel frank and clayton copulas were used to build trivariate joint distributions the 365 root mean square error rmse values between empirical and theoretical probabilities were computed the mean rmse values of 365 days for each station were computed as given in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that the results obtained by different copulas show little difference however the mean values corresponding to the gumbel copula is smaller than those of other copulas therefore the gumbel copula was used to generate daily streamflow data in this study consider streamflow at yichang gauging station as an example 200 sets of streamflow with a length of 138 years were simulated basic statistics were calculated to evaluate the performance of the proposed model which included mean value standard deviation sd and skewness cs the mean values of the 200 samples in terms of the basic statistics of the simulated and observed data on each day are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the simulated values fitted the observed values well in addition relative errors res between the simulated and observed values of these basic statistics were calculated as given in table 4 which shows that the mean res between the simulated and observed data corresponding to the mean daily streamflow sd and cs were 0 085 0 27 and 0 00 respectively it demonstrates that the proposed method for daily streamflow simulation performed well in addition daily streamflow simulation at other gauging stations including the gaochang pingshan beibei lijiawan and wulong stations on the upper yangtze river and wuzhou station on the pearl river was carried out the curves of observed and simulated basic statistics corresponding to the mean value sd and cs are shown in fig 4 which demonstrates that the proposed method preserved the statistical characteristics of the streamflow series the mean relative errors res of the basic statistics including mean flow standard deviation sd and coefficient of skewness cs between observed and simulated daily streamflows for seven gauging stations were calculated as given in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the maximum res of mean flow sd and cs were 0 59 0 46 and 1 12 respectively which were less than 1 5 therefore it is concluded that the proposed method performed well in preserving the basic statistics of observed flow at the seven gauging stations boxplots were also used to compare the basic statistics of simulated and observed daily streamflow data the performance was judged to be good when a statistic fell within the boxplot hao and singh 2013 lee and salas 2011 the box plots of basic statistics mean value sd and cs of the observed and simulated values are shown in fig 5 the simulation statistics fell within the box plots for most of the days 4 3 comparison with other stochastic simulation methods for comparing the proposed method with the traditional daily streamflow simulation methods the seasonal autoregressive sar model and copula based daily streamflow simulation method were carried out in which the order of the sar model was 2 and bivariate copula based method considered only lag 1 autocorrelation 4 3 1 comparison with the sar method box and jenkins 1994 proposed the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sar method for time series analysis detailed information on how to carry out daily streamflow simulation using the sar method can be found in awass 2009 the akaike information criterion aic proposed by akaike 1974 was used to determine the order of the model which aims to minimize the following aic function 19 aic p n ln σ ε 2 2 p where n is the length of the observed streamflow series σ ε 2 is the variance of the residuals and p is the order of the sar model for the seven stations used in this paper the order of the sar model order was determined using the aic criterion the mean aic values for sar 1 sar 2 sar 3 and sar 4 models were calculated as given in table 5 which shows that the mean values of aic for each station are very close however the mean values of sar 2 were smaller than those of other sar models in particular for the pingshan and yichang stations the mean aic values of lag 2 autocorrelation were significantly smaller than those of others based on the aic criterion the sar 2 model was found to be the most appropriate model for stochastic streamflow simulation of observed streamflow series at the seven stations the mean values of relative errors res of basic statistics including mean flow standard deviation sd and coefficient of skewness cs of observed daily streamflow and simulated daily streamflows using sar 2 for the seven stations were calculated as given in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the performance of the proposed method was better than that of the sar method generally compared with the sar method the res of the mean value sd and cs calculated by the proposed method were much smaller the mean values in terms of the mean flow sd and cs calculated by the sar method were 0 71 2 35 and 4 21 and the mean values by the proposed method were 0 13 0 27 and 0 63 which demonstrates that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the sar method 4 3 2 comparison with stochastic method based on bivariate copula the stochastic method based on the bivariate copula with only 1 lag time was used for daily streamflow simulation the procedure of how to carry out daily streamflow simulation using copula based method considering lag 1 time is as follows 1 fit the marginal distribution of qt and qt 1 based on the p iii distribution ut f qt ut 1 f qt 1 2 build the bivariate joint distribution between qt and qt 1 based on bivariate copula namely f qt qt 1 c ut ut 1 then the parameters of copula were estimated by the kendall tau method 3 as qt 1 is known ut 1 can be computed then a uniform random number ε is generated and is assign to c ut ut 1 thus the value of ut can be calculated based on the inverse function c 1 ut ut 1 4 the daily streamflow qt can be calculated from the inverse function f 1 qt note that the streamflow of the first day q 1 is obtained from the marginal distribution f 1 q 1 more details can be found in lee and salas 2008 2011 the mean values of relative errors res of basic statistics such as mean flow standard deviation sd and coefficient of skewness cs of observed daily streamflow and simulated daily streamflows using the copula based method considering 1 lag time for the seven stations were calculated as given in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the bivariate copula based method generally compared with the bivariate copula based method the res of the mean value sd and cs calculated by the proposed method were much smaller the mean values in terms of the mean flow sd and cs calculated by the bivariate copula based method were 0 23 0 75 and 1 37 respectively and the mean values by the proposed method were 0 13 0 27 and 0 63 respectively which demonstrates that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the bivariate copula based method in addition it can be seen from fig 4 that the simulated values based on the proposed method were closer to the observed values which also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method 5 conclusions this paper proposed a copula based method for daily streamflow simulation the advantages of the proposed method are that a compared with the current copula based method it considers lag 2 autocorrelation b the conditional copula is used to build high dimensional copulas which makes the calculation work much easier c it can be used for daily streamflow simulation because of the simplified model structure and effective parameter estimation method seven gauging stations in the upper yangzte river and pearl river basins in china were selected as case studies the proposed method was also compared with the 2 order seasonal autoregressive model and the bivariate copula based model considering lag 1 autocorrelation the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the proposed copula based method considering lag 2 correlations preserves the statistical characteristics of the observed streamflow data these statistics include mean daily streamflow standard deviation and coefficient of skewness for all the gauging stations mentioned in this study the maximum relative errors corresponding to the mean value sd and cs were 0 59 0 46 and 1 12 respectively from this point of view the proposed method performs well 2 the proposed method was compared with two currently used streamflow simulation methods the simulated results for the seven gauging stations demonstrated that the proposed method was better than the 2 order seasonal autocorrelation model and copula based model considering lag 1 autocorrelation 3 the proposed method provides a new way for daily streamflow stochastic simulation which is more accurate and simpler than the currently used methods in this study only the lag 2 autocorrelation was considered may be in certain river basins the lag 3 autocorrelation may still be needed in the future work a more general method for higher order daily streamflow simulation will be investigated second in this study only two river basins with 7 gauging stations were taken as case studies to test the proposed method more gauging stations will be tested in the future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

6121,daily stochastic streamflow simulation is widely used for the design of reservoirs evaluation of reservoir operation rules and risk evaluation of operation of water resources systems the major difficulties and challenges of daily streamflow are that there are 365 days that need to be simulated which entails much more calculation than does monthly streamflow simulation since lag 2 auto correlation is usually large the lag 2 correlations should be considered this paper therefore proposes a copula based method for daily stochastic streamflow simulation the contribution and novelty of this paper are that a the proposed method can consider lag 2 correlations compared with the currently used copula based method b the conditional copulas are used to build high dimensional copulas which make calculations easier and c the method can be used for daily streamflow simulation because of the simplified model structure and effective parameter estimation method seven gauging stations on the upper yangtze river and pearl river in china were selected as case studies results demonstrated that the proposed method preserved the basic statistics including mean daily flow standard deviation and coefficient of skewness of observed data of each day well comparison with the currently used seasonal autoregressive model sar 2 and bivariate copula based method considering lag 1 autocorrelation indicated that the proposed method produced smaller relative errors and was better overall therefore the proposed method can be regarded as an effective way for stochastic daily streamflow simulation and can be used for the design of reservoirs and risk analysis of water resources systems keywords daily streamflow stochastic simulation copula lag 2 correlations 1 introduction observed streamflow records are often used for water resources management decisions however since observed streamflow records are limited in length synthetic streamflow traces of longer length are generated preserving statistical characteristics including mean standard deviation coefficient of skewness and lag 1 correlation of the observed streamflow record reducing uncertainty in stochastic streamflow generation and reservoir sizing by combining observed reconstructed and projected streamflow patskoski et al 2018 therefore stochastic simulation of streamflow sequences may help simulate events that have not yet been observed in the past but can be expected in the future szilagyi et al 2006 which is needed for water resources planning and management stochastic streamflow simulation is therefore widely used for the design of reservoirs evaluation of alternative operating policies for a system of reservoirs and assessment of risk and reliability of operation of water resources systems srinivas and srinivasan 2005 lan et al 2018 lin et al 2010 chen et al 2016 several models have been developed for stochastic streamflow simulation the most commonly used method is the autoregressive ar model which reproduces the relationship between streamflow values at an instant in time t with the previous streamflow the widely used ar model is the first order markov model some improved methods based on ar model were also proposed such as autoregressive moving average arma autoregressive integrated moving average arima periodic autoregressive moving average parma srinivas and srinivasan 2001 and autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima models grimaldi 2004 sirangelo et al 2017 the advantage of these models is that the calculation procedure is simple and they are easy to apply however the limitation is that they require data to satisfy the assumptions of linearity and normal probability distribution chen et al 2015a b some disaggregation methods have also been used to simulate streamflow by sampling yearly streamflow values and disaggregating them into monthly or daily values as in portela and silva 2017 however these methods are difficult to extend to high dimensions recently the copula method has been used for stochastic simulation of hydrological data because copulas are flexible in choosing arbitrary marginal distributions representing the dependence structure extending to multivariate analysis and permitting a separate consideration of marginal distributions and dependence structure chen et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 lee and salas 2008 used the copula method for simulation of annual streamflow however in their method only dependence between time t and t 1 was considered which means that this method can only model the first order situation second the method is only used for monthly streamflow simulation in order to overcome this limitation this paper proposed a new copula based method in which the dependences among time t t 1 and t 2 were considered the lag time was extended to 2 days for daily streamflow simulation the conditional copula was used to establish the high dimensional copulas wang et al 2018 proposed a hierarchical network copula conditional models for monthly streamflow simulation however the calculation procedure is complex for these models which limits their application for daily streamflow simulation in which 365 high dimensional copulas need to be established the objective of this study therefore is to propose an efficient reliable and parsimonious method for generating daily streamflow which can preserve all the statistical characteristics exhibited by observed data lag 2 autocorrelations were considered in this new method the conditional copula was used to build high dimensional copulas which makes the calculation work much easier in order to validate the proposed method long term daily streamflow from several gauging stations in the yangzte river and pearl river basins of china were generated basic statistics of observed and simulated daily streamflow data were calculated and compared finally the performance of the proposed method was compared with that of the one order copula model and the traditional ar model 2 development of multivariate copulas copula function is a multivariate distribution function formed on 0 1 by connecting the marginal distribution functions of each variable and it describes multivariate correlation in this section the method for developing multivariate copulas is introduced in which high dimensional copulas are built based on bivariate and conditional copulas in this study the pearson type iii p iii distribution which has been recommended by the ministry of water resources of china mwr 2006 as a uniform procedure for flood frequency analysis was used to establish the marginal distributions chen et al 2012 some other distributions which are commonly used in hydrology were also considered as candidate distributions these distributions are the exponential exp generalized extreme value gev generalized logistic glo generalized pareto gpa generalized normal gno gumbel normal pearson type iii p iii wakeby and weibull distributions huang et al 2018a b chen et al 2015a b the best fitted distribution was selected based on the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic which can be calculated by chen and singh 2018 1a rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 1b aic 2 ln l 2 k where y i is the simulated values y i is the observed values n is the length of the observed data series l is the maximum value of the likelihood function for the model k is the number of estimated parameters in the model let a multivariate joint distribution of n correlated random variables x 1 x 2 xn be denoted as f x 1 xn and the marginal distributions be denoted as f 1 x 1 fn xn then f x 1 xn can be expressed as nelsen 2007 sklar 1959 2 f x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n c u 1 u n where f xi ui for i 1 n with ui u 0 1 the joint probability density function f x 1 x n of variables x 1 x 2 xn can be defined zhang and singh 2019 as 3 f x 1 x n c u 1 u n f x 1 f x n 4 c u 1 u n c u 1 u n u 1 u n where f x 1 x n is the joint probability density function pdf of variables x 1 x 2 xn c u 1 u n is the copula density function and f 1 x 1 fn xn are the marginal distributions of variables x 1 x 2 xn for building the multivariate joint distribution the conditional distribution method was employed in this study to illustrate this method three variables x 1 x 2 and x 3 are taken as an example the joint distribution of these three variables can be expressed as 5 f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 f x 1 x 2 x 3 d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 x 1 x 2 x 3 f x 1 x 2 x 3 f x 3 d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 x 3 f x 3 x 1 x 2 f x 1 x 2 x 3 d x 1 d x 2 d x 3 x 3 f x 3 f x 1 x 2 x 3 d x 3 x 3 f x 1 x 2 x 3 d f x 3 the conditional probability distribution f x 1 x 2 x 3 can be described by a copula according to sklar s theorem nelsen 2007 there exists a unique copula c such that 6 f x 1 x 2 x 3 c f x 1 x 3 f x 2 x 3 where c represents the copula function f x 1 x 3 and f x 2 x 3 are the conditional probability distributions of variables x 1 and x 2 respectively given x 3 therefore the trivariate joint distribution can be built based on the bivariate and conditional copulas for the trivariate case eq 3 can be written as 7 f x 1 x 2 x 3 c u 1 u 2 u 3 x 3 c f x 1 x 3 f x 2 x 3 d f x 3 u 3 c c u 1 u 3 c u 2 u 3 d u 3 in order to obtain eq 7 the conditional copula needs to be specified the conditional copula for the bivariate case can be defined as 8 c u 1 u 3 c u 1 u 3 u 3 c u 2 u 3 c u 2 u 3 u 3 3 copula based method for daily streamflow simulation because the flow at the current time has a certain correlation with the flow at the previous time the copula function was used to characterize the correlation and establish the joint probability distribution to measure the dependence the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient was used in order to simulate daily streamflow considering lag 2 autocorrelation the correlations among streamflow at time t t 1 and t 2 were considered the streamflows at times t t 1 and t 2 were denoted as qt qt 1 and qt 2 respectively thus following eqs 5 and 6 the trivariate joint distribution can be established using a conditional bivariate joint distribution as 9 f q t q t 1 q t 2 c u 1 u 2 u 3 q t 2 c f q t q t 2 f q t 1 q t 2 d f q t 2 u 2 c c u 1 u 2 c u 3 u 2 d u 2 where q t q t 1 and q t 2 are the specific values of streamflows at times t t 1 and t 2 respectively and u 1 f q t 1 u 2 f q t 2 and u 3 f q t and u 1 u 2 and u 3 are the specific values corresponding to q t 1 q t 2 and q t from eq 8 the conditional copulas c u 1 u 2 and c u 3 u 2 given f q t 2 u 2 can be calculated as 10 c u 1 u 2 c u 1 u 2 u 2 w 1 c u 3 u 2 c u 2 u 3 u 2 w 2 therefore the trivariate copula can be written as 11 c u 1 u 2 u 3 u 2 c w 1 w 2 d u 2 in order to generate streamflow at time t q t the conditional distribution given q t 1 q t 1 and q t 2 q t 2 need to be formulated thus f q t q t 1 q t 2 can be calculated as 12 f q t q t 1 q t 2 0 q t f q t 1 q t 2 q t f q t 1 q t 2 d q t from eq 3 the bivariate and trivariate joint pdfs of variables q t 1 q t 2 and q t can be given as 13 f q t 1 q t 2 c u 1 u 2 f q t 2 f q t 1 14 f q t 1 q t 2 q t c u 1 u 2 u 3 f q t 2 f q t 1 f q t then eq 12 can be calculated as 15 f q t q t 1 q t 2 0 q t c u 1 u 2 u 3 f q t 2 f q t 1 f q t c u 1 u 2 f q t 2 f q t 1 d q t 0 u 3 c u 1 u 2 u 3 c u 1 u 2 d u 3 c u 3 u 1 u 2 2 c u 1 u 2 u 3 u 1 u 2 2 c u 2 u 1 u

and 14 into eq 15 c u 3 u 2 u 1 can be calculated as 17 c u 3 u 2 u 1 c w 1 w 2 u 1 2 c u 1 u 2 u 1 u 2 c w 1 w 2 w 1 w 1 u 1 w 1 u 1 c w 1 w 2 w 1 c w 2 w 1 thus only the parameters of bivariate copulas need to be estimated due to its simplicity the kendall tau method was used to measure the correlation between two random variables nelsen 2007 has given the relationship between kendall tau rank correlation coefficient and the parameter of copula function it is noted that when calculating the correlation between variables qt and qt 2 the effect of qt 1 should be removed the partial correlation coefficient pcc is introduced here the pcc corresponding to the kendall tau can be calculated as chen et al 2013 ebuh and oyeka 2012 kendall 1948 siegal 1956 as 18 τ q t q t 2 q t 1 τ q t q t 2 τ q t q t 1 τ q t 1 q t 2 1 τ q t q t 1 2 1 τ q t 1 q t 2 2 where τ q t q t 2 q t 1 is the pcc given the controlling variable qt 1 τ q t q t 2 is the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient between qt and qt 2 τ q t q t 1 is the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient between qt and qt 1 and τ q t 1 q t 2 is the kendall tau rank correlation coefficient between qt 1 and qt 2 the above procedure of deduction shows that daily streamflow at time t is conditioned on the previous streamflows at time t 1 and t 2 therefore the main steps for daily streamflow simulation considering lag 2 autocorrelation can be described as follows step 1 the pearson type iii p iii distribution was selected to fit the observed data denote u 1 f q t 1 u 2 f q t 2 and u 3 f q t step 2 establish the joint probability distributions c u 1 u 2 c u 1 u 3 and c u 2 u 3 based on bivariate copulas respectively the parameters of the first two copulas can be estimated using the kendall tau correlation coefficient and the parameters of the third one can be estimated based on pcc step 3 since streamflows at times t 1 and t 2 are known w 1 c u 1 u 2 u 2 can be calculated based on the conditional distribution step 4 generate a uniform random number ε and assign it by equating to ε c w 2 w 1 then the value of w 2 can be obtained from the inverse function c 1 w 2 w 1 step 5 when w 2 is obtained the subsequent u 3 is derived by solving the inverse function of w 2 c u 3 u 2 u 2 then streamflow at time t is obtained from the inverse function f 1 u 3 the overall framework of the proposed method is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the first daily streamflow values were obtained based on the inverse function q 1 f 1 u 1 the second data of the long term simulated series is related only to the first data therefore it can be directly derived based on the conditional copula c u 2 u 1 4 case study 4 1 data in this paper the upper yangtze river and the pearl river were selected as case studies the yangtze river basin is the third largest river basin in the world with a total area of 1 8 million square kilometers accounting for 18 8 of china s land area the yangtze river basin is basically in a subtropical humid climate zone with abundant precipitation and large runoff the main tributary rivers of the yangtze river in the upstream are the jinsha river min river tuo river jialing river and wu river chen et al 2014a b their concurrent mean daily flows data are available from the year 1952 to 2015 as shown in table 1 their corresponding gauging stations are the pingshan gaochang lijiawan beibei and wulong the length of daily streamflow data at yichang gauging station which is the control station of the three gorges reservoir tgr is from the year 1876 to 2015 as shown in table 1 a schematic of the rivers and gauging stations on the upper yangtze river is shown in fig 2 the pearl river basin is located in southern china and is in a tropical and subtropical region with distinct seasons and humid and rainy climate it comprises three tributaries namely xijiang beijiang and dongjiang the xijiang river basin covers an area of 35 31 km2 accounting for 77 8 of the pearl river basin the wuzhou gauging station located in the upstream of the xijiang river was selected in this study the length of the data at wuzhou gauging station is from the year 1962 to 2008 as shown in table 1 a schematic of pearl river basin and wuzhou gauging station is shown in fig 3 4 2 daily streamflow simulation using the proposed method in order to obtain the joint probability distribution of the three variables q t q t 1 and q t 2 three bivariate copulas need to be established the parameters of the copula models can be derived based on the kendall tau coefficient τ q t q t 1 and pcc τ q t q t 2 q t 1 measured by the kendall tau method first since the daily streamflow series do not always follow the normal distribution the skewed distributions are used in hydrology including the exponential exp generalized extreme value gev generalized logistic glo generalized pareto gpa generalized normal gno gumbel normal pearson type iii p iii wakeby and weibull distributions huang et al 2018a b chen et al 2015a b the l moment method was used to estimate the parameters of the marginal distributions of flow series the performance of the 10 marginal distributions was estimated based on the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic the mean values of rmse and aic for 365 days were calculated as given in table 2 it can be seen from table 2 that the mean rmse and aic values corresponding to p iii distribution are the smallest the smallest values in bold in table 2 therefore the p iii distribution was selected as the marginal distribution for daily streamflow series second daily streamflow was simulated using the trivariate copula method the trivariate copula was created by three bivariate copulas and the conditional probability distributions the performance of the selected gumbel copula and other copulas frank copula and clayton copula were compared first the gumbel frank and clayton copulas were used to build trivariate joint distributions the 365 root mean square error rmse values between empirical and theoretical probabilities were computed the mean rmse values of 365 days for each station were computed as given in table 3 it can be seen from table 3 that the results obtained by different copulas show little difference however the mean values corresponding to the gumbel copula is smaller than those of other copulas therefore the gumbel copula was used to generate daily streamflow data in this study consider streamflow at yichang gauging station as an example 200 sets of streamflow with a length of 138 years were simulated basic statistics were calculated to evaluate the performance of the proposed model which included mean value standard deviation sd and skewness cs the mean values of the 200 samples in terms of the basic statistics of the simulated and observed data on each day are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the simulated values fitted the observed values well in addition relative errors res between the simulated and observed values of these basic statistics were calculated as given in table 4 which shows that the mean res between the simulated and observed data corresponding to the mean daily streamflow sd and cs were 0 085 0 27 and 0 00 respectively it demonstrates that the proposed method for daily streamflow simulation performed well in addition daily streamflow simulation at other gauging stations including the gaochang pingshan beibei lijiawan and wulong stations on the upper yangtze river and wuzhou station on the pearl river was carried out the curves of observed and simulated basic statistics corresponding to the mean value sd and cs are shown in fig 4 which demonstrates that the proposed method preserved the statistical characteristics of the streamflow series the mean relative errors res of the basic statistics including mean flow standard deviation sd and coefficient of skewness cs between observed and simulated daily streamflows for seven gauging stations were calculated as given in table 4 it can be seen from table 4 that the maximum res of mean flow sd and cs were 0 59 0 46 and 1 12 respectively which were less than 1 5 therefore it is concluded that the proposed method performed well in preserving the basic statistics of observed flow at the seven gauging stations boxplots were also used to compare the basic statistics of simulated and observed daily streamflow data the performance was judged to be good when a statistic fell within the boxplot hao and singh 2013 lee and salas 2011 the box plots of basic statistics mean value sd and cs of the observed and simulated values are shown in fig 5 the simulation statistics fell within the box plots for most of the days 4 3 comparison with other stochastic simulation methods for comparing the proposed method with the traditional daily streamflow simulation methods the seasonal autoregressive sar model and copula based daily streamflow simulation method were carried out in which the order of the sar model was 2 and bivariate copula based method considered only lag 1 autocorrelation 4 3 1 comparison with the sar method box and jenkins 1994 proposed the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average sar method for time series analysis detailed information on how to carry out daily streamflow simulation using the sar method can be found in awass 2009 the akaike information criterion aic proposed by akaike 1974 was used to determine the order of the model which aims to minimize the following aic function 19 aic p n ln σ ε 2 2 p where n is the length of the observed streamflow series σ ε 2 is the variance of the residuals and p is the order of the sar model for the seven stations used in this paper the order of the sar model order was determined using the aic criterion the mean aic values for sar 1 sar 2 sar 3 and sar 4 models were calculated as given in table 5 which shows that the mean values of aic for each station are very close however the mean values of sar 2 were smaller than those of other sar models in particular for the pingshan and yichang stations the mean aic values of lag 2 autocorrelation were significantly smaller than those of others based on the aic criterion the sar 2 model was found to be the most appropriate model for stochastic streamflow simulation of observed streamflow series at the seven stations the mean values of relative errors res of basic statistics including mean flow standard deviation sd and coefficient of skewness cs of observed daily streamflow and simulated daily streamflows using sar 2 for the seven stations were calculated as given in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the performance of the proposed method was better than that of the sar method generally compared with the sar method the res of the mean value sd and cs calculated by the proposed method were much smaller the mean values in terms of the mean flow sd and cs calculated by the sar method were 0 71 2 35 and 4 21 and the mean values by the proposed method were 0 13 0 27 and 0 63 which demonstrates that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the sar method 4 3 2 comparison with stochastic method based on bivariate copula the stochastic method based on the bivariate copula with only 1 lag time was used for daily streamflow simulation the procedure of how to carry out daily streamflow simulation using copula based method considering lag 1 time is as follows 1 fit the marginal distribution of qt and qt 1 based on the p iii distribution ut f qt ut 1 f qt 1 2 build the bivariate joint distribution between qt and qt 1 based on bivariate copula namely f qt qt 1 c ut ut 1 then the parameters of copula were estimated by the kendall tau method 3 as qt 1 is known ut 1 can be computed then a uniform random number ε is generated and is assign to c ut ut 1 thus the value of ut can be calculated based on the inverse function c 1 ut ut 1 4 the daily streamflow qt can be calculated from the inverse function f 1 qt note that the streamflow of the first day q 1 is obtained from the marginal distribution f 1 q 1 more details can be found in lee and salas 2008 2011 the mean values of relative errors res of basic statistics such as mean flow standard deviation sd and coefficient of skewness cs of observed daily streamflow and simulated daily streamflows using the copula based method considering 1 lag time for the seven stations were calculated as given in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the bivariate copula based method generally compared with the bivariate copula based method the res of the mean value sd and cs calculated by the proposed method were much smaller the mean values in terms of the mean flow sd and cs calculated by the bivariate copula based method were 0 23 0 75 and 1 37 respectively and the mean values by the proposed method were 0 13 0 27 and 0 63 respectively which demonstrates that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the bivariate copula based method in addition it can be seen from fig 4 that the simulated values based on the proposed method were closer to the observed values which also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method 5 conclusions this paper proposed a copula based method for daily streamflow simulation the advantages of the proposed method are that a compared with the current copula based method it considers lag 2 autocorrelation b the conditional copula is used to build high dimensional copulas which makes the calculation work much easier c it can be used for daily streamflow simulation because of the simplified model structure and effective parameter estimation method seven gauging stations in the upper yangzte river and pearl river basins in china were selected as case studies the proposed method was also compared with the 2 order seasonal autoregressive model and the bivariate copula based model considering lag 1 autocorrelation the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 the proposed copula based method considering lag 2 correlations preserves the statistical characteristics of the observed streamflow data these statistics include mean daily streamflow standard deviation and coefficient of skewness for all the gauging stations mentioned in this study the maximum relative errors corresponding to the mean value sd and cs were 0 59 0 46 and 1 12 respectively from this point of view the proposed method performs well 2 the proposed method was compared with two currently used streamflow simulation methods the simulated results for the seven gauging stations demonstrated that the proposed method was better than the 2 order seasonal autocorrelation model and copula based model considering lag 1 autocorrelation 3 the proposed method provides a new way for daily streamflow stochastic simulation which is more accurate and simpler than the currently used methods in this study only the lag 2 autocorrelation was considered may be in certain river basins the lag 3 autocorrelation may still be needed in the future work a more general method for higher order daily streamflow simulation will be investigated second in this study only two river basins with 7 gauging stations were taken as case studies to test the proposed method more gauging stations will be tested in the future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

6122,most karst aquifers are characterized as a dual flow system comprised of a highly conductive conduit network embedded in a low porosity matrix the conduits are hydraulically connected to the matrix and behave either as a drain or a source depending on the recharge conditions simplified physically based models are herein employed to simulate the spring outflow for such aquifer systems the processes consist of a free surface flow in the conduit that is interacting laterally with a laminar groundwater flow in the surrounding matrix the conduit is subject to a concentrated recharge at its upstream end while the groundwater aquifer is subject to a diffuse recharge over its contributing surface area the flow system is described by a coupled system of partial differential equations the conduit flow is approximated by the kinematic wave equation and the groundwater flow by the linearized boussinesq equation the governing equations are solved using the laplace transform method after an appropriate linearization of the nonlinear coefficient the derived spring discharge models are a function of three dimensionless parameters the time lag parameter ξ the lumped conduit parameter λ and the aquifer parameter η the simulation results highlight the contrast between pressure driven and gravity driven flows and the importance of the conduit matrix interaction on the response of the karst system application of the models on real karst aquifers demonstrates their effectiveness in simulating the observed spring hydrograph using lumped physical parameters of the karst system keywords karst hydrology aquifer characterization spring hydrograph conduit matrix interaction free surface flow mathematical modeling karst water resources karst conduit hydraulic processes dual hydraulic model inverse modeling analytical models laplace transform method kernel functions transfer functions convolution integral 1 introduction karst aquifers are highly heterogeneous and anisotropic systems consisting of an underground conduit network embedded in a low permeability matrix karst springs respond rapidly to intense storms and represent a combined response of flow through fractures pores and conduits the flow reaches the conduit and ultimately the karst spring from concentrated and diffuse aquifer recharge events the concentrated recharge originates from sinking streams and sinkholes and is applied at localized points along the conduit the diffuse recharge represents dispersed infiltration over the aquifer surrounding the conduit that acts as a drain depending on the prevailing hydraulic conditions the conduit flow can be laminar or turbulent pressurized full pipe flow or non pressurized free surface flow as observed by raeisi et al 2007 therefore modeling of flow in karst aquifers requires the combination of both surface water and groundwater hydraulics concepts there are numerous models that simulate the spring response to recharge events most of the models are lumped transfer functions or reservoir models since they are easier to apply and require limited input data when compared to physically based distributed models among the physically based models that were developed for karst systems pipe flow processes are predominant e g modflow cfp shoemaker et al 2008 flow in partially filled karst conduits has recently gained importance since the flow can change from a pressurized flow regime to a free surface flow regime depending on the recharge conditions as per field observations raeisi et al 2007 prelovsek et al 2008 distributive models that account for free surface flow conditions have been developed by reimann et al 2011 and de rooij et al 2013 other models such as the storm water management model swmm that features open channel flow concepts were also applied to simulate a karst system response e g campbell and sullivan 2002 peterson and wicks 2006 chen and goldscheider 2014 although lumped models have been widely used to characterize karst aquifers their parameters have limited physical representation on the other hand distributive models are difficult to apply due to their extensive data demand furthermore they are computationally expensive sensitive to the spatial discretization at the interface and thus challenging to use in inverse problems in the present study a simplified physically based model is presented in which the flow domain geometry consists of a simple doline conduit matrix system that has been adopted in numerous karst studies birk et al 2006 chang et al 2015 luhmann et al 2012 reimann et al 2011 the model relies on mechanistic laws and is function of lumped physical parameters that are directly related to the hydraulic and geometric properties of the conduit and aquifer the basic flow concept is similar to the one underlying hybrid discrete continuum models e g modflow cfp using the simplest representation while preserving the basic flow components of the system a few analytic models exist for karst aquifers cornaton and perrochet 2002 used the dual porosity concept for a matrix system to derive an analytical solution that simulates the hydraulic response of karst aquifers while loper and eltayeb 2010 used the hybrid discrete continuum model to investigate the propagation of waves in a pressurized karst conduit embedded in a matrix criss and winston 2003 used darcy s law and the diffusion equation to develop a model in terms of a single fitting parameter that simulated the spring hydrograph of karst springs the conduit matrix system is also hydraulically analogous to the river aquifer interaction problem however the flow processes that are taken into consideration and the governing equations used to model such processes are largely different most river aquifer interaction studies assume that the mathematical problem is decoupled while those few studies that deal with the stream aquifer interaction as a coupled problem use the empirical muskingum method for river routing rather than the theoretical saint venant equation the one exception is the analytical work by hunt 1990 that employs the same governing equations as in the present study but neglects the effect of the groundwater recharge on the river outflow as it was not relevant to his study of bank storage during floods the present model consists of a one dimensional conduit embedded in a two dimensional matrix domain the conduit is subject to a concentrated recharge at an upstream location while a diffuse recharge distribution is applied uniformly over the flow domain the conduit and the surrounding matrix exchange flow at their common interface under various flow conditions the exchange flow is properly evaluated by satisfying the continuity of the head and flux at the interface and this flow interaction is an intrinsic component of the model the flow processes are mathematically described by a coupled system of partial differential equations the kinematic wave approximation for the free surface flow in the conduit and the boussinesq equation for the unconfined groundwater flow in the matrix the governing differential equations are linearized to obtain analytical spring discharge expressions using the laplace transform method the model structure and domain geometry are thus similar to the ones introduced in basha and zoghbi 2018 while the flow conditions in the conduit are different gravity driven vs pressure driven the previous investigation dealt with pressurized flow in conduits whereby different hydraulic processes and associated governing equations were used pressure driven flows are steady and generate instantaneous responses while gravity driven flows are non steady and produce delayed responses the aim of the present work is to develop flow models to simulate the hydrograph of a typical karst spring given that a predominant free surface flow regime exists in the conduit throughout the simulation period the study highlights the contrast between the instantaneous response of a pressurized flow system and the delayed response of a free surface flow system and applies the derived discharge expressions to real karst systems to demonstrate their effectiveness in simulating the observed spring hydrographs using two or three parameters 2 theoretical framework 2 1 model setup this study considers a single conduit of length l located within an aquifer spanning a width w on each side of the conduit the conduit receives a concentrated recharge q b at its upstream end and the aquifer is subject to a diffuse recharge r applied uniformly over the recharge domain w r w the model domain is two dimensional in space with the conduit flow along the downslope x direction and the aquifer flow along the perpendicular y direction however the flow in the conduit and aquifer are both considered to be one dimensional the conduit acts as a source or a sink for the matrix depending on the flow conditions and the flow exchange between the conduit and the aquifer occurs at their common interface y 0 the spring is set to be at the base level of the carbonate formation and the connected conduit is assumed to be inclined at a uniform slope the spring is the principal discharge outlet of the karst aquifer and the outflow q is the spring hydrograph that is commonly measured the top and cross sectional view of the coupled conduit aquifer flow system is illustrated in fig 1 in contrast to the pressurized conditions basha and zoghbi 2018 fig 1c the top elevation of the conduit is situated above the water table level 2 2 flow processes the flow processes in the conduit matrix system is composed of non steady open channel flow in the subterranean conduit and unconfined groundwater flow in the adjoining matrix 2 3 channel flow one dimensional unsteady open channel flow is governed by the saint venant equations that consist of the continuity and momentum equations the continuity equation gives 1 a t q x 2 q 0 where a is the cross sectional area of the flow l2 q is the flow rate l3 t x is the longitudinal coordinate downslope along the channel l t is the time t and q is the rate of lateral outflow positive or inflow negative per unit length of channel on each side l2 t the subscript denotes that the variables are dimensional one approximation of the momentum equation consists of neglecting the inertia terms and setting the friction slope s f equal to the channel bed slope s o 2 s f s o this simplification is known as the kinematic wave approximation it implies that the downstream boundary conditions do not affect the flow condition upstream the relationship between the flow rate and friction slope is given by chezy s equation 3 q a c r s f where c l1 2 t is the chezy coefficient that can be related to the darcy weisbach friction factor through c 8 g f the flow area for a rectangular conduit is a b h c where b is the width and h c is the flow height the hydraulic radius r a p is the ratio of the flow area over the wetted perimeter p for a flow width b larger than the flow depth h c the hydraulic radius simplifies to r h c the equation of the flow rate becomes 4 q k c b h c m k c c s o m 3 2 where k c is the conduit conveyance factor that is dependent on the roughness and the channel s bed slope it should be noted that the head is defined with respect to the channel bottom therefore h c is the hydraulic head in the conduit as well as the flow depth in case manning s discharge equation is used for q the resulting flow rate equation is similar in form to 4 but with a different exponent m 5 3 and conveyance factor k c s 0 n where n is the manning coefficient the relationship between chezy s and manning s equation is given by c r 1 6 n jain 2001 2 3 1 matrix flow the variation of the water table in the porous matrix h a is governed by the boussinesq equation for non steady unconfined groundwater flow 5 φ h a t y k s h a h a y r here h a is the height of the water table measured from the base of the conduit y is the horizontal lateral coordinate l φ is the effective or drainable porosity k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t and r is the recharge distribution l t eq 5 is mildly nonlinear for gradual variation of the water table profile a common approach to linearize it is to assume that the coefficient h a in the diffusion term is equal to the mean depth of flow in the aquifer h m and thereby define the product κ k s h m as the constant aquifer transmissivity one should note that the water table elevation in the karst aquifer has to be below the top of the conduit to ensure free surface flow conditions in the conduit it is also implicitly assumed that the water table is uniformly inclined along the conduit direction since the local heads in the matrix are defined with respect to the conduit bottom 2 3 2 exchange flow the exchange flow q at the interface of the conduit and the surrounding matrix is given by darcy s law with a constant transmissivity formulation 6 q κ h a y at the interface y 0 the water surface in the channel and matrix are joined and the heads in the conduit and aquifer are equal h c x t h a 0 t the interface condition couples the conduit with the matrix flow problem and implies that no seepage face exists at the conduit matrix interface the problem of seepage face can only be handled by a numerical model defined over a two dimensional vertical domain to determine the location of the seepage face and evaluate the exchange flow a common approximation is to introduce a correction factor to the one dimensional flux eq 6 that produces the same output as the two dimensional solution however such an approach will not change the structure of the derived solution it will only lead to a different quantification of the proportionality constant in 6 the exchange flow between the conduit and matrix is therefore evaluated by satisfying the continuity of the head and flux at the interface this is in contrast to the barenblatt formulation barenblatt et al 1960 that is simply a first order numerical approximation of darcy s law whereby the interface height nodal spacing and hydraulic conductivity are lumped together in a parameter defined as the exchange coefficient it expresses the exchange flow in terms of the head difference between the conduit and matrix times the above defined exchange coefficient nevertheless the exchange flow in both approaches is represented by a similar linear relationship e g eq 6 and differ only in the formulation and estimation of the flow exchange parameter 2 3 3 recharge although various models exist for the estimation of the groundwater recharge in karst aquifers e g hartmann et al 2013 a simple infiltration model which is based on the phi index method chow et al 1988 is herein used to estimate the recharge from the rainfall distribution the infiltration module is a function of an initial abstraction amount a i l plus a constant abstraction rate a c l t and a travel time parameter t r t the initial abstraction parameter a i accounts for the surface depression storage while the constant abstraction parameter a c represents the interception root uptake evaporation rate for small rainfall events or surface runoff rate for large rainfall events the time of travel t r parameter is to account for the translation of the rainfall pulse from the soil surface to the groundwater the recharge is mathematically expressed by 7 r t r e t t r r e i e a c u i e a c where i e is the effective rainfall intensity l t over a duration δ t defined by 8 i e δ i δ t i p c a i u p c a i here p c δ p is the cumulative precipitation l and u z is the unit step function u z 0 for z 0 and u z 1 for z 0 to ensure non negative values the recharge is considered to be uniformly distributed in space and varying in time in a stepwise constant fashion the recharge flow is obtained by multiplying the recharge rate r by the recharge area μ r 2 l r w r for diffuse recharge or by the capture area of the sinkholes ν for concentrated recharge due to its simplicity the above recharge model has significantly fewer parameters than existing models and provide an adequate representation of the recharge distribution especially in relatively small karst catchments where spatial variability of recharge is not significant 2 4 governing equations the governing equation for the combined conduit matrix flow is a coupled system of differential equations the coupling is achieved through the boundary condition at the interface h c x t h a 0 t that affects the head distribution in the matrix h a eq 5 and the exchange flow at the interface q eq 6 moreover the flow q is directly related to the exchange flow term q eq 1 and the head distribution in the conduit h c eq 4 to simplify the notation and generalize the results the governing equations are first expressed in dimensionless form using the following definitions 9 h h x x y y b b l o t t t o u o l o t o q o u o l o 2 and 10 k s k r r u o q q u o l o q q q o where l o and t o are the characteristic length and time while u o and q o are the characteristic velocity and discharge the parameter l o can be set equal to the length l or height of the conduit d and the parameter t o can be set equal to the measured recharge period or flow duration alternatively one can set q o and t o equal to some reference values e g 1 m3 s and 1 day respectively one should stress that for consistency one must define only two dimensionless variables and deduce the other two using eq 9 the groundwater flow equation in dimensionless form becomes 11 φ h a t κ 2 h a y 2 r where κ κ u o l o is the dimensionless transmissivity the dimensionless flow rate in the channel is 12 q b k c h c m k c k c l o m 1 q o eq 1 becomes 13 h c t m k c h c m 1 h c x 2 κ b d h a dy y 0 eq 13 is nonlinear in its present form due to the presence of the nonlinear coefficient m k c h c m 1 which is a measure of the wave celerity i e the transmission speed of any disturbance in the system defining a representative wave celerity c s k c where s m h m m 1 is the scaling parameter to be subsequently estimated in an optimal fashion one can obtain a linearized version of 13 14 h c t c h c x 2 κ b d h a dy y 0 the corresponding linearized flow rate is then 15 q c b h c 2 4 1 initial conditions the equilibrium initial condition in the unconfined aquifer of width w is given by 16 h ia x y h ic x r i κ w y 2 y where h ic is the corresponding initial head distribution in the conduit expressed by 17 h ic x h 0 2 q i cb x eqs 16 and 17 are derived from the steady version of eqs 11 and 14 respectively whereby h 0 is the head at the inlet section that corresponds to the steady initial flow q 0 in the conduit cf eq 15 and q i is the steady exchange flux at the matrix conduit interface that results from the steady diffuse recharge r i over the recharge zone wl the relationship between q i and r i is q i w r i 2 4 2 boundary conditions in the conduit domain for a prescribed concentrated recharge at the inlet section of the conduit q b the corresponding boundary condition is 18 h c q b cb x 0 for a concentrated recharge obtained from the rainfall distribution using the infiltration module q b t ν r t where the recharge r is defined in a stepwise constant variation in terms of the unit step function u t 19 r t r 1 u t t 0 r 2 r 1 u t t 1 r n r n 1 u t t n 1 for a piecewise linear variation of the concentrated recharge q b is expressed by 20 q b t q 1 u t t 0 q 2 q 1 u t t 1 q n q n 1 u t t n 1 here q k with k 1 2 n is a linear function of time defined over the interval t k 1 t t k as 21 q k a k t t k 1 υ k 1 a k υ k υ k 1 t k t k 1 where υ k is the flow value at time t k and υ 0 is the initial flow q 0 at time t 0 2 4 3 boundary conditions in the matrix domain the boundary conditions in the unconfined aquifer are expressed by 22 h a h c t y 0 23 h a y 0 y w eq 22 accounts for the varying head in the conduit and eq 23 expresses the no flux boundary condition at a water divide or fault section at the far end of the aquifer 2 5 optimal coefficient the governing set of equations was linearized through the introduction of an appropriate coefficient c s k c where s m h m m 1 m q m k c b 1 1 m is the scaling parameter defined in terms of the mean depth h m or the mean flow rate q m using the method of weighted residuals ames 1965 the scaling parameter s is estimated in an optimum fashion for a given time

upstream boundary the linearized wave celerity parameter is then c m k c 1 m b 1 m 1 q m 1 1 m the time limits of the integrals 25 and 26 should capture any large variation in the discharge an appropriate selection of the upper limit t is twice the time of rise of the spring hydrograph so that the time interval is centered on the time to peak t p the above expressions are also function of the outflow q d that might not be available a good first approximation is to assume a mean height h m or flow q m and evaluate c directly to generate the downstream discharge q d once q d is available one can repeat the process of updating q m using 25 or 26 in an iterative fashion until convergence is achieved within three to four iterations eq 25 turns out to be the most useful for all flow conditions while eq 26 provides a slightly more accurate result for diffuse recharge events 3 karst flow models the laplace transform method is herein employed to derive the models for various flow conditions from the coupled system of eqs 11 and 14 three models are presented below model kwb is for a bounded aquifer model kwu is for aquifers of unlimited extent and model kwg is for the general case of partial recharge area in a finite flow domain l r l w r w all models generate the spring response for a concentrated recharge at the upstream end of the conduit and for a diffuse recharge over a defined aquifer domain the laplace transforms of h is defined by 27 h l h 0 h exp p t d t where p is the laplace parameter and laplace transformed variables are hereafter denoted by an overbar the laplace transforms of eqs 11 and 14 are 28 1 ρ 2 d 2 h a d y 2 p h a h ia r φ 29 c d h c dx p h c h ic ς d h a dy y 0 where r l r is the laplace transform of the recharge function and 30 ρ 2 φ κ ς 2 κ

eq 31 describes the water table profile in the aquifer in terms of the laplace parameter p the exchange flux on each side of the conduit is obtained from the derivative of 31 at y 0 32 q κ d h a dy y

outflow from a conduit embedded in a bounded karst aquifer over which a uniform recharge over the whole flow domain is applied it is expressed in terms of the concentrated recharge q b the diffuse recharge q r and the antecedent flow conditions in the conduit q 0 and in the aquifer q i eq 36 is hereafter designated as the spring discharge model kwb for a wide aquifer with the recharge applied over a predefined semi width w the resulting outflow expression can be derived from the solution of the coupled system 28 29 using the boundary condition 23 at y rather than at y w the final result

as the function argument 40 is simpler than 33 of the kwb model cf appendix a an extension of the above model to a branched system of subterranean conduits is also outlined in appendix a the above two flow models were derived under the assumption that the recharge occurs over an area delimited by the length of the conduit l and the width w on each side of the conduit for the general case of a partial contributing recharge area i e r r t u l r x u w r y where l r l and w r w are the horizontal and lateral dimensions of the recharge zone the discharge equation can be derived in a similar fashion using slightly different form of the initial conditions 16 17 to account for the piecewise recharge zone the discharge at any location l r x l is given by 41 q μ r r i q 0 q b q 0 exp ψ x 2 w

partial recharge zone for x l r l and w r w eq 41 reduces to the equation of the discharge for a full recharge zone i e the kwb model 36 the kwu model 39 can also be derived from eq 41 by taking the limit w followed by setting x l r l and w r w in the end result one should note that the recharge area is assumed to be the same in both the antecedent and the current conditions and the flow exchange occurs over the whole length of the conduit 4 spring response analysis there are three models 36 39 and 41 for simulating the free surface outflow of a spring depending on the extent of the aquifer whether bounded or unbounded and the recharge zone whether full or partial the models can handle concentrated q b and diffuse recharge events q r as well as the antecedent equilibrium flow conditions q 0 and q i although the primary focus of this study is the simulation of spring discharge the models also allow the evaluation of the hydraulic head distribution in the conduit 35 and of the water table in the aquifer 31 furthermore they can also quantify the flow interaction at the conduit matrix interface 32 and simulate its fluctuation and flow reversal as a flood event passes through the conduit such an analysis was previously conducted in a pressurized conduit system basha and zoghbi 2018 fig 4 to highlight the rise and fall of the hydraulic heads during a flood event as well as the exchange flow reversal when the flood recedes the evaluation of the laplace based models in the real time domain is carried out using the laplace numerical inversion algorithm based on fourier series expansion as formulated by crump 1976 modified by de hoog et al 1982 and implemented by hollenbeck 1998 within the matlab environment the numerical inversions are corroborated against the exact analytical solutions for the kwu model cf appendix a 4 1 numerical validation the linearized analytical models are first compared with the fully nonlinear numerical solution in order to assess the effectiveness of the optimal coefficient approach in producing the nonlinear discharge rate as generated by eq 12 using the linearized version of the flow rate 15 the numerical solution of the nonlinear system of equations is obtained using the maccormack numerical scheme for the free surface flow in the conduit and the crank nicholson scheme for the groundwater flow hoffman 2001 the resulting finite difference equations are in a tri diagonal form that can be solved efficiently using the thomas algorithm the grid distribution is uniform in the conduit section and non uniform in the matrix flow directions the accurate evaluation of the exchange flux necessitates the prescription of very fine grid spacing near the interface δ y 0 02 that is progressively increased to a maximum of 5 δ y as one moves away from the interface boundary the grid spacing in the conduit is uniform and set equal to δ x l 40 and a small time step δ t δ x k c is employed to satisfy the courant condition and ensure convergence the solution process consists first of solving for the head distribution in the matrix to evaluate the exchange flux at the interface and thus compute the head distribution in the conduit using the revised head at the conduit matrix interface updated values of the head in the matrix are generated and the exchange flow at the interface is recalculated the convergence of this iterative process within each time step is further accelerated using the successive over relaxation technique the two stage solving process is then repeated at each time step using the new boundary condition of the conduit and the updated head condition at the conduit matrix interface the output of the nonlinear numerical model is shown in figs 2 3 alongside all the curves that were generated with the linearized analytical models the analytical model performance is evaluated statistically using the root mean squared error and the nash sutcliffe measure of goodness of fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 the root mean squared error rmse between the numerical and analytical solutions ranged from as low as 0 000768 model kwu in fig 2 to as high as 0 0386 model kwb in fig 3 while the nash sutcliff efficiency nse parameter ranged from 0 972 to 0 996 for the generated spring hydrographs given the close agreement between the analytical and the numerical solutions one concludes that the present linear models conserve the effect of the conduit nonlinearity and are able to reproduce with very good accuracy the response of the more complex nonlinear model one key advantage of the analytical models is their speed and efficiency since they produce the complete spring hydrograph in a single evaluation sweep in a fraction of the time used by the numerical model this is particularly useful in the context of parameter estimation whereby the spring discharge is being evaluated for hundreds of trial values of the physical parameters 4 2 conduit matrix interaction to investigate the influence of the conduit matrix interaction and the hydraulic parameters on the spring response a simplified two dimensional hypothetical karst catchment is used the scenario setup is similar to the one used by previous investigators e g birk et al 2006 reimann et al 2011 a single conduit of width b 0 016 and dimensionless length l 40 is embedded in a karst aquifer system of a dimensionless semi width w 4 for a dimensionless system defined by l o 60 m and t o 6 hrs or equivalently u o 10 m hr and q o 10 m3 s the corresponding conduit length and width are 2400 m and 0 96 m respectively while the total width of the flow domain is 480 m for a flow area 0 96 m wide by 0 5 m high in a rectangular conduit with a friction factor f of 0 2 equivalent to a chezy coefficient of 20 or to a manning roughness coefficient of 0 04 the conveyance factor k c is near 2 m1 2 s for a conduit slope of 1 the dimensionless conveyance factor of k c 5525 is then obtained from k c k c l o m 1 q o similarly the dimensionless transmissivity κ can be obtained from its dimensional counterpart using κ κ u o l o the dimensionless model parameters consist of the time lag parameter ξ the lumped conduit parameter λ and the aquifer parameter η the time lag parameter ξ is equal to the ratio of the conduit length l to the mean wave celerity c and provides an estimate of the time of transit the lumped conduit parameter λ is the product of the flow exchange parameter ε and the time lag parameter ξ the aquifer parameter η is function of the contributing zone of the aquifer w and inversely proportional to the hydraulic diffusivity κ φ for zero exchange at the interface ε 0 the upstream inflow pulse is routed to the outlet with a delay equal to the time lag ξ for small values of the flow exchange parameter ε the spring outflow can be considered to be representative of a conduit dominated flow regime for a conduit with a very large conveyance coefficient large values of k c or c the parameters ξ and λ are near zero that denote a matrix dominated flow regime in the spring outflow small values of η indicate limited aquifer extent and matrix storage that also imply a strong effect of the conduit hydraulic properties on the spring hydrograph it is important to note that ξ l c is in terms of the scaling parameter s m h m m 1 that modifies the original hydraulic parameters ξ l k c such that the linearized model produces the same output as the nonlinear one in the nonlinear numerical model the parameters have fixed values while in the linear models the parameters ξ and λ are varying with the mean depth h m or flow q m of the specific problem through the scaling parameter s 42 ξ ξ s ξ l k c λ ε ξ s λ fig 2 compares the spring response to a concentrated pulse recharge of dimensionless magnitude of 0 08 0 8 m3 s and spanning a dimensionless duration of 1 6 hrs injected at the upstream boundary of the conduit in the presence of a dimensionless background flow of 0 02 0 2 m3 s although the models can handle a triangular pulse or any piecewise linear variation of recharge a rectangular pulse was selected in order to accentuate the response features the kwb and kwu responses are generated from eqs 36 and 39 for q r q i 0 respectively for the selected values of the flow exchange parameter ε with ξ 0 0072 η 1 and b 0 016 the selected value of ξ corresponds to a conveyance factor k c of 2 m1 2 s for l 2400 m a value of η 1 was used for the kwb model in order to highlight the difference with the kwu model while the remaining parameter λ is directly obtained from λ ε ξ the scaling parameter s was obtained from 25 with t 2 t p also shown is the output of the model fb for pressure driven flow in the conduit basha and zoghbi 2018 eq 38 using the same input parameters except for the height of the water table that is set higher than the height of the conduit h a d model fb was selected for comparison purposes as it is based on similar boundary conditions as the kwb model fig 2 clearly shows that the kwb and kwu response is not instantaneous as in the response of the pressure driven conduit flow model fb the delay in the response is one of the primary characteristics of the free surface flow models and it is closely related to the value of the ξ parameter the early time response of the kwb and kwu models is also identical there is a larger damping of the peak with the kwu model than the kwb model due to the unbounded storage area available in the matrix that facilitates a larger exchange volume for large values of η 2 the kwb and kwu responses are almost indistinguishable thereby indicating that the spring hydrograph is independent of the lateral extent of the matrix domain for concentrated recharges a variation in the ε parameter assesses the influence of the flow exchange on the damping of the flow for ε 0 no exchange flow occurs and the model simulates the movement of an inflow pulse through the conduit and the delayed response at the outlet a higher value of ε implies a larger exchange of the conduit flow with the matrix and a larger reduction of the peak flow as expected the parameter ξ also affects the shape of the spring hydrograph as it is inversely proportional to the conduit conveyance k c a high ξ value implies a low conveyance factor k c due to a higher friction factor f or manning s roughness n for a low value of ξ the decline of the recession limb is fast while for the selected value of ξ the recession is slow and decreasing in a linear fashion the linear decrease of the recession limb has been observed in the field e g bailly comte et al 2010 fig 3 compares the spring response to a diffuse recharge of the gravity driven flow model kwb and kwu as well as the pressure driven flow model fb basha zoghbi 2018 eq 38 using the same model input parameters as for fig 2 the diffuse recharge event consists of a constant and uniform groundwater recharge rate of r 1 25 x 10 4 over the entire recharge domain 40 8 for a dimensionless duration of 2 this is equivalent to a diffuse recharge rate of 1 25 mm h over a period of 12 hrs although the flow domain is different for the kwb and kwu model the recharge area is the same the responses are generated from eqs 36 and 39 for q b q 0 q i 0 and they are normalized with respect to the maximum possible discharge of 0 04 for the kwb and kwu model and 0 02 for the fb model the scaling parameter s was obtained from 26 with t 2 t p as it handles better the spatial distribution of recharge as expected the free surface flow models kwb and kwu models yields a milder and delayed response than the pressure driven flow model fb the kwb model produces a larger response than the kwu model due to the ensuing rise in the water table that enhances the exchange with the conduit and the subsequent drainage to the spring outlet in the unbounded aquifer case kwu part of the recharge is directed by the prevailing gradient towards the outer boundary of the aquifer that limits the rise of the hydraulic head in the matrix the peak response and the water transfer are also larger for smaller values of η since the parameter η is inversely proportional to the hydraulic diffusivity κ φ for a fixed recharge width 5 models application the flow models are herein applied to three real karst systems the logsdon conduit located in kentucky raeisi et al 2007 the bluegrass spring in missouri criss and winston 2003 and the fertans spring in france charlier et al 2012 the first application pertains to a well monitored system with a strong evidence of free surface flows for flow rates smaller than 4 m3 s the bluegrass spring is a simple application of the kwu model and provides a simple mean to estimate the dominant parameter while the fertans example is an application for a multi peaked event with intermittent rainfall and low discharge values the model parameters ξ λ and η are estimated using the nonlinear least square method that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and simulated hydrographs the model performance is evaluated using the nash sutcliffe ns measure of goodness of fit in all of the above mentioned applications it is presumed that a single conduit is draining the karst system and the conduit is hydraulically connected to a porous or fissured matrix this is a plausible assumption in the absence of speleological information that can adequately describe the complexity of a karst system however one can apply any of the models repeatedly to connect several conduits in series or in parallel in case a dendritic system exists cf appendix a it should also be mentioned that the models presented herein assume a predominant free surface flow regime in the conduit with a free discharge conditions at the outlet in the present form the models cannot handle mixed flow regimes or the transition from pressurized to unpressurized flow conditions one must therefore ensure that the maximum spring discharge is below the conduit capacity as computed from eq 3 or alternatively the maximum flow depth is smaller than the conduit height when information on the conduit dimensions is not readily available the magnitude of the maximum discharge might provide an indication on whether the flow is predominantly pressure driven or gravity driven in addition the kinematic wave simplification implies that the flow in the conduit is not affected by the flow conditions at the downstream end such as a water pond at the spring outlet that would hinder the outflow furthermore the derived models are event based models that are better fit for a single storm or isolated event they are not suitable for long term simulations in their current form however they can be linked to other modules that account for evaporation and vadose zone processes to form a large scale hydrological model finally the model parameters consist of lumped physical parameters of the karst system the actual physical parameters of the conduit and matrix can be determined from the model parameters only if sufficient information on the karst system is separately available such as the length of the conduit l and the extent of the aquifer or recharge zone w although the application examples below show that the models can replicate the behavior of the karst system the physical attributes of the system cannot be specified due to the limited information available nonetheless one can still make an inference on the hydraulic functioning of a karst system from the success of a particular model 5 1 logsdon kentucky the logsdon river is located within the mammoth cave system in south central kentucky and is considered to be one of the major underground streams during large storms the flow enters the logsdon river through sinkholes and sinking streams depending on the flood magnitude and the stage height the flow in the conduit is either pressure driven full pipe flow or gravity driven free surface flow the spring hydrograph selected for modeling is the storm of may 2008 that falls in the group of open channel flow as categorized by raeisi et al 2007 the data was extracted from the thesis of schenck brown 2008 appendices a and b fig 4 shows the observed spring hydrograph and the simulated one using the kwb model although the karst system might be subject to both concentrated and diffuse recharge a concentrated recharge inflow was simulated eq 36 with q r q i 0 as it provided a better fit than the one for a diffuse recharge the concentrated recharge inflow was obtained from the measured rainfall distribution using the infiltration module with an initial abstraction of 2 cm and a constant abstraction of 0 21 cm hr over an effective recharge area of 10 km2 the time of travel t r in the infiltration module was set equal to zero as it is assumed to be small for concentrated recharge in sinking streams a constant baseflow equal to the observed value of 0 12 m3 s was assumed in the simulation the nonlinear least squares method yielded the following fitted parameters λ 0 78 η 2 2 and ξ 0 067 in addition to the fitted parameters of the infiltration module for the above estimated parameters the nash sutcliffe efficiency number is ns 0 9977 and the root mean squared error is rmse 0 0442 the equivalent dimensional values of the model parameters can be determined from λ λ t o η η t o and ξ ξ t o where t o 1 day the conversion to the actual hydraulic parameters ξ and λ of the flow system can be obtained from 42 given that no additional information is available on the karst system one cannot determine the individual hydraulic parameters of the aquifer or conduit however one can infer from the fitted value of η that the aquifer is limited in extent by a fault or a no flow boundary a similar conclusion was reached for another logsdon event during which the conduit was flowing under pressurized conditions basha and zoghbi 2018 a preliminary estimate of the model parameters can be derived from the simple response model kwu ir pertaining to an impulse recharge a2 the response to an impulse of volume v 1 at time t 1 is given by eq a2 with t ξ replaced by t ξ t 1 and scaled up by a factor equal to v 1 the expressions for the time to peak and the peak outflow can then be derived from the scaled response function to yield 43 t p t 1 ξ λ 2 6 q p 3 6 π e 3 2 λ 2 v 1 eq 43 can be used to obtain a preliminary estimate of the parameters λ and the merged time lag parameter t 1 ξ from the measured values of t p q p and the effective recharge volume v 1 after baseflow separation the third parameter η can be obtained by matching the moments of the analytical model with the moments of the observed spring hydrograph the moments are obtained from the laplace solution 36 for an idealized sudden injection using the moment generating function 44 m k 1 k d k q d p k p 0 using 36 with q b 1 and q r q 0 q i 0 the moments are derived from 44 in terms of the model parameters to obtain 45 m 1 m 0 λ η ξ assuming ξ 0 one can solve for η m 1 m 0 λ whereby the moments of the observed outflow are computed numerically from 46 m k 0 t k q d t using the above approximate expressions one can obtain a close estimate of the model parameters the measured spring hydrograph has a peak flow q p of 3 68 m3 s at a time of peak t p of 0 875 days from an arbitrarily set reference time zero and the effective recharge volume v 1 is equal to 0 1675 106 m3 using 43 one gets λ 0 70 day1 2 and t 1 ξ 0 79 days assuming that the time application of the recharge impulse t 1 is at the end of the peak rainfall intensity one reads t 1 0 71 and the time lag parameter is then ξ 0 085 days for λ 0 70 and m 1 m 0 1 24 eq 45 yields η 1 78 day1 2 the difference between the preliminary and the final estimates of the parameters is close to 10 for λ 12 for ξ and 20 for η noting that the latter parameter has the least influence on the output for a concentrated recharge case the simulated hydrograph of the simple kwu ir model a2 using the above estimates of λ and t 1 ξ is displayed in fig 4 as expected the hydrograph captures the peak since the model parameters are estimated from the peak expressions 43 the nash sutcliffe efficiency number for this simple fit is ns 0 788 and the root mean squared error is rmse 0 421 a better fit of an observed hydrograph by the kwu ir model can be obtained if the recharge occurs over a shorter period of time as shown in the next application example 5 2 bluegrass spring missouri the bluegrass spring is located in east central missouri usa in an area that has extensive karst features including losing streams and sinkholes the surficial recharge area is approximately 0 8 km2 and has no runoff features the discharge data selected for modeling is the storm of february 2001 that was extracted from the publication of criss and winston 2003 fig 1 fig 5 compares the measured spring hydrograph with the simulated one using the kwu model 39 as it provided a better fit ns 0 9960 rmse 0 003 thereby indicating the negligible influence of the matrix boundaries on the discharge the nonlinear least squares method yielded the following fitted parameters λ 1 14 day1 2 and ξ 0 14 days the concentrated recharge input was derived from the measured rainfall distribution using the infiltration module with an effective recharge area of 0 6 km2 an initial abstraction of 2 9 cm from a total of 7 4 cm of rainfall and a negligible constant abstraction a c 0 the time of travel parameter t r in the infiltration module was set equal to zero in effect the influence of the t r parameter cannot be separated from the effect of the time lag parameter ξ in the fitting exercise unless additional information on the study area are available that will help discern the value range of each the concentrated recharge case of the kwu model is a function of two model parameters ξ and λ that can be effectively estimated from 43 for the observed peak flow of 0 195 m3 s at a time of peak of 2 15 days from an arbitrarily set reference time zero and a total volume of discharge of 20475 m3 after baseflow separation of q 0 0 0047 m3 s one gets λ 1 06 day1 2 and t 1 ξ 1 97 days setting the time of injection as the time of peak rainfall intensity t 1 1 79 one finds ξ 0 18 days the simulated spring hydrograph using the simple kwu ir model a2 with these preliminary estimates is shown in fig 5 a good fit is obtained ns 0 866 rmse 0 0173 as the recharge distribution is quite close to an impulse form as little information is available about the geometric properties of the conduit and aquifer in the bluegrass karst system one cannot determine the hydraulic parameters of the karst system that are embedded in the lumped model parameters ξ and λ criss and winston 2003 derived an equation similar in form to equation a2 using the linear diffusion equation for groundwater flow subject to an instantaneous planar source the resulting discharge equation is then normalized to the peak flow in order to reduce the number of parameters to one single parameter named the time constant b which is herein equivalent to the parameter λ 2 4 the time constant b is a fitting parameter that is inversely proportional to the hydraulic diffusivity of the aquifer while the lumped conduit parameter λ is herein related to the conduit s length and width conveyance coefficient k c the exchange coefficient ς as well as the inverse of the hydraulic diffusivity ρ 5 3 fertans spring france the fertans spring is located in a small karst system in the french jura mountains where karstification is considered to be relatively high in the zone the recharge area is small with highly permeable formations and it varied largely between low and high water periods as noted by charlier et al 2012 the selected event for modeling is the smallest flow event may 2010 in order to ensure open channel flow conditions in the spring system it has a rainfall depth of 20 8 mm a maximum rainfall intensity of 3 2 mm h and a peak flow of 0 6 l s the rainfall and spring data were extracted from fig 10 in charlier et al 2012 although a continuous distribution of rainfall is shown therein an hourly rainfall distribution was used since the rainfall data were originally collected at a time step of 1 h fig 6 is a plot of the measured spring hydrograph and the simulated one using the concentrated recharge component of the kwu model although the kwb model performed equally well the kwu model was chosen as it is simpler in form a concentrated recharge inflow was also selected in agreement with the findings of charlier et al 2012 that the contribution of the diffuse infiltration is smaller than the fast infiltration component the localized recharge input was derived from the measured rainfall distribution using the infiltration module with an estimated rainfall capture area of 2000 m2 an initial abstraction of 5 mm and a constant abstraction of nearly 0 2 mm hr with t r 0 finally a constant baseflow equal to the initial flow value of 0 06 l s was assumed in the simulation the nonlinear least squares method yielded the following fitted parameters λ 0 34 day1 2 and ξ 0 05 days whereby the nash sutcliffe efficiency number is ns 0 930 and the root mean squared error is rmse 0 039 given the complexity of the spring hydrograph and the simplicity of the infiltration module one can consider the fit of the kwu model to be acceptable a slightly better fit can be achieved if a finer interval of the rainfall pulses is assumed as it would allow the model to capture the first large peak 6 conclusions simplified physically based flow models were developed to simulate the hydrograph of a typical karst spring using basic concepts of free surface flow the models are in an analytical form that proved helpful in the parameter estimation of real karst systems the analytical approach provides the ability to present the parameters of a problem into the simplest form possible one can then simulate the spring discharge using two or three dimensionless parameters rather than a series of physical parameters this is even more valuable in the inverse analysis as it simplifies considerably the task of parameter estimation in the absence of analytical expressions the inverse problem of estimating the parameters from observed data is computationally intensive as it would involve the numerical solution of the system of differential equations for every set of trial values of parameters while being susceptible to the numerical truncation errors of the coupled problem the proposed parsimonious models account for time varying localized and distributed recharge conduit and matrix storage transmission and subsequent discharge at a single spring outlet although the primary use of the models is the simulation of the spring hydrograph for a given recharge event they also allow the evaluation of the hydraulic head distribution in the conduit and of the water table in the aquifer in case observation wells and groundwater levels are available one can therefore simultaneously fit the spring discharge and the aquifer heads in order to get a more refined estimate of the parameters the models can also quantify the exchange flow at the conduit matrix interface that is valuable in contaminant transport studies they can also simulate dendritic systems by applying any of the models repeatedly to connect several conduits in series or in parallel that will simulate the flow through a branched and intermeshed network of subterranean conduits the present models are in terms of physically meaningful parameters that represent the dominant flow processes occurring in a karst aquifer in the case of a concentrated recharge scenario in unbounded flow domain the derived mathematical expression is a simple and elegant expression that accurately reproduces the complete response hydrograph including the delayed peak flow as well as the rising and recession limbs the concentrated recharge solution provided an efficient approach to estimate the model parameters and proved to be more applicable than the diffuse recharge solution in the real karst systems considered herein it should be reminded that the models presented herein assume a predominant free surface flow regime in the conduit throughout the simulation period furthermore they are based on the kinematic wave approximation that neglects the effects of the downstream boundary conditions on the shape of the spring hydrograph due to the inherent nature of the analytical method of solution the models in their present form cannot handle mixed flow regimes or the transition from pressurized to unpressurized flow conditions such situations are best simulated using a numerical model since the domain is discretized into cells or elements this is also possible only if the required hydro geologic information is available in most cases one has to resort to the analysis of the spring discharge to characterize the aquifer the present work provides analytical expressions suitable for that end the proposed models proved to be simple and effective tools in simulating karst system response under various recharge conditions they help elucidate the functional behavior of complex karst systems and highlight the importance of the conduit matrix interaction additional applications of the flow models can include the benchmarking of numerical solutions and the investigation of idealized situations in non ideal conditions they can be incorporated into more complex hydrologic models for predictive purposes or long term simulations of a spring discharge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

6122,most karst aquifers are characterized as a dual flow system comprised of a highly conductive conduit network embedded in a low porosity matrix the conduits are hydraulically connected to the matrix and behave either as a drain or a source depending on the recharge conditions simplified physically based models are herein employed to simulate the spring outflow for such aquifer systems the processes consist of a free surface flow in the conduit that is interacting laterally with a laminar groundwater flow in the surrounding matrix the conduit is subject to a concentrated recharge at its upstream end while the groundwater aquifer is subject to a diffuse recharge over its contributing surface area the flow system is described by a coupled system of partial differential equations the conduit flow is approximated by the kinematic wave equation and the groundwater flow by the linearized boussinesq equation the governing equations are solved using the laplace transform method after an appropriate linearization of the nonlinear coefficient the derived spring discharge models are a function of three dimensionless parameters the time lag parameter ξ the lumped conduit parameter λ and the aquifer parameter η the simulation results highlight the contrast between pressure driven and gravity driven flows and the importance of the conduit matrix interaction on the response of the karst system application of the models on real karst aquifers demonstrates their effectiveness in simulating the observed spring hydrograph using lumped physical parameters of the karst system keywords karst hydrology aquifer characterization spring hydrograph conduit matrix interaction free surface flow mathematical modeling karst water resources karst conduit hydraulic processes dual hydraulic model inverse modeling analytical models laplace transform method kernel functions transfer functions convolution integral 1 introduction karst aquifers are highly heterogeneous and anisotropic systems consisting of an underground conduit network embedded in a low permeability matrix karst springs respond rapidly to intense storms and represent a combined response of flow through fractures pores and conduits the flow reaches the conduit and ultimately the karst spring from concentrated and diffuse aquifer recharge events the concentrated recharge originates from sinking streams and sinkholes and is applied at localized points along the conduit the diffuse recharge represents dispersed infiltration over the aquifer surrounding the conduit that acts as a drain depending on the prevailing hydraulic conditions the conduit flow can be laminar or turbulent pressurized full pipe flow or non pressurized free surface flow as observed by raeisi et al 2007 therefore modeling of flow in karst aquifers requires the combination of both surface water and groundwater hydraulics concepts there are numerous models that simulate the spring response to recharge events most of the models are lumped transfer functions or reservoir models since they are easier to apply and require limited input data when compared to physically based distributed models among the physically based models that were developed for karst systems pipe flow processes are predominant e g modflow cfp shoemaker et al 2008 flow in partially filled karst conduits has recently gained importance since the flow can change from a pressurized flow regime to a free surface flow regime depending on the recharge conditions as per field observations raeisi et al 2007 prelovsek et al 2008 distributive models that account for free surface flow conditions have been developed by reimann et al 2011 and de rooij et al 2013 other models such as the storm water management model swmm that features open channel flow concepts were also applied to simulate a karst system response e g campbell and sullivan 2002 peterson and wicks 2006 chen and goldscheider 2014 although lumped models have been widely used to characterize karst aquifers their parameters have limited physical representation on the other hand distributive models are difficult to apply due to their extensive data demand furthermore they are computationally expensive sensitive to the spatial discretization at the interface and thus challenging to use in inverse problems in the present study a simplified physically based model is presented in which the flow domain geometry consists of a simple doline conduit matrix system that has been adopted in numerous karst studies birk et al 2006 chang et al 2015 luhmann et al 2012 reimann et al 2011 the model relies on mechanistic laws and is function of lumped physical parameters that are directly related to the hydraulic and geometric properties of the conduit and aquifer the basic flow concept is similar to the one underlying hybrid discrete continuum models e g modflow cfp using the simplest representation while preserving the basic flow components of the system a few analytic models exist for karst aquifers cornaton and perrochet 2002 used the dual porosity concept for a matrix system to derive an analytical solution that simulates the hydraulic response of karst aquifers while loper and eltayeb 2010 used the hybrid discrete continuum model to investigate the propagation of waves in a pressurized karst conduit embedded in a matrix criss and winston 2003 used darcy s law and the diffusion equation to develop a model in terms of a single fitting parameter that simulated the spring hydrograph of karst springs the conduit matrix system is also hydraulically analogous to the river aquifer interaction problem however the flow processes that are taken into consideration and the governing equations used to model such processes are largely different most river aquifer interaction studies assume that the mathematical problem is decoupled while those few studies that deal with the stream aquifer interaction as a coupled problem use the empirical muskingum method for river routing rather than the theoretical saint venant equation the one exception is the analytical work by hunt 1990 that employs the same governing equations as in the present study but neglects the effect of the groundwater recharge on the river outflow as it was not relevant to his study of bank storage during floods the present model consists of a one dimensional conduit embedded in a two dimensional matrix domain the conduit is subject to a concentrated recharge at an upstream location while a diffuse recharge distribution is applied uniformly over the flow domain the conduit and the surrounding matrix exchange flow at their common interface under various flow conditions the exchange flow is properly evaluated by satisfying the continuity of the head and flux at the interface and this flow interaction is an intrinsic component of the model the flow processes are mathematically described by a coupled system of partial differential equations the kinematic wave approximation for the free surface flow in the conduit and the boussinesq equation for the unconfined groundwater flow in the matrix the governing differential equations are linearized to obtain analytical spring discharge expressions using the laplace transform method the model structure and domain geometry are thus similar to the ones introduced in basha and zoghbi 2018 while the flow conditions in the conduit are different gravity driven vs pressure driven the previous investigation dealt with pressurized flow in conduits whereby different hydraulic processes and associated governing equations were used pressure driven flows are steady and generate instantaneous responses while gravity driven flows are non steady and produce delayed responses the aim of the present work is to develop flow models to simulate the hydrograph of a typical karst spring given that a predominant free surface flow regime exists in the conduit throughout the simulation period the study highlights the contrast between the instantaneous response of a pressurized flow system and the delayed response of a free surface flow system and applies the derived discharge expressions to real karst systems to demonstrate their effectiveness in simulating the observed spring hydrographs using two or three parameters 2 theoretical framework 2 1 model setup this study considers a single conduit of length l located within an aquifer spanning a width w on each side of the conduit the conduit receives a concentrated recharge q b at its upstream end and the aquifer is subject to a diffuse recharge r applied uniformly over the recharge domain w r w the model domain is two dimensional in space with the conduit flow along the downslope x direction and the aquifer flow along the perpendicular y direction however the flow in the conduit and aquifer are both considered to be one dimensional the conduit acts as a source or a sink for the matrix depending on the flow conditions and the flow exchange between the conduit and the aquifer occurs at their common interface y 0 the spring is set to be at the base level of the carbonate formation and the connected conduit is assumed to be inclined at a uniform slope the spring is the principal discharge outlet of the karst aquifer and the outflow q is the spring hydrograph that is commonly measured the top and cross sectional view of the coupled conduit aquifer flow system is illustrated in fig 1 in contrast to the pressurized conditions basha and zoghbi 2018 fig 1c the top elevation of the conduit is situated above the water table level 2 2 flow processes the flow processes in the conduit matrix system is composed of non steady open channel flow in the subterranean conduit and unconfined groundwater flow in the adjoining matrix 2 3 channel flow one dimensional unsteady open channel flow is governed by the saint venant equations that consist of the continuity and momentum equations the continuity equation gives 1 a t q x 2 q 0 where a is the cross sectional area of the flow l2 q is the flow rate l3 t x is the longitudinal coordinate downslope along the channel l t is the time t and q is the rate of lateral outflow positive or inflow negative per unit length of channel on each side l2 t the subscript denotes that the variables are dimensional one approximation of the momentum equation consists of neglecting the inertia terms and setting the friction slope s f equal to the channel bed slope s o 2 s f s o this simplification is known as the kinematic wave approximation it implies that the downstream boundary conditions do not affect the flow condition upstream the relationship between the flow rate and friction slope is given by chezy s equation 3 q a c r s f where c l1 2 t is the chezy coefficient that can be related to the darcy weisbach friction factor through c 8 g f the flow area for a rectangular conduit is a b h c where b is the width and h c is the flow height the hydraulic radius r a p is the ratio of the flow area over the wetted perimeter p for a flow width b larger than the flow depth h c the hydraulic radius simplifies to r h c the equation of the flow rate becomes 4 q k c b h c m k c c s o m 3 2 where k c is the conduit conveyance factor that is dependent on the roughness and the channel s bed slope it should be noted that the head is defined with respect to the channel bottom therefore h c is the hydraulic head in the conduit as well as the flow depth in case manning s discharge equation is used for q the resulting flow rate equation is similar in form to 4 but with a different exponent m 5 3 and conveyance factor k c s 0 n where n is the manning coefficient the relationship between chezy s and manning s equation is given by c r 1 6 n jain 2001 2 3 1 matrix flow the variation of the water table in the porous matrix h a is governed by the boussinesq equation for non steady unconfined groundwater flow 5 φ h a t y k s h a h a y r here h a is the height of the water table measured from the base of the conduit y is the horizontal lateral coordinate l φ is the effective or drainable porosity k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t and r is the recharge distribution l t eq 5 is mildly nonlinear for gradual variation of the water table profile a common approach to linearize it is to assume that the coefficient h a in the diffusion term is equal to the mean depth of flow in the aquifer h m and thereby define the product κ k s h m as the constant aquifer transmissivity one should note that the water table elevation in the karst aquifer has to be below the top of the conduit to ensure free surface flow conditions in the conduit it is also implicitly assumed that the water table is uniformly inclined along the conduit direction since the local heads in the matrix are defined with respect to the conduit bottom 2 3 2 exchange flow the exchange flow q at the interface of the conduit and the surrounding matrix is given by darcy s law with a constant transmissivity formulation 6 q κ h a y at the interface y 0 the water surface in the channel and matrix are joined and the heads in the conduit and aquifer are equal h c x t h a 0 t the interface condition couples the conduit with the matrix flow problem and implies that no seepage face exists at the conduit matrix interface the problem of seepage face can only be handled by a numerical model defined over a two dimensional vertical domain to determine the location of the seepage face and evaluate the exchange flow a common approximation is to introduce a correction factor to the one dimensional flux eq 6 that produces the same output as the two dimensional solution however such an approach will not change the structure of the derived solution it will only lead to a different quantification of the proportionality constant in 6 the exchange flow between the conduit and matrix is therefore evaluated by satisfying the continuity of the head and flux at the interface this is in contrast to the barenblatt formulation barenblatt et al 1960 that is simply a first order numerical approximation of darcy s law whereby the interface height nodal spacing and hydraulic conductivity are lumped together in a parameter defined as the exchange coefficient it expresses the exchange flow in terms of the head difference between the conduit and matrix times the above defined exchange coefficient nevertheless the exchange flow in both approaches is represented by a similar linear relationship e g eq 6 and differ only in the formulation and estimation of the flow exchange parameter 2 3 3 recharge although various models exist for the estimation of the groundwater recharge in karst aquifers e g hartmann et al 2013 a simple infiltration model which is based on the phi index method chow et al 1988 is herein used to estimate the recharge from the rainfall distribution the infiltration module is a function of an initial abstraction amount a i l plus a constant abstraction rate a c l t and a travel time parameter t r t the initial abstraction parameter a i accounts for the surface depression storage while the constant abstraction parameter a c represents the interception root uptake evaporation rate for small rainfall events or surface runoff rate for large rainfall events the time of travel t r parameter is to account for the translation of the rainfall pulse from the soil surface to the groundwater the recharge is mathematically expressed by 7 r t r e t t r r e i e a c u i e a c where i e is the effective rainfall intensity l t over a duration δ t defined by 8 i e δ i δ t i p c a i u p c a i here p c δ p is the cumulative precipitation l and u z is the unit step function u z 0 for z 0 and u z 1 for z 0 to ensure non negative values the recharge is considered to be uniformly distributed in space and varying in time in a stepwise constant fashion the recharge flow is obtained by multiplying the recharge rate r by the recharge area μ r 2 l r w r for diffuse recharge or by the capture area of the sinkholes ν for concentrated recharge due to its simplicity the above recharge model has significantly fewer parameters than existing models and provide an adequate representation of the recharge distribution especially in relatively small karst catchments where spatial variability of recharge is not significant 2 4 governing equations the governing equation for the combined conduit matrix flow is a coupled system of differential equations the coupling is achieved through the boundary condition at the interface h c x t h a 0 t that affects the head distribution in the matrix h a eq 5 and the exchange flow at the interface q eq 6 moreover the flow q is directly related to the exchange flow term q eq 1 and the head distribution in the conduit h c eq 4 to simplify the notation and generalize the results the governing equations are first expressed in dimensionless form using the following definitions 9 h h x x y y b b l o t t t o u o l o t o q o u o l o 2 and 10 k s k r r u o q q u o l o q q q o where l o and t o are the characteristic length and time while u o and q o are the characteristic velocity and discharge the parameter l o can be set equal to the length l or height of the conduit d and the parameter t o can be set equal to the measured recharge period or flow duration alternatively one can set q o and t o equal to some reference values e g 1 m3 s and 1 day respectively one should stress that for consistency one must define only two dimensionless variables and deduce the other two using eq 9 the groundwater flow equation in dimensionless form becomes 11 φ h a t κ 2 h a y 2 r where κ κ u o l o is the dimensionless transmissivity the dimensionless flow rate in the channel is 12 q b k c h c m k c k c l o m 1 q o eq 1 becomes 13 h c t m k c h c m 1 h c x 2 κ b d h a dy y 0 eq 13 is nonlinear in its present form due to the presence of the nonlinear coefficient m k c h c m 1 which is a measure of the wave celerity i e the transmission speed of any disturbance in the system defining a representative wave celerity c s k c where s m h m m 1 is the scaling parameter to be subsequently estimated in an optimal fashion one can obtain a linearized version of 13 14 h c t c h c x 2 κ b d h a dy y 0 the corresponding linearized flow rate is then 15 q c b h c 2 4 1 initial conditions the equilibrium initial condition in the unconfined aquifer of width w is given by 16 h ia x y h ic x r i κ w y 2 y where h ic is the corresponding initial head distribution in the conduit expressed by 17 h ic x h 0 2 q i cb x eqs 16 and 17 are derived from the steady version of eqs 11 and 14 respectively whereby h 0 is the head at the inlet section that corresponds to the steady initial flow q 0 in the conduit cf eq 15 and q i is the steady exchange flux at the matrix conduit interface that results from the steady diffuse recharge r i over the recharge zone wl the relationship between q i and r i is q i w r i 2 4 2 boundary conditions in the conduit domain for a prescribed concentrated recharge at the inlet section of the conduit q b the corresponding boundary condition is 18 h c q b cb x 0 for a concentrated recharge obtained from the rainfall distribution using the infiltration module q b t ν r t where the recharge r is defined in a stepwise constant variation in terms of the unit step function u t 19 r t r 1 u t t 0 r 2 r 1 u t t 1 r n r n 1 u t t n 1 for a piecewise linear variation of the concentrated recharge q b is expressed by 20 q b t q 1 u t t 0 q 2 q 1 u t t 1 q n q n 1 u t t n 1 here q k with k 1 2 n is a linear function of time defined over the interval t k 1 t t k as 21 q k a k t t k 1 υ k 1 a k υ k υ k 1 t k t k 1 where υ k is the flow value at time t k and υ 0 is the initial flow q 0 at time t 0 2 4 3 boundary conditions in the matrix domain the boundary conditions in the unconfined aquifer are expressed by 22 h a h c t y 0 23 h a y 0 y w eq 22 accounts for the varying head in the conduit and eq 23 expresses the no flux boundary condition at a water divide or fault section at the far end of the aquifer 2 5 optimal coefficient the governing set of equations was linearized through the introduction of an appropriate coefficient c s k c where s m h m m 1 m q m k c b 1 1 m is the scaling parameter defined in terms of the mean depth h m or the mean flow rate q m using the method of weighted residuals ames 1965 the scaling parameter s is estimated in an optimum fashion for a given time and flow condition defining the residual e as the difference between the nonlinear continuity eq 13 and its linearized form 14 24 e m k c h c m 1 h c x c h c x and minimizing the residual e over the flow duration 0 t e d t 0 one gets an expression for the linearized wave celerity c or alternately the mean flow rate q m 25 q m 1 1 m 1 t 0 t q d 1 1 m d t minimizing the residual over the flow domain and duration 0 t 0 l e d x d t 0 yields 26 q m 1 1 m 1 m 0 t q d q b d t 0 t q d 1 m q b 1 m d t where q d q l t is the outflow at the downstream boundary and q b q 0 t is the inflow at the upstream boundary the linearized wave celerity parameter is then c m k c 1 m b 1 m 1 q m 1 1 m the time limits of the integrals 25 and 26 should capture any large variation in the discharge an appropriate selection of the upper limit t is twice the time of rise of the spring hydrograph so that the time interval is centered on the time to peak t p the above expressions are also function of the outflow q d that might not be available a good first approximation is to assume a mean height h m or flow q m and evaluate c directly to generate the downstream discharge q d once q d is available one can repeat the process of updating q m using 25 or 26 in an iterative fashion until convergence is achieved within three to four iterations eq 25 turns out to be the most useful for all flow conditions while eq 26 provides a slightly more accurate result for diffuse recharge events 3 karst flow models the laplace transform method is herein employed to derive the models for various flow conditions from the coupled system of eqs 11 and 14 three models are presented below model kwb is for a bounded aquifer model kwu is for aquifers of unlimited extent and model kwg is for the general case of partial recharge area in a finite flow domain l r l w r w all models generate the spring response for a concentrated recharge at the upstream end of the conduit and for a diffuse recharge over a defined aquifer domain the laplace transforms of h is defined by 27 h l h 0 h exp p t d t where p is the laplace parameter and laplace transformed variables are hereafter denoted by an overbar the laplace transforms of eqs 11 and 14 are 28 1 ρ 2 d 2 h a d y 2 p h a h ia r φ 29 c d h c dx p h c h ic ς d h a dy y 0 where r l r is the laplace transform of the recharge function and 30 ρ 2 φ κ ς 2 κ

outflow from a conduit embedded in a bounded karst aquifer over which a uniform recharge over the whole flow domain is applied it is expressed in terms of the concentrated recharge q b the diffuse recharge q r and the antecedent flow conditions in the conduit q 0 and in the aquifer q i eq 36 is hereafter designated as the spring discharge model kwb for a wide aquifer with the recharge applied over a predefined semi width w the resulting outflow expression can be derived from the solution of the coupled system 28 29 using the boundary condition 23 at y rather than at y w the final result for the discharge at x l is 39 q q i q 0 q b q 0 exp ϖ ξ q r q i 1 exp ϖ ξ ϖ ξ 1 exp η p 1 2 η p 1 2 where 40 ϖ p ε p 1 2 the kwu model 39 allows for an analytical inversion of the laplace solutions as the function argument 40 is simpler than 33 of the kwb model cf appendix a an extension of the above model to a branched system of subterranean conduits is also outlined in appendix a the above two flow models were derived under the assumption that the recharge occurs over an area delimited by the length of the conduit l and the width w on each side of the conduit for the general case of a partial contributing recharge area i e r r t u l r x u w r y where l r l and w r w are the horizontal and lateral dimensions of the recharge zone the discharge equation can be derived in a similar fashion using slightly different form of the initial conditions 16 17 to account for the piecewise recharge zone the discharge at any location l r x l is given by 41 q μ r r i q 0 q b q 0 exp ψ x 2 w r r i ψ 1 exp ψ l r ψ x 2 ψ r exp ψ l r 1 exp ψ x r i 1 exp ψ x 1 sinh ϕ w ϕ w r sinh ϕ w tanh ϕ w ϕ where μ r 2 l r w r ϕ ρ p 1 2 and ψ ϖ c for x l eq 41 gives the discharge at the outlet for a partial recharge zone for x l r l and w r w eq 41 reduces to the equation of the discharge for a full recharge zone i e the kwb model 36 the kwu model 39 can also be derived from eq 41 by taking the limit w followed by setting x l r l and w r w in the end result one should note that the recharge area is assumed to be the same in both the antecedent and the current conditions and the flow exchange occurs over the whole length of the conduit 4 spring response analysis there are three models 36 39 and 41 for simulating the free surface outflow of a spring depending on the extent of the aquifer whether bounded or unbounded and the recharge zone whether full or partial the models can handle concentrated q b and diffuse recharge events q r as well as the antecedent equilibrium flow conditions q 0 and q i although the primary focus of this study is the simulation of spring discharge the models also allow the evaluation of the hydraulic head distribution in the conduit 35 and of the water table in the aquifer 31 furthermore they can also quantify the flow interaction at the conduit matrix interface 32 and simulate its fluctuation and flow reversal as a flood event passes through the conduit such an analysis was previously conducted in a pressurized conduit system basha and zoghbi 2018 fig 4 to highlight the rise and fall of the hydraulic heads during a flood event as well as the exchange flow reversal when the flood recedes the evaluation of the laplace based models in the real time domain is carried out using the laplace numerical inversion algorithm based on fourier series expansion as formulated by crump 1976 modified by de hoog et al 1982 and implemented by hollenbeck 1998 within the matlab environment the numerical inversions are corroborated against the exact analytical solutions for the kwu model cf appendix a 4 1 numerical validation the linearized analytical models are first compared with the fully nonlinear numerical solution in order to assess the effectiveness of the optimal coefficient approach in producing the nonlinear discharge rate as generated by eq 12 using the linearized version of the flow rate 15 the numerical solution of the nonlinear system of equations is obtained using the maccormack numerical scheme for the free surface flow in the conduit and the crank nicholson scheme for the groundwater flow hoffman 2001 the resulting finite difference equations are in a tri diagonal form that can be solved efficiently using the thomas algorithm the grid distribution is uniform in the conduit section and non uniform in the matrix flow directions the accurate evaluation of the exchange flux necessitates the prescription of very fine grid spacing near the interface δ y 0 02 that is progressively increased to a maximum of 5 δ y as one moves away from the interface boundary the grid spacing in the conduit is uniform and set equal to δ x l 40 and a small time step δ t δ x k c is employed to satisfy the courant condition and ensure convergence the solution process consists first of solving for the head distribution in the matrix to evaluate the exchange flux at the interface and thus compute the head distribution in the conduit using the revised head at the conduit matrix interface updated values of the head in the matrix are generated and the exchange flow at the interface is recalculated the convergence of this iterative process within each time step is further accelerated using the successive over relaxation technique the two stage solving process is then repeated at each time step using the new boundary condition of the conduit and the updated head condition at the conduit matrix interface the output of the nonlinear numerical model is shown in figs 2 3 alongside all the curves that were generated with the linearized analytical models the analytical model performance is evaluated statistically using the root mean squared error and the nash sutcliffe measure of goodness of fit nash and sutcliffe 1970 the root mean squared error rmse between the numerical and analytical solutions ranged from as low as 0 000768 model kwu in fig 2 to as high as 0 0386 model kwb in fig 3 while the nash sutcliff efficiency nse parameter ranged from 0 972 to 0 996 for the generated spring hydrographs given the close agreement between the analytical and the numerical solutions one concludes that the present linear models conserve the effect of the conduit nonlinearity and are able to reproduce with very good accuracy the response of the more complex nonlinear model one key advantage of the analytical models is their speed and efficiency since they produce the complete spring hydrograph in a single evaluation sweep in a fraction of the time used by the numerical model this is particularly useful in the context of parameter estimation whereby the spring discharge is being evaluated for hundreds of trial values of the physical parameters 4 2 conduit matrix interaction to investigate the influence of the conduit matrix interaction and the hydraulic parameters on the spring response a simplified two dimensional hypothetical karst catchment is used the scenario setup is similar to the one used by previous investigators e g birk et al 2006 reimann et al 2011 a single conduit of width b 0 016 and dimensionless length l 40 is embedded in a karst aquifer system of a dimensionless semi width w 4 for a dimensionless system defined by l o 60 m and t o 6 hrs or equivalently u o 10 m hr and q o 10 m3 s the corresponding conduit length and width are 2400 m and 0 96 m respectively while the total width of the flow domain is 480 m for a flow area 0 96 m wide by 0 5 m high in a rectangular conduit with a friction factor f of 0 2 equivalent to a chezy coefficient of 20 or to a manning roughness coefficient of 0 04 the conveyance factor k c is near 2 m1 2 s for a conduit slope of 1 the dimensionless conveyance factor of k c 5525 is then obtained from k c k c l o m 1 q o similarly the dimensionless transmissivity κ can be obtained from its dimensional counterpart using κ κ u o l o the dimensionless model parameters consist of the time lag parameter ξ the lumped conduit parameter λ and the aquifer parameter η the time lag parameter ξ is equal to the ratio of the conduit length l to the mean wave celerity c and provides an estimate of the time of transit the lumped conduit parameter λ is the product of the flow exchange parameter ε and the time lag parameter ξ the aquifer parameter η is function of the contributing zone of the aquifer w and inversely proportional to the hydraulic diffusivity κ φ for zero exchange at the interface ε 0 the upstream inflow pulse is routed to the outlet with a delay equal to the time lag ξ for small values of the flow exchange parameter ε the spring outflow can be considered to be representative of a conduit dominated flow regime for a conduit with a very large conveyance coefficient large values of k c or c the parameters ξ and λ are near zero that denote a matrix dominated flow regime in the spring outflow small values of η indicate limited aquifer extent and matrix storage that also imply a strong effect of the conduit hydraulic properties on the spring hydrograph it is important to note that ξ l c is in terms of the scaling parameter s m h m m 1 that modifies the original hydraulic parameters ξ l k c such that the linearized model produces the same output as the nonlinear one in the nonlinear numerical model the parameters have fixed values while in the linear models the parameters ξ and λ are varying with the mean depth h m or flow q m of the specific problem through the scaling parameter s 42 ξ ξ s ξ l k c λ ε ξ s λ fig 2 compares the spring response to a concentrated pulse recharge of dimensionless magnitude of 0 08 0 8 m3 s and spanning a dimensionless duration of 1 6 hrs injected at the upstream boundary of the conduit in the presence of a dimensionless background flow of 0 02 0 2 m3 s although the models can handle a triangular pulse or any piecewise linear variation of recharge a rectangular pulse was selected in order to accentuate the response features the kwb and kwu responses are generated from eqs 36 and 39 for q r q i 0 respectively for the selected values of the flow exchange parameter ε with ξ 0 0072 η 1 and b 0 016 the selected value of ξ corresponds to a conveyance factor k c of 2 m1 2 s for l 2400 m a value of η 1 was used for the kwb model in order to highlight the difference with the kwu model while the remaining parameter λ is directly obtained from λ ε ξ the scaling parameter s was obtained from 25 with t 2 t p also shown is the output of the model fb for pressure driven flow in the conduit basha and zoghbi 2018 eq 38 using the same input parameters except for the height of the water table that is set higher than the height of the conduit h a d model fb was selected for comparison purposes as it is based on similar boundary conditions as the kwb model fig 2 clearly shows that the kwb and kwu response is not instantaneous as in the response of the pressure driven conduit flow model fb the delay in the response is one of the primary characteristics of the free surface flow models and it is closely related to the value of the ξ parameter the early time response of the kwb and kwu models is also identical there is a larger damping of the peak with the kwu model than the kwb model due to the unbounded storage area available in the matrix that facilitates a larger exchange volume for large values of η 2 the kwb and kwu responses are almost indistinguishable thereby indicating that the spring hydrograph is independent of the lateral extent of the matrix domain for concentrated recharges a variation in the ε parameter assesses the influence of the flow exchange on the damping of the flow for ε 0 no exchange flow occurs and the model simulates the movement of an inflow pulse through the conduit and the delayed response at the outlet a higher value of ε implies a larger exchange of the conduit flow with the matrix and a larger reduction of the peak flow as expected the parameter ξ also affects the shape of the spring hydrograph as it is inversely proportional to the conduit conveyance k c a high ξ value implies a low conveyance factor k c due to a higher friction factor f or manning s roughness n for a low value of ξ the decline of the recession limb is fast while for the selected value of ξ the recession is slow and decreasing in a linear fashion the linear decrease of the recession limb has been observed in the field e g bailly comte et al 2010 fig 3 compares the spring response to a diffuse recharge of the gravity driven flow model kwb and kwu as well as the pressure driven flow model fb basha zoghbi 2018 eq 38 using the same model input parameters as for fig 2 the diffuse recharge event consists of a constant and uniform groundwater recharge rate of r 1 25 x 10 4 over the entire recharge domain 40 8 for a dimensionless duration of 2 this is equivalent to a diffuse recharge rate of 1 25 mm h over a period of 12 hrs although the flow domain is different for the kwb and kwu model the recharge area is the same the responses are generated from eqs 36 and 39 for q b q 0 q i 0 and they are normalized with respect to the maximum possible discharge of 0 04 for the kwb and kwu model and 0 02 for the fb model the scaling parameter s was obtained from 26 with t 2 t p as it handles better the spatial distribution of recharge as expected the free surface flow models kwb and kwu models yields a milder and delayed response than the pressure driven flow model fb the kwb model produces a larger response than the kwu model due to the ensuing rise in the water table that enhances the exchange with the conduit and the subsequent drainage to the spring outlet in the unbounded aquifer case kwu part of the recharge is directed by the prevailing gradient towards the outer boundary of the aquifer that limits the rise of the hydraulic head in the matrix the peak response and the water transfer are also larger for smaller values of η since the parameter η is inversely proportional to the hydraulic diffusivity κ φ for a fixed recharge width 5 models application the flow models are herein applied to three real karst systems the logsdon conduit located in kentucky raeisi et al 2007 the bluegrass spring in missouri criss and winston 2003 and the fertans spring in france charlier et al 2012 the first application pertains to a well monitored system with a strong evidence of free surface flows for flow rates smaller than 4 m3 s the bluegrass spring is a simple application of the kwu model and provides a simple mean to estimate the dominant parameter while the fertans example is an application for a multi peaked event with intermittent rainfall and low discharge values the model parameters ξ λ and η are estimated using the nonlinear least square method that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and simulated hydrographs the model performance is evaluated using the nash sutcliffe ns measure of goodness of fit in all of the above mentioned applications it is presumed that a single conduit is draining the karst system and the conduit is hydraulically connected to a porous or fissured matrix this is a plausible assumption in the absence of speleological information that can adequately describe the complexity of a karst system however one can apply any of the models repeatedly to connect several conduits in series or in parallel in case a dendritic system exists cf appendix a it should also be mentioned that the models presented herein assume a predominant free surface flow regime in the conduit with a free discharge conditions at the outlet in the present form the models cannot handle mixed flow regimes or the transition from pressurized to unpressurized flow conditions one must therefore ensure that the maximum spring discharge is below the conduit capacity as computed from eq 3 or alternatively the maximum flow depth is smaller than the conduit height when information on the conduit dimensions is not readily available the magnitude of the maximum discharge might provide an indication on whether the flow is predominantly pressure driven or gravity driven in addition the kinematic wave simplification implies that the flow in the conduit is not affected by the flow conditions at the downstream end such as a water pond at the spring outlet that would hinder the outflow furthermore the derived models are event based models that are better fit for a single storm or isolated event they are not suitable for long term simulations in their current form however they can be linked to other modules that account for evaporation and vadose zone processes to form a large scale hydrological model finally the model parameters consist of lumped physical parameters of the karst system the actual physical parameters of the conduit and matrix can be determined from the model parameters only if sufficient information on the karst system is separately available such as the length of the conduit l and the extent of the aquifer or recharge zone w although the application examples below show that the models can replicate the behavior of the karst system the physical attributes of the system cannot be specified due to the limited information available nonetheless one can still make an inference on the hydraulic functioning of a karst system from the success of a particular model 5 1 logsdon kentucky the logsdon river is located within the mammoth cave system in south central kentucky and is considered to be one of the major underground streams during large storms the flow enters the logsdon river through sinkholes and sinking streams depending on the flood magnitude and the stage height the flow in the conduit is either pressure driven full pipe flow or gravity driven free surface flow the spring hydrograph selected for modeling is the storm of may 2008 that falls in the group of open channel flow as categorized by raeisi et al 2007 the data was extracted from the thesis of schenck brown 2008 appendices a and b fig 4 shows the observed spring hydrograph and the simulated one using the kwb model although the karst system might be subject to both concentrated and diffuse recharge a concentrated recharge inflow was simulated eq 36 with q r q i 0 as it provided a better fit than the one for a diffuse recharge the concentrated recharge inflow was obtained from the measured rainfall distribution using the infiltration module with an initial abstraction of 2 cm and a constant abstraction of 0 21 cm hr over an effective recharge area of 10 km2 the time of travel t r in the infiltration module was set equal to zero as it is assumed to be small for concentrated recharge in sinking streams a constant baseflow equal to the observed value of 0 12 m3 s was assumed in the simulation the nonlinear least squares method yielded the following fitted parameters λ 0 78 η 2 2 and ξ 0 067 in addition to the fitted parameters of the infiltration module for the above estimated parameters the nash sutcliffe efficiency number is ns 0 9977 and the root mean squared error is rmse 0 0442 the equivalent dimensional values of the model parameters can be determined from λ λ t o η η t o and ξ ξ t o where t o 1 day the conversion to the actual hydraulic parameters ξ and λ of the flow system can be obtained from 42 given that no additional information is available on the karst system one cannot determine the individual hydraulic parameters of the aquifer or conduit however one can infer from the fitted value of η that the aquifer is limited in extent by a fault or a no flow boundary a similar conclusion was reached for another logsdon event during which the conduit was flowing under pressurized conditions basha and zoghbi 2018 a preliminary estimate of the model parameters can be derived from the simple response model kwu ir pertaining to an impulse recharge a2 the response to an impulse of volume v 1 at time t 1 is given by eq a2 with t ξ replaced by t ξ t 1 and scaled up by a factor equal to v 1 the expressions for the time to peak and the peak outflow can then be derived from the scaled response function to yield 43 t p t 1 ξ λ 2 6 q p 3 6 π e 3 2 λ 2 v 1 eq 43 can be used to obtain a preliminary estimate of the parameters λ and the merged time lag parameter t 1 ξ from the measured values of t p q p and the effective recharge volume v 1 after baseflow separation the third parameter η can be obtained by matching the moments of the analytical model with the moments of the observed spring hydrograph the moments are obtained from the laplace solution 36 for an idealized sudden injection using the moment generating function 44 m k 1 k d k q d p k p 0 using 36 with q b 1 and q r q 0 q i 0 the moments are derived from 44 in terms of the model parameters to obtain 45 m 1 m 0 λ η ξ assuming ξ 0 one can solve for η m 1 m 0 λ whereby the moments of the observed outflow are computed numerically from 46 m k 0 t k q d t using the above approximate expressions one can obtain a close estimate of the model parameters the measured spring hydrograph has a peak flow q p of 3 68 m3 s at a time of peak t p of 0 875 days from an arbitrarily set reference time zero and the effective recharge volume v 1 is equal to 0 1675 106 m3 using 43 one gets λ 0 70 day1 2 and t 1 ξ 0 79 days assuming that the time application of the recharge impulse t 1 is at the end of the peak rainfall intensity one reads t 1 0 71 and the time lag parameter is then ξ 0 085 days for λ 0 70 and m 1 m 0 1 24 eq 45 yields η 1 78 day1 2 the difference between the preliminary and the final estimates of the parameters is close to 10 for λ 12 for ξ and 20 for η noting that the latter parameter has the least influence on the output for a concentrated recharge case the simulated hydrograph of the simple kwu ir model a2 using the above estimates of λ and t 1 ξ is displayed in fig 4 as expected the hydrograph captures the peak since the model parameters are estimated from the peak expressions 43 the nash sutcliffe efficiency number for this simple fit is ns 0 788 and the root mean squared error is rmse 0 421 a better fit of an observed hydrograph by the kwu ir model can be obtained if the recharge occurs over a shorter period of time as shown in the next application example 5 2 bluegrass spring missouri the bluegrass spring is located in east central missouri usa in an area that has extensive karst features including losing streams and sinkholes the surficial recharge area is approximately 0 8 km2 and has no runoff features the discharge data selected for modeling is the storm of february 2001 that was extracted from the publication of criss and winston 2003 fig 1 fig 5 compares the measured spring hydrograph with the simulated one using the kwu model 39 as it provided a better fit ns 0 9960 rmse 0 003 thereby indicating the negligible influence of the matrix boundaries on the discharge the nonlinear least squares method yielded the following fitted parameters λ 1 14 day1 2 and ξ 0 14 days the concentrated recharge input was derived from the measured rainfall distribution using the infiltration module with an effective recharge area of 0 6 km2 an initial abstraction of 2 9 cm from a total of 7 4 cm of rainfall and a negligible constant abstraction a c 0 the time of travel parameter t r in the infiltration module was set equal to zero in effect the influence of the t r parameter cannot be separated from the effect of the time lag parameter ξ in the fitting exercise unless additional information on the study area are available that will help discern the value range of each the concentrated recharge case of the kwu model is a function of two model parameters ξ and λ that can be effectively estimated from 43 for the observed peak flow of 0 195 m3 s at a time of peak of 2 15 days from an arbitrarily set reference time zero and a total volume of discharge of 20475 m3 after baseflow separation of q 0 0 0047 m3 s one gets λ 1 06 day1 2 and t 1 ξ 1 97 days setting the time of injection as the time of peak rainfall intensity t 1 1 79 one finds ξ 0 18 days the simulated spring hydrograph using the simple kwu ir model a2 with these preliminary estimates is shown in fig 5 a good fit is obtained ns 0 866 rmse 0 0173 as the recharge distribution is quite close to an impulse form as little information is available about the geometric properties of the conduit and aquifer in the bluegrass karst system one cannot determine the hydraulic parameters of the karst system that are embedded in the lumped model parameters ξ and λ criss and winston 2003 derived an equation similar in form to equation a2 using the linear diffusion equation for groundwater flow subject to an instantaneous planar source the resulting discharge equation is then normalized to the peak flow in order to reduce the number of parameters to one single parameter named the time constant b which is herein equivalent to the parameter λ 2 4 the time constant b is a fitting parameter that is inversely proportional to the hydraulic diffusivity of the aquifer while the lumped conduit parameter λ is herein related to the conduit s length and width conveyance coefficient k c the exchange coefficient ς as well as the inverse of the hydraulic diffusivity ρ 5 3 fertans spring france the fertans spring is located in a small karst system in the french jura mountains where karstification is considered to be relatively high in the zone the recharge area is small with highly permeable formations and it varied largely between low and high water periods as noted by charlier et al 2012 the selected event for modeling is the smallest flow event may 2010 in order to ensure open channel flow conditions in the spring system it has a rainfall depth of 20 8 mm a maximum rainfall intensity of 3 2 mm h and a peak flow of 0 6 l s the rainfall and spring data were extracted from fig 10 in charlier et al 2012 although a continuous distribution of rainfall is shown therein an hourly rainfall distribution was used since the rainfall data were originally collected at a time step of 1 h fig 6 is a plot of the measured spring hydrograph and the simulated one using the concentrated recharge component of the kwu model although the kwb model performed equally well the kwu model was chosen as it is simpler in form a concentrated recharge inflow was also selected in agreement with the findings of charlier et al 2012 that the contribution of the diffuse infiltration is smaller than the fast infiltration component the localized recharge input was derived from the measured rainfall distribution using the infiltration module with an estimated rainfall capture area of 2000 m2 an initial abstraction of 5 mm and a constant abstraction of nearly 0 2 mm hr with t r 0 finally a constant baseflow equal to the initial flow value of 0 06 l s was assumed in the simulation the nonlinear least squares method yielded the following fitted parameters λ 0 34 day1 2 and ξ 0 05 days whereby the nash sutcliffe efficiency number is ns 0 930 and the root mean squared error is rmse 0 039 given the complexity of the spring hydrograph and the simplicity of the infiltration module one can consider the fit of the kwu model to be acceptable a slightly better fit can be achieved if a finer interval of the rainfall pulses is assumed as it would allow the model to capture the first large peak 6 conclusions simplified physically based flow models were developed to simulate the hydrograph of a typical karst spring using basic concepts of free surface flow the models are in an analytical form that proved helpful in the parameter estimation of real karst systems the analytical approach provides the ability to present the parameters of a problem into the simplest form possible one can then simulate the spring discharge using two or three dimensionless parameters rather than a series of physical parameters this is even more valuable in the inverse analysis as it simplifies considerably the task of parameter estimation in the absence of analytical expressions the inverse problem of estimating the parameters from observed data is computationally intensive as it would involve the numerical solution of the system of differential equations for every set of trial values of parameters while being susceptible to the numerical truncation errors of the coupled problem the proposed parsimonious models account for time varying localized and distributed recharge conduit and matrix storage transmission and subsequent discharge at a single spring outlet although the primary use of the models is the simulation of the spring hydrograph for a given recharge event they also allow the evaluation of the hydraulic head distribution in the conduit and of the water table in the aquifer in case observation wells and groundwater levels are available one can therefore simultaneously fit the spring discharge and the aquifer heads in order to get a more refined estimate of the parameters the models can also quantify the exchange flow at the conduit matrix interface that is valuable in contaminant transport studies they can also simulate dendritic systems by applying any of the models repeatedly to connect several conduits in series or in parallel that will simulate the flow through a branched and intermeshed network of subterranean conduits the present models are in terms of physically meaningful parameters that represent the dominant flow processes occurring in a karst aquifer in the case of a concentrated recharge scenario in unbounded flow domain the derived mathematical expression is a simple and elegant expression that accurately reproduces the complete response hydrograph including the delayed peak flow as well as the rising and recession limbs the concentrated recharge solution provided an efficient approach to estimate the model parameters and proved to be more applicable than the diffuse recharge solution in the real karst systems considered herein it should be reminded that the models presented herein assume a predominant free surface flow regime in the conduit throughout the simulation period furthermore they are based on the kinematic wave approximation that neglects the effects of the downstream boundary conditions on the shape of the spring hydrograph due to the inherent nature of the analytical method of solution the models in their present form cannot handle mixed flow regimes or the transition from pressurized to unpressurized flow conditions such situations are best simulated using a numerical model since the domain is discretized into cells or elements this is also possible only if the required hydro geologic information is available in most cases one has to resort to the analysis of the spring discharge to characterize the aquifer the present work provides analytical expressions suitable for that end the proposed models proved to be simple and effective tools in simulating karst system response under various recharge conditions they help elucidate the functional behavior of complex karst systems and highlight the importance of the conduit matrix interaction additional applications of the flow models can include the benchmarking of numerical solutions and the investigation of idealized situations in non ideal conditions they can be incorporated into more complex hydrologic models for predictive purposes or long term simulations of a spring discharge declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

an analytical inversion of the laplace solutions and yields discharge expressions that are explicit in time analytical solutions pertaining to simple variations of the concentrated recharge q b and for a stepwise uniform diffuse recharge r are derived below the impulse and pulse response expressions are also presented since they constitute the basis of transfer functions that are widely used in black box models and proved to be useful in the simulation of spring hydrographs cf section 5 kwu concentrated recharge the impulse response function is the spring response for an idealized

assistance of mingjie chen associate editor the breakthrough pressures of shale fractures are of great significance for the understanding of shale gas seepage or accumulation co2 geological sequestration and radioactive waste storage in shale and pollution problems caused by gas leakage in this study three shale cores taken from the eastern qaidam basin in china were used to investigate the breakthrough pressures of partially saturated shale fractures the fractured shale core had a single longitudinal fracture across the core along the axis a quantitative description of the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the water content in the fracture is difficult because of the difficulty in the measurement of the water volume in the fracture we propose a method to describe this relationship in this method the water content in the fracture is described by the matric potential cores with different matric potentials were prepared by moistening the cores in different humidity environments methane breakthrough experiments were conducted on three core samples under six different matric potentials the six matric potential levels were 51 38 mpa 39 08 mpa 23

fracture and breakthrough pressure at a low matric potential water forms very thin water films on fracture surfaces and the effect of water on the breakthrough pressure is not notable as the matric potential increases the thickness of water film in the fracture increases and the increase in the breakthrough pressure become notably we establish a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and matric potential the experimental data show that the increase in breakthrough pressure with the matric potential is a process that proceeds from slow to fast and there is a critical value of matric potential in this process when the critical value is reached the connected gas passages are gradually sealed by water films and the breakthrough pressure begins to increase significantly keywords shale fracture breakthrough pressure matric potential partially saturated 1 introduction shales are commonly characterized by low porosities low permeabilities and complicated pore structure networks which make shales both reservoir rocks and caprocks chandler et al 2016 due to the low porosity and low permeability values shales are not only considered to be storage and migration sites for oil and gas resources ougier simonin et al 2016 but also rocks of interest for co2 geological sequestration as well as geological disposal of radioactive waste because of the excellent sealing efficiencies bolton et al 2000 tsang et al 2012 the problem of gas escaping after overcoming the breakthrough pressure in a shale is becoming the intersection of many resource and environmental issues such as the accumulation and exploitation of shale gas the long term safety of underground storage projects in shales co2 geological sequestration radioactive waste storage and underground gas storage reservoir and the pollution problems caused by gas leakage in a shale gas reservoir the excess pressure of shale gas mainly ch4 generated from organic matter must not be higher than the breakthrough pressure of the shale so that the gas can migrate and accumulate to form a gas reservoir in the trap structure romero sarmiento et al 2013 chapiro and bruining 2015 in the exploitation of low porosity and low permeability shale reservoirs gas can migrate to the production wellbore only when the differential pressure between gas and water is higher than the breakthrough pressure of the formation fracture network zhang et al 2015 in the long term safety considerations of underground storage projects the shale caprock must have a sufficiently high breakthrough pressure to prevent gas ch4 co2 or the additional gas produced by radioactive waste leakage from the shale into the shallow environment kim and santamarina 2013 the shale associated with a higher breakthrough pressure is accompanied by a higher sealing capacity however shale formation damage caused by induced fractures or reactivated pre existing fractures due to tectonic activity hydraulic fracturing or large scale fluid injection fang et al 2017 induces the gas to escape from the fracture network after overcoming the breakthrough pressure thereby resulting in shallow groundwater or surface water contaminants osborn et al 2011 molofsky et al 2013 vidic et al 2013 and atmospheric pollutions as well as the greenhouse effect montgomery et al 2006 howarth et al 2011 allen et al 2015 which has been a global topic of discussion the aforementioned issues highlight that an accurate measurement of the breakthrough pressure in shales is particularly important for the study of these resource and environment related issues shales serve as potential flow barriers against gas escaping outward through a capillary sealing mechanism controlled by the capillary pressures of small pores horsrud et al 1998 nojabaei et al 2016 the breakthrough pressure is the critical capillary pressure in a series of interconnected pores of arbitrarily large sizes that the differential pressure between non wetting phase gas and wetting phase water must overcome to break through the porous medium and form continuous gas pathways through the wetting phase hildenbrand et al 2002 li et al 2005 zhang and yu 2016 the breakthrough pressure pbt has been comprehensively regarded as a characteristic core scale parameter in the formation and exploration of oil and gas reservoirs as well as geological storage assessment i e ch4 co2 gao et al 2014 zhang and yu 2019 which can be described by the young laplace equation as follows 1 p bt p n p w 2 σ cos θ r e where pn and pw are the nonwetting gas or oil and wetting phase pressure water respectively σ is the surface tension at the interface between the nonwetting and wetting phase θ is the contact angle and re is the effective radius of the pore throat or effective aperture of the fracture the inverse dependence on re accounts for why the very fine pores of rocks can provide a large resistance to gas migration however since the aperture size of a fracture is several orders of magnitude larger than a matrix pore the capillary resistance to the gas in a fracture is much lower than that in the shale matrix with the result that fractures form preferential and primary flow paths karpyn et al 2009 zeng et al 2013 hence fractures control gas migration accumulation of reservoirs and the long term sealing capacities of caprocks jarvie et al 2007 therefore the breakthrough pressure of shale fractures can be considered as a critical parameter to better evaluate the hydrocarbon accumulation and exploitation and underground storage engineering in shales recently many researchers have conducted gas breakthrough experiments on low permeability sedimentary rocks to study the breakthrough pressure graham et al 2002 performed breakthrough experiments on water saturated clay specimens and found that gas breakthrough occurred in discrete channels with the lowest capillary resistance amann hildenbrand et al 2013 conducted breakthrough pressure experiments on completely saturated shales and found that the helium gas breakthrough pressure of shale matrix was higher than 20 mpa li et al 2015 conducted breakthrough pressure experiments on dry and completely saturated shales and found that a completely saturated shale was hard to be broken through and the gas breakthrough process can be divided three stages rezaeyan et al 2015 performed breakthrough experiments on saturated shale and anhydrite to analyze the effects of different parameters overburden pressure ambient temperature gas mixture on the breakthrough pressure however based on the breakthrough pressure measurements on water saturated shales zhang and yu 2016 found that microfractures in shales facilitated an easier gas breakthrough resulting in lower breakthrough pressures therefore the analysis of the breakthrough pressure of shales without considering the controlling effect of fractures will results in significant deviation even mistakes in engineering applications however almost all existing breakthrough pressure studies fundamentally focused on the rock matrix where there was little description and discussion on the fractures of the samples to our knowledge no quantitative studies on the breakthrough pressure of a fracture are available yet moreover previous breakthrough pressure studies have been almost carried out on dry or fully water saturated cores however due to the coexistence of water and gas in pores and fractures shales deep within the earth are always partially water saturated birdsell et al 2015 the theory of the breakthrough pressure in partially saturated shale fractures remains poorly understood so it is necessary to conduct gas breakthrough experiments on partially saturated fractures to understand the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the water content in the fracture the gas breakthrough pressure of low permeability rock is closely related to the water content in the rock zhang and yu 2016 2017 the water content in a partially saturated porous medium is usually quantified by the water saturation which can be obtained by weighing however for fractured cores the water saturations of fractures cannot be measured due to the interconnected fracture and pore networks it is very difficult to describe the relationship between breakthrough pressure and the water content in the fracture because the water saturation in an unsaturated porous medium can be represented by the matric potential for a given matric potential the water in the matrix pore spaces is in equilibrium with the water on the fracture surfaces the water content in the fracture can be represented by the matric potential when the matric potential is lower than a high extreme close to zero the fracture is partially saturated changes in the matric potential can alter the water content in the shale matrix and fracture thereby resulting in a change in the breakthrough pressure therefore to quantitatively describe the variation in the breakthrough pressure of a fracture with the water content the relationship between the matric potential and breakthrough pressure of a partially saturated fracture need to be studied in this study methane breakthrough experiments were conducted on fractures in shale cores under various matric potentials three shale cores were obtained from the carboniferous formation in the eastern qaidam basin in china the shale core contained a single fracture located centrally and longitudinally through the whole core along the axis a detailed description of the properties of shale core preparation of fractures and experimental devices was provided in section 2 the method for preparing water saturated cores with different matric potentials and the procedure for measuring the methane breakthrough pressure of fractures under different matric potentials were provided in section 3 based on the experimental results the relationship among the matric potential the water content in the fracture and the breakthrough pressure was qualitatively analyzed the mathematical relationship between the matric potential and breakthrough pressure of fractures was established the water film thicknesses on the fracture surfaces at various matric potentials were analyzed and the gas flow mechanism in the fracture was preliminary discussed 2 experimental samples and apparatus 2 1 shale samples three shale cores for the methane breakthrough experiments were taken from the carboniferous formation from the eastern qaidam basin in china carboniferous shale in the eastern basin is extensively developed and the sequence is complete gao et al 2017 these three shale samples were extracted from zk5 2 well from depths of 239 96 m 380 m and 356 05 m fig 1 and are referred to as samples s1 s2 and s3 in this study respectively the stratigraphic depth lithology and sampling stratum for the zk5 2 well are shown in fig 1 the samples were made into cylindrical cores the dimensional specifications depth diameter and length and properties permeability of these core samples are listed in table 1 the absolute gas permeability kabs of the shale samples was measured with the steady state flow method using methane as the penetrating fluid the shale samples possess a low permeability in the range of 10 18 10 19 m2 which implies that the shale matrix has a high capillary resistance pressure the nonclay mineral and clay mineral contents in the shale samples were measured by x ray diffraction xrd using shale powders with particle sizes smaller than 40 μm and 1 mm respectively a leco carbon sulfur analyzer was used to measure the total organic carbon toc content and an mpv sp micro photometer was applied to analyze the vitrinite reflectance ro a fracture was artificially induced due to the difficulty in obtaining a core with a single fracture located centrally and longitudinally through the whole core during the coring process to prepare a single fracture along the axis of the cylindrical sample the cylindrical core was positioned into a uniaxial compression device two thin steel sheets were placed into small notches along both sides of the core length to prevent core edge damage the core was encased in a shrinkable tube during the fracturing experiment to avoid direct contact between the core and the steel sheets following the encasement a uniaxial compression device was used to exert a load parallel to the bedding plane of the core on the thin steel notches to induce a single fracture the advantage of this method of inducement is that the resulting fracture was suitably located centrally and ran longitudinally throughout the core along the axis of the core afterwards both cylindrical halves of the fractured cores were joined together along the lateral boundaries using a silicon adhesive to avoid the slight offset of the fracture and make the fracture aperture remain constant during the experiment the created cores s1 s2 and s3 and the directions of splitting are displayed in fig 2 the pulse echo method which offers a convenient way to analyze elastic modulus and poisson s ratio without damaging the rock was applied to measure the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the fractured shale sample according to the method of american society for testing and materials 1999 all of the measurement results mineral content toc content ro elastic modulus and poisson s ratio are shown in table 2 2 2 experimental apparatus fig 3 shows a schematic of the experimental apparatus for the experiments to measure the breakthrough pressure and permeability the experimental device contains a core clamping unit a vacuum pumping system a liquid injection system a gas injection system a confining pressure system a detection unit and a data acquisition unit the core clamping unit is mainly composed of a core holder and a fluororubber sleeve with a high elasticity which is acid and pressure resistant the core is wrapped in a fluororubber sleeve put into the core holder and placed horizontally in a thermostat an isotropic confining pressure is used to simulate the in situ stresses and is continuously applied around the core using a syringe pump the vacuum pumping system is designed to eliminate air from the pipelines gas can be injected into the core holder at a constant pressure by the gas injection system the liquid injection system can pump liquid into the core holder at a constant flow rate two pressure sensors with a high precision 0 20 mpa 0 1 kpa are installed at both ends of the core holder to display the inlet and outlet pressures when gas breaches the rock core the detection system monitors bubbles at the outlet and the gas flow rate can be measured by a gas flow meter under the experimental conditions an electronic scale is used to weigh the water that is cumulatively collected in the liquid tank both the inlet and outlet pressures relative to the atmospheric pressure and the flow rates are recorded through a data acquisition system as shown in fig 3 the gas and liquid containers the gas and liquid injection systems the core holder the valves and the pipelines connecting these systems are thermostatically controlled due to the low porosity and low permeability it is very difficult to saturate a massive shale through immersion therefore an experimental apparatus is designed to obtain a completely saturated shale core as shown in fig 4 this device consists of a stainless steel container a liquid injection unit a gas compression unit a gas injection unit and a vacuum pumping unit the basic principle of the device is to use gas pressure to force water to penetrate into the pores and fractures of tight shale the amount of he adsorbed in shale can be considered negligible wang et al 2016 in addition he gas is hard to dissolve in water and does not interact with water and minerals in shale he gas is used as the non wetting fluid to pressurize the system 3 experimental procedures 3 1 moistening the samples to various matric potentials the partially saturated fractured shale samples with various matric potentials were obtained by using the relative humidity rh to control the balance between the water potential φw and matric potential φm tokunaga et al 2003 silva et al 2008 ferrari et al 2014 we first obtained a fully saturated fractured sample and then placed the saturated sample into a constant humidity chamber to balance the water potential and matric potential first the apparatus shown in fig 4 was used to obtain a fully saturated fractured core the shale core was dried at 105 c for 8 h and the dry weight m0 was measured the dry core was then placed into the stainless steel container and the air in the core and pipelines was removed by the vacuum pumping unit subsequently distilled water was injected into the core container and the core was fully immersed in water to ensure uniform saturation then he gas with a pressure of 10 mpa was introduced into the container to pressurize the system for at least 2 days until the weight of the core did not change and the completely saturated weight was recorded as m1 at this point the matrix and fracture were completely saturated and the matric potential in the completely saturated core is regarded as zero then the saturated core was placed in a constant humidity chamber where the fixed rh was controlled through saturated salt solutions of various compositions greenspan 1977 and the constant temperature 25 c 0 05 c was maintained by a thermostat the temperature and rh 0 100 0 01 were monitored by a probe during the experiment the salt solutions and corresponding rh in this experiment were provided in table 3 theoretically the water content in the fractured core ultimately reaches a stable value when the water potential and the total pore liquid chemical potential in the fractured core reach equilibrium the total potential in the fractured core is the sum matric potential and osmotic potential in pure water and fractured shale system the osmotic potential contribution little to the total potential and the osmotic potential can be ignored the assumption is justified in nearly all of vapor pressure equilibration system tokunaga et al 2003 the core was then weighed every 24 h when the core weight did not change for 7 consecutive days recorded as m2 the equilibrium condition was reached and the water in matrix pores and in the fracture was in equilibrium at this point the matric potential is approximately equal to the water potential and can be calculated from the kelvin s law as follows delage et al 1998 2 φ m φ w rt ρ w m w l n r h where r is the gas constant t is the kelvin temperature ρ w and mw are the density and the molecular mass of water the water saturation of the fractured shale core sw was calculated as follows 3 s w m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 100 after reaching equilibrium at the highest rh cores were then moistened at various saturated salt controlled environments for preparing the matric potential from 2 33 mpa down to 51 38 mpa 3 2 breakthrough pressure experiments three methods were used to conduct the gas breakthrough experiments mercury injection method residual capillary pressure approach and step by step method the step by step method which is most representative and reliable method to conduct breakthrough experiments li et al 2005 boulin et al 2013 zhao and yu 2017 2019 was applied in this study prior to breakthrough experiment a solid nonporous 50 mm diameter stainless steel cylinder was subjected to the methane experimental program to ensure there was no leakage of gas between the core and the fluororubber sleeve we found that there was no measurable gas leakage across the steel sample when the confining pressure was maintained 4 mpa above the injection pressure after checking the airtightness of the apparatus the breakthrough pressure and gas permeability of the dried cores were first measured then methane breakthrough experiments were conducted on the partially saturated fractured shale cores to obtain a partially saturated fracture at a given matric potential the fractured core was moistened according to section 3 1 the wetted core was then placed in the core holder the confining pressure was set to 16 mpa during the experimental run to prevent the core from being hydraulically fractured the core holder was placed under the confining pressure for 48 h and both ends of the core holder were in communication with a humidity environment of the same water potential as where the core samples were moistened whether 48 h is long enough for the samples to reach equilibrium remains to be further studied subsequently the entire detection system was vacuumed to remove the residual gas in the pipeline after that ch4 was injected into the inlet of the core holder at a desired lower pressure value initially and the outlet was detected by the gas detector throughout the whole experiment process the inlet pressure of the ch4 was then increased in a stepwise manner and adequate time intervals were offered for each step of the continuous injection process in this study to avoid overshooting and overestimating of breakthrough pressures when the injection pressure was less than 0 5 mpa the pressure increment in each step is 0 002 0 005 mpa and 0 01 0 02 mpa when the injection pressure was higher than 0 5 mpa the time lag of each step increment should be 30 min when the injection pressure is lower than 2 mpa 45 min when the pressure is between 2 and 5 mpa according to the determination method of gas breakthrough pressure in rock the people s republic of china standards of the petroleum and natural gas industry sy t 5748 2013 theoretically when the gas phase reaches the fracture due to the heterogeneous aperture structure and the rough surface at the capillary entry pressure the gas begins to enter the largest aperture an increase in gas pressure causes the gas to advance through the interconnected void spaces to the smaller aperture where the additional pressure is balanced by a higher capillary pressure the gas pressure continues to increase until the gas pressure is sufficiently high to overcome the capillary pressure of the narrowest aperture in the channel the gas breaks through the core and the gas migrates along the continuous pathway through the fracture therefore when continuous gas bubbles were observed at the outlet a continuous pathway for ch4 to pass through was formed and the gas broke through the pressure difference between the inlet pressure of the last step and the outlet pressure was recorded as the gas breakthrough pressure pbt at this point the gas source was closed and the inlet pressure variation was recorded until no gas was emitted at the outlet subsequently the inlet pressure was increased to value of breakthrough pressure to measure the effective permeability the permeability measurements lasted 0 5 h to obtain the effective ch4 permeability thereby obtaining the effective aperture the gas permeability of the fracture kg can be calculated as follows persoff and pruess 1995 bertels et al 2001 4 k g 2 p 0 q μ l z a p 1 2 p 2 2 z a where p1 p2 and p0 are the inlet pressure outlet pressure and standard atmospheric pressure respectively q is the volumetric flow rate of gas under standard atmospheric pressure μ is the gas dynamic viscosity under the experimental temperature and pressure conditions z is the compressibility factor at the experimental temperature and pressure conditions za is the compressibility factor at the experimental temperature and atmospheric pressure a is the cross section and l is the length of the core the fracture intrinsic permeability kf is a function of the hydraulic aperture brush and thomson 2003 konzuk and kueper 2004 5 k f e h 2 12 where eh is the hydraulic aperture which is defined as the aperture of a smooth fracture with the same dimensions generating the same volumetric flow as the rough fracture moreover the cross section can be calculated by eq 6 where w is the width of the fracture along the cross section 6 a e h w combined with eqs 5 and 6 eq 4 can be derived as follows 7 k f 1 12 12 μ q z w z a 2 p 0 l p 1 2 p 2 2 2 3 because only a small portion of the interconnected pores is involved in the gas migration process hildenbrand et al 2004 the effective aperture at the time of gas breakthrough can be obtained from eqs 5 and 7 it is noted that to apply eq 7 to calculate the fracture gas permeability it must be assumed that the contribution of the matrix to gas flow is negligible thus prior to the experiment to determine whether the flow through the shale matrix is negligible gas percolation experiments were conducted on the samples before and after fracturing we found that the flow rates of the shale samples after fracturing were more than three orders of magnitude greater than those of the cores before fracturing for the same inlet pressure this indicated that matrix flow had little influence on the measurement of fracture permeability all pressure and flow measurements were directly related to the fracture all breakthrough tests were performed at a temperature of 25 c 4 results and discussion gas breakthrough from water saturated rocks is a complex process involving the interaction between solid phase liquid phase and gas phase the water phase forms a water film on the solid particles under the adsorption and capillary forces which affects the migration of the gas phase in the pore spaces the gas breakthrough pressure which is the capillary pressure between the water phase and gas phase is mainly affected by the water content a quantitative description of the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and water content is needed 4 1 describing the water content in a fracture by the matric potential the quantitative description of the water content in a partially saturated porous medium usually depends on the water saturation due to the difficulty in measurement of water volume in the fracture in the fractured shale it is difficult to separately extract the water saturation of the fracture in a fractured shale core we use the matric potential to describe the water content in a partially saturated fracture the water phase in unsaturated porous media is reserved by both adsorption and capillarity buckingham 1907 and the matric potential φm encompasses the adsorptive and capillary effects on the water phase sposito 1981 tokunaga and wan 1997 or and tuller 2000 in constant humidity environment the water potential in a fracture is equal to the matric potential when the water in the fracture and matrix pores is in equilibrium at this point the water content in the fracture can be described by the matric potential determining the water content and water distribution in a fracture at various matric potentials is key to the subsequent analysis of the gas breakthrough mechanism the water saturations of fractured samples under various matric potentials are provided in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 increasing the matric potential causes more pores to be filled with water thereby resulting in a gradual increase in the water saturation of core at the beginning of the saturation process water preferentially enters the small pores and dead end pores through the large and interconnected pores and fractures as the matric potential increases water then begins to accumulate in the large and interconnected pores and fractures until the matric potential increases to zero the fractured samples are completely water saturated the water retained in the fractured sample is composed of the water in the matrix pores and in the fracture and the water in the matrix pore spaces is in equilibrium with the water on the fracture surface the increasing matric potential results in an increase in the water saturation in the fracture the water content in the fracture is determined by the amount of water in the matrix through the matric potential in the process of saturation water gradually enters the fracture under the actions of adsorption and capillary forces the total amount of water in the fracture is composed of the water film adsorbed on the solid surface and the capillary water held in the depressions on the fracture surface and both are termed films in a macroscopic sense tokunaga and wan 1997 at a low matric potential the water content in the fracture is low at this point the capillary filled water is discontinuous and the adsorptive film contribution to the water retained on the fracture surface is dominant or and tuller 2000 the water films adsorbed on the walls of the fracture are thin and cannot be freely removed as the matric potential increases the adsorptive film and capillary water film gradually become thicker the relatively thick films on the rough surfaces are generally conceptualized as networks of surface capillary channels attached to thin adsorbed films tokunaga and wan 1997 tuller and or 2002 as the amount of water in the fracture increases the small apertures are gradually sealed up by the water film and the capillary contribution to the water film thickness gradually becomes dominant subsequently the increasing matric potential causes the interconnected large apertures in the fracture to be gradually sealed by water film when the matric potential increases towards approximately zero the fracture is completely saturated by a water film 4 2 the relationship between the breakthrough pressure of a fracture and the matric potential samples 1 and 3 successfully survived all of the breakthrough pressure tests while sample 2 was crushed during the breakthrough experiments the breakthrough pressure measurement results for two samples under various matric potentials were shown in table 4 and the breakthrough pressure measurement processes were provided in fig 6 after gas breakthrough when gas continuously flows through the core the effective ch4 permeability was also measured the results of the effective ch4 permeability keff and the effective aperture eeff were also provided in table 4 as shown in table 4 with the matric potential increasing the capillary breakthrough pressure of the fracture increases significantly and the breakthrough time becomes increasingly longer fig 6 and the effective gas permeability and corresponding effective aperture gradually decrease through analysis of the experimental results we found that the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and effective aperture under various matric potentials can be described by the young laplace equation eq 1 the breakthrough pressure at a matric potential higher than 51 38 mpa was larger than that of the dry core this result can be attributed to the presence of water in the fracture fig 7 shows that increasing the matric potential results in an increase in the breakthrough pressure of the fracture and the breakthrough pressure increases slowly in the early stage and remarkably increases in the later stage this phenomenon may be caused by the reduction in the effective aperture resulting from the increase in the water film thickness in the fracture with increasing matric potential it is noted that water and air coexist within a partially saturated fracture and the amount of water as well as the distribution of water in the unsaturated fracture depend on the matric potential therefore based on the experimental results and water distribution characteristics of the fracture we establish the conceptual model of breakthrough pressure formation in unsaturated shale fractures shown in fig 8 the model qualitatively describes the relationship among the matric potential the water distribution characteristics of the fracture and the breakthrough pressure as depicted in fig 8 with increasing matric potential the water distribution in the rough fracture can be divided into three stages at relatively lower matric potentials the amount of water in the fracture is small and the water film on the fracture surface slowly increases with matric potential the film at this point is still very thin which only has a slight effect on the gas pathway connectivity fig 8a at this stage the ch4 breakthrough pressure is low and increases slowly with the matric potential fig 7 the effect of the water film on the breakthrough pressure is not notable as shown in fig 8b as the matric potential continues to increase the water film increases to a certain thickness where the two films form a water bridge and certain small apertures are blocked by water tuller et al 1999 this situation results in a remarkable reduction in the effective aperture and gas pathway connectivity as a result it is more difficult for gas to break through the fracture to form a continuous channel at this point according to the laplace equation the breakthrough pressure increases notably with increasing matric potential fig 7 and the water film begins to act to prevent gas from escaping from the fracture a further increase in the matric potential results in an increasing number of apertures sealed by water the breakthrough pressure continues to increase rapidly until the matric potential increases close to 0 the fracture and matrix are fully saturated as shown in fig 8c the fracture is completely blocked by water and the breakthrough pressure reaches a maximum to quantitatively describe the relationship between the breakthrough pressure of partially saturated fracture and the matric potential in the above experimental results the exponential model was fitted to the results for samples the high correlation coefficient r2 in fig 7 demonstrates that the exponential model can accurately represent the relationship between the breakthrough pressure of a fracture and the matric potential of each sample which can be uniformly described as follows 8 p bt a e b φ m p 0 where a b and p0 are fitting parameters which vary with the aperture size and roughness of the fracture the sum of a and p0 is equal to the breakthrough pressure of fracture when the matric potential is 0 the value of p0 is the breakthrough pressure of the fracture without water it can be seen from the exponential equation that the function of the growth rate d p bt d φ m is monotonically increasing and the growth rate reaches a maximum when the matric potential is equal to zero from fig 7 we found that the increase in breakthrough pressure with the matric potential proceeds from slow to fast process during which there is a turning point that begins to notably increase hence we define a critical value of the matric potential φ c of which its corresponding growth rate is equal to one tenth of the maximum growth rate and this growth rate is regarded as a criterion for determining the rapid growth when the matric potential is lower than φ c the growth rate of the breakthrough pressure is low when the matric potential is higher than φ c the growth rate of the breakthrough pressure begins to rapidly increase this critical value indicates that when the matric potential is equal to φ c the small apertures in the gas pathways are blocked by water films and the water films begin to act to prevent gas from escaping from the fracture the critical value of two samples is 4 3 mpa 5 2 mpa respectively we find that the critical value is consistent with the corresponding matric potential when the curve in fig 7 begins to increase notably after preliminary analysis the critical value is related to the aperture size and roughness of the fracture after gas breakthrough the effective aperture at the time of gas breakthrough can be obtained from effective ch4 permeability by comparing the experimental results we found that effective permeability was one to three orders of magnitude lower than the gas permeability of the dry fracture this finding shows that the presence of water in the fracture greatly affects the ability of gas to pass through the fracture as shown in fig 9 the effective ch4 permeability of the fracture decreases significantly with increasing matric potential this is because as the matric potential increases the water film thickness in the fracture gradually increases and the volume of the water sealed apertures increases thereby leading to a reduction in the connectivity of the gas channels this in turn causes a decrease in the effective ch4 permeability from fig 9 an exponential relationship between the effective ch4 permeability of the fracture and the matric potential can be found which can be defined as follows 9 k eff m e n φ m where m and n are fitting parameters which are constant for a given fracture the inlet gas pressure curves with time for samples in fig 10 are used to analyze the gas breakthrough process after gas begins to break through the curve can be divided into three stages according to the rate of decrease of the gas pressure during the first stage the gas pressure drops rapidly as an approximately straight line in the second stage the gas pressure decreases slowly during the third stage the gas pressure drops to a stable value these three stages are consistent with the breakthrough process of gas breaking through a saturated shale matrix in the study by hildenbrand et al 2002 in stage one because of the heterogeneous aperture size and structure the gas breakthrough process starts with the large apertures and channels with a suitable connectivity the displacement rate is high and the gas pressure thus drops rapidly in the second stage as the gas pressure declines spontaneous imbibition of some water occurs the water displaced in this stage is mainly residual water and re adsorbed water and it is not easy to form more channels in this stage the gas pressure thus decreases slowly or remains constant in the third stage as gas breakthrough progresses an increasing amount of water in the fracture is displaced more channels for gas to pass through are formed however there are still some apertures that are blocked by the residual water the displacement rate gradually decreases to 0 the gas pressure thus decreases until a stable value 4 3 water film thickness affecting gas breakthrough under various matric potentials the water film in a fracture causes a reduction in the effective aperture thereby resulting in an increase in the breakthrough pressure we attempt to mathematically analyze the water film thickness that influences the gas breakthrough from a rough fracture under various matric potentials we assume that a simple geometrical model of the fracture surface is composed of a number of individual rough elements as shown in fig 11 where α is the angle which is the roughness parameter of a single roughness element and ranges from a value of π 2 for a smooth plane surface to the limiting value 0 for an extremely rough surface we first analyze the water film adsorbed on the flat surface using the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory the disjoining pressure which is the sum of the van der waals forces the electrostatic forces and structural forces determines the stability and thickness of the water film adsorbed on the solid surface derjaguin et al 1987 thus equating the disjoining pressure to the negative matric potential the adsorbed film thickness h can be calculated as follows li et al 2016 10 a slg h 3 ε r ε 0 8 π ξ 1 ξ 2 2 1 h 2 f e h λ φ m where aslg is the hamaker constant for the interactions between the solid substrate water film and air ε0 is the vacuum permittivity εr is the relative permittivity of water ξ1 is the potential between the solid and water phase ξ2 is the potential between the water phase and air phase f is the structural strength coefficient and λ is the characteristic length of the water molecule in this study using aslg 1 10 20 j ε r 8 85 10 12f m ε 0 81 5 ξ1 ξ2 50 mv f 1 10 7 n m2 λ 1 5 nm li et al 2016 subsequently we analyze the capillary water retained in the groove fig 11 according to the augmented young laplace equation the radius of the water air meniscus curvature r for the unsaturated situation which is dependent on the matric potential can be calculated as follows 11 r σ φ m where α is the surface tension at the interface between the water phase and air phase σ 72 7 mn m 1 therefore the effective film thickness heff in the fracture can be calculated as follows 12 h eff 1 sin α 1 r h sin α from fig 12 we found that as the matric potential increases the water film thickness increases slowly in the early stages and increases remarkably in the later stage this phenomenon is consistent with the growth trend of the breakthrough pressure with the matric potential when gas invades a partially saturated fracture the gas liquid meniscus is in contact with the water films on the fracture surfaces the effective aperture at the time of gas breakthrough is approximately equal to the initial aperture without water minus the thickness of the water film however we found that even under very rough conditions α 10 the difference between the initial aperture without water and the effective aperture in table 4 is much larger than the total film thickness 2heff this inconsistency may be caused by the assumption that the total flow of gas in the fracture is entirely due to the darcy flow this assumption overestimates the permeability of the fracture and therefore the fracture aperture darabi et al 2012 also found that the apparent gas permeabilities in nanometer to micrometer size pores of shale are as much as 10 times greater than the gas permeability values obtained by darcy flow predictions in fact the flow mechanism of gas in the nanometer size to micrometer size pores of shale is very complicated which consists of darcy flow slip flow and knudsen diffusion flux javadpour 2009 gao et al 2017 the total gas mass flux is the linear superposition of darcy flow slip flow and knudsen diffusion flux which can be expressed as follows 13 j tot j darcy j slip j kn the apparent gas permeability of shale can be expressed as follows 14 k app k k b k p 2 k b t μ 3 τ π δ 2 p 2 zrt π m where k is the intrinsic permeability of the shale medium p is the pore pressure bk is the gas slippage factor ϕ is the porosity and τ is the tortuosity and kb is the knudsen diffusion coefficient under partially water saturated conditions these parameters change with the water content in the pores of shale and the gas flow becomes more complicated gao and yu 2018 this finding may indicate that after gas breakthrough the partially saturated fracture the gas flow in fractures needs to consider the slip flow and diffusion 5 conclusions quantitative descriptions of the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and water content are extremely important for the study of many resource and environment related topics the water content in a rock is usually quantified by the water saturation the quantitative description of the relationship is difficult for fractures the reason is that there is no way to describe the water saturation in a fracture because of the difficulty in the measurement of the water volume in the fracture we propose a method to describe the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the water content in a fracture in this method the relationship between the matric potential and water content of a core is determined experimentally under constant humidity conditions the water potential in a fracture is equal to the matric potential when the water in the fracture and matrix pores reaches equilibrium the water content in the fracture can be described by the matric potential by studying the relationship between the breakthrough pressure of the fracture and the matric potential the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and water content in the fracture is quantitatively described based on the experimental results we apply a conceptual model to qualitatively describe the relationship among the matric potential the water distribution in the fracture and the breakthrough pressure of the fracture at a low matric potential water forms very thin water films on the walls of the fracture and the effect of water on the breakthrough pressure is not distinct as the matric potential increases the increasing thickness of the water film results in a decrease in the effective aperture thereby causing an increase in the breakthrough pressure the breakthrough pressure of the fracture increases monotonically as an exponential relationship the increase in breakthrough pressure with the matric potential is a process from slow to fast we define a critical value of the matric potential and the growth rate of the critical value serves as a criterion for determining the rapid growth when the matric potential is higher than the critical value the breakthrough pressure of the fracture begins to increase rapidly the critical value is related to the fracture aperture size and roughness of the fracture the thicknesses of water films under various matric potentials were calculated our experimental data show that the difference between the initial aperture without water and the effective aperture at the time of breakthrough calculated by darcy s law is much larger than the calculated water film thickness this finding may indicate that gas seepage in partially saturated fractures is complex and slip flow and diffusion need to be considered the gas seepage mechanisms in shale fractures under partially saturated conditions remain to be further studied acknowledgments this work was supported by the national

assistance of mingjie chen associate editor the breakthrough pressures of shale fractures are of great significance for the understanding of shale gas seepage or accumulation co2 geological sequestration and radioactive waste storage in shale and pollution problems caused by gas leakage in this study three shale cores taken from the eastern qaidam basin in china were used to investigate the breakthrough pressures of partially saturated shale fractures the fractured shale core had a single longitudinal fracture across the core along the axis a quantitative description of the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the water content in the fracture is difficult because of the difficulty in the measurement of the water volume in the fracture we propose a method to describe this relationship in this method the water content in the fracture is described by the matric potential cores with different matric potentials were prepared by moistening the cores in different humidity environments methane breakthrough experiments were conducted on three core samples under six different matric potentials the six matric potential levels were 51 38 mpa 39 08 mpa 23 45 mpa 8 55 mpa 2 33 mpa and 0 mpa based on the experimental results we apply a conceptual model to qualitatively describe the relationship among the matric potential water distribution in the fracture and breakthrough pressure at a low matric potential water forms very thin water films on fracture surfaces and the effect of water on the breakthrough pressure is not notable as the matric potential increases the thickness of water film in the fracture increases and the increase in the breakthrough pressure become notably we establish a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and matric potential the experimental data show that the increase in breakthrough pressure with the matric potential is a process that proceeds from slow to fast and there is a critical value of matric potential in this process when the critical value is reached the connected gas passages are gradually sealed by water films and the breakthrough pressure begins to increase significantly keywords shale fracture breakthrough pressure matric potential partially saturated 1 introduction shales are commonly characterized by low porosities low permeabilities and complicated pore structure networks which make shales both reservoir rocks and caprocks chandler et al 2016 due to the low porosity and low permeability values shales are not only considered to be storage and migration sites for oil and gas resources ougier simonin et al 2016 but also rocks of interest for co2 geological sequestration as well as geological disposal of radioactive waste because of the excellent sealing efficiencies bolton et al 2000 tsang et al 2012 the problem of gas escaping after overcoming the breakthrough pressure in a shale is becoming the intersection of many resource and environmental issues such as the accumulation and exploitation of shale gas the long term safety of underground storage projects in shales co2 geological sequestration radioactive waste storage and underground gas storage reservoir and the pollution problems caused by gas leakage in a shale gas reservoir the excess pressure of shale gas mainly ch4 generated from organic matter must not be higher than the breakthrough pressure of the shale so that the gas can migrate and accumulate to form a gas reservoir in the trap structure romero sarmiento et al 2013 chapiro and bruining 2015 in the exploitation of low porosity and low permeability shale reservoirs gas can migrate to the production wellbore only when the differential pressure between gas and water is higher than the breakthrough pressure of the formation fracture network zhang et al 2015 in the long term safety considerations of underground storage projects the shale caprock must have a sufficiently high breakthrough pressure to prevent gas ch4 co2 or the additional gas produced by radioactive waste leakage from the shale into the shallow environment kim and santamarina 2013 the shale associated with a higher breakthrough pressure is accompanied by a higher sealing capacity however shale formation damage caused by induced fractures or reactivated pre existing fractures due to tectonic activity hydraulic fracturing or large scale fluid injection fang et al 2017 induces the gas to escape from the fracture network after overcoming the breakthrough pressure thereby resulting in shallow groundwater or surface water contaminants osborn et al 2011 molofsky et al 2013 vidic et al 2013 and atmospheric pollutions as well as the greenhouse effect montgomery et al 2006 howarth et al 2011 allen et al 2015 which has been a global topic of discussion the aforementioned issues highlight that an accurate measurement of the breakthrough pressure in shales is particularly important for the study of these resource and environment related issues shales serve as potential flow barriers against gas escaping outward through a capillary sealing mechanism controlled by the capillary pressures of small pores horsrud et al 1998 nojabaei et al 2016 the breakthrough pressure is the critical capillary pressure in a series of interconnected pores of arbitrarily large sizes that the differential pressure between non wetting phase gas and wetting phase water must overcome to break through the porous medium and form continuous gas pathways through the wetting phase hildenbrand et al 2002 li et al 2005 zhang and yu 2016 the breakthrough pressure pbt has been comprehensively regarded as a characteristic core scale parameter in the formation and exploration of oil and gas reservoirs as well as geological storage assessment i e ch4 co2 gao et al 2014 zhang and yu 2019 which can be described by the young laplace equation as follows 1 p bt p n p w 2 σ cos θ r e where pn and pw are the nonwetting gas or oil and wetting phase pressure water respectively σ is the surface tension at the interface between the nonwetting and wetting phase θ is the contact angle and re is the effective radius of the pore throat or effective aperture of the fracture the inverse dependence on re accounts for why the very fine pores of rocks can provide a large resistance to gas migration however since the aperture size of a fracture is several orders of magnitude larger than a matrix pore the capillary resistance to the gas in a fracture is much lower than that in the shale matrix with the result that fractures form preferential and primary flow paths karpyn et al 2009 zeng et al 2013 hence fractures control gas migration accumulation of reservoirs and the long term sealing capacities of caprocks jarvie et al 2007 therefore the breakthrough pressure of shale fractures can be considered as a critical parameter to better evaluate the hydrocarbon accumulation and exploitation and underground storage engineering in shales recently many researchers have conducted gas breakthrough experiments on low permeability sedimentary rocks to study the breakthrough pressure graham et al 2002 performed breakthrough experiments on water saturated clay specimens and found that gas breakthrough occurred in discrete channels with the lowest capillary resistance amann hildenbrand et al 2013 conducted breakthrough pressure experiments on completely saturated shales and found that the helium gas breakthrough pressure of shale matrix was higher than 20 mpa li et al 2015 conducted breakthrough pressure experiments on dry and completely saturated shales and found that a completely saturated shale was hard to be broken through and the gas breakthrough process can be divided three stages rezaeyan et al 2015 performed breakthrough experiments on saturated shale and anhydrite to analyze the effects of different parameters overburden pressure ambient temperature gas mixture on the breakthrough pressure however based on the breakthrough pressure measurements on water saturated shales zhang and yu 2016 found that microfractures in shales facilitated an easier gas breakthrough resulting in lower breakthrough pressures therefore the analysis of the breakthrough pressure of shales without considering the controlling effect of fractures will results in significant deviation even mistakes in engineering applications however almost all existing breakthrough pressure studies fundamentally focused on the rock matrix where there was little description and discussion on the fractures of the samples to our knowledge no quantitative studies on the breakthrough pressure of a fracture are available yet moreover previous breakthrough pressure studies have been almost carried out on dry or fully water saturated cores however due to the coexistence of water and gas in pores and fractures shales deep within the earth are always partially water saturated birdsell et al 2015 the theory of the breakthrough pressure in partially saturated shale fractures remains poorly understood so it is necessary to conduct gas breakthrough experiments on partially saturated fractures to understand the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the water content in the fracture the gas breakthrough pressure of low permeability rock is closely related to the water content in the rock zhang and yu 2016 2017 the water content in a partially saturated porous medium is usually quantified by the water saturation which can be obtained by weighing however for fractured cores the water saturations of fractures cannot be measured due to the interconnected fracture and pore networks it is very difficult to describe the relationship between breakthrough pressure and the water content in the fracture because the water saturation in an unsaturated porous medium can be represented by the matric potential for a given matric potential the water in the matrix pore spaces is in equilibrium with the water on the fracture surfaces the water content in the fracture can be represented by the matric potential when the matric potential is lower than a high extreme close to zero the fracture is partially saturated changes in the matric potential can alter the water content in the shale matrix and fracture thereby resulting in a change in the breakthrough pressure therefore to quantitatively describe the variation in the breakthrough pressure of a fracture with the water content the relationship between the matric potential and breakthrough pressure of a partially saturated fracture need to be studied in this study methane breakthrough experiments were conducted on fractures in shale cores under various matric potentials three shale cores were obtained from the carboniferous formation in the eastern qaidam basin in china the shale core contained a single fracture located centrally and longitudinally through the whole core along the axis a detailed description of the properties of shale core preparation of fractures and experimental devices was provided in section 2 the method for preparing water saturated cores with different matric potentials and the procedure for measuring the methane breakthrough pressure of fractures under different matric potentials were provided in section 3 based on the experimental results the relationship among the matric potential the water content in the fracture and the breakthrough pressure was qualitatively analyzed the mathematical relationship between the matric potential and breakthrough pressure of fractures was established the water film thicknesses on the fracture surfaces at various matric potentials were analyzed and the gas flow mechanism in the fracture was preliminary discussed 2 experimental samples and apparatus 2 1 shale samples three shale cores for the methane breakthrough experiments were taken from the carboniferous formation from the eastern qaidam basin in china carboniferous shale in the eastern basin is extensively developed and the sequence is complete gao et al 2017 these three shale samples were extracted from zk5 2 well from depths of 239 96 m 380 m and 356 05 m fig 1 and are referred to as samples s1 s2 and s3 in this study respectively the stratigraphic depth lithology and sampling stratum for the zk5 2 well are shown in fig 1 the samples were made into cylindrical cores the dimensional specifications depth diameter and length and properties permeability of these core samples are listed in table 1 the absolute gas permeability kabs of the shale samples was measured with the steady state flow method using methane as the penetrating fluid the shale samples possess a low permeability in the range of 10 18 10 19 m2 which implies that the shale matrix has a high capillary resistance pressure the nonclay mineral and clay mineral contents in the shale samples were measured by x ray diffraction xrd using shale powders with particle sizes smaller than 40 μm and 1 mm respectively a leco carbon sulfur analyzer was used to measure the total organic carbon toc content and an mpv sp micro photometer was applied to analyze the vitrinite reflectance ro a fracture was artificially induced due to the difficulty in obtaining a core with a single fracture located centrally and longitudinally through the whole core during the coring process to prepare a single fracture along the axis of the cylindrical sample the cylindrical core was positioned into a uniaxial compression device two thin steel sheets were placed into small notches along both sides of the core length to prevent core edge damage the core was encased in a shrinkable tube during the fracturing experiment to avoid direct contact between the core and the steel sheets following the encasement a uniaxial compression device was used to exert a load parallel to the bedding plane of the core on the thin steel notches to induce a single fracture the advantage of this method of inducement is that the resulting fracture was suitably located centrally and ran longitudinally throughout the core along the axis of the core afterwards both cylindrical halves of the fractured cores were joined together along the lateral boundaries using a silicon adhesive to avoid the slight offset of the fracture and make the fracture aperture remain constant during the experiment the created cores s1 s2 and s3 and the directions of splitting are displayed in fig 2 the pulse echo method which offers a convenient way to analyze elastic modulus and poisson s ratio without damaging the rock was applied to measure the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the fractured shale sample according to the method of american society for testing and materials 1999 all of the measurement results mineral content toc content ro elastic modulus and poisson s ratio are shown in table 2 2 2 experimental apparatus fig 3 shows a schematic of the experimental apparatus for the experiments to measure the breakthrough pressure and permeability the experimental device contains a core clamping unit a vacuum pumping system a liquid injection system a gas injection system a confining pressure system a detection unit and a data acquisition unit the core clamping unit is mainly composed of a core holder and a fluororubber sleeve with a high elasticity which is acid and pressure resistant the core is wrapped in a fluororubber sleeve put into the core holder and placed horizontally in a thermostat an isotropic confining pressure is used to simulate the in situ stresses and is continuously applied around the core using a syringe pump the vacuum pumping system is designed to eliminate air from the pipelines gas can be injected into the core holder at a constant pressure by the gas injection system the liquid injection system can pump liquid into the core holder at a constant flow rate two pressure sensors with a high precision 0 20 mpa 0 1 kpa are installed at both ends of the core holder to display the inlet and outlet pressures when gas breaches the rock core the detection system monitors bubbles at the outlet and the gas flow rate can be measured by a gas flow meter under the experimental conditions an electronic scale is used to weigh the water that is cumulatively collected in the liquid tank both the inlet and outlet pressures relative to the atmospheric pressure and the flow rates are recorded through a data acquisition system as shown in fig 3 the gas and liquid containers the gas and liquid injection systems the core holder the valves and the pipelines connecting these systems are thermostatically controlled due to the low porosity and low permeability it is very difficult to saturate a massive shale through immersion therefore an experimental apparatus is designed to obtain a completely saturated shale core as shown in fig 4 this device consists of a stainless steel container a liquid injection unit a gas compression unit a gas injection unit and a vacuum pumping unit the basic principle of the device is to use gas pressure to force water to penetrate into the pores and fractures of tight shale the amount of he adsorbed in shale can be considered negligible wang et al 2016 in addition he gas is hard to dissolve in water and does not interact with water and minerals in shale he gas is used as the non wetting fluid to pressurize the system 3 experimental procedures 3 1 moistening the samples to various matric potentials the partially saturated fractured shale samples with various matric potentials were obtained by using the relative humidity rh to control the balance between the water potential φw and matric potential φm tokunaga et al 2003 silva et al 2008 ferrari et al 2014 we first obtained a fully saturated fractured sample and then placed the saturated sample into a constant humidity chamber to balance the water potential and matric potential first the apparatus shown in fig 4 was used to obtain a fully saturated fractured core the shale core was dried at 105 c for 8 h and the dry weight m0 was measured the dry core was then placed into the stainless steel container and the air in the core and pipelines was removed by the vacuum pumping unit subsequently distilled water was injected into the core container and the core was fully immersed in water to ensure uniform saturation then he gas with a pressure of 10 mpa was introduced into the container to pressurize the system for at least 2 days until the weight of the core did not change and the completely saturated weight was recorded as m1 at this point the matrix and fracture were completely saturated and the matric potential in the completely saturated core is regarded as zero then the saturated core was placed in a constant humidity chamber where the fixed rh was controlled through saturated salt solutions of various compositions greenspan 1977 and the constant temperature 25 c 0 05 c was maintained by a thermostat the temperature and rh 0 100 0 01 were monitored by a probe during the experiment the salt solutions and corresponding rh in this experiment were provided in table 3 theoretically the water content in the fractured core ultimately reaches a stable value when the water potential and the total pore liquid chemical potential in the fractured core reach equilibrium the total potential in the fractured core is the sum matric potential and osmotic potential in pure water and fractured shale system the osmotic potential contribution little to the total potential and the osmotic potential can be ignored the assumption is justified in nearly all of vapor pressure equilibration system tokunaga et al 2003 the core was then weighed every 24 h when the core weight did not change for 7 consecutive days recorded as m2 the equilibrium condition was reached and the water in matrix pores and in the fracture was in equilibrium at this point the matric potential is approximately equal to the water potential and can be calculated from the kelvin s law as follows delage et al 1998 2 φ m φ w rt ρ w m w l n r h where r is the gas constant t is the kelvin temperature ρ w and mw are the density and the molecular mass of water the water saturation of the fractured shale core sw was calculated as follows 3 s w m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 100 after reaching equilibrium at the highest rh cores were then moistened at various saturated salt controlled environments for preparing the matric potential from 2 33 mpa down to 51 38 mpa 3 2 breakthrough pressure experiments three methods were used to conduct the gas breakthrough experiments mercury injection method residual capillary pressure approach and step by step method the step by step method which is most representative and reliable method to conduct breakthrough experiments li et al 2005 boulin et al 2013 zhao and yu 2017 2019 was applied in this study prior to breakthrough experiment a solid nonporous 50 mm diameter stainless steel cylinder was subjected to the methane experimental program to ensure there was no leakage of gas between the core and the fluororubber sleeve we found that there was no measurable gas leakage across the steel sample when the confining pressure was maintained 4 mpa above the injection pressure after checking the airtightness of the apparatus the breakthrough pressure and gas permeability of the dried cores were first measured then methane breakthrough experiments were conducted on the partially saturated fractured shale cores to obtain a partially saturated fracture at a given matric potential the fractured core was moistened according to section 3 1 the wetted core was then placed in the core holder the confining pressure was set to 16 mpa during the experimental run to prevent the core from being hydraulically fractured the core holder was placed under the confining pressure for 48 h and both ends of the core holder were in communication with a humidity environment of the same water potential as where the core samples were moistened whether 48 h is long enough for the samples to reach equilibrium remains to be further studied subsequently the entire detection system was vacuumed to remove the residual gas in the pipeline after that ch4 was injected into the inlet of the core holder at a desired lower pressure value initially and the outlet was detected by the gas detector throughout the whole experiment process the inlet pressure of the ch4 was then increased in a stepwise manner and adequate time intervals were offered for each step of the continuous injection process in this study to avoid overshooting and overestimating of breakthrough pressures when the injection pressure was less than 0 5 mpa the pressure increment in each step is 0 002 0 005 mpa and 0 01 0 02 mpa when the injection pressure was higher than 0 5 mpa the time lag of each step increment should be 30 min when the injection pressure is lower than 2 mpa 45 min when the pressure is between 2 and 5 mpa according to the determination method of gas breakthrough pressure in rock the people s republic of china standards of the petroleum and natural gas industry sy t 5748 2013 theoretically when the gas phase reaches the fracture due to the heterogeneous aperture structure and the rough surface at the capillary entry pressure the gas begins to enter the largest aperture an increase in gas pressure causes the gas to advance through the interconnected void spaces to the smaller aperture where the additional pressure is balanced by a higher capillary pressure the gas pressure continues to increase until the gas pressure is sufficiently high to overcome the capillary pressure of the narrowest aperture in the channel the gas breaks through the core and the gas migrates along the continuous pathway through the fracture therefore when continuous gas bubbles were observed at the outlet a continuous pathway for ch4 to pass through was formed and the gas broke through the pressure difference between the inlet pressure of the last step and the outlet pressure was recorded as the gas breakthrough pressure pbt at this point the gas source was closed and the inlet pressure variation was recorded until no gas was emitted at the outlet subsequently the inlet pressure was increased to value of breakthrough pressure to measure the effective permeability the permeability measurements lasted 0 5 h to obtain the effective ch4 permeability thereby obtaining the effective aperture the gas permeability of the fracture kg can be calculated as follows persoff and pruess 1995 bertels et al 2001 4 k g 2 p 0 q μ l z a p 1 2 p 2 2 z a where p1 p2 and p0 are the inlet pressure outlet pressure and standard atmospheric pressure respectively q is the volumetric flow rate of gas under standard atmospheric pressure μ is the gas dynamic viscosity under the experimental temperature and pressure conditions z is the compressibility factor at the experimental temperature and pressure conditions za is the compressibility factor at the experimental temperature and atmospheric pressure a is the cross section and l is the length of the core the fracture intrinsic permeability kf is a function of the hydraulic aperture brush and thomson 2003 konzuk and kueper 2004 5 k f e h 2 12 where eh is the hydraulic aperture which is defined as the aperture of a smooth fracture with the same dimensions generating the same volumetric flow as the rough fracture moreover the cross section can be calculated by eq 6 where w is the width of the fracture along the cross section 6 a e h w combined with eqs 5 and 6 eq 4 can be derived as follows 7 k f 1 12 12 μ q z w z a 2 p 0 l p 1 2 p 2 2 2 3 because only a small portion of the interconnected pores is involved in the gas migration process hildenbrand et al 2004 the effective aperture at the time of gas breakthrough can be obtained from eqs 5 and 7 it is noted that to apply eq 7 to calculate the fracture gas permeability it must be assumed that the contribution of the matrix to gas flow is negligible thus prior to the experiment to determine whether the flow through the shale matrix is negligible gas percolation experiments were conducted on the samples before and after fracturing we found that the flow rates of the shale samples after fracturing were more than three orders of magnitude greater than those of the cores before fracturing for the same inlet pressure this indicated that matrix flow had little influence on the measurement of fracture permeability all pressure and flow measurements were directly related to the fracture all breakthrough tests were performed at a temperature of 25 c 4 results and discussion gas breakthrough from water saturated rocks is a complex process involving the interaction between solid phase liquid phase and gas phase the water phase forms a water film on the solid particles under the adsorption and capillary forces which affects the migration of the gas phase in the pore spaces the gas breakthrough pressure which is the capillary pressure between the water phase and gas phase is mainly affected by the water content a quantitative description of the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and water content is needed 4 1 describing the water content in a fracture by the matric potential the quantitative description of the water content in a partially saturated porous medium usually depends on the water saturation due to the difficulty in measurement of water volume in the fracture in the fractured shale it is difficult to separately extract the water saturation of the fracture in a fractured shale core we use the matric potential to describe the water content in a partially saturated fracture the water phase in unsaturated porous media is reserved by both adsorption and capillarity buckingham 1907 and the matric potential φm encompasses the adsorptive and capillary effects on the water phase sposito 1981 tokunaga and wan 1997 or and tuller 2000 in constant humidity environment the water potential in a fracture is equal to the matric potential when the water in the fracture and matrix pores is in equilibrium at this point the water content in the fracture can be described by the matric potential determining the water content and water distribution in a fracture at various matric potentials is key to the subsequent analysis of the gas breakthrough mechanism the water saturations of fractured samples under various matric potentials are provided in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 increasing the matric potential causes more pores to be filled with water thereby resulting in a gradual increase in the water saturation of core at the beginning of the saturation process water preferentially enters the small pores and dead end pores through the large and interconnected pores and fractures as the matric potential increases water then begins to accumulate in the large and interconnected pores and fractures until the matric potential increases to zero the fractured samples are completely water saturated the water retained in the fractured sample is composed of the water in the matrix pores and in the fracture and the water in the matrix pore spaces is in equilibrium with the water on the fracture surface the increasing matric potential results in an increase in the water saturation in the fracture the water content in the fracture is determined by the amount of water in the matrix through the matric potential in the process of saturation water gradually enters the fracture under the actions of adsorption and capillary forces the total amount of water in the fracture is composed of the water film adsorbed on the solid surface and the capillary water held in the depressions on the fracture surface and both are termed films in a macroscopic sense tokunaga and wan 1997 at a low matric potential the water content in the fracture is low at this point the capillary filled water is discontinuous and the adsorptive film contribution to the water retained on the fracture surface is dominant or and tuller 2000 the water films adsorbed on the walls of the fracture are thin and cannot be freely removed as the matric potential increases the adsorptive film and capillary water film gradually become thicker the relatively thick films on the rough surfaces are generally conceptualized as networks of surface capillary channels attached to thin adsorbed films tokunaga and wan 1997 tuller and or 2002 as the amount of water in the fracture increases the small apertures are gradually sealed up by the water film and the capillary contribution to the water film thickness gradually becomes dominant subsequently the increasing matric potential causes the interconnected large apertures in the fracture to be gradually sealed by water film when the matric potential increases towards approximately zero the fracture is completely saturated by a water film 4 2 the relationship between the breakthrough pressure of a fracture and the matric potential samples 1 and 3 successfully survived all of the breakthrough pressure tests while sample 2 was crushed during the breakthrough experiments the breakthrough pressure measurement results for two samples under various matric potentials were shown in table 4 and the breakthrough pressure measurement processes were provided in fig 6 after gas breakthrough when gas continuously flows through the core the effective ch4 permeability was also measured the results of the effective ch4 permeability keff and the effective aperture eeff were also provided in table 4 as shown in table 4 with the matric potential increasing the capillary breakthrough pressure of the fracture increases significantly and the breakthrough time becomes increasingly longer fig 6 and the effective gas permeability and corresponding effective aperture gradually decrease through analysis of the experimental results we found that the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and effective aperture under various matric potentials can be described by the young laplace equation eq 1 the breakthrough pressure at a matric potential higher than 51 38 mpa was larger than that of the dry core this result can be attributed to the presence of water in the fracture fig 7 shows that increasing the matric potential results in an increase in the breakthrough pressure of the fracture and the breakthrough pressure increases slowly in the early stage and remarkably increases in the later stage this phenomenon may be caused by the reduction in the effective aperture resulting from the increase in the water film thickness in the fracture with increasing matric potential it is noted that water and air coexist within a partially saturated fracture and the amount of water as well as the distribution of water in the unsaturated fracture depend on the matric potential therefore based on the experimental results and water distribution characteristics of the fracture we establish the conceptual model of breakthrough pressure formation in unsaturated shale fractures shown in fig 8 the model qualitatively describes the relationship among the matric potential the water distribution characteristics of the fracture and the breakthrough pressure as depicted in fig 8 with increasing matric potential the water distribution in the rough fracture can be divided into three stages at relatively lower matric potentials the amount of water in the fracture is small and the water film on the fracture surface slowly increases with matric potential the film at this point is still very thin which only has a slight effect on the gas pathway connectivity fig 8a at this stage the ch4 breakthrough pressure is low and increases slowly with the matric potential fig 7 the effect of the water film on the breakthrough pressure is not notable as shown in fig 8b as the matric potential continues to increase the water film increases to a certain thickness where the two films form a water bridge and certain small apertures are blocked by water tuller et al 1999 this situation results in a remarkable reduction in the effective aperture and gas pathway connectivity as a result it is more difficult for gas to break through the fracture to form a continuous channel at this point according to the laplace equation the breakthrough pressure increases notably with increasing matric potential fig 7 and the water film begins to act to prevent gas from escaping from the fracture a further increase in the matric potential results in an increasing number of apertures sealed by water the breakthrough pressure continues to increase rapidly until the matric potential increases close to 0 the fracture and matrix are fully saturated as shown in fig 8c the fracture is completely blocked by water and the breakthrough pressure reaches a maximum to quantitatively describe the relationship between the breakthrough pressure of partially saturated fracture and the matric potential in the above experimental results the exponential model was fitted to the results for samples the high correlation coefficient r2 in fig 7 demonstrates that the exponential model can accurately represent the relationship between the breakthrough pressure of a fracture and the matric potential of each sample which can be uniformly described as follows 8 p bt a e b φ m p 0 where a b and p0 are fitting parameters which vary with the aperture size and roughness of the fracture the sum of a and p0 is equal to the breakthrough pressure of fracture when the matric potential is 0 the value of p0 is the breakthrough pressure of the fracture without water it can be seen from the exponential equation that the function of the growth rate d p bt d φ m is monotonically increasing and the growth rate reaches a maximum when the matric potential is equal to zero from fig 7 we found that the increase in breakthrough pressure with the matric potential proceeds from slow to fast process during which there is a turning point that begins to notably increase hence we define a critical value of the matric potential φ c of which its corresponding growth rate is equal to one tenth of the maximum growth rate and this growth rate is regarded as a criterion for determining the rapid growth when the matric potential is lower than φ c the growth rate of the breakthrough pressure is low when the matric potential is higher than φ c the growth rate of the breakthrough pressure begins to rapidly increase this critical value indicates that when the matric potential is equal to φ c the small apertures in the gas pathways are blocked by water films and the water films begin to act to prevent gas from escaping from the fracture the critical value of two samples is 4 3 mpa 5 2 mpa respectively we find that the critical value is consistent with the corresponding matric potential when the curve in fig 7 begins to increase notably after preliminary analysis the critical value is related to the aperture size and roughness of the fracture after gas breakthrough the effective aperture at the time of gas breakthrough can be obtained from effective ch4 permeability by comparing the experimental results we found that effective permeability was one to three orders of magnitude lower than the gas permeability of the dry fracture this finding shows that the presence of water in the fracture greatly affects the ability of gas to pass through the fracture as shown in fig 9 the effective ch4 permeability of the fracture decreases significantly with increasing matric potential this is because as the matric potential increases the water film thickness in the fracture gradually increases and the volume of the water sealed apertures increases thereby leading to a reduction in the connectivity of the gas channels this in turn causes a decrease in the effective ch4 permeability from fig 9 an exponential relationship between the effective ch4 permeability of the fracture and the matric potential can be found which can be defined as follows 9 k eff m e n φ m where m and n are fitting parameters which are constant for a given fracture the inlet gas pressure curves with time for samples in fig 10 are used to analyze the gas breakthrough process after gas begins to break through the curve can be divided into three stages according to the rate of decrease of the gas pressure during the first stage the gas pressure drops rapidly as an approximately straight line in the second stage the gas pressure decreases slowly during the third stage the gas pressure drops to a stable value these three stages are consistent with the breakthrough process of gas breaking through a saturated shale matrix in the study by hildenbrand et al 2002 in stage one because of the heterogeneous aperture size and structure the gas breakthrough process starts with the large apertures and channels with a suitable connectivity the displacement rate is high and the gas pressure thus drops rapidly in the second stage as the gas pressure declines spontaneous imbibition of some water occurs the water displaced in this stage is mainly residual water and re adsorbed water and it is not easy to form more channels in this stage the gas pressure thus decreases slowly or remains constant in the third stage as gas breakthrough progresses an increasing amount of water in the fracture is displaced more channels for gas to pass through are formed however there are still some apertures that are blocked by the residual water the displacement rate gradually decreases to 0 the gas pressure thus decreases until a stable value 4 3 water film thickness affecting gas breakthrough under various matric potentials the water film in a fracture causes a reduction in the effective aperture thereby resulting in an increase in the breakthrough pressure we attempt to mathematically analyze the water film thickness that influences the gas breakthrough from a rough fracture under various matric potentials we assume that a simple geometrical model of the fracture surface is composed of a number of individual rough elements as shown in fig 11 where α is the angle which is the roughness parameter of a single roughness element and ranges from a value of π 2 for a smooth plane surface to the limiting value 0 for an extremely rough surface we first analyze the water film adsorbed on the flat surface using the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek theory the disjoining pressure which is the sum of the van der waals forces the electrostatic forces and structural forces determines the stability and thickness of the water film adsorbed on the solid surface derjaguin et al 1987 thus equating the disjoining pressure to the negative matric potential the adsorbed film thickness h can be calculated as follows li et al 2016 10 a slg h 3 ε r ε 0 8 π ξ 1 ξ 2 2 1 h 2 f e h λ φ m where aslg is the hamaker constant for the interactions between the solid substrate water film and air ε0 is the vacuum permittivity εr is the relative permittivity of water ξ1 is the potential between the solid and water phase ξ2 is the potential between the water phase and air phase f is the structural strength coefficient and λ is the characteristic length of the water molecule in this study using aslg 1 10 20 j ε r 8 85 10 12f m ε 0 81 5 ξ1 ξ2 50 mv f 1 10 7 n m2 λ 1 5 nm li et al 2016 subsequently we analyze the capillary water retained in the groove fig 11 according to the augmented young laplace equation the radius of the water air meniscus curvature r for the unsaturated situation which is dependent on the matric potential can be calculated as follows 11 r σ φ m where α is the surface tension at the interface between the water phase and air phase σ 72 7 mn m 1 therefore the effective film thickness heff in the fracture can be calculated as follows 12 h eff 1 sin α 1 r h sin α from fig 12 we found that as the matric potential increases the water film thickness increases slowly in the early stages and increases remarkably in the later stage this phenomenon is consistent with the growth trend of the breakthrough pressure with the matric potential when gas invades a partially saturated fracture the gas liquid meniscus is in contact with the water films on the fracture surfaces the effective aperture at the time of gas breakthrough is approximately equal to the initial aperture without water minus the thickness of the water film however we found that even under very rough conditions α 10 the difference between the initial aperture without water and the effective aperture in table 4 is much larger than the total film thickness 2heff this inconsistency may be caused by the assumption that the total flow of gas in the fracture is entirely due to the darcy flow this assumption overestimates the permeability of the fracture and therefore the fracture aperture darabi et al 2012 also found that the apparent gas permeabilities in nanometer to micrometer size pores of shale are as much as 10 times greater than the gas permeability values obtained by darcy flow predictions in fact the flow mechanism of gas in the nanometer size to micrometer size pores of shale is very complicated which consists of darcy flow slip flow and knudsen diffusion flux javadpour 2009 gao et al 2017 the total gas mass flux is the linear superposition of darcy flow slip flow and knudsen diffusion flux which can be expressed as follows 13 j tot j darcy j slip j kn the apparent gas permeability of shale can be expressed as follows 14 k app k k b k p 2 k b t μ 3 τ π δ 2 p 2 zrt π m where k is the intrinsic permeability of the shale medium p is the pore pressure bk is the gas slippage factor ϕ is the porosity and τ is the tortuosity and kb is the knudsen diffusion coefficient under partially water saturated conditions these parameters change with the water content in the pores of shale and the gas flow becomes more complicated gao and yu 2018 this finding may indicate that after gas breakthrough the partially saturated fracture the gas flow in fractures needs to consider the slip flow and diffusion 5 conclusions quantitative descriptions of the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and water content are extremely important for the study of many resource and environment related topics the water content in a rock is usually quantified by the water saturation the quantitative description of the relationship is difficult for fractures the reason is that there is no way to describe the water saturation in a fracture because of the difficulty in the measurement of the water volume in the fracture we propose a method to describe the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the water content in a fracture in this method the relationship between the matric potential and water content of a core is determined experimentally under constant humidity conditions the water potential in a fracture is equal to the matric potential when the water in the fracture and matrix pores reaches equilibrium the water content in the fracture can be described by the matric potential by studying the relationship between the breakthrough pressure of the fracture and the matric potential the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and water content in the fracture is quantitatively described based on the experimental results we apply a conceptual model to qualitatively describe the relationship among the matric potential the water distribution in the fracture and the breakthrough pressure of the fracture at a low matric potential water forms very thin water films on the walls of the fracture and the effect of water on the breakthrough pressure is not distinct as the matric potential increases the increasing thickness of the water film results in a decrease in the effective aperture thereby causing an increase in the breakthrough pressure the breakthrough pressure of the fracture increases monotonically as an exponential relationship the increase in breakthrough pressure with the matric potential is a process from slow to fast we define a critical value of the matric potential and the growth rate of the critical value serves as a criterion for determining the rapid growth when the matric potential is higher than the critical value the breakthrough pressure of the fracture begins to increase rapidly the critical value is related to the fracture aperture size and roughness of the fracture the thicknesses of water films under various matric potentials were calculated our experimental data show that the difference between the initial aperture without water and the effective aperture at the time of breakthrough calculated by darcy s law is much larger than the calculated water film thickness this finding may indicate that gas seepage in partially saturated fractures is complex and slip flow and diffusion need to be considered the gas seepage mechanisms in shale fractures under partially saturated conditions remain to be further studied acknowledgments this work was supported by the national

6124,the knowledge of the impacts of environmental factors on actual evapotranspiration eta and evaporative fraction ef is important for understanding a range of land surface processes and for estimating eta however rare attempts have been made to quantitatively assess various controls on eta and ef to this end a comprehensive dataset was obtained from four study sites with different land cover conditions within an arid region from northwest china the boosted regression tree brt method was applied to assess the relative controls of different factors e g net radiation rn soil water content swc leaf area index lai relative humidity rh air temperature ta and wind speed ws on eta and ef in general the importance of swc in controlling eta increased with decreasing swc across the sites however the brt analysis revealed that although an arid climate was prevalent in the study region rn might outweigh swc in affecting eta at both irrigated and rain fed sites in addition rh also played a nonnegligible role in affecting eta at rain fed sites while the relative control of lai varied with swc moreover ef at the irrigated site was mainly controlled by lai and swc when swc was low while by ta when swc was higher rh was the most important in explaining the variability in ef at the rain fed sites which was followed by lai and swc this study underscores the importance of available

introduction actual evapotranspiration eta is one of the key components in terrestrial water cycles which can significantly modulate energy budgets at the land surface from local to continental scales oki and kanae 2006 trenberth et al 2009 maxwell and condon 2016 meanwhile an array of land surface processes and ecosystem functioning is tightly linked to evapotranspiration processes through complex feedback mechanisms such as precipitation p zveryaev and allan 2010 surface temperature seneviratne et al 2006 and gross primary production ciais et al 2005 despite its importance accurate estimation of eta still presents one of the grand challenges for scientific communities mainly due to its complex interactions with surrounding environments and to the limitations associated with different estimation methods c f allen et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 for example as a cost effective approach a wealth of numerical algorithms has been implemented in hydrological and land surface models to compute eta at various spatiotemporal scales which however requires priori knowledge of the relationships of eta with a multitude of influencing factors e g poulovassilis et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 vivoni et al 2010 wang and zlotnik 2012 owing to the highly nonlinear interactions with influencing factors evapotranspiration processes generally exhibit significant spatiotemporal variability resulting in large uncertainties in model based eta estimates liu et al 2013 bai and liu 2018 hu et al 2018 to improve the accuracy of eta estimates it is critically important to understand the impacts of various influencing factors on eta under different environmental conditions in the common practice of formulating conceptual or mathematical frameworks for estimating eta e g based on the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 two factors are generally considered to be the first order controls on eta namely available energy and available water zhang et al 2001 koster et al 2009 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 specifically in humid regions with relatively low energy inputs water primarily soil moisture is abundant and thus not a limiting factor for eta while water supplies gradually become limited for eta as climate gets drier e g in semi arid and arid regions in addition to the first order controls other environmental factors denoted as secondary factors hereafter may also play pivotal roles in modulating eta such as climate seasonality ryu et al 2008 maeda et al 2017 vegetation zhang et al 2001 vivoni et al 2008 soil property wang et al 2009 wang et al 2015 and groundwater soylu et

characteristics and hydrometeorological conditions of the study region e g zhang et al 2001 gu et al 2006 vivoni et al 2008 wang et al 2009 liljedahl et al 2011 zscheischler et al 2015 li et al 2016b bagley et al 2017 for instance vivoni et al 2008 revealed that the observed relation between eta and soil water in a monsoon dominated region from the southwest united states and northwest mexico was tightly linked to the process of vegetation greening based on the budyko framework wang et al 2009 showed that soil texture exerted a significant impact on the partitioning of p into eta and groundwater recharge and subsequently the partitioning of surface energy in the nebraska sandhills from the central united states by comparison using data measured at agricultural and grassland pasture sites across the central united states bagley et al 2017 found that land cover had an important influence on ef overall the aforementioned studies have demonstrated the substantial variations in the impacts of secondary factors on eta and ef regimes across regions even with similar hydroclimatic conditions it also underlines the importance of understanding the interplays between first order and secondary controls on eta and ef especially in semiarid and arid regions where water supplies are limited for eta and critical for ecosystem functioning despite previous studies there is still a dearth of investigation that quantifies the relative controls of first order and secondary factors on eta and ef under different environmental conditions with only few exceptions e g villarreal et al 2016 ma et al 2019 sun et al 2019 to this end a comprehensive dataset from the middle section of the heihe river basin hrb in northwest china was used where ecosystems are extremely sensitive to climate variability and anthropogenic disturbances zhang et al 2016a li et al 2018 the main aim of this study was to diagnose the relative controls of environmental variables on eta and ef under water limited conditions with varying land surface and hydrometeorological conditions 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study area was located in the middle section of the hrb in northwest china fig 1 the regional climate is of an arid continental monsoonal type with low p and high atmospheric demands for evapotranspiration four sites were selected in this study including bajitan bt daman dm huazhaizi hz and shenshawo sw detailed site descriptions are provided in table 1 across the sites there were noticeable differences in land surface conditions e g irrigation vs

and zomer 2019 2 2 data description a brief description of the dataset used in this study is given here which can be accessed from the cold and arid regions science data center carsdc http card westgis ac cn hiwater while detailed information can be found from the official website of the hiwater program or elsewhere in literature e g li et al 2013 liu et al 2018 specifically an eddy covariance ec tower and an automatic weather station aws were installed at each study site the ec sensors were mounted at the heights of 4 60 4 50 2 85 and 4 60 m above the ground surface at the bt dm hz and sw site respectively the csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc ut usa and the li7500 gas analyzer li cor inc ne usa were installed for measuring water vapor fluxes the ec data including le and h were sampled at a frequency of 10 hz which were then integrated to half hourly data at the aws a range of meteorological variables were recorded including p net radiation rn air

all data from the aws were collected at every 10 s and then integrated to 10 min values for consistency the swc data used in the following analysis were depth weighted over 0 60 cm based on the rooting depth of salsola passerine at the bt and hz sites yang et al 2013 moreover to assess the impact of vegetation on eta and ef under different land covers leaf area index lai was retrieved from the database of yin et al 2015 with a temporal resolution of 5 days and a spatial resolution of 1 km which was synthesized from multi source remote sensing data and verified by experimental observations before further analysis the 5 day lai data were linearly interpolated into daily values 2 3 pre processing of ec and aws data the ec data from the carsdc have been already processed at

sonic virtual temperature correction coordinate rotation density fluctuation correction and frequency response correction and 2 a four step procedure for quality controls on the half hourly flux data see liu et al 2011 for details after these procedures about 60 of raw data were retained for the aws data quality control procedures were also performed by removing the data that were either not physically sound or due to sensor malfunctioning to resolve the issue of missing data additional procedures were also carried out in this study first due to the missing ec data mostly occurring at night about 72 of the total missing data and also because of the low contributions of nocturnal eta to daily eta especially under arid and semiarid conditions novick et al 2009 le data between 8 00 and 19 00 were used to compute daily eta in this study in addition to minimize the effect of freezing conditions on soil water measurements the time period analyzed in this study was constrained from april to september of each calendar year based on ts data then daily eta and aws data were obtained by integrating the processed data based on the obtained daily data the energy closure ratio ecr was computed when all energy components i e rn le h and gs were available the ecr defined as le h rn gs is a standard measure to evaluate the performance of ec measurements wilson et al 2002 during the study period the average ecr was 0 89 0 93 0 81 and 0 84 for the bt dm hz and sw site respectively which was in general agreement with the values reported from the fluxnet sites stoy et al 2013 to minimize the energy closure problem data with ecr 0 87 0 15 were also removed as suggested by stoy et al 2013 finally data with ef values from 0 to 1 were retained in the analysis the final number of

variables on eta and ef note that for comparing hydrometeorological conditions among the study sites the gap filled ec data series were used which were filled using an online tool https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocweb papale et al 2006 2 4 statistical analysis the boosted regression tree brt method developed by elith et al 2008 was adopted in this study to quantify the impacts of different influencing factors on eta and ef the brt combines the regression tree method with boosting algorithms to predict the relationship between predictor and response variables specifically based on the recursive binary splitting method tree based models are fitted iteratively to the observations through which poorly modeled observations in existing trees are first identified and new trees are then added to improve the prediction of those poorly modeled observations until a minimum deviance between the observed and predicted data is reached elith et al 2008 the relative importance of a predictor variable is calculated based on the number of times that the variable is selected for splitting in the trees which is then weighted by the squared improvement to the whole tree based model breiman et al 1984 particularly the brt method does not require specific data distributions and is suitable for analyzing datasets with issues such as variable types outliers interactions between predictor variables and missing data elith et al 2008 as such it has been increasingly used in a range of scientific fields e g bhatt et al 2013 sayegh et al 2016 sun et al 2019 in this study the open source gbm package was employed to run the brt model using r software version 3 5 1 r core team 2018 a brief description of the package is given here and more detailed information can be found in elith et al 2008 specifically four key input parameters are required by the gbm package namely learning rate lr tree complexity tc the number of trees nt and bag fraction bg the parameter lr determines the contribution of each tree to the overall model and the parameter tc controls the structure of a tree these two parameters then determine the parameter nt that is required for the optimal performance of the tree model through a cross validation method here the maximum and minimum nt values were set to be 10 000 and 1000 respectively as suggested by elith et al 2008 different combinations of lr e g 0 05 0 01 0 005 and 0 001 tc e g 2 3 4 5 and 6 and bg e g 0 5 and 0 75 values were tested for each site and then site specific optimal combinations of those parameters given in table 3s and 4s were used to analyze the relative contributions of predictor variables in controlling eta and ef at each site six variables including rn swc lai rh ta and ws were selected as predictors in this study although recent studies have shown that vpd played an important role in regulating eta novick et al 2016 our preliminary analysis showed that the correlations between vpd and eta were not significant at the study sites except for at the dm site table 1s instead ta and rh both of which are tightly linked to vpd were selected as predictor variables in this study note that the multicollinearity in predictor variables may affect the performance of brt models to resolve this issue the multicollinearity among predictor variables was tested before the brt analysis based on pearson s correlation coefficient rp and variance inflation factor vif analysis aertsen et al 2012 dormann et al 2013 sun et al 2019 all predictor variables passed the multicollinearity test i e rp 0 7 and vif 5 as shown in the supplemental tables tables 1s and 2s a 10 fold cross validation method as illustrated in elith et al 2008 was used to build and assess the performance of the brt model specifically the dataset was first randomly divided into 10 equally sized subsets 9 of which were selected as training data to build the model with the remaining subset used to test the model performance this process was repeated 10 times to get the final modeled values the observed and modeled eta are compared in fig 1s while the comparison between observed and modeled ef is shown in fig 2s overall figs 1s and 2s showed good agreements between observations and modeling results for both eta and ef illustrating the viability of using the brt method in the study region 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrometeorology of the study sites the time series of daily eta along with p rn and swc during the study period is plotted in fig 2 while the time series of secondary factors e g lai ta rh and ws is provided in fig 3 fig 2 reveals strong seasonality in eta and associated first order controls at all sites for instance over 87 of annual p and 85 of annual eta occurred from april to september during the study period at all sites with regards to the interannual variability the distribution pattern of p varied noticeably between 2013 and 2014 although the amounts of annual p were similar in those two years for the same sites for example rainfall events were less frequent in 2013 at the bt site but with a much higher mean rainfall depth than in 2014 fig 2j there were also marked variations in interannual eta patterns at the rain fed sites although the variations in annual rn patterns at those sites were less obvious it can be seen from fig 2a e i and m that peak values of eta were substantially higher in 2013 e g at hz bt and sw which was mainly due to the larger rainfall events and subsequently higher swc in 2013 the smaller variability in interannual eta at the dm site was mostly attributed to irrigation which alleviated the water limit on eta it should be emphasized that although the study sites were located within a radius of 15 km fig 1 the spatial variability in eta and its first order controls was considerable across the sites for example rn at the dm and hz sites was higher than at the bt and sw sites mostly because of lower surface albedo at the dm and hz sites caused by higher vegetation density and wetter soil water conditions zhang and huang 2004 the spatial variability in swc was also noticeable reflecting an integrated effect of environmental conditions on soil water dynamics vereecken et al 2014 wang et al 2017a in particular due to the irrigation swc was the highest at the dm site meanwhile the average swc decreased from hz to sw and bt sites which was in line with the decreasing p amount from hz to sw and bt as displayed in fig 3 there was a pronounced seasonal variation in lai with a significant vegetation gradient across the sites fig 3a e i and m moreover the highest ta occurred during summer months which corresponded with the temporal variation in rn during the study period the average daily ta at the dm site was about 2 c lower than that at the other three sites mostly owing to the oasis cool island effect in summer caused by irrigation hao and li 2015 li et al 2016a in addition rh and ws also exhibited seasonal variations but less than ta the average ws at the dm site was much lower than at the other three sites which was likely due to the higher vegetation density and height at the dm site vautard et al 2010 in summary there were noticeable spatiotemporal variations in hydrometeorological and land surface conditions across the study sites providing an ideal experimental area for discerning the relative controls of various influencing factors on eta and ef in water limited regions 3 2 controls on eta the relationships of eta with swc and rn are plotted in fig 4 which generally shows positive correlations in various degrees across the study sites in particular when compared to those for the rain fed sites a stronger positive relationship emerged between rn and eta at the dm site rp 0 833 and p 0 001 resulting in less impact of swc on eta fig 4a the stronger positive rn eta relationship at the dm site was mostly due to irrigation which alleviated the water limiting effect on eta and led to the dominant control of rn on eta more importantly fig 4b d reveal that with decreasing swc levels at the rain fed sites the positive relationship between swc and eta became less scattered implying varying degrees of the soil water control on eta even under arid climatic conditions to further assess the relative controls of different environmental factors on eta results from the brt analysis are displayed in fig 5 overall with decreasing swc the relative contribution of rn in controlling eta decreased while the controls of swc increased across the study sites e g from dm to hz bt and sw the result is consistent with the common understanding of the interaction of eta with available energy and available water demonstrating the viability of using the brt method for discerning relative controls of various influencing factors on eta as expected due to irrigation the dominant control on eta was rn 64 6 at the dm site followed by lai 9 7 and swc 9 2 at the sw site which was the driest and with no vegetation swc 39 8 was the dominant factor in regulating eta followed by rn 23 5 and rh 22 0 more importantly despite the arid climate at the hz and bt sites e g p 144 4 mm year at the hz site and p 102 3 mm year at the bt site during the study period the brt results revealed that rn outweighed swc in controlling eta at both sites suggesting that available energy still played an important role in modulating evapotranspiration processes in the study area this result is in general agreement with the findings of villarreal et al 2016 and yang and zhou 2011 for instance villarreal et al 2016 showed that in northwest mexico where water was limited available energy was an important factor affecting seasonal and annual variations in eta it thus underscores the necessity of taking available energy into consideration when modelling eta even under water limited conditions fig 5 further shows that the relative contribution of lai in affecting eta during growing seasons varied noticeably under different land covers it appears that the importance of lai in controlling eta increased with decreasing vegetation density across the sites one of the possible reasons was the variations in the relative importance of soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t in eta at those sites for example surface swc e g 4 and 20 cm data are not shown here was larger at the dm and hz sites than at other two sites which might result in higher proportions of e in eta whereas the lower surface swc at the bt site might lead to relatively higher t in eta due to root water uptake from deeper soil layers with wetter water conditions as such eta was more responsive to lai at the bt site as a result of the relatively higher proportion of t in eta this explanation is also supported by observational evidence from areas with similar climatic conditions su et al 2015 specifically su et al 2015 showed that for desert plants in the hrb the proportion of t in eta was significantly higher under lower soil water conditions nevertheless investigation is still needed to further elucidate the role of vegetation in controlling eta under arid climatic conditions it can be seen from fig 5 that rh also played a nonnegligible role in affecting eta at the rain fed sites especially when rh was in the range from 20 to 70 fig 3s it was in agreement with the findings of zhang et al 2012 who showed that rh was important in determining eta in a temperate desert steppe from inner mongolia china in general rh is closely related to surface vapor conductance that directly controls eta salvucci and gentine 2013 however it should be noted that this result could also be partly attributed to the correlations of rh with other environmental variables at our study sites table 1s for example a strong positive correlation existed between rh and swc at the rainfed sites e g rp 0 465 for hz 0 387 for bt and 0 309 for sw with all p values less than 0 001 as rh was higher on rainy days with subsequently elevated soil water therefore rh could serve as a good indicator for soil water availability and thus for estimating eta in the study region overall the brt analysis revealed that in addition to the control of water inputs available energy e g rn and other environmental factors e g rh and lai might also play important roles in modulating eta in the study area with limited water supplies for eta especially the relative controls of those environmental variables on eta varied considerably with land surface and micro hydroclimatic conditions across the study sites it thus underscores the need to quantitatively define water limited and energy limited environments based on the relative controls of available water and available energy on eta and to evaluate the impacts of secondary factors on characterizing ef regimes under different climatic conditions haghighi et al 2018 3 3 controls on ef to understand the interaction between available water and energy partitioning the swc ef relationships at the study sites are plotted in fig 6 overall ef was positively correlated with swc under both irrigated and rain fed conditions which was consistent with previous reports koster et al 2009 ford et al 2014 haghighi et al 2018 at the dm site when swc was higher than roughly 30 the dependence of ef on swc was greatly reduced fig 6a as soil water was no longer a limiting factor for eta however it should be noted that the threshold value of swc at which ef levels may vary in different regions for instance haghighi et al 2018 showed that in early growing stages the threshold value of swc was about 10 at the walnut gulch arizona while about 15 at the freeman ranch texas both with semiarid climatic conditions by comparison the inflection point of swc was not clear at the sw site although swc reached above 15 moreover at the hz and bt sites the swc ef relationships were more scattered indicating that there were other factors controlling ef other than soil water ford et al 2014 williams and torn 2015 the results of controls on ef obtained from the brt analysis are presented in fig 7 contrary to the findings about eta fig 7 shows that swc lai and rh instead of rn had more influences on ef at the dm site swc 34 5 and lai 45 0 played the most important roles in controlling ef however it should be noted that ef at the dm site responded to swc and lai when swc and lai were lower than 30 and 1 0 respectively whereas ef showed less variations when swc and lai were above 30 and 1 0 respectively fig 4s to further evaluate the controls on ef at the dm site data with swc 30 and lai 1 0 both occurred during the same period were also analyzed by the brt method and the results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that ta 51 4 became the dominant factor controlling ef suggesting that the main driver of energy partitioning at the dm site changed from swc and lai to ta when soil water was no longer a limiting factor for eta it implies that both ef regimes and the controls on ef may change under varying environmental conditions even at the same place as suggested by gu et al 2006 and haghighi et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 the contribution of lai varied with surface conditions at the dm site the comparatively higher contribution of lai 45 0 mostly reflected the control of vegetation on ef when swc was relatively lower fig 4s implying that the energy partitioning was more sensitive to t as previously explained lower swc in surface soil layers might lead to smaller proportions of e in eta and thus eta was mainly controlled by lai at the hz and bt sites the pattern of relative contribution of lai on ef was similar to its relative contribution on eta as depicted in previous paragraphs specifically the relative contribution of lai on ef at the hz and bt site was 11 4 and 21 8 respectively closely related to plant water use strategy and the corresponding t eta under different soil water conditions su et al 2015 more interestingly the brt results shown in fig 7 revealed that instead of swc rh was the leading variable controlling the energy partitioning at the rain fed sites specifically the relative contribution of rh was 60 3 52 3 and 61 5 at the hz bt and sw sites respectively this might explain the large scatters in ef swc scatter plots in fig 6 the result is consistent with the findings of haghighi et al 2018 to some extent who found that the variation in rh was also important in identifying the transition between water limited and energy limited evaporative regimes under cloudy sky conditions in semiarid regions during early growing stages whereas our results showed that rh presented the dominant control on ef during the whole growing season under water limited conditions in order to further investigate why rh rather than swc contributes most to ef at these three rain fed sites the scatter plots of daily rh or swc with le or h were shown in fig 9 it can be clearly seen from fig 9 that there existed significant positive relationships between le and rh and between le and swc by comparison the negative relationships between h and rh were much more evident than those between h and swc at all these three sites for example at the hz site the rp of h rh reached 0 75 p 0 001 fig 9a while the rp of h swc was 0 35 p 0 001 fig 9d the positive relationships of le rh could be attributed to the tight link of rh and p processes as illustrated in previous paragraphs moreover the negative relationships of h rh were possibly related to the effect of air mass on surface air exchange and corresponding energy partitioning during monsoonal periods du et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b the warm and moist air deduced the temperature gradient between ground surface and air which suppressed h leading to the negative correlation between h and rh thus rh may serve as a better index on illuminating energy partitioning in the study region under rain fed conditions during monsoonal seasons overall it highlights that except for the soil water some other environmental factors e g rh and lai should also be considered when quantifying ef in arid regions 4 conclusions in this study a comprehensive dataset was analyzed using the brt approach to elucidate the relative controls of different environmental factors on eta and ef under different land cover conditions from a water limited region the main findings of this study were 1 although an arid climate was dominant in the study region the brt results showed that the available energy rn still played an important role in controlling eta under both irrigated and rain fed conditions and the relative control of rn on eta decreased with increasing soil water levels 2 the relative contribution of lai on eta varied with soil water conditions at rain fed sites 3 rh also played a nonnegligible role in affecting eta at the rain fed sites while the relative control of rh on eta was considerably lower at the irrigated site 4 the main controlling factors changed when the ef regime shifted at the irrigated site ef was primarily correlated with lai and swc when swc was relatively lower whereas ta played a dominant role in controlling ef when sufficient water supply was satisfied 5 the relative contribution of lai on ef varied with soil water conditions at rain fed sites and 6 rh outweighed swc in explaining the variability of ef at the rain fed sites this study underlines that the impacts of both available energy rn and the secondary factor rh on eta cannot be neglected even within water limited regions and that the effects of vegetation lai on eta and ef varied with soil water conditions further investigation is still warranted to investigate how different environmental factors

6124,the knowledge of the impacts of environmental factors on actual evapotranspiration eta and evaporative fraction ef is important for understanding a range of land surface processes and for estimating eta however rare attempts have been made to quantitatively assess various controls on eta and ef to this end a comprehensive dataset was obtained from four study sites with different land cover conditions within an arid region from northwest china the boosted regression tree brt method was applied to assess the relative controls of different factors e g net radiation rn soil water content swc leaf area index lai relative humidity rh air temperature ta and wind speed ws on eta and ef in general the importance of swc in controlling eta increased with decreasing swc across the sites however the brt analysis revealed that although an arid climate was prevalent in the study region rn might outweigh swc in affecting eta at both irrigated and rain fed sites in addition rh also played a nonnegligible role in affecting eta at rain fed sites while the relative control of lai varied with swc moreover ef at the irrigated site was mainly controlled by lai and swc when swc was low while by ta when swc was higher rh was the most important in explaining the variability in ef at the rain fed sites which was followed by lai and swc this study underscores the importance of available energy and other environmental factors e g rh and lai in modulating eta and ef in water limited regions which has important implications for parameterizing hydrological and land surface models for simulating eta and for identifying ef regimes more accurately keywords actual evapotranspiration evaporative fraction soil water water limited environment boosted regression tree heihe river basin 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration eta is one of the key components in terrestrial water cycles which can significantly modulate energy budgets at the land surface from local to continental scales oki and kanae 2006 trenberth et al 2009 maxwell and condon 2016 meanwhile an array of land surface processes and ecosystem functioning is tightly linked to evapotranspiration processes through complex feedback mechanisms such as precipitation p zveryaev and allan 2010 surface temperature seneviratne et al 2006 and gross primary production ciais et al 2005 despite its importance accurate estimation of eta still presents one of the grand challenges for scientific communities mainly due to its complex interactions with surrounding environments and to the limitations associated with different estimation methods c f allen et al 2011 wang and dickinson 2012 for example as a cost effective approach a wealth of numerical algorithms has been implemented in hydrological and land surface models to compute eta at various spatiotemporal scales which however requires priori knowledge of the relationships of eta with a multitude of influencing factors e g poulovassilis et al 2001 zhang et al 2004 vivoni et al 2010 wang and zlotnik 2012 owing to the highly nonlinear interactions with influencing factors evapotranspiration processes generally exhibit significant spatiotemporal variability resulting in large uncertainties in model based eta estimates liu et al 2013 bai and liu 2018 hu et al 2018 to improve the accuracy of eta estimates it is critically important to understand the impacts of various influencing factors on eta under different environmental conditions in the common practice of formulating conceptual or mathematical frameworks for estimating eta e g based on the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 two factors are generally considered to be the first order controls on eta namely available energy and available water zhang et al 2001 koster et al 2009 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 specifically in humid regions with relatively low energy inputs water primarily soil moisture is abundant and thus not a limiting factor for eta while water supplies gradually become limited for eta as climate gets drier e g in semi arid and arid regions in addition to the first order controls other environmental factors denoted as secondary factors hereafter may also play pivotal roles in modulating eta such as climate seasonality ryu et al 2008 maeda et al 2017 vegetation zhang et al 2001 vivoni et al 2008 soil property wang et al 2009 wang et al 2015 and groundwater soylu et al 2011 yue et al 2016 moreover elucidations of how those secondary factors affect eta are crucial for distinguishing evaporative fraction ef defined as latent heat flux le divided by the sum of latent and sensible h heat fluxes regimes e g energy limited vs water limited regimes which can offer valuable information for reducing uncertainties in eta estimates williams and torn 2015 bagley et al 2017 haghighi et al 2018 the relative importance of secondary factors in regulating eta and ef may vary considerably across regions primarily depending on land surface and subsurface characteristics and hydrometeorological conditions of the study region e g zhang et al 2001 gu et al 2006 vivoni et al 2008 wang et al 2009 liljedahl et al 2011 zscheischler et al 2015 li et al 2016b bagley et al 2017 for instance vivoni et al 2008 revealed that the observed relation between eta and soil water in a monsoon dominated region from the southwest united states and northwest mexico was tightly linked to the process of vegetation greening based on the budyko framework wang et al 2009 showed that soil texture exerted a significant impact on the partitioning of p into eta and groundwater recharge and subsequently the partitioning of surface energy in the nebraska sandhills from the central united states by comparison using data measured at agricultural and grassland pasture sites across the central united states bagley et al 2017 found that land cover had an important influence on ef overall the aforementioned studies have demonstrated the substantial variations in the impacts of secondary factors on eta and ef regimes across regions even with similar hydroclimatic conditions it also underlines the importance of understanding the interplays between first order and secondary controls on eta and ef especially in semiarid and arid regions where water supplies are limited for eta and critical for ecosystem functioning despite previous studies there is still a dearth of investigation that quantifies the relative controls of first order and secondary factors on eta and ef under different environmental conditions with only few exceptions e g villarreal et al 2016 ma et al 2019 sun et al 2019 to this end a comprehensive dataset from the middle section of the heihe river basin hrb in northwest china was used where ecosystems are extremely sensitive to climate variability and anthropogenic disturbances zhang et al 2016a li et al 2018 the main aim of this study was to diagnose the relative controls of environmental variables on eta and ef under water limited conditions with varying land surface and hydrometeorological conditions 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study area was located in the middle section of the hrb in northwest china fig 1 the regional climate is of an arid continental monsoonal type with low p and high atmospheric demands for evapotranspiration four sites were selected in this study including bajitan bt daman dm huazhaizi hz and shenshawo sw detailed site descriptions are provided in table 1 across the sites there were noticeable differences in land surface conditions e g irrigation vs rainfed conditions specifically the dm site was located in an artificial oasis with irrigated crops e g maize while the other three sites were under natural conditions without anthropogenic disturbances the hz site was part of a desert steppe with the highest vegetation coverage e g salsola passerine while the bt site sparsely covered by salsola passerine was located in the gobi desert and the sw site no vegetation was located in a sandy desert the micro hydrometeorological conditions were also slightly different in particular mean annual p p from 1960 to 2014 was estimated to be 138 144 166 and 156 mm year at the bt dm hz and sw sites wang et al 2017b respectively and the mean annual potential evapotranspiration et p was 1628 1557 1569 and 1601 mm year at each site trabucco and zomer 2019 2 2 data description a brief description of the dataset used in this study is given here which can be accessed from the cold and arid regions science data center carsdc http card westgis ac cn hiwater while detailed information can be found from the official website of the hiwater program or elsewhere in literature e g li et al 2013 liu et al 2018 specifically an eddy covariance ec tower and an automatic weather station aws were installed at each study site the ec sensors were mounted at the heights of 4 60 4 50 2 85 and 4 60 m above the ground surface at the bt dm hz and sw site respectively the csat3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific inc ut usa and the li7500 gas analyzer li cor inc ne usa were installed for measuring water vapor fluxes the ec data including le and h were sampled at a frequency of 10 hz which were then integrated to half hourly data at the aws a range of meteorological variables were recorded including p net radiation rn air temperature ta relative humidity rh wind speed ws wind direction air pressure and soil temperature ts in addition soil water content swc and soil heat flux gs were also measured at the aws hydra probe ii sensors stevens water monitoring systems inc or usa were installed to measure swc at various depths by converting soil dielectric permittivity to swc based on site specific calibration functions all data from the aws were collected at every 10 s and then integrated to 10 min values for consistency the swc data used in the following analysis were depth weighted over 0 60 cm based on the rooting depth of salsola passerine at the bt and hz sites yang et al 2013 moreover to assess the impact of vegetation on eta and ef under different land covers leaf area index lai was retrieved from the database of yin et al 2015 with a temporal resolution of 5 days and a spatial resolution of 1 km which was synthesized from multi source remote sensing data and verified by experimental observations before further analysis the 5 day lai data were linearly interpolated into daily values 2 3 pre processing of ec and aws data the ec data from the carsdc have been already processed at two steps 1 the use of the edire software http www geos ed ac uk abs research micromet edire for data corrections e g spike removal lag correction of h2o co2 relative to the vertical wind component sonic virtual temperature correction coordinate rotation density fluctuation correction and frequency response correction and 2 a four step procedure for quality controls on the half hourly flux data see liu et al 2011 for details after these procedures about 60 of raw data were retained for the aws data quality control procedures were also performed by removing the data that were either not physically sound or due to sensor malfunctioning to resolve the issue of missing data additional procedures were also carried out in this study first due to the missing ec data mostly occurring at night about 72 of the total missing data and also because of the low contributions of nocturnal eta to daily eta especially under arid and semiarid conditions novick et al 2009 le data between 8 00 and 19 00 were used to compute daily eta in this study in addition to minimize the effect of freezing conditions on soil water measurements the time period analyzed in this study was constrained from april to september of each calendar year based on ts data then daily eta and aws data were obtained by integrating the processed data based on the obtained daily data the energy closure ratio ecr was computed when all energy components i e rn le h and gs were available the ecr defined as le h rn gs is a standard measure to evaluate the performance of ec measurements wilson et al 2002 during the study period the average ecr was 0 89 0 93 0 81 and 0 84 for the bt dm hz and sw site respectively which was in general agreement with the values reported from the fluxnet sites stoy et al 2013 to minimize the energy closure problem data with ecr 0 87 0 15 were also removed as suggested by stoy et al 2013 finally data with ef values from 0 to 1 were retained in the analysis the final number of available days during the study period from 2013 to 2014 was 245 223 318 and 281 at the bt dm hz and sw site respectively which were used to analyze the relative controls of different environmental variables on eta and ef note that for comparing hydrometeorological conditions among the study sites the gap filled ec data series were used which were filled using an online tool https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocweb papale et al 2006 2 4 statistical analysis the boosted regression tree brt method developed by elith et al 2008 was adopted in this study to quantify the impacts of different influencing factors on eta and ef the brt combines the regression tree method with boosting algorithms to predict the relationship between predictor and response variables specifically based on the recursive binary splitting method tree based models are fitted iteratively to the observations through which poorly modeled observations in existing trees are first identified and new trees are then added to improve the prediction of those poorly modeled observations until a minimum deviance between the observed and predicted data is reached elith et al 2008 the relative importance of a predictor variable is calculated based on the number of times that the variable is selected for splitting in the trees which is then weighted by the squared improvement to the whole tree based model breiman et al 1984 particularly the brt method does not require specific data distributions and is suitable for analyzing datasets with issues such as variable types outliers interactions between predictor variables and missing data elith et al 2008 as such it has been increasingly used in a range of scientific fields e g bhatt et al 2013 sayegh et al 2016 sun et al 2019 in this study the open source gbm package was employed to run the brt model using r software version 3 5 1 r core team 2018 a brief description of the package is given here and more detailed information can be found in elith et al 2008 specifically four key input parameters are required by the gbm package namely learning rate lr tree complexity tc the number of trees nt and bag fraction bg the parameter lr determines the contribution of each tree to the overall model and the parameter tc controls the structure of a tree these two parameters then determine the parameter nt that is required for the optimal performance of the tree model through a cross validation method here the maximum and minimum nt values were set to be 10 000 and 1000 respectively as suggested by elith et al 2008 different combinations of lr e g 0 05 0 01 0 005 and 0 001 tc e g 2 3 4 5 and 6 and bg e g 0 5 and 0 75 values were tested for each site and then site specific optimal combinations of those parameters given in table 3s and 4s were used to analyze the relative contributions of predictor variables in controlling eta and ef at each site six variables including rn swc lai rh ta and ws were selected as predictors in this study although recent studies have shown that vpd played an important role in regulating eta novick et al 2016 our preliminary analysis showed that the correlations between vpd and eta were not significant at the study sites except for at the dm site table 1s instead ta and rh both of which are tightly linked to vpd were selected as predictor variables in this study note that the multicollinearity in predictor variables may affect the performance of brt models to resolve this issue the multicollinearity among predictor variables was tested before the brt analysis based on pearson s correlation coefficient rp and variance inflation factor vif analysis aertsen et al 2012 dormann et al 2013 sun et al 2019 all predictor variables passed the multicollinearity test i e rp 0 7 and vif 5 as shown in the supplemental tables tables 1s and 2s a 10 fold cross validation method as illustrated in elith et al 2008 was used to build and assess the performance of the brt model specifically the dataset was first randomly divided into 10 equally sized subsets 9 of which were selected as training data to build the model with the remaining subset used to test the model performance this process was repeated 10 times to get the final modeled values the observed and modeled eta are compared in fig 1s while the comparison between observed and modeled ef is shown in fig 2s overall figs 1s and 2s showed good agreements between observations and modeling results for both eta and ef illustrating the viability of using the brt method in the study region 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrometeorology of the study sites the time series of daily eta along with p rn and swc during the study period is plotted in fig 2 while the time series of secondary factors e g lai ta rh and ws is provided in fig 3 fig 2 reveals strong seasonality in eta and associated first order controls at all sites for instance over 87 of annual p and 85 of annual eta occurred from april to september during the study period at all sites with regards to the interannual variability the distribution pattern of p varied noticeably between 2013 and 2014 although the amounts of annual p were similar in those two years for the same sites for example rainfall events were less frequent in 2013 at the bt site but with a much higher mean rainfall depth than in 2014 fig 2j there were also marked variations in interannual eta patterns at the rain fed sites although the variations in annual rn patterns at those sites were less obvious it can be seen from fig 2a e i and m that peak values of eta were substantially higher in 2013 e g at hz bt and sw which was mainly due to the larger rainfall events and subsequently higher swc in 2013 the smaller variability in interannual eta at the dm site was mostly attributed to irrigation which alleviated the water limit on eta it should be emphasized that although the study sites were located within a radius of 15 km fig 1 the spatial variability in eta and its first order controls was considerable across the sites for example rn at the dm and hz sites was higher than at the bt and sw sites mostly because of lower surface albedo at the dm and hz sites caused by higher vegetation density and wetter soil water conditions zhang and huang 2004 the spatial variability in swc was also noticeable reflecting an integrated effect of environmental conditions on soil water dynamics vereecken et al 2014 wang et al 2017a in particular due to the irrigation swc was the highest at the dm site meanwhile the average swc decreased from hz to sw and bt sites which was in line with the decreasing p amount from hz to sw and bt as displayed in fig 3 there was a pronounced seasonal variation in lai with a significant vegetation gradient across the sites fig 3a e i and m moreover the highest ta occurred during summer months which corresponded with the temporal variation in rn during the study period the average daily ta at the dm site was about 2 c lower than that at the other three sites mostly owing to the oasis cool island effect in summer caused by irrigation hao and li 2015 li et al 2016a in addition rh and ws also exhibited seasonal variations but less than ta the average ws at the dm site was much lower than at the other three sites which was likely due to the higher vegetation density and height at the dm site vautard et al 2010 in summary there were noticeable spatiotemporal variations in hydrometeorological and land surface conditions across the study sites providing an ideal experimental area for discerning the relative controls of various influencing factors on eta and ef in water limited regions 3 2 controls on eta the relationships of eta with swc and rn are plotted in fig 4 which generally shows positive correlations in various degrees across the study sites in particular when compared to those for the rain fed sites a stronger positive relationship emerged between rn and eta at the dm site rp 0 833 and p 0 001 resulting in less impact of swc on eta fig 4a the stronger positive rn eta relationship at the dm site was mostly due to irrigation which alleviated the water limiting effect on eta and led to the dominant control of rn on eta more importantly fig 4b d reveal that with decreasing swc levels at the rain fed sites the positive relationship between swc and eta became less scattered implying varying degrees of the soil water control on eta even under arid climatic conditions to further assess the relative controls of different environmental factors on eta results from the brt analysis are displayed in fig 5 overall with decreasing swc the relative contribution of rn in controlling eta decreased while the controls of swc increased across the study sites e g from dm to hz bt and sw the result is consistent with the common understanding of the interaction of eta with available energy and available water demonstrating the viability of using the brt method for discerning relative controls of various influencing factors on eta as expected due to irrigation the dominant control on eta was rn 64 6 at the dm site followed by lai 9 7 and swc 9 2 at the sw site which was the driest and with no vegetation swc 39 8 was the dominant factor in regulating eta followed by rn 23 5 and rh 22 0 more importantly despite the arid climate at the hz and bt sites e g p 144 4 mm year at the hz site and p 102 3 mm year at the bt site during the study period the brt results revealed that rn outweighed swc in controlling eta at both sites suggesting that available energy still played an important role in modulating evapotranspiration processes in the study area this result is in general agreement with the findings of villarreal et al 2016 and yang and zhou 2011 for instance villarreal et al 2016 showed that in northwest mexico where water was limited available energy was an important factor affecting seasonal and annual variations in eta it thus underscores the necessity of taking available energy into consideration when modelling eta even under water limited conditions fig 5 further shows that the relative contribution of lai in affecting eta during growing seasons varied noticeably under different land covers it appears that the importance of lai in controlling eta increased with decreasing vegetation density across the sites one of the possible reasons was the variations in the relative importance of soil evaporation e and vegetation transpiration t in eta at those sites for example surface swc e g 4 and 20 cm data are not shown here was larger at the dm and hz sites than at other two sites which might result in higher proportions of e in eta whereas the lower surface swc at the bt site might lead to relatively higher t in eta due to root water uptake from deeper soil layers with wetter water conditions as such eta was more responsive to lai at the bt site as a result of the relatively higher proportion of t in eta this explanation is also supported by observational evidence from areas with similar climatic conditions su et al 2015 specifically su et al 2015 showed that for desert plants in the hrb the proportion of t in eta was significantly higher under lower soil water conditions nevertheless investigation is still needed to further elucidate the role of vegetation in controlling eta under arid climatic conditions it can be seen from fig 5 that rh also played a nonnegligible role in affecting eta at the rain fed sites especially when rh was in the range from 20 to 70 fig 3s it was in agreement with the findings of zhang et al 2012 who showed that rh was important in determining eta in a temperate desert steppe from inner mongolia china in general rh is closely related to surface vapor conductance that directly controls eta salvucci and gentine 2013 however it should be noted that this result could also be partly attributed to the correlations of rh with other environmental variables at our study sites table 1s for example a strong positive correlation existed between rh and swc at the rainfed sites e g rp 0 465 for hz 0 387 for bt and 0 309 for sw with all p values less than 0 001 as rh was higher on rainy days with subsequently elevated soil water therefore rh could serve as a good indicator for soil water availability and thus for estimating eta in the study region overall the brt analysis revealed that in addition to the control of water inputs available energy e g rn and other environmental factors e g rh and lai might also play important roles in modulating eta in the study area with limited water supplies for eta especially the relative controls of those environmental variables on eta varied considerably with land surface and micro hydroclimatic conditions across the study sites it thus underscores the need to quantitatively define water limited and energy limited environments based on the relative controls of available water and available energy on eta and to evaluate the impacts of secondary factors on characterizing ef regimes under different climatic conditions haghighi et al 2018 3 3 controls on ef to understand the interaction between available water and energy partitioning the swc ef relationships at the study sites are plotted in fig 6 overall ef was positively correlated with swc under both irrigated and rain fed conditions which was consistent with previous reports koster et al 2009 ford et al 2014 haghighi et al 2018 at the dm site when swc was higher than roughly 30 the dependence of ef on swc was greatly reduced fig 6a as soil water was no longer a limiting factor for eta however it should be noted that the threshold value of swc at which ef levels may vary in different regions for instance haghighi et al 2018 showed that in early growing stages the threshold value of swc was about 10 at the walnut gulch arizona while about 15 at the freeman ranch texas both with semiarid climatic conditions by comparison the inflection point of swc was not clear at the sw site although swc reached above 15 moreover at the hz and bt sites the swc ef relationships were more scattered indicating that there were other factors controlling ef other than soil water ford et al 2014 williams and torn 2015 the results of controls on ef obtained from the brt analysis are presented in fig 7 contrary to the findings about eta fig 7 shows that swc lai and rh instead of rn had more influences on ef at the dm site swc 34 5 and lai 45 0 played the most important roles in controlling ef however it should be noted that ef at the dm site responded to swc and lai when swc and lai were lower than 30 and 1 0 respectively whereas ef showed less variations when swc and lai were above 30 and 1 0 respectively fig 4s to further evaluate the controls on ef at the dm site data with swc 30 and lai 1 0 both occurred during the same period were also analyzed by the brt method and the results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 that ta 51 4 became the dominant factor controlling ef suggesting that the main driver of energy partitioning at the dm site changed from swc and lai to ta when soil water was no longer a limiting factor for eta it implies that both ef regimes and the controls on ef may change under varying environmental conditions even at the same place as suggested by gu et al 2006 and haghighi et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 the contribution of lai varied with surface conditions at the dm site the comparatively higher contribution of lai 45 0 mostly reflected the control of vegetation on ef when swc was relatively lower fig 4s implying that the energy partitioning was more sensitive to t as previously explained lower swc in surface soil layers might lead to smaller proportions of e in eta and thus eta was mainly controlled by lai at the hz and bt sites the pattern of relative contribution of lai on ef was similar to its relative contribution on eta as depicted in previous paragraphs specifically the relative contribution of lai on ef at the hz and bt site was 11 4 and 21 8 respectively closely related to plant water use strategy and the corresponding t eta under different soil water conditions su et al 2015 more interestingly the brt results shown in fig 7 revealed that instead of swc rh was the leading variable controlling the energy partitioning at the rain fed sites specifically the relative contribution of rh was 60 3 52 3 and 61 5 at the hz bt and sw sites respectively this might explain the large scatters in ef swc scatter plots in fig 6 the result is consistent with the findings of haghighi et al 2018 to some extent who found that the variation in rh was also important in identifying the transition between water limited and energy limited evaporative regimes under cloudy sky conditions in semiarid regions during early growing stages whereas our results showed that rh presented the dominant control on ef during the whole growing season under water limited conditions in order to further investigate why rh rather than swc contributes most to ef at these three rain fed sites the scatter plots of daily rh or swc with le or h were shown in fig 9 it can be clearly seen from fig 9 that there existed significant positive relationships between le and rh and between le and swc by comparison the negative relationships between h and rh were much more evident than those between h and swc at all these three sites for example at the hz site the rp of h rh reached 0 75 p 0 001 fig 9a while the rp of h swc was 0 35 p 0 001 fig 9d the positive relationships of le rh could be attributed to the tight link of rh and p processes as illustrated in previous paragraphs moreover the negative relationships of h rh were possibly related to the effect of air mass on surface air exchange and corresponding energy partitioning during monsoonal periods du et al 2018 zhang et al 2016b the warm and moist air deduced the temperature gradient between ground surface and air which suppressed h leading to the negative correlation between h and rh thus rh may serve as a better index on illuminating energy partitioning in the study region under rain fed conditions during monsoonal seasons overall it highlights that except for the soil water some other environmental factors e g rh and lai should also be considered when quantifying ef in arid regions 4 conclusions in this study a comprehensive dataset was analyzed using the brt approach to elucidate the relative controls of different environmental factors on eta and ef under different land cover conditions from a water limited region the main findings of this study were 1 although an arid climate was dominant in the study region the brt results showed that the available energy rn still played an important role in controlling eta under both irrigated and rain fed conditions and the relative control of rn on eta decreased with increasing soil water levels 2 the relative contribution of lai on eta varied with soil water conditions at rain fed sites 3 rh also played a nonnegligible role in affecting eta at the rain fed sites while the relative control of rh on eta was considerably lower at the irrigated site 4 the main controlling factors changed when the ef regime shifted at the irrigated site ef was primarily correlated with lai and swc when swc was relatively lower whereas ta played a dominant role in controlling ef when sufficient water supply was satisfied 5 the relative contribution of lai on ef varied with soil water conditions at rain fed sites and 6 rh outweighed swc in explaining the variability of ef at the rain fed sites this study underlines that the impacts of both available energy rn and the secondary factor rh on eta cannot be neglected even within water limited regions and that the effects of vegetation lai on eta and ef varied with soil water conditions further investigation is still warranted to investigate how different environmental factors
