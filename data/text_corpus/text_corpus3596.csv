17980,with increasing freshwater scarcity and greater use of seawater fluctuating salinities are becoming common in water treatment systems this can be challenging for salinity sensitive processes like nitrification especially in recirculating aquaculture systems ras where maintaining nitrification efficiency is crucial for fish health this study was undertaken to determine if prior exposure to seawater priming could improve nitrification in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr under salinity increase from freshwater to seawater the results showed that seawater primed freshwater mbbrs had less than 10 reduction in nitrification activity and twice the ammonia oxidation capacity of the unprimed bioreactors after seawater transfer the primed biofilms had different microbial community composition but the same nitrifying taxa suggesting that priming promoted physiological adaptation of the nitrifiers priming may also have strengthened the extrapolymeric matrix protecting the nitrifiers in mbbrs started up in brackish water 12 salinity seawater priming had no significant impact on the nitrification activity and the microbial community composition these bioreactors were inherently robust to salinity increase likely because they were already primed to osmotic stress by virtue of their native salinity of 12 the results show that osmotic stress priming is an effective strategy for improving salinity acclimation in nitrifying biofilms and can be applied to water treatment systems where salinity variations are expected graphical abstract image 1 keywords

a widely used process for ammonia removal in wastewater treatment however this biological process is sensitive to variations in salinity as the nitrifying microorganisms can be inhibited or lysed by changes in the osmotic pressure csonka 1989 madigan et al 2018 several industrial and municipal effluents have fluctuating salt concentrations such as those from tanneries food processing or cities with seawater flushing cui et al 2009 lefebvre and moletta 2006 yu et al 2002 variable salinity is also common in recirculating aquaculture systems ras ras are land based fish production systems with water treatment processes including nitrifying bioreactors for biological ammonia removal in ras for atlantic salmon salmo salar the salinity is typically increased from freshwater to brackish water or seawater after smoltification kinyage et al 2019 navada et al 2019 especially in ras and in effluents discharged to water bodies with aquatic life maintaining nitrification efficiency during salinity variations is essential as both ammonia and nitrite an intermediate in the nitrification process can be extremely toxic at concentrations as low as 1 mgn l 1 timmons and ebeling 2010 studies have shown that the nitrification activity begins to decrease significantly at salinities higher than 10 bassin et al 2012a navada et al 2019 thus in this study salinity acclimation will refer to adaptation to salinities above 10 although nitrifying bioreactors can be acclimated to higher salinities it is difficult to avoid a loss in nitrification rate in the initial period after salinity increase bassin et al 2012a gonzalez silva et al 2016 navada et al 2019 moreover the acclimatization process is slow and can take weeks or even months bassin et al 2012a 2011 sharrer et al 2007 salt adapted inocula can reduce but not necessarily eliminate the negative impact of salinity change on nitrification panswad and anan 1999 shi et al 2012 further in ras inoculation can pose a biosecurity risk to the fish it is therefore necessary to develop a strategy to increase the salinity resistance of nitrifying biofilms so that salinity changes may be performed without hindering the bioreactor performance studies have shown that the performance of bioreactors may be influenced by their operational history cabrol et al 2016 saur et al 2016 bioreactors are often more functionally stable to environmental disturbances such as toxic substances or high nutrient loading when previously exposed to a smaller dose of the same disturbance cabrol et al 2016 and references within perturbations of biofilms especially in the initial growth phase may influence the microbial community succession and the structure of the finally established community cabrol et al 2016 ohashi et al 1995 saur et al 2016 alternatively the microorganisms in the biofilm may respond physiologically to the perturbations and become more tolerant to future stresses priming also called predictive response strategy or acquired stress tolerance is a phenomenon where microorganisms exposed to a mild external stress show an improved response to a more severe stress in the future usually through phenotypical modifications such as changes in gene expression or metabolism hilker et al 2016 mitchell et al 2009 rillig et al 2015 priming as a physiological strategy has been observed in bacterial cultures subjected to osmotic stress andrade linares et al 2016 jenkins et al 1990 however the response of microbial communities to priming may differ greatly from that of pure cultures priming of microbial communities can not only modify the physiological phenotype of the microorganisms but also alter the microbial community composition due to differences in the priming capabilities of the community members and complex microbial interactions rillig et al 2015 studies on the response of nitrifying microbial communities to osmotic stress priming are limited a study on nitrifying sludge showed that adaptation to 10 g cl l 1 16 salinity did not improve the nitrification performance at higher salinities moussa et al 2006 to the best of our knowledge the effect of osmotic stress priming in nitrifying microbial communities especially in biofilms has not been well researched the objective of this study was to determine if seawater priming could improve salinity acclimation in nitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr it was hypothesized that the primed treatment would undergo lesser reduction in nitrification performance than the unprimed treatment when the salinity was increased from freshwater to seawater with this objective we investigated the effect of seawater priming on mbbrs initially started up in fresh and brackish water respectively 2 materials methods 2 1 experimental setup and design the experiment was performed on continuously operated mbbrs with four treatments in duplicate the setup was similar to that described in navada et al 2019 two treatments f0 f1 were started in freshwater fw whereas the other two b0 b1 were started in brackish water bw at 12 salinity table 1 thereafter f1 and b1 were transferred to seawater sw 32 salinity by increasing the salinity in gradual daily increments 10 11 day 1 over three and two days respectively these treatments were operated in seawater for two weeks while f0 and b0 were operated at their native salinities thereafter all reactors were transferred to fw in approx one day and operated for 24 days finally all reactors were transferred to seawater salinity increased in the same manner as in the priming stage and operated for 31 days the biofilm carriers anoxk chip p krüger kaldnes as norway were started in a fw and bw ras mbbr with fish feed nh4cl nano2 and nahco3 with no fish in the system these carriers had been used previously in the ras so they were disinfected with acid and base prior to start up the experimental reactors were filled with biofilm carriers 35 by volume from the fw and bw ras mbbrs after two and four weeks of start up respectively to acclimatize the carriers to the experimental system the reactors were operated for one month on synthetic medium the synthetic medium had an ammonia concentration of 700 1130 mgn l 1 with the following nutrients per mg of nh4 n 7 14 mg caco3 supplied by nahco3 0 1 mg p as na2hpo4 12h2o 0 1 mg p as kh2po4 0 1 mg mg as mgso4 and 0 003 mg fe as fecl3 zhu et al 2016 sucrose 2 4 g was added daily in the last 19 days of the acclimatization period with few exceptions to boost biofilm growth by heterotrophic bacteria bassin et al 2012b to minimize reactor bias the biomedia were intermixed and redistributed to the reactors ten days before starting the experiment the experiment was started after the acclimatization period the mbbrs were operated at 12 4 0 5 c ph 7 5 0 3 and aerated with an air flow of 40 nl min 1 dissolved oxygen saturation 80 100 each reactor was provided synthetic medium at a flow rate of 2 3 ml min 1 corresponding to an average ammonia loading rate of 0 22 0 04 gn m 2 d 1 in addition dilution water was provided to each reactor from a buffer tank one per treatment via a multichannel peristaltic pump ismatec ism404 mcp cole parmer usa salinity changes for each treatment were performed by controlling the salinity in buffer tanks by adjusting the freshwater and seawater flow rates thus changing the reactor salinity gradually navada et al 2019 in the freshwater and seawater phases the hydraulic retention time hrt was approximately 5 h dilution flow 119 7 ml min 1 during the native and priming phases the reactors had a higher hrt of 12 h dilution flow 50 3 ml min 1 as this period was designed to simulate the start up phase of mbbrs temperature ph dissolved oxygen salinity and flow rates of synthetic medium dilution water and air were measured daily with few exceptions using the methods described in navada et al 2019 ammonia in the synthetic medium and in each reactor and nitrite concentration in each reactor were measured using the phenate method and colorimetric method respectively apha 2017 2 2 nitrification performance the in situ ammonia oxidation rate aor in situ in each reactor was calculated by ammonia mass balance assuming pseudo steady state over 24 h navada et al 2019 for each mbbr the maximum ammonia oxidation rate aormax and the maximum nitrite oxidation rate normax were determined by performing capacity tests each test was conducted by running the mbbr in a batch mode by closing the inlets and outlets the reactor was spiked with 170 350 ml of either synthetic medium or a spike solution to obtain an initial ammonia concentration of 4 18 mgn l 1 in the mbbr the ammonia spike solution had the same proportions of nutrients per nh4 n as the synthetic medium except iron made up in deionized water no spike was added if the in situ ammonia concentration was already high 4 mgn l 1 ammonia concentration was measured every 5 31 min during the capacity test the nitrite capacity test was performed similarly each reactor was spiked with 8 20 mg no2 n l 1 by adding 200 250 ml of a spike solution made with nano2 and deionized water water samples were analyzed every 5 15 min to determine the no2 n concentration 2 3 microbial analyses before each ammonia capacity test three biofilm carriers were sampled from each reactor and preserved at 80 c for each test one biofilm sample from each treatment was analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing on ion personal genome machine using the procedures for analysis and data processing described in navada et al 2019 briefly 10 20 mm pieces were cut out from the thawed carriers and placed into 1 5 ml tubes containing atl buffer qiagen netherlands biofilm was detached in a qiagen tissuelyser ii 30hz s 1 10 min pcr amplification was performed with ion 16s metagenomics kit cat no a26216 thermofisher the kit includes two sets of primer pools targeting variable regions v2 4 8 and v3 6 7 9 respectively sequences are deposited in genbank with accession number prjna614452 2 4 data analysis and statistics aormax or normax was calculated from the slope of regression lines of the nh4 n or no2 n concentration vs time as there was little difference between duplicate reactors the combined data from both reactors were used to fit a regression line for each treatment with a minimum of 14 samples per test supplementary information b analysis of covariance ancova was used to detect significant differences between the slopes of the regression lines of the primed and unprimed treatments fox and weisberg 2011 navada et al 2019 on days 74 75 nitrification activity in f0 ceased suddenly due to suspected metals deficiency supplementary information section a 1 therefore all analyses are reported for days 1 73 unless otherwise specified for the microbial analysis the operational taxonomic unit otu table was normalized to the sum of sample reads otus with a maximum of less than 0 1 in any sample were filtered out the α diversity of each sample was calculated using the first order diversity number n1 eh where h refers to the shannon diversity index richness count of otus n0 and evenness n1 n0 hill 1973 ordination was performed using principal coordinates analysis pcoa based on bray curtis dissimilarity between the biofilm samples permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova based on bray curtis and sørensen dice indices was used to test the hypothesis of equal community composition between groups of biofilm samples anderson 2001 differences were considered statistically significant at a confidence interval of 95 p 0 05 physicochemical variables are reported as mean standard deviation sd whereas calculated variables such as aormax are reported

nitrification activity in the freshwater f treatments the primed treatment f1 had significantly higher ammonia oxidation capacity aormax than f0 in the seawater phase fig 1 a until day 45 the aormax in f0 operated in fw was relatively stable at 0 26 0 05 gn m 2 d 1 in this period the aormax in f1 was lower than in f0 likely due to a reduction during the priming phase however after the second transfer to seawater day 50 f1 showed no significant reduction in aormax which in fact increased by 80 after three weeks in seawater in contrast aormax in f0 decreased by 55 upon transfer to seawater the aor in situ and ammonia concentration in the mbbrs were in alignment with the aormax fig 2 a c the nitrite oxidation capacity normax was also higher in f1 than in f0 in the seawater phase fig 1c until the seawater phase the normax in f1 was 9 50 lower than that in f0 after transfer to the sw phase normax in f1 initially reduced by 10 but increased to 35 higher than that in the fw phase after two weeks in seawater in contrast normax in f0 initially decreased by 35 on transfer to seawater and decreased further by 90 after 15 days throughout the study normax was higher than aormax in both treatments except in f0 on day 64 indicating complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate nitrite concentration in the mbbrs during normal operation was consistently below 0 4 mgn l 1 days 1 73 fig 2e 3 2 nitrification activity in the brackish water b treatments in general the aormax in b0 and b1 did not differ significantly during the study fig 1b further the aormax in both treatments was not impacted by seawater transfer both in the priming and sw phases upon transfer to freshwater the treatments suffered a 45 60 reduction in aormax however within three weeks in fw aormax in b1 recovered completely whereas b0 recovered to 80 of the original aormax in the seawater phase the aormax did not decrease rather it increased by 30 50 after three weeks in seawater the aor in situ in both treatments was limited by the ammonia substrate during most of the study fig 2b d in contrast to aormax the normax was negatively impacted by salinity increase during the priming phase b1 at 32 salinity had significantly lower normax than b0 12 salinity fig 1d after day 40 the normax in the two treatments did not differ significantly in the sw phase the normax reduced to half the capacity in freshwater in the priming and seawater phases normax was lower than aormax fig 1b d during the priming phase the nitrite concentration in b1 increased to a maximum of 2 mgn l 1 fig 2f but after transfer to freshwater the nitrite concentration in both treatments decreased to less than 0 2 mgn l 1 in three weeks in the sw phase although the nitrite concentration increased slightly it was still below 0 5 mgn l 1 3 3 microbial community composition of the 1434 otus detected in the biofilm 25 were identified as nitrifying bacteria after filtering out the rare otus 452 otus remained including 15 nitrifying otus supplementary information table a 1 the nitrifying bacteria constituted up to 55 of the total reads the rest were likely heterotrophic bacteria fig 3 supplementary information fig a 6 the aob otus that could be classified at the genus species level were nitrosomonas n sp and nitrosospira n multiformis the nob were candidatus nitrotoga nitrotoga nitrospira n marina n sp and nitrobacter n vulgaris four otus were classified only to the family level as nitrosomonadaceae 2 otus nitrospiraceae 1 otu and nitrospinaceae 1 otu nitrosomonas was the dominant aob genus in all the treatments among the nob candidatus nitrotoga was the dominant genus although a few samples in the b treatments had nitrobacter as the most abundant nitrospira was detected exclusively in the f treatments whereas nitrobacter was detected only in the b treatments for both the f and b treatments the α diversity in the primed and unprimed treatment did not differ significantly both based on all the otus and the nitrifying otus except for evenness of the nitrifying community in b0 and b1 p 0 04 table 2 for the f and b treatments separately ordination by pcoa showed that time was the primary factor influencing both the total and nitrifying microbial community composition fig 4 further on any given day the bray curtis similarity between the nitrifying communities of the primed and unprimed treatments was 64 90 f treatments and 56 92 b treatments supplementary information fig a 5 the permanova results showed that the community composition of f0 and f1 on days 31 50 were significantly different both based on the bray curtis index r2 0 48 p 0 03 and the sørensen dice index r2 0 45 p 0 03 however the nitrifying community composition of f0 and f1 was significantly different only based on the bray curtis index r2 0 52 p 0 03 but not on the sørensen dice index r2 0 13 p 0 32 for the b treatments both the overall and nitrifying community composition of b0 and b1 were not significantly different throughout the experiment based on both the distance metrics p 0 2 4 discussion growth history can influence biofilm behavior ohashi et al 1995 saur et al 2016 in addition to having different native salinities the biofilm carriers in f and b treatments had slightly different histories before being transferred to the experimental reactors the f carriers had been disinfected and stored dry before start up in the ras mbbr whereas the b carriers had been disinfected in the bw ras mbbr and immediately started up again the b carriers were also cultured two weeks longer in the ras mbbrs than f before being transferred to the experimental system nonetheless the nitrification activity in all treatments was similar on day 1 indicating that all treatments had similar nitrifying capacity in the beginning of the study fig 1 thus the differences in salinity acclimation of the f and b treatments are primarily attributed to the difference in native salinity the primed treatment f1 had twice the aormax and 20 higher normax than f0 upon transfer to the sw phase fig 1a c this provides strong evidence that seawater priming increased salinity acclimation in the biofilm salinity acclimation in nitrifying biofilms may be achieved by physiological adaptation of the existing nitrifiers bassin et al 2011 navada et al 2019 or by a shift in the microbial community composition to favor more halotolerant bacteria bassin et al 2012a gonzalez silva 2016 the acclimation strategy may be influenced by the manner of salinity change bassin et al 2012a navada et al 2019 in this study the microbial community composition in f1 changed after the priming phase days 31 50 and became significantly different from that in f0 this indicates that the species inventory in the biofilm was influenced by priming the compositional change was mainly due to changes in the heterotrophic community rather than in the nitrifying community as the heterotrophic group has higher functional redundancy than nitrifiers a larger range of microorganisms within this group can perform the same function in different salinity regimes despite the change in the overall community composition the α diversity did not change likely because of trade offs between priming ability and competitiveness rillig et al 2015 also the nitrifying community composition in f0 and f1 remained highly similar up to 90 similarity and the same nitrifying taxa were present in both treatments this suggests that the higher nitrification activity in f1 was due to a physiological adaptation to salinity through the production of compatible solutes rather than a compositional change in the nitrifying bacteria the dominant aob in this study the genus nitrosomonas is reported to be able to adapt to seawater bassin et al 2011 foesel et al 2008 the dominant nob candidatus nitrotoga can also survive salinity increase from freshwater to seawater navada et al 2019 and has been detected in marine ras biofilms keuter et al 2017 spearman rank correlation between the nitrifying otus in the f and b treatments separately showed that most of the significant correlations were positive supplementary information fig a 7 this suggests that the growth of all the nitrifying bacterial species in the various salinity regimes was similar and that the competition between the species was not very strong the high osmotic tolerance of nitrifying bacteria underscores the immense versatility of this bacterial group to survive in different salinities despite the existence of exclusive freshwater and marine species a previous study supports this observation by reporting that although freshwater brackish water 22 salinity and seawater biofilms contained several unique nitrifying otus the dominant otus at each salinity were detected in all the three treatments gonzalez silva et al 2016 the nitrifying taxa were present at different relative abundances in the two f treatments indicating that priming affected the taxa to different extents in general the proportion of aob was greater in f1 whereas nob were present at a greater relative abundance in f0 consequently the average ratio of aob to nob in f1 was double that in f0 although f1 had the same proportion of aob as f0 on day 45 12 90 of which was nitrosomonas f1 had more than double the relative abundance of aob in f0 at the end of the sw phase on day 72 the proportion of nitrosomonas was twice as high in f1 24 than in f0 12 and the proportion of nitrosospira multiformis was 10x higher in f1 10 than in f0 1 this suggests that priming increased the salinity acclimation of these aob it also indicates that aob were more competitive than nob in seawater as also observed in other biofilm studies aslan and simsek 2012 bassin et al 2011 as ammonia oxidation is considered the rate limiting step in the nitrification process the increase in the proportion of aob in f1 after seawater transfer could explain why f1 had higher nitrification capacity than f0 despite having similar nitrifying communities the lower capacity in f0 could also have been due to inhibition of nitrifying bacteria or lower biomass of nitrifiers in f0 the increased salt during priming may also have strengthened the biofilm structure through better settling characteristics goode and allen 2006 moussa et al 2006 or by shifting the overall microbial community composition towards bacteria that were efficient at producing extracellular polymeric substances eps thus the nitrifying bacteria could have been protected against osmotic stress by the hydrated microenvironment created by the surrounding eps baho et al 2012 flemming and wingender 2010 this hypothesis is plausible as nitrifiers are often found in the deeper layers of the biofilm okabe et al 1996 likely because nitrifiers have low eps production ability and slower growth rates than heterotrophs tsuneda et al 2001 the protective nature of the extrapolymeric matrix may also explain why salt acclimation did not improve the salinity adaptation of nitrifying sludge in a previous study moussa et al 2006 future studies should include quantification of eps to test this hypothesis in contrast to the f treatments the nitrification activities of b0 and b1 were similar after sw transfer indicating that seawater priming had no influence on the salinity acclimation fig 1b d moreover salinity increase did not negatively impact the ammonia oxidation capacity in both b treatments thus it appears that brackish water biofilms are inherently robust to salinity increase from another perspective it may be stated that the b treatments were already primed due to their native salinity of 12 this finding is partly in accordance with another brackish water mbbr study 22 salinity where aormax reduced only by 15 after sw transfer gonzalez silva et al 2016 however our study contradicts other studies on brackish water adapted sludge 11 16 salinity where the reduction was 50 90 bassin et al 2011 moussa et al 2006 this difference suggests that young brackish water biofilms may be more resilient to salinity increase than nitrifying sludge or mature biofilms alternatively the distinct responses to salinity changes may have been due to different initial nitrifying communities selected by the different operating conditions temperature ph ammonia loading rate concentration etc in these studies in both b treatments the microbial community composition both total and nitrifying was similar throughout the experiment indicating that brackish water biofilms contain bacteria that can physiologically adapt to varying salinities as the b treatments had received bacteria from both fw and sw their biofilms had a greater α diversity than the f treatments further although nitrosomonas and candidatus nitrotoga were the dominant aob and nob in both the f and b treatments the b treatments had a higher proportion of nitrosospira and nitrobacter the greater α diversity of nitrifiers in the b treatments may have provided functional redundancy at different salinities notably aormax in both the b treatments decreased after freshwater transfer without any change in the nitrifying community the salinity decrease may have temporarily inhibited the nitrifying bacteria especially obligately halophilic strains present in the biofilm this observation contradicts a study where the ammonia oxidation capacity increased by 30 when the salinity was reduced from 20 native salinity to 0 gonzalez silva et al 2016 but corroborates other studies where a decrease from the native salinity slightly reduced ammonia oxidation bassin et al 2011 sudarno et al 2011 bacteria are generally more resistant to a salinity decrease than a salinity increase this is because a hypoosmotic shock usually only increases the cell volume slightly whereas a hyperosmotic shock can cause plasmolysis csonka 1989 interestingly aormax in b1 recovered faster than in b0 in the fw phase suggesting that priming may have increased the capability of the biofilm to adapt to different salinities perhaps through cross protection although all treatments had similar aormax and normax in the beginning of the experiment aormax increased more rapidly in the b treatments than in f during most of the study aormax in b was significantly greater than in f suggesting that ammonia oxidation may be higher in bw biofilms than in fw biofilms perhaps due to isotonic conditions he et al 2017 or greater α diversity of nitrifiers in general the nitrite oxidation capacity increased during the fw phase but was lower in the priming and sw phases except in f1 although this finding contradicts some studies moussa et al 2006 sharrer et al 2007 it is in agreement with several other studies where nob were more negatively affected by salinity increase than aob aslan and simsek 2012 bassin et al 2011 dinçer and kargi 1999 jeong et al 2018 nijhof and bovendeur 1990 moreover in all treatments the normax was greater than the aormax immediately after sw transfer and no nitrite accumulation was observed but after two weeks in seawater normax was lower than aormax in all treatments except f1 indicating that the nitrite oxidizers did not acclimatize to the salinity unlike the ammonia oxidizers fig 1 the delayed response of the nob highlights the importance of monitoring nitrification activity during the acclimatization period after seawater transfer at high salt concentrations nitrite oxidation may not generate enough energy to make osmoregulation thermodynamically favorable oren 2011 so it is especially remarkable that f1 had no decrease in nitrite oxidation unlike that reported in many nitrification studies at high salinities bassin et al 2011 jeong et al 2018 sudarno et al 2011 the differences in aormax and normax between the f and b treatments can be related to the microbial community composition as the b treatments had a greater proportion of aob than nob while the opposite was true for f this study showed that osmotic stress priming which has strong evidence in pure cultures andrade linares et al 2016 berga et al 2017 can be applied to nitrifying biofilms thus in bioreactors treating variable salinity effluents the biofilms can be exposed to high salinity during the early stages of maturation to increase robustness to salinity fluctuations in the future specifically in ras for atlantic salmon the bioreactor can be primed before the introduction of fish into freshwater to avoid the adverse effects of salinity changes during fish production however many questions remain to be answered such as what is the minimum intensity and duration for stress priming and for how long can biofilms retain this memory further studies are required to optimize the salinity level and duration of osmotic stress priming also young biofilms may be more easily influenced by environmental conditions than mature biofilms saur et al 2016 in the present study the changes in the nitrifying community until day 50 appeared to be primarily due to biofilm maturation as seen by the overall increase in the proportion of the nitrifiers with time fig 3 further the biofilm in this study retained the memory for at least three weeks other studies have proposed a time scale of two weeks as the characteristic time for microbial community development in biofilms and the conservation of biofilm memory saur et al 2016 if that is the case when the freshwater phase extends to more than a few weeks the salinity adaptation capability may decrease further research is required to investigate this hypothesis another topic for future research is whether biofilms possess cross protection capability for example increased resistance to osmotic stress after prior exposure to other stressors such as temperature or ph 5 conclusions this study was undertaken to find a strategy for maintaining nitrification efficiency during salinity changes in mbbrs especially in ras the results of this study showed that seawater priming changed the microbial community composition of freshwater biofilms and greatly improved nitrification during the next salinity increase however the nitrifying taxa did not change suggesting that priming improved salinity acclimation through physiological adaptation of the existing nitrifiers and also perhaps by strengthening the biofilm structure in contrast to freshwater biofilms nitrification in brackish water biofilms was not influenced by priming also salinity increase did not negatively affect the nitrification nor did it change the microbial community composition this indicates that brackish water biofilms are inherently robust to salinity increase and contain bacteria that can adapt to varying salinities in conclusion osmotic stress priming can be used as an effective microbial management strategy for improving salinity acclimation in nitrifying biofilms hence prior exposure to high salinity can help biofilms adapt to salinity increases in the future future studies should investigate the optimal duration and intensity of osmotic stress required for priming as well as the extent of time these

17980,with increasing freshwater scarcity and greater use of seawater fluctuating salinities are becoming common in water treatment systems this can be challenging for salinity sensitive processes like nitrification especially in recirculating aquaculture systems ras where maintaining nitrification efficiency is crucial for fish health this study was undertaken to determine if prior exposure to

a widely used process for ammonia removal in wastewater treatment however this biological process is sensitive to variations in salinity as the nitrifying microorganisms can be inhibited or lysed by

risk to the fish it is therefore necessary to develop a strategy to increase the salinity resistance of nitrifying biofilms so that salinity changes may be performed without hindering the bioreactor performance studies have shown that the performance of bioreactors may be influenced by their operational history cabrol et al 2016 saur et al 2016 bioreactors are often more functionally stable to environmental disturbances such as toxic substances or high nutrient loading when previously exposed to a smaller dose of the same disturbance cabrol et al 2016 and references within perturbations of biofilms especially in the initial growth phase may influence the microbial community succession and the structure of the finally established community cabrol et al 2016 ohashi et al 1995 saur et al 2016 alternatively the microorganisms in the biofilm may respond physiologically to the perturbations and become more tolerant to future stresses priming also called predictive response strategy or acquired stress tolerance is a phenomenon where microorganisms exposed to a mild external stress show an improved response to a more severe stress in the future usually through phenotypical modifications such as changes in gene expression or metabolism hilker et al 2016 mitchell et al 2009 rillig et al 2015 priming as a physiological strategy has been observed in bacterial cultures subjected to osmotic stress andrade linares et al 2016 jenkins et al 1990 however the response of microbial communities to priming may differ greatly from that of pure cultures priming of microbial communities can not only modify the physiological phenotype of the microorganisms but also alter the microbial community composition due to differences in the priming capabilities of the community members and complex microbial interactions rillig et al 2015 studies on the response of nitrifying microbial communities to osmotic stress priming are limited a study on nitrifying sludge showed that adaptation to 10 g cl l 1 16 salinity did not improve the nitrification performance at higher salinities moussa et al 2006 to the best of our knowledge the effect of osmotic stress priming in nitrifying microbial communities especially in biofilms has not been well researched the objective of this study was to determine if seawater priming could improve salinity acclimation in nitrifying moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr it was hypothesized that the primed treatment would undergo lesser reduction in nitrification performance than the unprimed treatment when the salinity was increased from freshwater to seawater with this objective we investigated the effect of seawater priming on mbbrs initially started up in fresh and brackish water respectively 2 materials methods 2 1 experimental setup and design the experiment was performed on continuously operated mbbrs with four treatments in duplicate the setup was similar to that described in navada et al 2019 two treatments f0 f1 were started in freshwater fw whereas the other two b0 b1 were started in brackish water bw at 12 salinity table 1 thereafter f1 and b1 were transferred to seawater sw 32 salinity by increasing the salinity in gradual daily increments 10 11 day 1 over three and two days respectively these treatments were operated in seawater for two weeks while f0 and b0 were operated at their native salinities thereafter all reactors were transferred to fw in approx one day and operated for 24 days finally all reactors were transferred to seawater salinity increased in the same manner as in the priming stage and operated for 31 days the biofilm carriers anoxk chip p krüger kaldnes as norway were started in a fw and bw ras mbbr with fish feed nh4cl nano2 and nahco3 with no fish in the system these carriers had been used previously in the ras so they were disinfected with acid and base prior to start up the experimental reactors were filled with biofilm carriers 35 by volume from the fw and bw ras mbbrs after two and four weeks of start up respectively to acclimatize the carriers to the experimental system the reactors were operated for one month on synthetic medium the synthetic medium had an ammonia concentration of 700 1130 mgn l 1 with the following nutrients per mg of nh4 n 7 14 mg caco3 supplied by nahco3 0 1 mg p as na2hpo4 12h2o 0 1 mg p as kh2po4 0 1 mg mg as mgso4 and 0 003 mg fe as fecl3 zhu et al 2016 sucrose 2 4 g was added daily in the last 19 days of the acclimatization period with few exceptions to boost biofilm growth by heterotrophic bacteria bassin et al 2012b to minimize reactor bias the biomedia were intermixed and redistributed to the reactors ten days before starting the experiment the experiment was started after the acclimatization period the mbbrs were operated at 12 4 0 5 c ph 7 5 0 3 and aerated with an air flow of 40 nl min 1 dissolved oxygen saturation 80 100 each reactor was provided synthetic medium at a flow rate of 2 3 ml min 1 corresponding to an average ammonia loading rate of 0 22 0 04 gn m 2 d 1 in addition dilution water was provided to each reactor from a buffer tank one per treatment via a multichannel peristaltic pump ismatec ism404 mcp cole parmer usa salinity changes for each treatment were performed by controlling the salinity in buffer tanks by adjusting the freshwater and seawater flow rates thus changing the reactor salinity gradually navada et al 2019 in the freshwater and seawater phases the hydraulic retention time hrt was approximately 5 h dilution flow 119 7 ml min 1 during the native and priming phases the reactors had a higher hrt of 12 h dilution flow 50 3 ml min 1 as this period was designed to simulate the start up phase of mbbrs temperature ph dissolved oxygen salinity and flow rates of synthetic medium dilution water and air were measured daily with few exceptions using the methods described in navada et al 2019 ammonia in the synthetic medium and in each reactor and nitrite concentration in each reactor were measured using the phenate method and colorimetric method respectively apha 2017 2 2 nitrification performance the in situ ammonia oxidation rate aor in situ in each reactor was calculated by ammonia mass balance assuming pseudo steady state over 24 h navada et al 2019 for each mbbr the maximum ammonia oxidation rate aormax and the maximum nitrite oxidation rate normax were determined by performing capacity tests each test was conducted by running the mbbr in a batch mode by closing the inlets and outlets the reactor was spiked with 170 350 ml of either synthetic medium or a spike solution to obtain an initial ammonia concentration of 4 18 mgn l 1 in the mbbr the ammonia spike solution had the same proportions of nutrients per nh4 n as the synthetic medium except iron made up in deionized water no spike was added if the in situ ammonia concentration was already high 4 mgn l 1 ammonia concentration was measured every 5 31 min during the capacity test the nitrite capacity test was performed similarly each reactor was spiked with 8 20 mg no2 n l 1 by adding 200 250 ml of a spike solution made with nano2 and deionized water water samples were analyzed every 5 15 min to determine the no2 n concentration 2 3 microbial analyses before each ammonia capacity test three biofilm carriers were sampled from each reactor and preserved at 80 c for each test one biofilm sample from each treatment was analyzed by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing on ion personal genome machine using the procedures for analysis and data processing described in navada et al 2019 briefly 10 20 mm pieces were cut out from the thawed carriers and placed into 1 5 ml tubes containing atl buffer qiagen netherlands biofilm was detached in a qiagen tissuelyser ii 30hz s 1 10 min pcr amplification was performed with ion 16s metagenomics kit cat no a26216 thermofisher the kit includes two sets of primer pools targeting variable regions v2 4 8 and v3 6 7 9 respectively sequences are deposited in genbank with accession number prjna614452 2 4 data analysis and statistics aormax or normax was calculated from the slope of regression lines of the nh4 n or no2 n concentration vs time as there was little difference between duplicate reactors the combined data from both reactors were used to fit a regression line for each treatment with a minimum of 14 samples per test supplementary information b analysis of covariance ancova was used to detect significant differences between the slopes of the regression lines of the primed and unprimed treatments fox and weisberg 2011 navada et al 2019 on days 74 75 nitrification activity in f0 ceased suddenly due to suspected metals deficiency supplementary information section a 1 therefore all analyses are reported for days 1 73 unless otherwise specified for the microbial analysis the operational taxonomic unit otu table was normalized to the sum of sample reads otus with a maximum of less than 0 1 in

variance permanova based on bray curtis and sørensen dice indices was used to test the hypothesis of equal community composition between groups of biofilm samples anderson 2001 differences were

nitrification activity in the freshwater f treatments the primed treatment f1 had significantly higher ammonia oxidation capacity aormax than f0 in the seawater phase fig 1 a until day 45 the aormax in f0 operated in fw was relatively stable at 0 26 0 05 gn m 2 d 1 in this period the aormax in f1 was lower than in f0 likely due to a reduction during the priming phase however after the second transfer to seawater day 50 f1 showed no significant reduction in aormax which in fact increased by 80 after three weeks in seawater in contrast aormax in f0 decreased by 55 upon transfer to seawater the aor in situ and ammonia concentration in the mbbrs were in alignment with the aormax fig 2 a c the nitrite oxidation capacity normax was also higher in f1 than in f0 in the seawater phase fig 1c until the seawater phase the normax in f1 was 9 50 lower than that in f0 after transfer to the sw phase normax in f1 initially reduced by 10 but increased to 35 higher than that in the fw phase after two weeks in seawater in contrast normax in f0 initially decreased by 35 on transfer to seawater and decreased further by 90 after 15 days throughout the study normax was higher than aormax in both treatments except in f0 on day 64 indicating complete ammonia oxidation to nitrate nitrite concentration in the mbbrs during normal operation was consistently below 0 4 mgn l 1 days 1 73 fig 2e 3 2 nitrification activity in the brackish water b treatments in general the aormax in b0 and b1 did not differ significantly during the study fig 1b further the aormax in both treatments was not impacted by seawater transfer both in the priming and sw phases upon transfer to freshwater the treatments suffered a 45 60 reduction in aormax however within three weeks in fw aormax in b1 recovered completely whereas b0 recovered to 80 of the original aormax in the seawater phase the aormax did not decrease rather it increased by 30 50 after three weeks in seawater the aor in situ in both treatments was limited by the ammonia substrate during most of the study fig 2b d in contrast to aormax the normax was negatively impacted by salinity increase during the priming phase b1 at 32 salinity had significantly lower normax than b0 12 salinity fig 1d after day 40 the normax in the two treatments did not differ significantly in the sw phase the normax reduced to half the capacity in freshwater in the priming and seawater phases normax was lower than aormax fig 1b d during the priming phase the nitrite concentration in b1 increased to a maximum of 2 mgn l 1 fig 2f but after transfer to freshwater the nitrite concentration in both treatments decreased to less than 0 2 mgn l 1 in three weeks in the sw phase although the nitrite concentration increased slightly it was still below 0 5 mgn l 1 3 3 microbial community composition of the 1434 otus detected in the biofilm 25 were identified as nitrifying bacteria after filtering out the rare otus 452 otus remained including 15 nitrifying otus supplementary information table a 1 the nitrifying bacteria constituted up to 55 of the total reads the rest were likely heterotrophic bacteria fig 3 supplementary information fig a 6 the aob otus that could be classified at the genus species level were nitrosomonas n sp and nitrosospira n multiformis the nob were candidatus nitrotoga nitrotoga nitrospira n marina n sp and nitrobacter n vulgaris four otus were classified only to the family level as nitrosomonadaceae 2 otus nitrospiraceae 1 otu and nitrospinaceae 1 otu nitrosomonas was the dominant aob genus in all the treatments among the nob candidatus nitrotoga was the dominant genus although a few samples in the b treatments had nitrobacter as the most abundant nitrospira was detected exclusively in the f treatments whereas nitrobacter was detected only in the b treatments for both the f and b treatments the α diversity in the primed and unprimed treatment did not differ significantly both based on all the otus and the nitrifying otus except for evenness of the nitrifying community in b0 and b1 p 0 04 table 2 for the f and b treatments separately ordination by pcoa showed that time was the primary factor influencing both the total and nitrifying microbial community composition fig 4 further on any given day the bray curtis similarity between the nitrifying communities of the primed and unprimed treatments was 64 90 f treatments and 56 92 b treatments supplementary information fig a 5 the permanova results showed that the community composition of f0 and f1 on days 31 50 were significantly different both based on the bray curtis index r2 0 48 p 0 03 and the sørensen dice index r2 0 45 p 0 03 however the nitrifying community composition of f0 and f1 was significantly different only based on the bray curtis index r2 0 52 p 0 03 but not on the sørensen dice index r2 0 13 p 0 32 for the b treatments both the overall and nitrifying community composition of b0 and b1 were not significantly different throughout the experiment based on both the distance metrics p 0 2 4 discussion growth history can influence biofilm behavior ohashi et al 1995 saur et al 2016 in addition to having different native salinities the biofilm carriers in f and b treatments had slightly different histories before being transferred to the experimental reactors the f carriers had been disinfected and stored dry before start up in the ras mbbr whereas the b carriers had been disinfected in the bw ras mbbr and immediately started up again the b carriers were also cultured two weeks longer in the ras mbbrs than f before being transferred to the experimental system nonetheless the nitrification activity in all treatments was similar on day 1 indicating that all treatments had similar nitrifying capacity in the beginning of the study fig 1 thus the differences in salinity acclimation of the f and b treatments are primarily attributed to the difference in native salinity the primed treatment f1 had twice the aormax and 20 higher normax than f0 upon transfer to the sw phase fig 1a c this provides strong evidence that seawater priming increased salinity acclimation in the biofilm salinity acclimation in nitrifying biofilms may be achieved by physiological adaptation of the existing nitrifiers bassin et al 2011 navada et al 2019 or by a shift in the microbial community composition to favor more halotolerant bacteria bassin et al 2012a gonzalez silva 2016 the acclimation strategy may be influenced by the manner of salinity change bassin et al 2012a navada et al 2019 in this study the microbial community composition in f1 changed after the priming phase days 31 50 and became significantly different from that in f0 this indicates that the species inventory in the biofilm was influenced by priming the compositional change was mainly due to changes in the heterotrophic community rather than in the nitrifying community as the heterotrophic group has higher functional redundancy than nitrifiers a larger range of microorganisms within this group can perform the same function in different salinity regimes despite the change in the overall community composition the α diversity did not change likely because of trade offs between priming ability and competitiveness rillig et al 2015 also the nitrifying community composition in f0 and f1 remained highly similar up to 90 similarity and the same nitrifying taxa were present in both treatments this suggests that the higher nitrification activity in f1 was due to a physiological adaptation to salinity through the production of compatible solutes rather than a compositional change in the nitrifying bacteria the dominant aob in this study the genus nitrosomonas is reported to be able to adapt to seawater bassin et al 2011 foesel et al 2008 the dominant nob candidatus nitrotoga can also survive salinity increase from freshwater to seawater navada et al 2019 and has been detected in marine ras biofilms keuter et al 2017 spearman rank correlation between the nitrifying otus in the f and b treatments separately showed that most of the significant correlations were positive supplementary information fig a 7 this suggests that the growth of all the nitrifying bacterial species in the various salinity regimes was similar and that the competition between the species was not very strong the high osmotic tolerance of nitrifying bacteria underscores the immense versatility of this bacterial group to survive in different salinities despite the existence of exclusive freshwater and marine species a previous study supports this observation by reporting that although freshwater brackish water 22 salinity and seawater biofilms contained several unique nitrifying otus the dominant otus at each salinity were detected in all the three treatments gonzalez silva et al 2016 the nitrifying taxa were present at different relative abundances in the two f treatments indicating that priming affected the taxa to different extents in general the proportion of aob was greater in f1 whereas nob were present at a greater relative abundance in f0 consequently the average ratio of aob to nob in f1 was double that in f0 although f1 had the same proportion of aob as f0 on day 45 12 90 of which was nitrosomonas f1 had more than double the relative abundance of aob in f0 at the end of the sw phase on day 72 the proportion of nitrosomonas was twice as high in f1 24 than in f0 12 and the proportion of nitrosospira multiformis was 10x higher in f1 10 than in f0 1 this suggests that priming increased the salinity acclimation of these aob it also indicates that aob were more competitive than nob in seawater as also observed in other biofilm studies aslan and simsek 2012 bassin et al 2011 as ammonia oxidation is considered the rate limiting step in the nitrification process the increase in the proportion of aob in f1 after seawater transfer could explain why f1 had higher nitrification capacity than f0 despite having similar nitrifying communities the lower capacity in f0 could also have been due to inhibition of nitrifying bacteria or lower biomass of nitrifiers in f0 the increased salt during priming may also have strengthened the biofilm structure through better settling characteristics goode and allen 2006 moussa et al 2006 or by shifting the overall microbial community composition towards bacteria that were efficient at producing extracellular polymeric substances eps thus the nitrifying bacteria could have been protected against osmotic stress by the hydrated microenvironment created by the surrounding eps baho et al 2012 flemming and wingender 2010 this hypothesis is plausible as nitrifiers are often found in the deeper layers of the biofilm okabe et al 1996 likely because nitrifiers have low eps production ability and slower growth rates than heterotrophs tsuneda et al 2001 the protective nature of the extrapolymeric matrix may also explain why salt acclimation did not improve the salinity adaptation of nitrifying sludge in a previous study moussa et al 2006 future studies should include quantification of eps to test this hypothesis in contrast to the f treatments the nitrification activities of b0 and b1 were similar after sw transfer indicating that seawater priming had no influence on the salinity acclimation fig 1b d moreover salinity increase did not negatively impact the ammonia oxidation capacity in both b treatments thus it appears that brackish water biofilms are inherently robust to salinity increase from another perspective it may be stated that the b treatments were already primed due to their native salinity of 12 this finding is partly in accordance with another brackish water mbbr study 22 salinity where aormax reduced only by 15 after sw transfer gonzalez silva et al 2016 however our study contradicts other studies on brackish water adapted sludge 11 16 salinity where the reduction was 50 90 bassin et al 2011 moussa et al 2006 this difference suggests that young brackish water biofilms may be more resilient to salinity increase than nitrifying sludge or mature biofilms alternatively the distinct responses to salinity changes may have been due to different initial nitrifying communities selected by the different operating conditions temperature ph ammonia loading rate concentration etc in these studies in both b treatments the microbial community composition both total and nitrifying was similar throughout the experiment indicating that brackish water biofilms contain bacteria that can physiologically adapt to varying salinities as the b treatments had received bacteria from both fw and sw their biofilms had a greater α diversity than the f treatments further although nitrosomonas and candidatus nitrotoga were the dominant aob and nob in both the f and b treatments the b treatments had a higher proportion of nitrosospira and nitrobacter the greater α diversity of nitrifiers in the b treatments may have provided functional redundancy at different salinities notably aormax in both the b treatments decreased after freshwater transfer without any change in the nitrifying community the salinity decrease may have temporarily inhibited the nitrifying bacteria especially obligately halophilic strains present in the biofilm this observation contradicts a study where the ammonia oxidation capacity increased by 30 when the salinity was reduced from 20 native salinity to 0 gonzalez silva et al 2016 but corroborates other studies where a decrease from the native salinity slightly reduced ammonia oxidation bassin et al 2011 sudarno et al 2011 bacteria are generally more resistant to a salinity decrease than a salinity increase this is because a hypoosmotic shock usually only increases the cell volume slightly whereas a hyperosmotic shock can cause plasmolysis csonka 1989 interestingly aormax in b1 recovered faster than in b0 in the fw phase suggesting that priming may have increased the capability of the biofilm to adapt to different salinities perhaps through cross protection although all treatments had similar aormax and normax in the beginning of the experiment aormax increased more rapidly in the b treatments than in f during most of the study aormax in b was significantly greater than in f suggesting that ammonia oxidation may be higher in bw biofilms than in fw biofilms perhaps due to isotonic conditions he et al 2017 or greater α diversity of nitrifiers in general the nitrite oxidation capacity increased during the fw phase but was lower in the priming and sw phases except in f1 although this finding contradicts some studies moussa et al 2006 sharrer et al 2007 it is in agreement with several other studies where nob were more negatively affected by salinity increase than aob aslan and simsek 2012 bassin et al 2011 dinçer and kargi 1999 jeong et al 2018 nijhof and bovendeur 1990 moreover in all treatments the normax was greater than the aormax immediately after sw transfer and no nitrite accumulation was observed but after two weeks in seawater normax was lower than aormax in all treatments except f1 indicating that the nitrite oxidizers did not acclimatize to the salinity unlike the ammonia oxidizers fig 1 the delayed response of the nob highlights the importance of monitoring nitrification activity during the acclimatization period after seawater transfer at high salt concentrations nitrite oxidation may not generate enough energy to make osmoregulation thermodynamically favorable oren 2011 so it is especially remarkable that f1 had no decrease in nitrite oxidation unlike that reported in many nitrification studies at high salinities bassin et al 2011 jeong et al 2018 sudarno et al 2011 the differences in aormax and normax between the f and b treatments can be related to the microbial community composition as the b treatments had a greater proportion of aob than nob while the opposite was true for f this study showed that osmotic stress priming which has strong evidence in pure cultures andrade linares et al 2016 berga et al 2017 can be applied to nitrifying biofilms thus in bioreactors treating variable salinity effluents the biofilms can be exposed to high salinity during the early stages of maturation to increase robustness to salinity fluctuations in the future specifically in ras for atlantic salmon the bioreactor can be primed before the introduction of fish into freshwater to avoid the adverse effects of salinity changes during fish production however many questions remain to be answered such as what is the minimum intensity and duration for stress priming and for how long can biofilms retain this memory further studies are required to optimize the salinity level and duration of osmotic stress priming also young biofilms may be more easily influenced by environmental conditions than mature biofilms saur et al 2016 in the present study the changes in the nitrifying community until day 50 appeared to be primarily due to biofilm maturation as seen by the overall increase in the proportion of the nitrifiers with time fig 3 further the biofilm in this study retained the memory for at least three weeks other studies have proposed a time scale of two weeks as the characteristic time for microbial community development in biofilms and the conservation of biofilm memory saur et al 2016 if that is the case when the freshwater phase extends to more than a few weeks the salinity adaptation capability may decrease further research is required to investigate this hypothesis another topic for future research is whether biofilms possess cross protection capability for example increased resistance to osmotic stress after prior exposure to other stressors such as temperature or ph 5 conclusions this study was undertaken to find a strategy for maintaining nitrification efficiency during salinity changes in mbbrs especially in ras the results of this study showed that seawater priming changed the microbial community composition of freshwater biofilms and greatly improved nitrification during the next salinity increase however the nitrifying taxa did not change suggesting that priming improved salinity acclimation through physiological adaptation of the existing nitrifiers and also perhaps by strengthening the biofilm structure in contrast to freshwater biofilms nitrification in brackish water biofilms was not influenced by priming also salinity increase did not negatively affect the nitrification nor did it change the microbial community composition this indicates that brackish water biofilms are inherently robust to salinity increase and contain bacteria that can adapt to varying salinities in conclusion osmotic stress priming can be used as an effective microbial management strategy for improving salinity acclimation in nitrifying biofilms hence prior exposure to high salinity can help biofilms adapt to salinity increases in the future future studies should investigate the optimal duration and intensity of osmotic stress required for priming as well as the extent of time these

demonstrated that an increase in cycle frequency can limit the no and n2o formation and reduce nitrogen element loss ni et al 2013 another modeling of co2 stripping to the membrane lumen was investigated in an mabr system in that research co2 was more likely diffused to the membrane lumen instead of stripping to the atmosphere owing to the counter diffusion biofilms in the membrane

system and biochemical system the main function of each system was explained as follow the gas system was employed to supply pure oxygen to the bioreactor and the intake flow volume of oxygen was 5 ml min the influent system controlled the continuous water inlet rate through the peristaltic pump according to the volume of the actual water body contained in ma ba a reaction time of 24 h was set a magnetic stirring apparatus was constructed to make the entire reactor in a fully mixed state mixed system in this part the main purpose was to regulate the cross flow velocity across the biofilm to improve the mass transfer efficiency the biochemical system was the focus of ma ba system and the function of it was both membrane aerated biofilm reactor and photobioreactor the structure of the biochemical system was an opened 2 0 l organic glass rectangular container with a total working volume of 1 8 l a lid was equipped with the rectangular reactor which can be opened to easily monitor the dissolve oxygen do and ph of the wastewater the membrane module occupied 0 2 l were installed and submerged in ma ba membrane unit parameters was exhibited in table 1 2 2 ba community set up the single ba system included active sludge and algae activated sludge flocs came from the secondary sedimentation tanks in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp harbin china the algae were bought from taobao and enlarged in the bg11 culture medium for 10 days after cultivated to 1500 mg l mixed liquid suspended solid the algae were worked as algae inoculum the activated sludge was diluted to the same mlss with the algae and mixed with the algae in artificial wastewater to make them combination gradual artificial wastewater was shown in supplementary materials 2 3 experiment design the laboratory scale batch tests were prepared in four ba ma systems with the test temperature of 26 2 c which was the same as the room temperature to save energy all ma ba systems were irradiated from 9 00 to 21 00 with 12 h per day through four independent led lights to replace sunlight with the light intensity of 5000 lx the volumetric exchange efficiency was kept at 80 resulting in an hrt of 30 h the total operation time was 90 days the cod concentrations in four ma ba systems named as r1 r2 r3 and r4 were controlled in 0 00 mg l 100 00 mg l 250 00 mg l and 400 00 mg l to investigate the effect of different organic concentrations on the algae growth and pollutants removal efficiencies the details of influent water qualities in the treatment process are shown in table 2 furthermore the other substance in the influent wastewater was presented in supplementary materials 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 water quality analysis owing to the algae photosynthesis the ph and do was different between the daytime and nighttime therefore adopting a ph meter pb 21 germany and do meter oxi3210 wtw germany to detect the ph and do is necessary besides the main nitrogen including nh4 n and tn crucial nutrient of po4 3 p and the residual cod were detected through the standard methods apha 2005 ic were measured according to the toc tn detection equipment all of the water quality analysis was investigated after filtered by the 0 45 μm membrane 2 4 2 biomass estimation and biological composition analysis the criteria for algae proliferation evaluation was always suggested to detect the chlorophyll a chl a besides there is also relative content to represent the algae growth condition which is the chl a biomass ratio thus the chl a concentration and chl a biomass ratio in the ma ba system was detected and calculated and the chl a was extracted by acetone solution the detail process was showed in the supplementary materials meanwhile the biomass in the membrane was also investigated according to the standard method to replace the mlvss extracellular polymeric substance eps concentration was determined through the eem parafac analysis f7000 hitachi japan the biological composition was analyzed by high throughput sequencing the detail process was also shown in the supplementary materials besides the t test was adopted to evaluate the possible associations among nutrients removal and the statistically significant difference ρ 0 05 between groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon removal to investigate the carbon transformation mechanism the residual cod and ic concentrations are shown in fig 2 after 40 days operation the effluent organic carbon entered a steady state condition in all four ba ma systems at the end of the test the effluent cod concentration in r1 r2 r3 and r4 was 0 00 mg l 27 96 mg l 10 36 mg l 17 60 mg l respectively this result proves that the ma process had a dramatic performance in cod removal regardless of the influent cod concentration interestingly for the r1 there was no external organic carbon but cod appeared in the effluent from the 7th day it is obvious that organic matter is produced by the disintegration of the microorganism itself and released to the effluent besides the residual cod concentration in r4 was not the highest which indicated that the cod removal rate was not connected with the original cod concentration ic exists as three forms including free dissolved co2 bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions which depends on the ph of the water zhang et al 2019 although algae can use ic for photosynthesis co2 is the most important final matter in the photosynthesis process amoroso et al 1998 besides the ic in wastewater is either transformed into co2 before absorbance or converted to co2 intracellularly after absorbance it is reported that co2 can be captured from the gas phase when ic 50 mg l li et al 2017 then the ic enriched ma ba system can be adopted to support biomass proliferation thus ic higher than 50 mg l in the reactor is beneficial for algae growth there are also some researches illustrated that an increase photosynthesis ratio was found in algae biofilms with extra bicarbonate supply kesaano et al 2015 it is clear that owing to no external organic carbon the effluent ic concentration in r1 was the lowest among the four reactors the ic that supporting for the autotrophic microorganism proliferation was mainly from the original wastewater thus the effluent ic concentration in r1 was the lowest in the four reactors maintaining 31 96 mg l which was insufficient for the algae normal proliferation besides with increasing external organic carbon concentration the effluent ic concentration also soared the residual ic was sufficient for the algae growth in r3 and r4 with the effluent ic concentrations of 103 96 mg l and 163 36 mg l respectively however in r2 the ic was 56 4 mg l in this condition the residual ic was sufficient for the normal multiplication of algae yet the proliferation condition was poorer than r3 and r4 therefore in the carbon removal aspect the increasing cod influent concentration does not damage the ma ba system operation meanwhile the increasing product ic promoted the algae live environment 3 2 chlorophyll a and biomass accumulation the chl a concentration is the main indicator of algae proliferation condition in the ba system yao et al 2019 to better understand the biomass of the four ma bas and distinguish the effect of different original cod concentrations on the algae growth the chl a biomass ratios were also investigated and shown in fig 3 chl a concentration of r4 was the highest 20 95 mg cm2 in all four ma bas which was 17 77 mg cm2 13 60 mg cm2 and 4 51 mg cm2 higher compared to r1 r2 and r3 respectively moreover chl a biomass ratio displayed an obvious increase trend 0 41 mg mg and 0 45 mg mg respectively in r3 and r4 and a moderate increase in r2 0 31 mg mg compared to r1 which was a no external organic carbon ma ba system the algae absolute accumulation represented by chl a concentration and relative content represented by chl a biomass ratio suggested that the algae proliferation condition soared with increasing influent cod the minimum chl a biomass accumulation in all of the four reactors happened in r1 nevertheless the value was still around 250 fold higher than the traditional biofilm reactors with normal aeration process with the highest chl a biomass ratio of 0 0035 mg mg tang et al 2016 this result suggests that membrane aeration has the remarkable ability to promote the growth environment of algae owing to the amount of ic produced in the ma ba system however due to the drastically increased organic carbon the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria boosted obviously so sludge production and biomass in the biofilm were increased in this condition although the chl a in r4 had an obvious growth than other ma ba systems the chl a biomass ratio did not show a significant increase the chl a in r4 was around 6 59 times that in r1 but the chl a biomass ratio was only 1 96 times that in r1 this phenomenon demonstrated that no significant fluctuations have occurred in the proliferation balance between the algae and bacteria as the influent cod increased which means that ma ba system was suitable for the symbiotic relationship between algae and bacteria 3 3 kinetic of ammonia and phosphate removal under different influent cod conditions in the presence of higher substrates the half saturation constant ka of the nitrification process relative to substrate concentration is negligible thus the nitrification rate is indeed a zero order kinetics for the substrate murphy k l et al 1977 arvin and harremoes 1990 besides monod s kinetic expression which was belonged to the first order kinetics with sufficient substrate was appropriate for the algae biofilm proliferation with the nutrient absorption process maureen and ronald 2014 therefore the main function of the nutrients removal in ma ba system can be proved through the kinetics equation and the correlation coefficient r2 to clarify the nutrient removal route in the ma ba system the kinetics of nh4 n and po4 3 p removal during one hrt was calculated in fig 4 and the correlation coefficient r2 was summarized in table 3 in the aspect of nh4 n removal the correlation coefficient of r1 and r2 in zero order kinetic was higher than that in first order kinetic which means the main nh4 n removal route was nitrification process besides although the algae absorption process also contributed to the removal of nh4 n it did not play a major role this result was because the algae production is not enough to support assimilation to become the dominant mode in r1 and r2 in contrast as the soaring of influent cod the correlation coefficient of first order kinetic was gradually higher than that in zero order kinetic r3 and r4 this phenomenon demonstrated that the nh4 n removal route has been changed from nitrification to algae assimilation as the algae biomass accumulation this phenomenon was also significant in phosphate removal kinetic all four ma ba system were more in line with the first order kinetic equation and the correlation coefficients increased as the influent organic carbon soared when the influent cod reaches 400 00 mg l r4 the correlation coefficient has reached 0 9786 in this part nutrient removal path had been studied it is suggested that he route of nutrient removal was changed from bacterial action to algal action with the increase of organic carbon it is further proved that the increase of organic carbon can enrich algae and change the internal pollutant removal mode of the ma ba system 3 4 ma ba performance in nutrients removal under different organic carbon concentrations according to the kinetic analysis nh4 n removal in the ma ba system took place in two parts nitrification denitrification and algae assimilation as the soar of influent cod the algae assimilation was dominant meanwhile the phosphate removal in the ma ba system was mainly through the algae absorption regardless of the influent cod concentration thus to some extent the phosphate removal rate can represent the algae proliferation condition the nh4 n tn and phosphate concentrations in the effluent are shown in fig 5 effluent nh4 n concentrations were kept at a low level in r1 r2 r3 and r4 with residual concentrations of 0 03 mg l 0 63 mg l 0 03 mg l and 6 74 mg l respectively compared with the other three reactors the r4 had the highest residual nh4 n concentration which was attributed to the high organic carbon disrupting the growth balance between the nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria more organic carbon provided a better proliferation condition for the heterotrophic bacteria and limited the growth of nitrifying bacteria owing to its long growth cycle dong et al 2009 sun et al 2015 tn was the macroscopic index to represent nitrogen removal significantly in r4 the tn removal efficiency was the highest interestingly the tn had an obvious removal in r1 without external organic carbon which resulted in no denitrification thus the tn removal was not attributed to the nitrification denitrification process besides the algae have strong nitrogen assimilation ability which contributed to the tn removal in r1 this result proves that algae played a crucial role in the tn removal phosphate removal results further proved this point in fig 5 c the phosphate presented an obvious removal at the end of the test in r1 r2 r3 and r4 with the effluent concentrations of 4 61 mg l 3 18 mg l 1 91 mg l and 1 19 mg l respectively without external organic carbon the phosphate appeared the ineffective release in r1 however this phenomenon vanished after around 20 days operated which was because of the algae assimilation owing to the lower ic in r1 the algae assimilation showed a weak trend as the cod concentration increased the residual phosphate concentration declined significantly on the one hand the vastly increased organic carbon consumed more o2 to degrade providing an anaerobic environment for the phosphate effective release on the other hand owing to the complete degradation of ma ba system more ic was produced for the algae proliferation to absorb more phosphate these two processes determined the amount of phosphate removal a notable phenomenon appeared in r2 and r3 the removal ability of phosphate in r3 was obviously higher than in r2 but the tn removal capability was similar to the r2 this phenomenon was probably due to there being more algae in r3 the algae assimilation instead of the nitrification denitrification was the main reason for the tn removal in r3 which proved that organic carbon significantly promoted the algae growth environment condition at the end of the test the residual tn concentration in r1 was 31 96 mg l with the removal rate of 49 35 besides the r2 and r3 presented the similar tn removal with effluent tn concentrations of 13 55 mg l and 10 79 mg l respectively this phenomenon illustrated that the nitrification denitrification in high cod condition was not the main pathway for the decreased effluent nitrogen concentration which was consistent with the result of kinetic 3 5 microorganism abundance analysis 3 5 1 bacteria species analysis to achieve the whole insight into the microorganism community diversity phylum class and genus in four ma bas were investigated and shown in fig 6 in the phylum level the main function bacteria in the inner of the four ma ba biofilms were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi with the abundance of r1in 39 26 14 50 and 13 01 respectively r2in 39 54 28 03 and 9 35 respectively r3in 37 83 15 47 and 29 00 respectively r4in 24 15 27 75 and 31 24 respectively it is reported that the proteobacteria and bacteroidetes dominated ma ba systems had excellent cod and nh4 n treatment capabilities zhang et al 2020 in these four reactors the percentage of the three bacteria in the in biofilm was not changed significantly as the increasing of influent cod this result demonstrated that the ma ba was equipped with excellent organic carbon removal capability and the algae proliferation did not have a serious impact on it it is worth noting that whether in the in biofilm or out biofilm cyanobacteria existed which is hazardous after the lysis but the abundance of cyanobacteria presented the declining trend as the cod soared past researches suggested that the proliferation of cyanobacteria could be restricted by the proliferation of actinobacteria zhang et al 2018 in the ma ba system it is cleared that the inhibiting effect more significant as the increasing of influent cod concentration meanwhile the actinobacteria had an obvious accumulation in r1 out r2 out r3 out and r4 out with the percentage of 4 78 7 35 5 94 and 4 35 respectively furthermore acinetobacter was also verified as a beneficial bacterium facilitating the growth of algae in some ba system unnithan et al 2014 the abundance of acinetobacter in out biofilm was decreased as the soaring of influent cod but the percentage of acinetobacter in in biofilm was presented the increasing trend when the original organic carbon increased which suggested increasing organic carbon not only provided more ic for the proliferation of algae directly but also promoting the benefit bacteria acinetobacter to support the algae growth indirectly the percentage of nitrospirae was 7 04 2 04 0 60 and 0 30 in r1in r2in r3in and r4in respectively the abundance of nitrospirae was declined as the increase of original cod in the normal membrane aeration system this phenomenon was owing to the competition between the autotrophic bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria for the oxygen however as the kinetics analysis the nh4 n removal route had been changed from nitrification to algae assimilation as the algae biomass accumulation the nitrification process may be inhabited further the nitrogen removal pathway in the high organic carbon ma ba system has been transformed into algae adsorption furthermore the out biofilm presented the nearly anaerobic condition resulting in the death of nitrospirae with the percentage of 0 031 0 096 0 019 and 0 000 in r1out r2out r3out and r4out respectively to get further insight into the bacteria structure the bacteria abundance of the four ma ba systems in class level was investigated besides the anaerolineae was also the main function bacteria in the ma ba system with the percentage of 13 39 6 98 23 99 and 27 03 in r1in r2in r3in and r4in respectively moreover with an abundance of 15 68 12 65 6 97 and 13 01 in r1out r2out r3out and r4out it is obvious that in r1 and r2 the abundance of anaerolineae in the in biofilm is higher than that in out biofilm but the r3 and r4 suggested the opposite trend this result mainly owing to the different biofilm thickness when the influent organic carbon increased the biofilm thickness soared which caused the more thickness anaerobic area this process resulted in part of the anaerobic zone to be separated into the in biofilm and further brought about the abundance of anaerolineae increasing nitrospirae had the same trend with the phylum level indicating nitrogen removal in the ma ba system was mainly owing to the nitrification denitrification process in the lower influent organic carbon but mainly due to the algae assimilation process in higher influent organic carbon these results were also consistent with the kinetic analysis betaproteobacteria in the ma ba were related to polyphosphate poly p accumulating organisms paos zeng et al 2016 however it was not detected in the ma ba system this result proved that the phosphate removal was mainly the function of algae in the aspect of microbial communities thus the ma ba system moderated the disadvantage of phosphate removal in a single mabr system the bacteria abundance in the genus was detected and shown in fig 6 b the predominant genus in the four ma bas was norank f a4b with a higher percentage in out biofilm than the in biofilm besides the denitratisoma a kind of denitrification bacteria also occupied the main percentage in all of the bacteria in the genus level in the in biofilm owing to the sufficient oxygen denitratisoma abundance was declined by 9 29 19 68 19 64 and 22 66 in r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively compared to the out biofilm it is reported that the norank f caldilineaceae can utilized organic matters from the dead microorganism including eps as carbon source to support their proliferation wang et al 2019 the abundance of norank f caldilineaceae in the in biofilm was increased by 0 90 0 25 0 98 and 1 00 in r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively than the out biofilm this result was associated with the increasing eps concentration which was consistent with the result of eps analysis norank o chloroplast was responsible for the part of chl a accumulation in the ma ba system moreover nitrospira in the genus level had the same trend to the phylum and class level flavobacteriia which was related to the class bacteroidia would degrade proteins effectively kirchman 2002 the in biofilm contained more flavobacteriia than the out biofilm with the percentage of 0 18 5 83 0 23 and 0 06 in r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively which was increased by 0 10 4 60 0 23 and 0 64 compared to out biofilm 3 5 2 redundancy analysis rda employing rda to reveal the relationship between environmental variations and bacteria abundance in the phylum level can indicate their changes in different treatment conditions the detail was shown in supplementary materials a clear distinction among treatments in the four ma ba systems can be seen in fig 7 the first two principal components explained more than 98 of the variation in the microbe abundance there was a dramatically positive correlation between do and nitrospirae and both of them showed a positive relationship with the samples of r1 and r2 besides a negative correlation between samples r1 and r2 and chl a demonstrated that the two reactors were less subjected to the effect of chl a in other word the removal of nh4 n in these two ma ba systems was not relative to the chl a the two results suggest that the nitrification denitrification process rather than algae assimilation was the main route for the nh4 n removal in r1 and r2 r3 and r4 presented a positive correlation with chl a especially r4 meanwhile ic and cod also had a positive correlation with chl a which means that ic and cod contributed to the chl a accumulation in the ma ba system in this condition it can be averred that the proliferation of algae was positively impacted by the cod concentration with ma phosphate and tn removal load had a positive relationship with r2 r3 and r4 whereas r1 exhibited a negative correlation additionally a few bacteria stood out in the rda analysis bacteroidetes were more closely associated with the removal of phosphate and tn also r1 showed a strong relationship with the main phylum bacteria except for the chloroflexi whereas r4 has an obvious relationship with chloroflexi all of these results were consistent with the investigation of eps and bacteria communities analysis 4 conclusion in this study membrane aeration was applied to bacteria algae system to investigate the effect of organic carbon on algae proliferation rda suggested that chl a had a positive correlation with cod which was owing to sufficient ic produced by ma promoting the algae growth condition the concentration of chl a in r4 was increased by 17 77 mg cm2 than r1 besides the nutrient removal route has been changed from bacterial function to algae assimilation as the influent cod increased the abundance of some bacteria acinetobacter that contributed to algae growth was also boosted meanwhile the abundance of cyanobacteria which was harmful to the biofilm presented the declining trend overall this study provided a new insight for employing the ma to the ba system to break the idea that organic carbon was useless for algae

17981,in the bacteria algae ba system the amount of oxygen produced by the algae is always insufficient for the organic carbon degradation resulting in less inorganic carbon ic production meanwhile the conventional extra aeration method always causes co2 stripping and ic loss both two reasons limited the algae boosting membrane aeration ma has the excellent capability of organic carbon thorough degradation and gas blown off control in this study ma ba was employed to investigate the effect of organic carbon on the algae growth results showed that cod had a positive correlation with chlorophyll a chl a and algae proliferation in ma ba system according to the redundancy analysis rda the biggest chl a concentration 20 95 mg cm2 occurred in r4 cod 400 mg l stimulated algal population changed nutrient removal pathway from bacterial action to algae action meantime soared algae accumulation would selectively excite the abundance of bacteria that supported the algae growth such as acinetobacter which exhibited a growing trend as the increase of influent cod especially in the inner biofilm this paper provided new insight into the effect of organic carbon on the algae in a novel ma ba system which will be helpful for future research graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane aeration bacteria algae biofilm structure organic carbon bubble free 1 introduction the ba system is well known as a promising technology for wastewater treatment in this system co2 and nutrients are absorbed by the algae for self proliferation and maintain high cell levels through the assimilation process meanwhile a large amount of o2 is produced through the photosynthesis lee et al 2015 bacteria in the ba system can utilize the o2 for organic carbon degradation the degradation product is inorganic carbon which is the main multiplication substance from the algae and autotrophic bacteria ozkan et al 2012 shen et al 2017 complex interactions between attached algae and bacteria can not only remove the pollutants in wastewater but also complete their growth cai et al 2013 in recent years to alleviate the low c n problem the ba system is always adopted to treat the wastewater including high concentration nutrients i e anaerobic digestion effluent a higher nutrient nitrogen and phosphate removal efficiency was obtained on the fourth day xie et al 2018 besides seafood wastewater effluent was treated by the ba system thi et al 2019 results showed that a better formation of bacteria algae sludge 93 0 5 5 removal efficiency of total suspended solids and 88 0 2 2 nutrient removal rate were achieved with 14 days hydraulic retention time hrt however such a long hrt narrowed its prospects for application when the ba system operates alone some researchers focused on the extra aeration to shorten hrt tang et al 2018 the different aeration rates experiment was adopted with hrt of 1 day it was clear that aeration process can increase the pollutants removal efficiencies and reduce hrt but the high intensity aeration inhibited nutrients uptake for algae biomass accumulation and broke the balance between microalgae and bacteria tang et al 2016 to decrease the impact of aeration on the algae growth and reduce the cost of aeration an anoxic aerobic photobioreactor was employed alcantara et al 2015 the pollutant removal rates were increased by 4 0 41 0 and 11 0 in total organic carbon toc ic and tn respectively besides half of the o2 was saved however all of the traditional aeration methods using air blast head will cause co2 stripping and ic loss castrillo et al 2019 which was the main reason limited the algae proliferation zhang et al 2020 ma has drawn broad attention all over the world owing to two features strong organic carbon carbonization capability and the no gas blown off augusto et al 2018 lin et al 2016 in membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr system the membrane has two functions on the one hand the membrane surface works as a carrier for the multiplication of microorganisms through the bio adsorbed process li and liu 2019 owing to the huge membrane specific surface area bacteria biomass accumulation was achieved in the treatment process the o2 diffused from membrane pores is utilized by the microorganisms attached to the membrane surface during the transfer process li et al 2008 the transfer of substance in the wastewater is in the opposite direction to the transfer of o2 this type of transmission form which was named counter diffusion is more conducive to the removal of pollutants li and liu 2019 due to the counter diffusion the mabr can degrade the refractory organic compounds such as c16 alkyl quaternary ammonium compounds lai et al 2017 coal chemical reverse osmosis pollutants lan et al 2018 high o aminophenol concentration wastewater tian et al 2019 and perchloroethylene pce ohandja and stuckey 2007 ohandja and stuckey 2010 and obtained an obvious removal rate on the other hand o2 molecules produced by the membrane aeration process is invisible to the naked eye in this condition the stripping phenomenon is minimized resulting in a theoretical o2 utilization rate reaching 100 li and zhang 2018 in the nitrogen removal process in mabr less no and n2o were produced compared to a conventional biofilm reactor the no and n2o concentrations at the biofilm liquid interface of the mabr were 0 0066 0 0014 mg n l and 0 01 0 0009 mg n l respectively kinh et al 2017 meanwhile the modeling process was applied to evaluate no and n2o production in the periodic aeration treatment process results demonstrated that an increase in cycle frequency can limit the no and n2o formation and reduce nitrogen element loss ni et al 2013 another modeling of co2 stripping to the membrane lumen was investigated in an mabr system in that research co2 was more likely diffused to the membrane lumen instead of stripping to the atmosphere owing to the counter diffusion biofilms in the membrane aerated process ma et al 2017 considering the two crucial features of mabr technology combining membrane aeration and ba is necessary in this no stripping ma ba system declined co2 loss can provide more ic for the multiplying algae organic carbon was an important indirect influence factor for the proliferation of the algae owing to the complete carbonization process of membrane aeration system therefore in this test the novel ma ba system was set to investigate 1 the algae growth condition in different organic carbon concentrations 2 the changes of nutrients removal route through the kinetic analysis 3 the correlation between algae proliferation and cod through rda and 4 the mechanisms for enhancing pollutants removal from wastewater by analyzing the microorganism abundance diversity 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design the configuration of the ma ba system used in this test was shown in fig 1 which included four systems gas system wastewater inlet system mixed system and biochemical system the main function of each system was explained as follow the gas system was employed to supply pure oxygen to the bioreactor and the intake flow volume of oxygen was 5 ml min the influent system controlled the continuous water inlet rate through the peristaltic pump according to the volume of the actual water body contained in ma ba a reaction time of 24 h was set a magnetic stirring apparatus was constructed to make the entire reactor in a fully mixed state mixed system in this part the main purpose was to regulate the cross flow velocity across the biofilm to improve the mass transfer efficiency the biochemical system was the focus of ma ba system and the function of it was both membrane aerated biofilm reactor and photobioreactor the structure of the biochemical system was an opened 2 0 l organic glass rectangular container with a total working volume of 1 8 l a lid was equipped with the rectangular reactor which can be opened to easily monitor the dissolve oxygen do and ph of the wastewater the membrane module occupied 0 2 l were installed and submerged in ma ba membrane unit parameters was exhibited in table 1 2 2 ba community set up the single ba system included active sludge and algae activated sludge flocs came from the secondary sedimentation tanks in the wastewater treatment plant wwtp harbin china the algae were bought from taobao and enlarged in the bg11 culture medium for 10 days after cultivated to 1500 mg l mixed liquid suspended solid the algae were worked as algae inoculum the activated sludge was diluted to the same mlss with the algae and mixed with the algae in artificial wastewater to make them combination gradual artificial wastewater was shown in supplementary materials 2 3 experiment design the laboratory scale batch tests were prepared in four ba ma systems with the test temperature of 26 2 c which was the same as the room temperature to save energy all ma ba systems were irradiated from 9 00 to 21 00 with 12 h per day through four independent led lights to replace sunlight with the light intensity of 5000 lx the volumetric exchange efficiency was kept at 80 resulting in an hrt of 30 h the total operation time was 90 days the cod concentrations in four ma ba systems named as r1 r2 r3 and r4 were controlled in 0 00 mg l 100 00 mg l 250 00 mg l and 400 00 mg l to investigate the effect of different organic concentrations on the algae growth and pollutants removal efficiencies the details of influent water qualities in the treatment process are shown in table 2 furthermore the other substance in the influent wastewater was presented in supplementary materials 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 water quality analysis owing to the algae photosynthesis the ph and do was different between the daytime and nighttime therefore adopting a ph meter pb 21 germany and do meter oxi3210 wtw germany to detect the ph and do is necessary besides the main nitrogen including nh4 n and tn crucial nutrient of po4 3 p and the residual cod were detected through the standard methods apha 2005 ic were measured according to the toc tn detection equipment all of the water quality analysis was investigated after filtered by the 0 45 μm membrane 2 4 2 biomass estimation and biological composition analysis the criteria for algae proliferation evaluation was always suggested to detect the chlorophyll a chl a besides there is also relative content to represent the algae growth condition which is the chl a biomass ratio thus the chl a concentration and chl a biomass ratio in the ma ba system was detected and calculated and the chl a was extracted by acetone solution the detail process was showed in the supplementary materials meanwhile the biomass in the membrane was also investigated according to the standard method to replace the mlvss extracellular polymeric substance eps concentration was determined through the eem parafac analysis f7000 hitachi japan the biological composition was analyzed by high throughput sequencing the detail process was also shown in the supplementary materials besides the t test was adopted to evaluate the possible associations among nutrients removal and the statistically significant difference ρ 0 05 between groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 carbon removal to investigate the carbon transformation mechanism the residual cod and ic concentrations are shown in fig 2 after 40 days operation the effluent organic carbon entered a steady state condition in all four ba ma systems at the end of the test the effluent cod concentration in r1 r2 r3 and r4 was 0 00 mg l 27 96 mg l 10 36 mg l 17 60 mg l respectively this result proves that the ma process had a dramatic performance in cod removal regardless of the influent cod concentration interestingly for the r1 there was no external organic carbon but cod appeared in the effluent from the 7th day it is obvious that organic matter is produced by the disintegration of the microorganism itself and released to the effluent besides the residual cod concentration in r4 was not the highest which indicated that the cod removal rate was not connected with the original cod concentration ic exists as three forms including free dissolved co2 bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions which depends on the ph of the water zhang et al 2019 although algae can use ic for photosynthesis co2 is the most important final matter in the photosynthesis process amoroso et al 1998 besides the ic in wastewater is either transformed into co2 before absorbance or converted to co2 intracellularly after absorbance it is reported that co2 can be captured from the gas phase when ic 50 mg l li et al 2017 then the ic enriched ma ba system can be adopted to support biomass proliferation thus ic higher than 50 mg l in the reactor is beneficial for algae growth there are also some researches illustrated that an increase photosynthesis ratio was found in algae biofilms with extra bicarbonate supply kesaano et al 2015 it is clear that owing to no external organic carbon the effluent ic concentration in r1 was the lowest among the four reactors the ic that supporting for the autotrophic microorganism proliferation was mainly from the original wastewater thus the effluent ic concentration in r1 was the lowest in the four reactors maintaining 31 96 mg l which was insufficient for the algae normal proliferation besides with increasing external organic carbon concentration the effluent ic concentration also soared the residual ic was sufficient for the algae growth in r3 and r4 with the effluent ic concentrations of 103 96 mg l and 163 36 mg l respectively however in r2 the ic was 56 4 mg l in this condition the residual ic was sufficient for the normal multiplication of algae yet the proliferation condition was poorer than r3 and r4 therefore in the carbon removal aspect the increasing cod influent concentration does not damage the ma ba system operation meanwhile the increasing product ic promoted the algae live environment 3 2 chlorophyll a and biomass accumulation the chl a concentration is the main indicator of algae proliferation condition in the ba system yao et al 2019 to better understand the biomass of the four ma bas and distinguish the effect of different original cod concentrations on the algae growth the chl a biomass ratios were also investigated and shown in fig 3 chl a concentration of r4 was the highest 20 95 mg cm2 in all four ma bas which was 17 77 mg cm2 13 60 mg cm2 and 4 51 mg cm2 higher compared to r1 r2 and r3 respectively moreover chl a biomass ratio displayed an obvious increase trend 0 41 mg mg and 0 45 mg mg respectively in r3 and r4 and a moderate increase in r2 0 31 mg mg compared to r1 which was a no external organic carbon ma ba system the algae absolute accumulation represented by chl a concentration and relative content represented by chl a biomass ratio suggested that the algae proliferation condition soared with increasing influent cod the minimum chl a biomass accumulation in all of the four reactors happened in r1 nevertheless the value was still around 250 fold higher than the traditional biofilm reactors with normal aeration process with the highest chl a biomass ratio of 0 0035 mg mg tang et al 2016 this result suggests that membrane aeration has the remarkable ability to promote the growth environment of algae owing to the amount of ic produced in the ma ba system however due to the drastically increased organic carbon the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria boosted obviously so sludge production and biomass in the biofilm were increased in this condition although the chl a in r4 had an obvious growth than other ma ba systems the chl a biomass ratio did not show a significant increase the chl a in r4 was around 6 59 times that in r1 but the chl a biomass ratio was only 1 96 times that in r1 this phenomenon demonstrated that no significant fluctuations have occurred in the proliferation balance between the algae and bacteria as the influent cod increased which means that ma ba system was suitable for the symbiotic relationship between algae and bacteria 3 3 kinetic of ammonia and phosphate removal under different influent cod conditions in the presence of higher substrates the half saturation constant ka of the nitrification process relative to substrate concentration is negligible thus the nitrification rate is indeed a zero order kinetics for the substrate murphy k l et al 1977 arvin and harremoes 1990 besides monod s kinetic expression which was belonged to the first order kinetics with sufficient substrate was appropriate for the algae biofilm proliferation with the nutrient absorption process maureen and ronald 2014 therefore the main function of the nutrients removal in ma ba system can be proved through the kinetics equation and the correlation coefficient r2 to clarify the nutrient removal route in the ma ba system the kinetics of nh4 n and po4 3 p removal during one hrt was calculated in fig 4 and the correlation coefficient r2 was summarized in table 3 in the aspect of nh4 n removal the correlation coefficient of r1 and r2 in zero order kinetic was higher than that in first order kinetic which means the main nh4 n removal route was nitrification process besides although the algae absorption process also contributed to the removal of nh4 n it did not play a major role this result was because the algae production is not enough to support assimilation to become the dominant mode in r1 and r2 in contrast as the soaring of influent cod the correlation coefficient of first order kinetic was gradually higher than that in zero order kinetic r3 and r4 this phenomenon demonstrated that the nh4 n removal route has been changed from nitrification to algae assimilation as the algae biomass accumulation this phenomenon was also significant in phosphate removal kinetic all four ma ba system were more in line with the first order kinetic equation and the correlation coefficients increased as the influent organic carbon soared when the influent cod reaches 400 00 mg l r4 the correlation coefficient has reached 0 9786 in this part nutrient removal path had been studied it is suggested that he route of nutrient removal was changed from bacterial action to algal action with the increase of organic carbon it is further proved that the increase of organic carbon can enrich algae and change the internal pollutant removal mode of the ma ba system 3 4 ma ba performance in nutrients removal under different organic carbon concentrations according to the kinetic analysis nh4 n removal in the ma ba system took place in two parts nitrification denitrification and algae assimilation as the soar of influent cod the algae assimilation was dominant meanwhile the phosphate removal in the ma ba system was mainly through the algae absorption regardless of the influent cod concentration thus to some extent the phosphate removal rate can represent the algae proliferation condition the nh4 n tn and phosphate concentrations in the effluent are shown in fig 5 effluent nh4 n concentrations were kept at a low level in r1 r2 r3 and r4 with residual concentrations of 0 03 mg l 0 63 mg l 0 03 mg l and 6 74 mg l respectively compared with the other three reactors the r4 had the highest residual nh4 n concentration which was attributed to the high organic carbon disrupting the growth balance between the nitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria more organic carbon provided a better proliferation condition for the heterotrophic bacteria and limited the growth of nitrifying bacteria owing to its long growth cycle dong et al 2009 sun et al 2015 tn was the macroscopic index to represent nitrogen removal significantly in r4 the tn removal efficiency was the highest interestingly the tn had an obvious removal in r1 without external organic carbon which resulted in no denitrification thus the tn removal was not attributed to the nitrification denitrification process besides the algae have strong nitrogen assimilation ability which contributed to the tn removal in r1 this result proves that algae played a crucial role in the tn removal phosphate removal results further proved this point in fig 5 c the phosphate presented an obvious removal at the end of the test in r1 r2 r3 and r4 with the effluent concentrations of 4 61 mg l 3 18 mg l 1 91 mg l and 1 19 mg l respectively without external organic carbon the phosphate appeared the ineffective release in r1 however this phenomenon vanished after around 20 days operated which was because of the algae assimilation owing to the lower ic in r1 the algae assimilation showed a weak trend as the cod concentration increased the residual phosphate concentration declined significantly on the one hand the vastly increased organic carbon consumed more o2 to degrade providing an anaerobic environment for the phosphate effective release on the other hand owing to the complete degradation of ma ba system more ic was produced for the algae proliferation to absorb more phosphate these two processes determined the amount of phosphate removal a notable phenomenon appeared in r2 and r3 the removal ability of phosphate in r3 was obviously higher than in r2 but the tn removal capability was similar to the r2 this phenomenon was probably due to there being more algae in r3 the algae assimilation instead of the nitrification denitrification was the main reason for the tn removal in r3 which proved that organic carbon significantly promoted the algae growth environment condition at the end of the test the residual tn concentration in r1 was 31 96 mg l with the removal rate of 49 35 besides the r2 and r3 presented the similar tn removal with effluent tn concentrations of 13 55 mg l and 10 79 mg l respectively this phenomenon illustrated that the nitrification denitrification in high cod condition was not the main pathway for the decreased effluent nitrogen concentration which was consistent with the result of kinetic 3 5 microorganism abundance analysis 3 5 1 bacteria species analysis to achieve the whole insight into the microorganism community diversity phylum class and genus in four ma bas were investigated and shown in fig 6 in the phylum level the main function bacteria in the inner of the four ma ba biofilms were proteobacteria bacteroidetes and chloroflexi with the abundance of r1in 39 26 14 50 and 13 01 respectively r2in 39 54 28 03 and 9 35 respectively r3in 37 83 15 47 and 29 00 respectively r4in 24 15 27 75 and 31 24 respectively it is reported that the proteobacteria and bacteroidetes dominated ma ba systems had excellent cod and nh4 n treatment capabilities zhang et al 2020 in these four reactors the percentage of the three bacteria in the in biofilm was not changed significantly as the increasing of influent cod this result demonstrated that the ma ba was equipped with excellent organic carbon removal capability and the algae proliferation did not have a serious impact on it it is worth noting that whether in the in biofilm or out biofilm cyanobacteria existed which is hazardous after the lysis but the abundance of cyanobacteria presented the declining trend as the cod soared past researches suggested that the proliferation of cyanobacteria could be restricted by the proliferation of actinobacteria zhang et al 2018 in the ma ba system it is cleared that the inhibiting effect more significant as the increasing of influent cod concentration meanwhile the actinobacteria had an obvious accumulation in r1 out r2 out r3 out and r4 out with the percentage of 4 78 7 35 5 94 and 4 35 respectively furthermore acinetobacter was also verified as a beneficial bacterium facilitating the growth of algae in some ba system unnithan et al 2014 the abundance of acinetobacter in out biofilm was decreased as the soaring of influent cod but the percentage of acinetobacter in in biofilm was presented the increasing trend when the original organic carbon increased which suggested increasing organic carbon not only provided more ic for the proliferation of algae directly but also promoting the benefit bacteria acinetobacter to support the algae growth indirectly the percentage of nitrospirae was 7 04 2 04 0 60 and 0 30 in r1in r2in r3in and r4in respectively the abundance of nitrospirae was declined as the increase of original cod in the normal membrane aeration system this phenomenon was owing to the competition between the autotrophic bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria for the oxygen however as the kinetics analysis the nh4 n removal route had been changed from nitrification to algae assimilation as the algae biomass accumulation the nitrification process may be inhabited further the nitrogen removal pathway in the high organic carbon ma ba system has been transformed into algae adsorption furthermore the out biofilm presented the nearly anaerobic condition resulting in the death of nitrospirae with the percentage of 0 031 0 096 0 019 and 0 000 in r1out r2out r3out and r4out respectively to get further insight into the bacteria structure the bacteria abundance of the four ma ba systems in class level was investigated besides the anaerolineae was also the main function bacteria in the ma ba system with the percentage of 13 39 6 98 23 99 and 27 03 in r1in r2in r3in and r4in respectively moreover with an abundance of 15 68 12 65 6 97 and 13 01 in r1out r2out r3out and r4out it is obvious that in r1 and r2 the abundance of anaerolineae in the in biofilm is higher than that in out biofilm but the r3 and r4 suggested the opposite trend this result mainly owing to the different biofilm thickness when the influent organic carbon increased the biofilm thickness soared which caused the more thickness anaerobic area this process resulted in part of the anaerobic zone to be separated into the in biofilm and further brought about the abundance of anaerolineae increasing nitrospirae had the same trend with the phylum level indicating nitrogen removal in the ma ba system was mainly owing to the nitrification denitrification process in the lower influent organic carbon but mainly due to the algae assimilation process in higher influent organic carbon these results were also consistent with the kinetic analysis betaproteobacteria in the ma ba were related to polyphosphate poly p accumulating organisms paos zeng et al 2016 however it was not detected in the ma ba system this result proved that the phosphate removal was mainly the function of algae in the aspect of microbial communities thus the ma ba system moderated the disadvantage of phosphate removal in a single mabr system the bacteria abundance in the genus was detected and shown in fig 6 b the predominant genus in the four ma bas was norank f a4b with a higher percentage in out biofilm than the in biofilm besides the denitratisoma a kind of denitrification bacteria also occupied the main percentage in all of the bacteria in the genus level in the in biofilm owing to the sufficient oxygen denitratisoma abundance was declined by 9 29 19 68 19 64 and 22 66 in r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively compared to the out biofilm it is reported that the norank f caldilineaceae can utilized organic matters from the dead microorganism including eps as carbon source to support their proliferation wang et al 2019 the abundance of norank f caldilineaceae in the in biofilm was increased by 0 90 0 25 0 98 and 1 00 in r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively than the out biofilm this result was associated with the increasing eps concentration which was consistent with the result of eps analysis norank o chloroplast was responsible for the part of chl a accumulation in the ma ba system moreover nitrospira in the genus level had the same trend to the phylum and class level flavobacteriia which was related to the class bacteroidia would degrade proteins effectively kirchman 2002 the in biofilm contained more flavobacteriia than the out biofilm with the percentage of 0 18 5 83 0 23 and 0 06 in r1 r2 r3 and r4 respectively which was increased by 0 10 4 60 0 23 and 0 64 compared to out biofilm 3 5 2 redundancy analysis rda employing rda to reveal the relationship between environmental variations and bacteria abundance in the phylum level can indicate their changes in different treatment conditions the detail was shown in supplementary materials a clear distinction among treatments in the four ma ba systems can be seen in fig 7 the first two principal components explained more than 98 of the variation in the microbe abundance there was a dramatically positive correlation between do and nitrospirae and both of them showed a positive relationship with the samples of r1 and r2 besides a negative correlation between samples r1 and r2 and chl a demonstrated that the two reactors were less subjected to the effect of chl a in other word the removal of nh4 n in these two ma ba systems was not relative to the chl a the two results suggest that the nitrification denitrification process rather than algae assimilation was the main route for the nh4 n removal in r1 and r2 r3 and r4 presented a positive correlation with chl a especially r4 meanwhile ic and cod also had a positive correlation with chl a which means that ic and cod contributed to the chl a accumulation in the ma ba system in this condition it can be averred that the proliferation of algae was positively impacted by the cod concentration with ma phosphate and tn removal load had a positive relationship with r2 r3 and r4 whereas r1 exhibited a negative correlation additionally a few bacteria stood out in the rda analysis bacteroidetes were more closely associated with the removal of phosphate and tn also r1 showed a strong relationship with the main phylum bacteria except for the chloroflexi whereas r4 has an obvious relationship with chloroflexi all of these results were consistent with the investigation of eps and bacteria communities analysis 4 conclusion in this study membrane aeration was applied to bacteria algae system to investigate the effect of organic carbon on algae proliferation rda suggested that chl a had a positive correlation with cod which was owing to sufficient ic produced by ma promoting the algae growth condition the concentration of chl a in r4 was increased by 17 77 mg cm2 than r1 besides the nutrient removal route has been changed from bacterial function to algae assimilation as the influent cod increased the abundance of some bacteria acinetobacter that contributed to algae growth was also boosted meanwhile the abundance of cyanobacteria which was harmful to the biofilm presented the declining trend overall this study provided a new insight for employing the ma to the ba system to break the idea that organic carbon was useless for algae

17982,this study evaluated ozone treatment to address concerns regarding the discharge to marine waters of chemical contaminants and pathogens in reverse osmosis ro concentrates generated during the potable reuse of municipal wastewaters previous studies indicated that contaminants can be sorted into five groups based on their reaction rate constants with ozone and hydroxyl radical to predict degradation of chemical contaminants during ozonation of municipal effluents spiking representatives of each group into five ro concentrate samples this study demonstrated that the same contaminant grouping scheme could be used to predict contaminant degradation during ozonation of ro concentrates despite the higher concentrations of ozone and hydroxyl radical scavengers the predictive capability of the contaminant grouping scheme was further validated for four contaminants of concern in ro concentrates including the pesticides fipronil and imidacloprid and the metal chelates ni edta and cu edta after measuring their ozone and hydroxyl radical reaction rate constants these compounds were assigned to contaminant groups and their degradation during ozonation matched predictions addition of 300 mg l cao at ph 11 achieved partial removal of the native nickel and copper by precipitation ozone pretreatment further enhanced precipitation of nickel but not copper ozonation achieved 5 log inactivation of ms2 in all five concentrate samples at 1 18 mg o3 mg doc ozonation at 0 9 mg o3 mg doc formed 139 451 μg l bromate pretreatment of ro concentrates with chlorine and ammonia reduced bromate formation by a maximum of 48 but increased total halogenated dbp concentrations from 20 μg l to 36 μg l regardless neither bromate nor trihalomethane concentrations exceeded threshold concentrations of concern for discharge to marine waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords ozone metals pesticides ro concentrate virus bromate 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro treatment has been a key component of advanced treatment trains for potable reuse of municipal wastewater typically producing a purified permeate at 85 recovery gerrity et al 2013 although representing only 15

oceans tds 25 000 mg l where most large scale potable reuse plants are located and salts are of less concern than the elevated concentrations of chemical contaminants and pathogens united states environmental protection agency 2019 although ro treatment does not alter the mass loading of contaminants and pathogens in discharges to coastal waters the higher concentrations can be problematic particularly for discharge to poorly flushed estuaries for chemical contaminants concerns regard whether the elevated contaminant concentrations would contribute to aquatic toxicity in receiving water ecosystems chelated metals and pesticides are two potential concerns metals in municipal wastewater typically are bound to chelating agents e g 60 of cu and 75 of ni such as the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta used in industrial and household detergents sedlak et al 1997 bedsworth and sedlak 1999 munn et al 2004 metal edta chelates are poorly removed e g 4 cu edta during conventional wastewater treatment cheng et al 1975 srowland et al 1979 alder et al 1990 benjamin et al 1996 metal edta chelates can exert toxicity to some aquatic organisms sunda et al 1978 tessier and turner 1995 parker et al 2001 wenger et al 2005 additionally the high calcium concentrations in marine waters can release metals from edta chelates spencer 1958 producing cu2 and ni2 which are known to reduce reproduction in aquatic organisms by 20 at levels as low as 0 3 2 4 μg l luoma 1983 accordingly the u s epa 2019 has recommended that total dissolved cu and ni concentrations in saltwater not exceed 3 1 and 8 2 μg l respectively for protection of aquatic life during chronic exposure regarding pesticides the phenylpyrazole fipronil and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid are used to control fleas and ticks on pets their discharge to receiving waters via wastewater effluents has raised particular concerns as potential drivers for toxicity to aquatic invertebrates roessink et al 2013 weston and lydy 2014 bay area clean water agencies 2017 teerlink et al 2017 sadaria et al 2017 2019 the u s epa 2018 has established 11 ng l fipronil and 10 ng l imidacloprid as benchmark long term concentrations that should not be exceeded to protect aquatic invertebrates previous research has found that fipronil concentrations exceeded its aquatic life benchmark concentration in 70 of u s stone et al 2014 and 46 of california urban streams budd et al 2015 imidacloprid was detected in 50 of urban surface water samples in california at a 50 ng l median concentration ensminger et al 2013 and was estimated to be the primary driver of aquatic toxicity among pesticides detected in four german streams münze et al 2017 because both pesticides are poorly removed during wastewater treatment supowit et al 2016 sadaria et al 2016 2017 wastewater discharges are important sources of their loadings to surface waters with total concentrations of fipronil and its degradates ranging from 13 to 88 ng l and concentrations of imidacloprid ranging from 58 to 306 ng l in eight san francisco bay area wastewater effluents sadaria et al 2017 a further 6 7 fold concentration of these pesticides in ro concentrate would exacerbate the contributions of these pesticides to aquatic toxicity during discharges for pathogens the concerns regard whether their loadings in ro concentrate discharges would increase violations of water quality criteria for receiving waters serving as recreational waters pathogens in recreational waters are estimated to cause 90 million illnesses annually in the u s deflorio barker et al 2018 for example human norovirus is prevalent in coastal recreational waters and is associated with gastroenteritis duizer et al 2004 oka et al 2018 contact with seawater was

primary source of pathogens in coastal waters griffin et al 2003 national resources defense council 2014 ozonation could be used as an on site treatment of ro concentrate although other advanced oxidation processes including uv h2o2 yang et al 2016 tio2 photocatalysis dialynas et al 2008 westerhoff et al 2009 zhou et al 2011 and electrochemical oxidation bagastyo et al 2011 pérez et al 2010 van hege et al 2004 have also been investigated ozonation has been applied to conventional municipal wastewater effluents to degrade organic contaminants reungoat et al 2010 2011 2012 lee et al 2013 ozone o3 can react directly with organic contaminants but also produces hydroxyl radical oh in a series of reactions promoted by dissolved organic carbon doc von gunten 2003 lee et al 2013 lee et al 2013 demonstrated that when organic contaminants were sorted into five groups according to their reaction rate constants with o3 and oh the removal of contaminants within each group was fairly consistent across different conventional wastewater effluents as a function of applied o3 dose relative to the doc concentration i e mg o3 mg doc direct ozone reactions dominate for the degradation of contaminants with high ozone reaction rate constants while the generation of oh a non selective oxidant permits partial degradation of contaminants with low ozone reaction rate constants lee et al 2013 for the group of contaminants group i featuring the highest reaction rate constants with both o3 and oh 80 removal was typically achieved for o3 doses as low as 0 25 mg o3 mg doc however for contaminants with low reaction rate constants with both o3 and oh group v even a 1 5 mg o3 mg doc dose achieved 50 removal while the applicability of this contaminant grouping scheme to ro concentrates has not been evaluated application of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc achieved 80 removal of two β blocker pharmaceuticals metaprolol and atenolol in one ro concentrate benner et al 2008 and 70 removal of 8 other pharmaceuticals in another ro concentrate although 0 82 1 38 mg o3 mg doc was needed to achieve 80 removal of diclofenac atenolol and carbamazepine justo et al 2013 regarding metal chelates and pesticides of concern in ro concentrates previous research on ozonation demonstrated degradation of fipronil anandan and wu 2015 imidacloprid černigoj et al 2007 bourgin et al 2011 and cu edta huang et al 2016 but employed very high ozone doses e g 300 mg l huang et al 2016 in matrices other than municipal wastewater or ro concentrate another study observed 40 50 degradation of cu edta and cd edta spiked into conventional municipal wastewater after treatment with 0 5 0 7 mg o3 mg doc thalmann et al 2018 using five ro concentrates the goal of this study was to address several concerns for the treatment of ro concentrate prior to discharge to saline waters a primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether the groupings characterizing contaminant removal as a function of ozone dose i e mg o3 mg doc during ozonation of conventional municipal wastewater effluents also apply to contaminant removal in the more concentrated matrices of ro concentrates since the toxicity drivers in ro concentrate are poorly defined the contaminant grouping scheme would facilitate the prediction of removal as new contaminants of interest are identified the higher doc concentrations in ro concentrates may enhance the conversion of o3 to oh limiting the importance of direct reactions of o3 with contaminants conversely the higher doc concentrations also scavenge oh second this study tested the predictive ability of this categorization scheme by evaluating the removal of fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta as contaminants of particular concern for aquatic toxicity in ro concentrates third since ozonation could only liberate metals from edta chelates this study assessed the potential for removal of metals by precipitation after ozonation fourth because pathogens are also a concern for ro concentrate discharge the ability of ozone to inactivate ms2 bacteriophage as a pathogen indicator was explored lastly this study evaluated bromate formation a byproduct of ozonation and potential mitigation measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials text s1 provides reagent sources and purities ozone stock solutions were generated by passing oxygen gas 99 praxair danbury ct through an ozone generator triogen lab2b east kilbride scotland and bubbling into 0 5 1 l of deionized water on an ice water bath the ozone concentration in this stock was standardized by uv absorbance ε 260 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and was in the range of 45 55 mg l 2 2 sampling samples of ro concentrate were collected at five demonstration scale or full scale facilities treating municipal wastewater effluent for potable reuse samples were collected in 4 l amber glass bottles and shipped on ice overnight samples were stored at 4 c in the laboratory and analyses of general water quality parameters text s2 and tables 1 and s1 were conducted within 3 days of sample collection 2 3 determination of o3 and oh reaction rate constants the rate constants for o3 reactions with imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta were measured texts s3 s6 by competition kinetics using atrazine as the reference compound katz o3 6 0 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2000 a 200 ml solution of deionized water buffered at ph 7 7 with 5 mm borate buffer in a 250 ml borosilicate glass bottle was spiked with atrazine 0 19 μm or 0 93 μm 50 mm tert butanol as a oh scavenger and either imidacloprid 0 78 μm or 1 57 μm cu edta 10 μm or ni edta 10 μm as target compounds initial experiments determined that 50 mm tert butanol was sufficient to quench oh fig s1 the solutions were stirred continuously by a teflon coated magnetic stir bar the experiments were initiated by addition of 50 ml of the ozone stock solution to provide an initial o3 concentration of 10 mg l 210 μm because this o3 concentration is in excess relative to the contaminant concentration the reaction rate constant could be determined by following the contaminant loss under pseudo first order conditions samples 2 ml were withdrawn by pasteur pipette after 20 s and at 1 2 min intervals thereafter over the course of 12 min samples were added to a glass vial containing 0 2 ml of 50 mm sodium nitrite to quench the residual ozone and then were analyzed for residual atrazine or target compound the loss of o3 measured by the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 text s7 at various intervals indicated 50 loss of o3 over the 12 min of sampling the o3 reaction rate constants ktarget o3 for imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta were determined by competition kinetics against atrazine according to equation 1 where ctarget 0 and catz 0 are the initial concentrations of the target compound and atrazine respectively and ctarget and catz are the target compound and atrazine concentrations measured after specific times respectively the slope of plots of ln ctarget ctarget 0 versus ln catz catz 0 provided ktarget o3 experiments were conducted in duplicate for all compounds 1 ln c t a r g e t c t a r g e t 0 ln

exposure t 0 t o 3 d t as estimated by the trapezoidal rule huber et al 2003 ozone stock solution 5 ml was added to 250 ml of 5 mm borate buffered deionized water ph 7 7 spiked with 50 mm tert butanol and 0 92 μm fipronil to provide an initial o3 concentration of 1 mg l 21 μm in excess relative to fipronil samples 4 ml were collected every 10 s over 90 s samples were added to glass vials containing 0 12 ml of 1 mm indigo dye to immediately quench the residual ozone after removing a 1 ml aliquot for analysis of residual fipronil the remaining 3 ml was analyzed for residual o3 by the indigo method 2 ln c f i p r o n i l c f i p r o n i l 0 t 0 t o 3 d t k f i p r o n i l o 3 reaction rate constants for oh reactions with fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta were determined by competition kinetics using atrazine as the reference compound deionized water solutions 40 ml buffered at ph 7 8 with 5 mm borate were spiked with 0 93 μm atrazine and either 0 92 μm fipronil and 10 μm ni edta or 1 57 μm imidacloprid and 10 μm cu edta in 40 ml borosilicate vials fipronil and imidacloprid were spiked from 10 g l concentrated stock solutions in acetonitrile given the relatively low reaction rate constant for oh with acetonitrile 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 atkinson et al 1992 the oh scavenging by the 766 μm acetonitrile would have been limited regardless this scavenging does not affect the determination of reaction rate constants by competition kinetics the 40 ml solutions were purged with n2o for 30 min and then were decanted into 2 ml vials and capped with teflon lined septa under headspace free conditions the 2 ml vials were subjected to continuous γ radiolysis to generate oh from γ irradiation of water the n2o served to convert hydrated electrons and h atoms to oh text s8 buxton et al 1988 samples were periodically withdrawn in triplicate for analysis of residual atrazine and target compounds 2 4 ozonation of ro concentrate samples lee et al 2013 had found that degradation of compounds in municipal wastewater effluent could be predicted as a function of ozone dose on a mg o3 mg doc basis based upon the compounds reaction rate constants with o3 and oh they sorted compounds into the following 5 categories in order of decreasing reactivity ko3 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 group i ko3 between 10 m 1 s 1 and 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 group ii ko3 10 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and koh 5 109 m 1 s 1 group iii koh between 109 m 1 s 1 and 5 109 m 1 s 1 group iv and koh 109 m 1 s 1 group v degradation of members within each group were similar as a function of ozone dose while compounds of group i would be readily degraded by direct o3 reactions members of group v were poorly reactive with both o3 and oh the goal of these experiments was to evaluate whether the same categorization scheme could be used to predict contaminant degradation in ro concentrate the degradation of target contaminants was evaluated over ozone doses ranging up through 1 18 mg o3 mg doc ro concentrate samples were spiked with a mixture of the four target compounds and the following five compounds representing each of the five reactivity categories defined by lee et al 2013 based on their ko3 and koh values table 2 sulfamethoxazole group i atenolol group ii deet group iii atrazine group iv and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep group v ozonation was conducted in 25 ml glass vials capped with teflon lined caps under headspace free conditions the final concentrations of target compounds in the 25 ml solutions were the same for all experiments and ranged from 37 to 163 nm for organic compounds depending on their solubilities and were 4 μm for ni edta and cu edta thus the doc contributed by the spiked target compounds was always 1 of the doc concentrations table 1 an initial experiment evaluated the effect of the progressive increase in the concentration of the wastewater matrix on contaminant degradation the ro concentrate from facility 2 doc 36 mg l table 1 was diluted with deionized water to achieve 6 9 24 mg l doc concentrations ozone was applied from concentrated stock solutions to achieve a consistent 0 59 mg o3 mg doc dose across this concentration gradient because the maximum o3 stock concentration achievable by our system was 55 mg l some dilution of the ro concentrate was necessary to reach the 0 59 mg o3 mg doc dose thus 24 mg l was the maximum doc concentration compared to the 36 mg l doc concentration in the authentic ro concentrate for higher dilutions of this sample deionized water was added to make up the full 25 ml volume and maintain headspace free conditions samples were inverted several times and then held at room temperature for at least 3 h after which no o3 residual was measurable each ro concentrate was then subjected to a range of o3 doses 0 30 1 18 mg o3 mg doc in a similar fashion the doc concentrations in the authentic ro concentrates ranged from 22 5 to 86 7 mg l table 1 the dilution for each ro concentrate was set to enable a 1 18 mg o3 mg doc dose from the concentrated o3 stock solution such that each sample for a given ro concentrate was diluted to the same extent for the ro concentrate from facility 1 22 5 mg l doc samples were diluted to 14 4 mg l doc due to the high doc concentration in the ro concentrate from facility 5 86 7 mg l more significant dilution was necessary i e to 27 7 mg l doc all experiments were conducted in triplicate in addition to diluting the ro concentrate matrix addition of the cold ozone stock solution reduced the temperature of the ro concentrate by 6 c text s3 presents the results of a limited number of pilot scale experiments involving direct addition of o3 gas to ro concentrate at facility 2 and measurement of fipronil and imidacloprid degradation indicating that neither the dilution nor the temperature depression associated with the laboratory scale experiments affected the degree of contaminant degradation achieved as a function of ozone dose additional results from the pilot scale testing are provided in zhang et al 2020 2 5 precipitation of metals we evaluated whether ozone pretreatment could improve the removal of the native metals table 1 by precipitation potentially by liberating metals from chelates or transforming the ligands to weaker chelates for each ro concentrate 25 ml samples we compared the concentrations of total metals measured with or without ozone treatment and with or without the addition of reagents to promote precipitation ozone was dosed at 1 mg o3 mg doc in the same fashion described in section 2 4 a dose sufficient to result in significant degradation of metal chelates aliquots that were not ozonated were diluted with deionized water to the same extent as the ozonated samples to maintain consistent concentrations of metals and other matrix components text s9 samples were held for 2 h to ensure depletion of the ozone residual thereafter samples were split into 12 5 ml aliquots in 15 ml falcon tubes certain aliquots were adjusted to ph 11 with sodium hydroxide and supplemented with 300 mg l calcium oxide for the ro concentrate from facility 2 the effect of precipitation conditions was evaluated by varying the ph 9 5 11 and calcium oxide concentration 50 300 mg l and by evaluating the addition of 300 mg l of na2co3 after holding all aliquots for 8 h 6 ml of supernatant was acidified with concentrated nitric acid to achieve a 2 acid concentration prior to analysis of total residual metals 2 6 pathogen indicator inactivation the log removal of bacteriophage ms2 during ozonation of ro concentrates was used as an indicator for the removal of pathogenic viruses shin and sobsey 2003 bae and schwab 2008 ms2 attc 15597 b1 was propagated using e coli atcc 700891 as described previously eaton et al 2005 kohn and nelson 2007 the ms2 stock was then mixed into ro concentrate samples from each facility targeting a concentration of 106 107 plaque forming units pfus per ml samples were then treated with 0 1 18 mg o3 mg doc the same range employed in section 2 4 for evaluation of chemical contaminant degradation after holding for 3 h to ensure ozone depletion ms2 was enumerated in duplicate using a double agar layer technique according to a modification of standard method 9224 kohn and nelson 2007 each ozone experiment was repeated in at least duplicate text s10 provides additional details 2 7 bromate and disinfection byproduct dbp formation each ro concentrate 50 ml was treated with up to 1 mg o3 mg doc under headspace free conditions to evaluate bromate formation previous studies demonstrated that addition of either ammonia or chlorine and ammonia prior to ozonation could reduce bromate formation by sequestering bromide into bromamines and thereby preventing its oxidation to bromate pinkernell and von gunten 2001 buffle et al 2004 because chloramines frequently are added upstream of ro membranes to inhibit biofouling a chloramine residual occurs in ro concentrates different combinations of ammonia nh4cl and free chlorine hocl ocl were spiked prior to ozonation to evaluate their potential to mitigate bromate formation free chlorine stock solutions were concocted from 5 sodium hypochlorite solutions and were standardized by uv spectrometry at 292 nm ε 292 365 m 1s 1 furman and margerum 1998 text s11 provides additional details to evaluate the extent to which the addition of these halogenating agents promoted dbp formation additional samples 180 ml were treated in the same fashion in triplicate residual chlorine in each sample was quenched with 33 mg l l ascorbic acid 1 h after ozone treatment 1 h was used as an approximation of the residence time of treated water prior to discharge duplicate 40 ml aliquots were then taken from each sample and analyzed for 15 dbps including four trihalomethanes thms four haloacetonitriles four haloacetaldehydes two haloketones and chloropicrin these dbps were analyzed using modified epa method 551 1 as described previously zeng and mitch 2016 2 8 analytical methods total ni and cu were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific xseries 2 icp ms system with 0 1 μg l reporting limits ni edta was quantified by ion chromatography ic dionex integrion hpic system using an as11 hc anion exchange column 4 μm 4 250 mm and conductivity detection with an 100 μg l reporting limit cu edta was

additional details regarding the optimization of lc ms parameters fipronil and imidacloprid concentrations in the native ro concentrate samples were measured using solid phase extraction and lc ms ms text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality the ro concentrate samples had a wide range of doc concentrations 22 5 86 7 mg l table 1 alkalinities 385 848 mg l as caco3 and total dissolved solids tds concentrations 3442 5742 mg l by comparison the secondary municipal wastewater effluents in the lee et al 2013 study had 4 7 26 4 mg l doc and 65 330 mg l as caco3 alkalinity concurring with a 6 fold concentration factor between secondary effluents and ro concentrates the lower ph at facilities 4 and 5 may be associated with sulfuric acid addition prior to ro to control scaling the ro concentrates from facilities 4 and 5 received non nitrified effluents as indicated by the high ammonia concentrations the ro concentrates from facilities 1 3 exhibited lower ammonia concentrations and higher nitrate concentrations because they received nitrified effluents nitrite an important ozone scavenger von gunten 2003 was highest in the ro concentrate from facility 5 5 9 mg n l but also occurred at facilities 2 and 3 bromide the precursor for bromate ranged from 1 6 to 2 6 mg l calcium which can facilitate metal precipitation during alkaline treatment ranged from 233 to 499 mg l table s1 includes other general water quality parameters concentrations of total nickel total copper fipronil and imidacloprid exceeded their aquatic toxicity thresholds of 3 1 μg l 8 2 μg l 11 ng l and 10 ng l respectively in all five ro concentrates 3 2 degradation of organic contaminants spiked in ro concentrates lee et al 2013 had demonstrated that contaminants could be sorted into five groups based upon their reaction rate constants with o3 and oh with group i compounds exhibiting the highest rate constants with both oxidants the degradation of contaminants within each group was similar across secondary effluent samples as a function of o3 dose on a mg o3 mg doc basis to evaluate whether the pattern of contaminant degradation observed with secondary effluents also applies to ro concentrates we spiked representatives of each group table 2 into the ro concentrate samples and measured their degradation after treatment with various o3 doses because limits on the maximum concentration of o3 stock solutions necessitated some sample dilution we first evaluated whether the degradation changed with sample dilution when the ro concentrate from facility 2 was diluted to 6 9 24 mg l doc spiked with the five representative contaminants and then ozonated at 0 59 mg o3 mg doc the degradation of the five contaminants was similar across the dilution range fig s2 when the spiked ro concentrate sample from facility 2 was treated with 0 29 1 47 mg o3 mg doc degradation decreased with increasing group number fig 1 reflecting the lower reaction rate constants with the oxidants table 2 sulfamethoxazole group i was completely removed at 0 59 mg o3 mg doc while only 14 degradation of tcep group v was observed at 1 47 mg o3 mg doc the removal of each compound in this ro concentrate was within the range observed in ten secondary effluent samples by lee et al 2013 for the same range of o3 doses on a mg o3 mg doc basis fig s5 shows a comparison between facility 2 ro concentrate and the ten secondary effluent samples lee et al 2013 for sulfamethoxazole group i and deet group iii adding 50 mm tert butanol as a oh scavenger increased the removal of sulfamethoxazole and atenolol groups i ii fig s6 likely by increasing the o3 exposure by inhibiting the chain decomposition of ozone von gunten 2003 direct o3 reactions are particularly important for compounds in groups i ii lee et al 2013 however tert butanol completely inhibited the removal of deet atrazine and tcep groups iii v for which oh reactions dominate overall these results suggest that the pattern of contaminant degradation observed in secondary effluents applies to ro concentrates despite the higher concentrations of ozone and oh scavengers in ro concentrates some differences were observed between ro concentrate samples that correlated with nitrite concentrations table 1 during application of 0 3 mg o3 mg doc to samples from facilities 1 and 4 which lacked nitrite sulfamethoxazole group i was completely removed and the removal of atenolol group ii was 93 figs 2 and s7 for the same dose applied to samples from facilities 3 1 1 mg n l no2 and 5 5 9 mg n l no2 sulfamethoxazole removal was 81 and atenolol removal was 40 the sample from facility 2 0 4 mg n l no2 also exhibited limited removal of sulfamethoxazole 62 and atenolol 37 although its nitrite concentration was less than the nitrite in facilities 3 and 5 given that no2 effectively scavenges o3 k 3 7 105 m 1 s 1 at a 1 1 stoichiometry naumov et al 2010 no2 could have scavenged up to 13 29 and 78 of the applied o3 in the samples from facilities 2 3 and 5 respectively although direct o3 reactions are less important for the degradation of compounds in groups iii v scavenging of o3 by nitrite is still important because o3 is the ultimate source of oh at 0 3 mg o3 mg doc the samples from facilities 1 and 4 which lacked no2 featured higher removal of deet group iii 34 40 and atrazine group iv 17 18 than in samples from facilities 2 4 and 5 20 24 deet and 10 11 atrazine where no2 was detected at 1 18 mg o3 mg doc however removal of deet 70 84 and atrazine 58 74 was similar across all five samples these results suggest that after the scavenging capacity of no2 is exhausted at higher o3 doses the pattern of contaminant removal is similar across samples in addition to nitrite differing amounts of electron rich moieties in each facility s organic matter can also scavenge ozone to varying degrees 3 3 degradation of fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta to further validate the predictive capability of the contaminant grouping scheme for ro concentrates we evaluated fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta we determined their reaction rate constants with o3 and oh table 2 figs s8 10 these contaminants were then assigned to groups based upon the similarity of their rate constants to those of the group representatives fipronil exhibited the fastest rate constant with o3 comparable to that of atenolol group ii but was assigned to groups ii iii because its rate constant with oh was more similar to that of deet group iii imidacloprid was assigned to group iii and cu edta to group iv ni edta was assigned to groups iii iv since the ko3 was similar to that of deet while the koh was similar to that of atrazine the degradation patterns of each target contaminant concurred with the behavior of their assigned group representatives indicating that the classification scheme of lee et al 2013 works well in ro concentrate and the compounds of interest were grouped appropriately for example fig 3 compares the degradation of imidacloprid vs deet group iii and cu edta vs atrazine group iv for ozonation of ro concentrate from facility 2 additional comparisons are provided in fig s11 for example the degradation of fipronil and atenolol was similar across ro concentrates at low o3 doses degradation of both compounds was greater in concentrates from facilities 1 and 4 which did not contain measurable concentrations of nitrite fig s11 across all five ro concentrates 0 89 mg o3 mg doc degraded 80 97 of fipronil 44 74 of imidacloprid 38 77 of ni edta and 58 75 of cu edta the ko3 we determined for ni edta and cu edta were two orders of magnitude lower than the values determined previously by thalmann et al 2018 of 18 000 m 1 s 1 and 170 m 1 s 1 respectively while this previous study did not measure koh the ko3 values would place ni edta in group ii and cu edta in groups ii iii however the degradation of ni edta and cu edta observed in both studies aligned with the behavior of group iv compounds for example thalmann et al 2018 observed 40 50 removal of cu edta during ozonation of secondary effluent at 0 5 0 7 mg o3 mg doc while we observed 30 60 removal of cu edta during ozonation of ro concentrates at 0 59 mg o3 mg doc moreover addition of the oh scavenger tert butanol during ozonation of ro concentrate from facility 2 at 0 59 mg o3 mg doc inhibited degradation of ni edta and cu edta fig s12 indicating that oh dominated the degradation of these compounds in accordance with expectations for group iv compounds 3 4 alkaline precipitation of metals the native i e not spiked total nickel 18 72 μg l and copper 7 4 38 μg l concentrations in all five ro concentrate samples table 1 exceeded their aquatic benchmark concentrations 8 2 and 3 1 μg l respectively whether these occurred as metal edta complexes was unclear since these total metal concentrations were below the ni edta and cu edta detection limits i e 100 μg l and 50 μg l respectively first we sought to evaluate whether ozonation could transform native metal complexes to forms more amenable to removal by alkaline precipitation as a simple removal technique although ozonation partially degrades ni edta and cu edta fig s11 no difference in total nickel or copper concentrations was observed after ozonation without addition of precipitating agents fig 4 initial testing of different precipitation conditions using ro concentrate from facility 2 demonstrated that 300 mg l calcium oxide at ph 11 was optimal fig s13 when the ro concentrate samples were treated under these conditions without ozone pretreatment total copper concentrations decreased by 51 53 for facilities 2 5 figs 4 and s12 but 78 for facility 1 total nickel concentrations decreased by 18 31 across all 5 facilities thus a fraction of the total native nickel and copper in each ro concentrate was labile to alkaline precipitation with copper more labile than nickel particularly at facility 1 when these samples were ozonated and then subjected to alkaline conditions the total copper concentrations declined by 59 71 for facilities 2 5 and 92 for facility 1 total nickel concentrations declined by 60 67 across all 5 facilities since the native copper was already more labile to precipitation ozone pretreatment resulted in a greater enhancement in precipitative removal of nickel 3 fold than copper 25 because the native metal chelates were uncharacterized we evaluated the effect of ozonation and precipitation on free nickel and copper or ni edta and cu edta spiked into ro concentrates from facilities 1 3 and 5 at levels 2 4 times higher than the total concentrations of the native metals fig s14 free metals and their edta chelates served as end members for species that are labile or not labile to precipitation respectively for nickel the pattern observed was similar between the native metals and after spiking with ni edta suggesting that the native metals occurred in strongly bound chelates after spiking with ni edta there was little removal by precipitation alone 30 but ozone significantly enhanced nickel precipitation 40 at facilities 3 and 5 particularly for the sample from facility 1 70 the stability of ni edta concurs with previous research nowack et al 1996 addition of free nickel to the sample from facility 1 did not alter the levels of total nickel measured after precipitation with or without ozonation suggesting complete removal of the added free nickel for samples from facilities 3 and 5 spiked with free nickel the levels of total nickel measured after precipitation with and without ozone were higher than in the sample from facility 1 but still lower than when ni edta was added these results suggest that free nickel became partially bound with strong ligands in the samples from facilities 3 and 5 that were not present at facility 1 addition of both free copper and cu edta nearly doubled the total copper concentrations measured after precipitation with and without ozone fig s14 for native free or edta bound copper precipitation alone removed 50 of the total copper ozone further promoted copper removal particularly at facility 1 given that the nickel results suggest the occurrence of strong chelating agents in the samples from these three facilities it is likely that the native copper was bound to similar chelating agents but that the copper chelates were more labile to precipitation overall precipitation alone was capable of removing a significant fraction of copper but ozone pre treatment was needed to facilitate nickel removal however the precipitation conditions would generate significant quantities of sludge e g 10 tons day for a 4 million l day facility thus technologies other than precipitation e g ion exchange or electrodialysis should be pursued in conjunction with ozone pre treatment to remove metals partially liberated from chelates 3 5 ms2 inactivation by ozone due to its greater selectivity as an oxidant o3 is expected to be a more effective disinfectant than oh thus o3 may be more effective for controlling pathogens in ro concentrates than other aops that rely solely on oh provided there is sufficient contact with o3 before its rapid degradation and partial conversion into oh ms2 bacteriophage was used as a surrogate virus because it is non pathogenic and because california uses 5 log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage as one metric to validate disinfection systems for non potable reuse applications cadph 2014 when 106 107pfu ml of ms2 bacteriophage was spiked into each ro concentrate as an indicator virus 5 log removal was observed at 0 30 mg o3 mg doc for the samples from facilities 1 and 4 fig 5 where nitrite was not measurable samples from facilities 2 3 and 5 which contained nitrite required higher o3 doses to achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 however 5 log removal was achieved in all 5 concentrates at 1 18 mg o3 mg doc 3 6 bromate formation and mitigation ozone reactions with bromide form bromate von gunten and hoigne 1994 a potential human carcinogen with a 10 μg l maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water federal register 1998 similar to other carcinogenic disinfection byproducts e g ndma human cancer risk may not be the most relevant endpoint while aquatic toxicity thresholds are not well established the lowest observed effects concentration for inhibition of cell division in marine phytoplankton is 13 6 mg l hutchinson et al 1997 untreated ro concentrate from facility 1 had a significant bromate concentration 108 μg l likely because the potable reuse treatment train employs ozone prior to ro across the five concentrate samples bromate formation ranged from 34 to 247 μg l at 0 45 mg o3 mg doc and 139 451 μg l at 0 9 mg o3 mg doc fig 6 these concentrations were higher than the 35 μg l bromate observed by benner et al 2008 when ozonating a ro concentrate with 1 2 mg l br which is lower than br concentrations in ro concentrates from this study table 1 bromate formation was highest at facility 1 which featured the lowest doc and no detectable nitrite table 1 bromate formation was lowest at facility 5 which featured the highest doc and nitrite concentrations as a potential bromate mitigation measure we evaluated the addition of chlorine hocl and ammonia nh3 to convert br to hobr and then bromamines locking bromine into a less reactive form prior to ozonation buffle et al 2004 the second reagent was added 5 min after the first reagent and ozone was added 5 min after the second reagent ozone was allowed to react fully without quenching when hocl and nh3 were each added at a 2 1 molar ratio relative to br for the sample from facility 2 bromate formation decreased by 23 regardless of whether the hocl or nh3 was added first fig 6 addition of nh3 and then hocl to samples from the other four facilities reduced bromate formation by 9 38 when the chloramines were added at a two fold molar excess relative to bromide and by 16 48 at a four fold molar excess addition of preformed monochloramine not shown did not inhibit bromate formation the benefits associated with mitigation of bromate formation must be weighed against the risks posed by the production of halogenated dbps resulting from chloramine addition certain states have promulgated limits on trihalomethanes in discharges to marine waters over concerns regarding their potential to bioaccumulate in fish the florida department of environmental protection 2018 limits annual mean concentrations to 34 μg l dibromochloromethane and 22 μg l bromodichloromethane in discharges to marine waters the california ocean plan provides threshold concentrations of 8 6 μg l dibromochloromethane and 6 2 μg l bromodichloromethane california state water resources control board 2016 the concentrations of 15 halogenated dbps were measured in the sample from facility 2 without and with bromate mitigation treatments fig 7 a total dbp concentration of 20 μg l was detected prior to mitigation treatments resulting from the addition of chloramines upstream of microfiltration to reduce membrane biofouling of the measured dbps the 4 trihalomethanes were the dominant dbp class 10 μg l including 7 5 μg l chloroform treating ro concentrate with ozone slightly increased the concentrations of each dbp class except for thms total halogenated dbp formation increased with chlorine dose forming chloramines in situ during bromate mitigation experiments from 28 μg l at 41 μm 2 9 mg l as cl2 chlorine to 36 μg l at 83 μm 5 9 mg l as cl2 chlorine total halogenated dbp formation was lower 28 μg l vs 32 μg l when ammonia was added before chlorine thereby reducing the exposure to free chlorine for all treatments dibromochloromethane and bromodichloromethane maximum concentrations of 1 0 μg l and 5 2 μg l respectively were below their threshold concentrations 4 conclusions to address concerns regarding the discharge to marine waters of chemical contaminants and pathogens in ro concentrates this study evaluated 1 the ability of ozone to degrade chemical contaminants and 2 inactivate ms2 as a virus indicator 3 whether metals liberated from chelates by ozone could be precipitated and 4 the formation of bromate and halogenated dbps previous research had demonstrated that the degradation of contaminants during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents could be predicted by sorting contaminants into five reactivity groups based upon their reaction rate constants with ozone and oh after spiking representatives for each of the five groupings into five ro concentrates we demonstrated that this contaminant grouping scheme could also predict contaminant degradation in the more concentrated matrices of ro concentrates while nitrite reduced the observed degradation of contaminants relative to the predicted degradation at low ozone doses the pattern of observed degradation matched expectations at higher ozone doses after nitrite was degraded the predictive capability of the contaminant grouping scheme was further illustrated with fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta four contaminants of concern in ro concentrate after measuring their ozone and oh reaction rate constants fipronil group ii iii imidacloprid group iii ni edta group iii iv and cu edta group iv were sorted into contaminant groups the degradation of these contaminants spiked into ro concentrate samples followed expectations based upon their assigned groups addition of 300 mg l cao at ph 11 achieved partial removal of the native nickel and copper by precipitation ozone pretreatment facilitated precipitation of nickel while copper precipitation occurred without ozonation ozonation achieved 5 log inactivation of ms2 in all 5 concentrate samples at 1 18 mg o3 mg doc ozonation at 0 9 mg o3 mg doc formed 139 451 μg l bromate pretreatment of ro concentrates with chlorine and ammonia reduced bromate formation by a maximum of 48 but increased total halogenated dbp formation from 20 μg l associated with chloramine application upstream of microfiltration to 36 μg l regardless neither bromate not trihalomethane concentrations

17982,this study evaluated ozone treatment to address concerns regarding the discharge to marine waters of chemical contaminants and pathogens in reverse osmosis ro concentrates generated during the potable reuse of municipal wastewaters previous studies indicated that contaminants can be sorted into five groups based on their reaction rate constants with ozone and hydroxyl radical to predict degradation of chemical contaminants during ozonation of municipal effluents spiking representatives of each group into five ro concentrate samples this study demonstrated that the same contaminant grouping scheme could be used to predict contaminant degradation during ozonation of ro concentrates despite the higher concentrations of ozone and hydroxyl radical scavengers the predictive capability of the contaminant grouping scheme was further validated for four contaminants of concern in ro concentrates including the pesticides fipronil and imidacloprid and the metal chelates ni edta and cu edta after measuring their ozone and hydroxyl radical reaction rate constants these compounds were assigned to contaminant groups and their degradation during ozonation matched predictions addition of 300 mg l cao at ph 11 achieved partial removal of the native nickel and copper by precipitation ozone pretreatment further enhanced precipitation of nickel but not copper ozonation achieved 5 log inactivation of ms2 in all five concentrate samples at 1 18 mg o3 mg doc ozonation at 0 9 mg o3 mg doc formed 139 451 μg l bromate pretreatment of ro concentrates with chlorine and ammonia reduced bromate formation by a maximum of 48 but increased total halogenated dbp concentrations from 20 μg l to 36 μg l regardless neither bromate nor trihalomethane concentrations exceeded threshold concentrations of concern for discharge to marine waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords ozone metals pesticides ro concentrate virus bromate 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro treatment has been a key component of advanced treatment trains for potable reuse of municipal wastewater typically producing a purified permeate at 85 recovery gerrity et al 2013 although representing only 15 of the influent flow the ro concentrate features the rejected salts pathogens and chemical contaminants at concentrations 6 7 fold higher than in the municipal wastewater national research council 2012 with total dissolved solids tds concentrations up to 5 000 mg l the salts in ro concentrate represent a significant challenge for disposal to inland freshwater receiving waters tds 500 mg l van der bruggen et al 2003 khan et al 2009 pérez gonzález et al 2012 united states environmental protection agency and smith 2017 however this study focuses on disposal to coastal waters estuaries and oceans tds 25 000 mg l where most large scale potable reuse plants are located and salts are of less concern than the elevated concentrations of chemical contaminants and pathogens united states environmental protection agency 2019 although ro treatment does not alter the mass loading of contaminants and pathogens in discharges to coastal waters the higher concentrations can be problematic particularly for discharge to poorly flushed estuaries for chemical contaminants concerns regard whether the elevated contaminant concentrations would contribute to aquatic toxicity in receiving water ecosystems chelated metals and pesticides are two potential concerns metals in municipal wastewater typically are bound to chelating agents e g 60 of cu and 75 of ni such as the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta used in industrial and household detergents sedlak et al 1997 bedsworth and sedlak 1999 munn et al 2004 metal edta chelates are poorly removed e g 4 cu edta during conventional wastewater treatment cheng et al 1975 srowland et al 1979 alder et al 1990 benjamin et al 1996 metal edta chelates can exert toxicity to some aquatic organisms sunda et al 1978 tessier and turner 1995 parker et al 2001 wenger et al 2005 additionally the high calcium concentrations in marine waters can release metals from edta chelates spencer 1958 producing cu2 and ni2 which are known to reduce reproduction in aquatic organisms by 20 at levels as low as 0 3 2 4 μg l luoma 1983 accordingly the u s epa 2019 has recommended that total dissolved cu and ni concentrations in saltwater not exceed 3 1 and 8 2 μg l respectively for protection of aquatic life during chronic exposure regarding pesticides the phenylpyrazole fipronil and the neonicotinoid imidacloprid are used to control fleas and ticks on pets their discharge to receiving waters via wastewater effluents has raised particular concerns as potential drivers for toxicity to aquatic invertebrates roessink et al 2013 weston and lydy 2014 bay area clean water agencies 2017 teerlink et al 2017 sadaria et al 2017 2019 the u s epa 2018 has established 11 ng l fipronil and 10 ng l imidacloprid as benchmark long term concentrations that should not be exceeded to protect aquatic invertebrates previous research has found that fipronil concentrations exceeded its aquatic life benchmark concentration in 70 of u s stone et al 2014 and 46 of california urban streams budd et al 2015 imidacloprid was detected in 50 of urban surface water samples in california at a 50 ng l median concentration ensminger et al 2013 and was estimated to be the primary driver of aquatic toxicity among pesticides detected in four german streams münze et al 2017 because both pesticides are poorly removed during wastewater treatment supowit et al 2016 sadaria et al 2016 2017 wastewater discharges are important sources of their loadings to surface waters with total concentrations of fipronil and its degradates ranging from 13 to 88 ng l and concentrations of imidacloprid ranging from 58 to 306 ng l in eight san francisco bay area wastewater effluents sadaria et al 2017 a further 6 7 fold concentration of these pesticides in ro concentrate would exacerbate the contributions of these pesticides to aquatic toxicity during discharges for pathogens the concerns regard whether their loadings in ro concentrate discharges would increase violations of water quality criteria for receiving waters serving as recreational waters pathogens in recreational waters are estimated to cause 90 million illnesses annually in the u s deflorio barker et al 2018 for example human norovirus is prevalent in coastal recreational waters and is associated with gastroenteritis duizer et al 2004 oka et al 2018 contact with seawater was associated with an increase in illness rates among surfers in san diego california by 86 during the dry season and by 228 during the wet season arnold et al 2017 wastewater discharges are already a primary source of pathogens in coastal waters griffin et al 2003 national resources defense council 2014 ozonation could be used as an on site treatment of ro concentrate although other advanced oxidation processes including uv h2o2 yang et al 2016 tio2 photocatalysis dialynas et al 2008 westerhoff et al 2009 zhou et al 2011 and electrochemical oxidation bagastyo et al 2011 pérez et al 2010 van hege et al 2004 have also been investigated ozonation has been applied to conventional municipal wastewater effluents to degrade organic contaminants reungoat et al 2010 2011 2012 lee et al 2013 ozone o3 can react directly with organic contaminants but also produces hydroxyl radical oh in a series of reactions promoted by dissolved organic carbon doc von gunten 2003 lee et al 2013 lee et al 2013 demonstrated that when organic contaminants were sorted into five groups according to their reaction rate constants with o3 and oh the removal of contaminants within each group was fairly consistent across different conventional wastewater effluents as a function of applied o3 dose relative to the doc concentration i e mg o3 mg doc direct ozone reactions dominate for the degradation of contaminants with high ozone reaction rate constants while the generation of oh a non selective oxidant permits partial degradation of contaminants with low ozone reaction rate constants lee et al 2013 for the group of contaminants group i featuring the highest reaction rate constants with both o3 and oh 80 removal was typically achieved for o3 doses as low as 0 25 mg o3 mg doc however for contaminants with low reaction rate constants with both o3 and oh group v even a 1 5 mg o3 mg doc dose achieved 50 removal while the applicability of this contaminant grouping scheme to ro concentrates has not been evaluated application of 0 25 mg o3 mg doc achieved 80 removal of two β blocker pharmaceuticals metaprolol and atenolol in one ro concentrate benner et al 2008 and 70 removal of 8 other pharmaceuticals in another ro concentrate although 0 82 1 38 mg o3 mg doc was needed to achieve 80 removal of diclofenac atenolol and carbamazepine justo et al 2013 regarding metal chelates and pesticides of concern in ro concentrates previous research on ozonation demonstrated degradation of fipronil anandan and wu 2015 imidacloprid černigoj et al 2007 bourgin et al 2011 and cu edta huang et al 2016 but employed very high ozone doses e g 300 mg l huang et al 2016 in matrices other than municipal wastewater or ro concentrate another study observed 40 50 degradation of cu edta and cd edta spiked into conventional municipal wastewater after treatment with 0 5 0 7 mg o3 mg doc thalmann et al 2018 using five ro concentrates the goal of this study was to address several concerns for the treatment of ro concentrate prior to discharge to saline waters a primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether the groupings characterizing contaminant removal as a function of ozone dose i e mg o3 mg doc during ozonation of conventional municipal wastewater effluents also apply to contaminant removal in the more concentrated matrices of ro concentrates since the toxicity drivers in ro concentrate are poorly defined the contaminant grouping scheme would facilitate the prediction of removal as new contaminants of interest are identified the higher doc concentrations in ro concentrates may enhance the conversion of o3 to oh limiting the importance of direct reactions of o3 with contaminants conversely the higher doc concentrations also scavenge oh second this study tested the predictive ability of this categorization scheme by evaluating the removal of fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta as contaminants of particular concern for aquatic toxicity in ro concentrates third since ozonation could only liberate metals from edta chelates this study assessed the potential for removal of metals by precipitation after ozonation fourth because pathogens are also a concern for ro concentrate discharge the ability of ozone to inactivate ms2 bacteriophage as a pathogen indicator was explored lastly this study evaluated bromate formation a byproduct of ozonation and potential mitigation measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials text s1 provides reagent sources and purities ozone stock solutions were generated by passing oxygen gas 99 praxair danbury ct through an ozone generator triogen lab2b east kilbride scotland and bubbling into 0 5 1 l of deionized water on an ice water bath the ozone concentration in this stock was standardized by uv absorbance ε 260 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and was in the range of 45 55 mg l 2 2 sampling samples of ro concentrate were collected at five demonstration scale or full scale facilities treating municipal wastewater effluent for potable reuse samples were collected in 4 l amber glass bottles and shipped on ice overnight samples were stored at 4 c in the laboratory and analyses of general water quality parameters text s2 and tables 1 and s1 were conducted within 3 days of sample collection 2 3 determination of o3 and oh reaction rate constants the rate constants for o3 reactions with imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta were measured texts s3 s6 by competition kinetics using atrazine as the reference compound katz o3 6 0 m 1 s 1 acero et al 2000 a 200 ml solution of deionized water buffered at ph 7 7 with 5 mm borate buffer in a 250 ml borosilicate glass bottle was spiked with atrazine 0 19 μm or 0 93 μm 50 mm tert butanol as a oh scavenger and either imidacloprid 0 78 μm or 1 57 μm cu edta 10 μm or ni edta 10 μm as target compounds initial experiments determined that 50 mm tert butanol was sufficient to quench oh fig s1 the solutions were stirred continuously by a teflon coated magnetic stir bar the experiments were initiated by addition of 50 ml of the ozone stock solution to provide an initial o3 concentration of 10 mg l 210 μm because this o3 concentration is in excess relative to the contaminant concentration the reaction rate constant could be determined by following the contaminant loss under pseudo first order conditions samples 2 ml were withdrawn by pasteur pipette after 20 s and at 1 2 min intervals thereafter over the course of 12 min samples were added to a glass vial containing 0 2 ml of 50 mm sodium nitrite to quench the residual ozone and then were analyzed for residual atrazine or target compound the loss of o3 measured by the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 text s7 at various intervals indicated 50 loss of o3 over the 12 min of sampling the o3 reaction rate constants ktarget o3 for imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta were determined by competition kinetics against atrazine according to equation 1 where ctarget 0 and catz 0 are the initial concentrations of the target compound and atrazine respectively and ctarget and catz are the target compound and atrazine concentrations measured after specific times respectively the slope of plots of ln ctarget ctarget 0 versus ln catz catz 0 provided ktarget o3 experiments were conducted in duplicate for all compounds 1 ln c t a r g e t c t a r g e t 0 ln c a t z c a t z 0 k t a r g e t o 3 k a t z o 3 because fipronil reacted more quickly with o3 kfipronil o3 was determined according to equation 2 by measuring the loss of fipronil and the ozone exposure t 0 t o 3 d t as estimated by the trapezoidal rule huber et al 2003 ozone stock solution 5 ml was added to 250 ml of 5 mm borate buffered deionized water ph 7 7 spiked with 50 mm tert butanol and 0 92 μm fipronil to provide an initial o3 concentration of 1 mg l 21 μm in excess relative to fipronil samples 4 ml were collected every 10 s over 90 s samples were added to glass vials containing 0 12 ml of 1 mm indigo dye to immediately quench the residual ozone after removing a 1 ml aliquot for analysis of residual fipronil the remaining 3 ml was analyzed for residual o3 by the indigo method 2 ln c f i p r o n i l c f i p r o n i l 0 t 0 t o 3 d t k f i p r o n i l o 3 reaction rate constants for oh reactions with fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta were determined by competition kinetics using atrazine as the reference compound deionized water solutions 40 ml buffered at ph 7 8 with 5 mm borate were spiked with 0 93 μm atrazine and either 0 92 μm fipronil and 10 μm ni edta or 1 57 μm imidacloprid and 10 μm cu edta in 40 ml borosilicate vials fipronil and imidacloprid were spiked from 10 g l concentrated stock solutions in acetonitrile given the relatively low reaction rate constant for oh with acetonitrile 1 3 107 m 1 s 1 atkinson et al 1992 the oh scavenging by the 766 μm acetonitrile would have been limited regardless this scavenging does not affect the determination of reaction rate constants by competition kinetics the 40 ml solutions were purged with n2o for 30 min and then were decanted into 2 ml vials and capped with teflon lined septa under headspace free conditions the 2 ml vials were subjected to continuous γ radiolysis to generate oh from γ irradiation of water the n2o served to convert hydrated electrons and h atoms to oh text s8 buxton et al 1988 samples were periodically withdrawn in triplicate for analysis of residual atrazine and target compounds 2 4 ozonation of ro concentrate samples lee et al 2013 had found that degradation of compounds in municipal wastewater effluent could be predicted as a function of ozone dose on a mg o3 mg doc basis based upon the compounds reaction rate constants with o3 and oh they sorted compounds into the following 5 categories in order of decreasing reactivity ko3 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 group i ko3 between 10 m 1 s 1 and 105 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 group ii ko3 10 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 and koh 5 109 m 1 s 1 group iii koh between 109 m 1 s 1 and 5 109 m 1 s 1 group iv and koh 109 m 1 s 1 group v degradation of members within each group were similar as a function of ozone dose while compounds of group i would be readily degraded by direct o3 reactions members of group v were poorly reactive with both o3 and oh the goal of these experiments was to evaluate whether the same categorization scheme could be used to predict contaminant degradation in ro concentrate the degradation of target contaminants was evaluated over ozone doses ranging up through 1 18 mg o3 mg doc ro concentrate samples were spiked with a mixture of the four target compounds and the following five compounds representing each of the five reactivity categories defined by lee et al 2013 based on their ko3 and koh values table 2 sulfamethoxazole group i atenolol group ii deet group iii atrazine group iv and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate tcep group v ozonation was conducted in 25 ml glass vials capped with teflon lined caps under headspace free conditions the final concentrations of target compounds in the 25 ml solutions were the same for all experiments and ranged from 37 to 163 nm for organic compounds depending on their solubilities and were 4 μm for ni edta and cu edta thus the doc contributed by the spiked target compounds was always 1 of the doc concentrations table 1 an initial experiment evaluated the effect of the progressive increase in the concentration of the wastewater matrix on contaminant degradation the ro concentrate from facility 2 doc 36 mg l table 1 was diluted with deionized water to achieve 6 9 24 mg l doc concentrations ozone was applied from concentrated stock solutions to achieve a consistent 0 59 mg o3 mg doc dose across this concentration gradient because the maximum o3 stock concentration achievable by our system was 55 mg l some dilution of the ro concentrate was necessary to reach the 0 59 mg o3 mg doc dose thus 24 mg l was the maximum doc concentration compared to the 36 mg l doc concentration in the authentic ro concentrate for higher dilutions of this sample deionized water was added to make up the full 25 ml volume and maintain headspace free conditions samples were inverted several times and then held at room temperature for at least 3 h after which no o3 residual was measurable each ro concentrate was then subjected to a range of o3 doses 0 30 1 18 mg o3 mg doc in a similar fashion the doc concentrations in the authentic ro concentrates ranged from 22 5 to 86 7 mg l table 1 the dilution for each ro concentrate was set to enable a 1 18 mg o3 mg doc dose from the concentrated o3 stock solution such that each sample for a given ro concentrate was diluted to the same extent for the ro concentrate from facility 1 22 5 mg l doc samples were diluted to 14 4 mg l doc due to the high doc concentration in the ro concentrate from facility 5 86 7 mg l more significant dilution was necessary i e to 27 7 mg l doc all experiments were conducted in triplicate in addition to diluting the ro concentrate matrix addition of the cold ozone stock solution reduced the temperature of the ro concentrate by 6 c text s3 presents the results of a limited number of pilot scale experiments involving direct addition of o3 gas to ro concentrate at facility 2 and measurement of fipronil and imidacloprid degradation indicating that neither the dilution nor the temperature depression associated with the laboratory scale experiments affected the degree of contaminant degradation achieved as a function of ozone dose additional results from the pilot scale testing are provided in zhang et al 2020 2 5 precipitation of metals we evaluated whether ozone pretreatment could improve the removal of the native metals table 1 by precipitation potentially by liberating metals from chelates or transforming the ligands to weaker chelates for each ro concentrate 25 ml samples we compared the concentrations of total metals measured with or without ozone treatment and with or without the addition of reagents to promote precipitation ozone was dosed at 1 mg o3 mg doc in the same fashion described in section 2 4 a dose sufficient to result in significant degradation of metal chelates aliquots that were not ozonated were diluted with deionized water to the same extent as the ozonated samples to maintain consistent concentrations of metals and other matrix components text s9 samples were held for 2 h to ensure depletion of the ozone residual thereafter samples were split into 12 5 ml aliquots in 15 ml falcon tubes certain aliquots were adjusted to ph 11 with sodium hydroxide and supplemented with 300 mg l calcium oxide for the ro concentrate from facility 2 the effect of precipitation conditions was evaluated by varying the ph 9 5 11 and calcium oxide concentration 50 300 mg l and by evaluating the addition of 300 mg l of na2co3 after holding all aliquots for 8 h 6 ml of supernatant was acidified with concentrated nitric acid to achieve a 2 acid concentration prior to analysis of total residual metals 2 6 pathogen indicator inactivation the log removal of bacteriophage ms2 during ozonation of ro concentrates was used as an indicator for the removal of pathogenic viruses shin and sobsey 2003 bae and schwab 2008 ms2 attc 15597 b1 was propagated using e coli atcc 700891 as described previously eaton et al 2005 kohn and nelson 2007 the ms2 stock was then mixed into ro concentrate samples from each facility targeting a concentration of 106 107 plaque forming units pfus per ml samples were then treated with 0 1 18 mg o3 mg doc the same range employed in section 2 4 for evaluation of chemical contaminant degradation after holding for 3 h to ensure ozone depletion ms2 was enumerated in duplicate using a double agar layer technique according to a modification of standard method 9224 kohn and nelson 2007 each ozone experiment was repeated in at least duplicate text s10 provides additional details 2 7 bromate and disinfection byproduct dbp formation each ro concentrate 50 ml was treated with up to 1 mg o3 mg doc under headspace free conditions to evaluate bromate formation previous studies demonstrated that addition of either ammonia or chlorine and ammonia prior to ozonation could reduce bromate formation by sequestering bromide into bromamines and thereby preventing its oxidation to bromate pinkernell and von gunten 2001 buffle et al 2004 because chloramines frequently are added upstream of ro membranes to inhibit biofouling a chloramine residual occurs in ro concentrates different combinations of ammonia nh4cl and free chlorine hocl ocl were spiked prior to ozonation to evaluate their potential to mitigate bromate formation free chlorine stock solutions were concocted from 5 sodium hypochlorite solutions and were standardized by uv spectrometry at 292 nm ε 292 365 m 1s 1 furman and margerum 1998 text s11 provides additional details to evaluate the extent to which the addition of these halogenating agents promoted dbp formation additional samples 180 ml were treated in the same fashion in triplicate residual chlorine in each sample was quenched with 33 mg l l ascorbic acid 1 h after ozone treatment 1 h was used as an approximation of the residence time of treated water prior to discharge duplicate 40 ml aliquots were then taken from each sample and analyzed for 15 dbps including four trihalomethanes thms four haloacetonitriles four haloacetaldehydes two haloketones and chloropicrin these dbps were analyzed using modified epa method 551 1 as described previously zeng and mitch 2016 2 8 analytical methods total ni and cu were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms thermo scientific xseries 2 icp ms system with 0 1 μg l reporting limits ni edta was quantified by ion chromatography ic dionex integrion hpic system using an as11 hc anion exchange column 4 μm 4 250 mm and conductivity detection with an 100 μg l reporting limit cu edta was

additional details regarding the optimization of lc ms parameters fipronil and imidacloprid concentrations in the native ro concentrate samples were measured using solid phase extraction and lc ms ms text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality the ro concentrate samples had a wide range of doc concentrations 22 5 86 7 mg l table 1 alkalinities 385 848 mg l as caco3 and total dissolved solids tds concentrations 3442 5742 mg l by comparison the secondary municipal wastewater effluents in the lee et al 2013 study had 4 7 26 4 mg l doc and 65 330 mg l as caco3 alkalinity concurring with a 6 fold concentration factor between secondary effluents and ro concentrates the lower ph at facilities 4 and 5 may be associated with sulfuric acid addition prior to ro to control scaling the ro concentrates from facilities 4 and 5 received non nitrified effluents as indicated by the high ammonia concentrations the ro concentrates from facilities 1 3 exhibited lower ammonia concentrations and higher nitrate concentrations because they received nitrified effluents nitrite an important ozone scavenger von gunten 2003 was highest in the ro concentrate from facility 5 5 9 mg n l but also occurred at facilities 2 and 3 bromide the precursor for bromate ranged from 1 6 to 2 6 mg l calcium which can facilitate metal precipitation during alkaline treatment ranged from 233 to 499 mg l table s1 includes other general water quality parameters concentrations of total nickel total copper fipronil and imidacloprid exceeded their aquatic toxicity thresholds of 3 1 μg l 8 2 μg l 11 ng l and 10 ng l respectively in all five ro concentrates 3 2 degradation of organic contaminants spiked in ro concentrates lee et al 2013 had demonstrated that contaminants could be sorted into five groups based upon their reaction rate constants with o3 and oh with group i compounds exhibiting the highest rate constants with both oxidants the degradation of contaminants within each group was similar across secondary effluent samples as a function of o3 dose on a mg o3 mg doc basis to evaluate whether the pattern of contaminant degradation observed with secondary effluents also applies to ro concentrates we spiked representatives of each group table 2 into the ro concentrate samples and measured their degradation after treatment with various o3 doses because limits on the maximum concentration of o3 stock solutions necessitated some sample dilution we first evaluated whether the degradation changed with sample dilution when the ro concentrate from facility 2 was diluted to 6 9 24 mg l doc spiked with the five representative contaminants and then ozonated at 0 59 mg o3 mg doc the degradation of the five contaminants was similar across the dilution range fig s2 when the spiked ro concentrate sample from facility 2 was treated with 0 29 1 47 mg o3 mg doc degradation decreased with increasing group number fig 1 reflecting the lower reaction rate constants with the oxidants table 2 sulfamethoxazole group i was completely removed at 0 59 mg o3 mg doc while only 14 degradation of tcep group v was observed at 1 47 mg o3 mg doc the removal of each compound in this ro concentrate was within the range observed in ten secondary effluent samples by lee et al 2013 for the same range of o3 doses on a mg o3 mg doc basis fig s5 shows a comparison between facility 2 ro concentrate and the ten secondary effluent samples lee et al 2013 for sulfamethoxazole group i and deet group iii adding 50 mm tert butanol as a oh scavenger increased the removal of sulfamethoxazole and atenolol groups i ii fig s6 likely by increasing the o3 exposure by inhibiting the chain decomposition of ozone von gunten 2003 direct o3 reactions are particularly important for compounds in groups i ii lee et al 2013 however tert butanol completely inhibited the removal of deet atrazine and tcep groups iii v for which oh reactions dominate overall these results suggest that the pattern of contaminant degradation observed in secondary effluents applies to ro concentrates despite the higher concentrations of ozone and oh scavengers in ro concentrates some differences were observed between ro concentrate samples that correlated with nitrite concentrations table 1 during application of 0 3 mg o3 mg doc to samples from facilities 1 and 4 which lacked nitrite sulfamethoxazole group i was completely removed and the removal of atenolol group ii was 93 figs 2 and s7 for the same dose applied to samples from facilities 3 1 1 mg n l no2 and 5 5 9 mg n l no2 sulfamethoxazole removal was 81 and atenolol removal was 40 the sample from facility 2 0 4 mg n l no2 also exhibited limited removal of sulfamethoxazole 62 and atenolol 37 although its nitrite concentration was less than the nitrite in facilities 3 and 5 given that no2 effectively scavenges o3 k 3 7 105 m 1 s 1 at a 1 1 stoichiometry naumov et al 2010 no2 could have scavenged up to 13 29 and 78 of the applied o3 in the samples from facilities 2 3 and 5 respectively although direct o3 reactions are less important for the degradation of compounds in groups iii v scavenging of o3 by nitrite is still important because o3 is the ultimate source of oh at 0 3 mg o3 mg doc the samples from facilities 1 and 4 which lacked no2 featured higher removal of deet group iii 34 40 and atrazine group iv 17 18 than in samples from facilities 2 4 and 5 20 24 deet and 10 11 atrazine where no2 was detected at 1 18 mg o3 mg doc however removal of deet 70 84 and atrazine 58 74 was similar across all five samples these results suggest that after the scavenging capacity of no2 is exhausted at higher o3 doses the pattern of contaminant removal is similar across samples in addition to nitrite differing amounts of electron rich moieties in each facility s organic matter can also scavenge ozone to varying degrees 3 3 degradation of fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta to further validate the predictive capability of the contaminant grouping scheme for ro concentrates we evaluated fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta we determined their reaction rate constants with o3 and oh table 2 figs s8 10 these contaminants were then assigned to groups based upon the similarity of their rate constants to those of the group representatives fipronil exhibited the fastest rate constant with o3 comparable to that of atenolol group ii but was assigned to groups ii iii because its rate constant with oh was more similar to that of deet group iii imidacloprid was assigned to group iii and cu edta to group iv ni edta was assigned to groups iii iv since the ko3 was similar to that of deet while the koh was similar to that of atrazine the degradation patterns of each target contaminant concurred with the behavior of their assigned group representatives indicating that the classification scheme of lee et al 2013 works well in ro concentrate and the compounds of interest were grouped appropriately for example fig 3 compares the degradation of imidacloprid vs deet group iii and cu edta vs atrazine group iv for ozonation of ro concentrate from facility 2 additional comparisons are provided in fig s11 for example the degradation of fipronil and atenolol was similar across ro concentrates at low o3 doses degradation of both compounds was greater in concentrates from facilities 1 and 4 which did not contain measurable concentrations of nitrite fig s11 across all five ro concentrates 0 89 mg o3 mg doc degraded 80 97 of fipronil 44 74 of imidacloprid 38 77 of ni edta and 58 75 of cu edta the ko3 we determined for ni edta and cu edta were two orders of magnitude lower than the values determined previously by thalmann et al 2018 of 18 000 m 1 s 1 and 170 m 1 s 1 respectively while this previous study did not measure koh the ko3 values would place ni edta in group ii and cu edta in groups ii iii however the degradation of ni edta and cu edta observed in both studies aligned with the behavior of group iv compounds for example thalmann et al 2018 observed 40 50 removal of cu edta during ozonation of secondary effluent at 0 5 0 7 mg o3 mg doc while we observed 30 60 removal of cu edta during ozonation of ro concentrates at 0 59 mg o3 mg doc moreover addition of the oh scavenger tert butanol during ozonation of ro concentrate from facility 2 at 0 59 mg o3 mg doc inhibited degradation of ni edta and cu edta fig s12 indicating that oh dominated the degradation of these compounds in accordance with expectations for group iv compounds 3 4 alkaline precipitation of metals the native i e not spiked total nickel 18 72 μg l and copper 7 4 38 μg l concentrations in all five ro concentrate samples table 1 exceeded their aquatic benchmark concentrations 8 2 and 3 1 μg l respectively whether these occurred as metal edta complexes was unclear since these total metal concentrations were below the ni edta and cu edta detection limits i e 100 μg l and 50 μg l respectively first we sought to evaluate whether ozonation could transform native metal complexes to forms more amenable to removal by alkaline precipitation as a simple removal technique although ozonation partially degrades ni edta and cu edta fig s11 no difference in total nickel or copper concentrations was observed after ozonation without addition of precipitating agents fig 4 initial testing of different precipitation conditions using ro concentrate from facility 2 demonstrated that 300 mg l calcium oxide at ph 11 was optimal fig s13 when the ro concentrate samples were treated under these conditions without ozone pretreatment total copper concentrations decreased by 51 53 for facilities 2 5 figs 4 and s12 but 78 for facility 1 total nickel concentrations decreased by 18 31 across all 5 facilities thus a fraction of the total native nickel and copper in each ro concentrate was labile to alkaline precipitation with copper more labile than nickel particularly at facility 1 when these samples were ozonated and then subjected to alkaline conditions the total copper concentrations declined by 59 71 for facilities 2 5 and 92 for facility 1 total nickel concentrations declined by 60 67 across all 5 facilities since the native copper was already more labile to precipitation ozone pretreatment resulted in a greater enhancement in precipitative removal of nickel 3 fold than copper 25 because the native metal chelates were uncharacterized we evaluated the effect of ozonation and precipitation on free nickel and copper or ni edta and cu edta spiked into ro concentrates from facilities 1 3 and 5 at levels 2 4 times higher than the total concentrations of the native metals fig s14 free metals and their edta chelates served as end members for species that are labile or not labile to precipitation respectively for nickel the pattern observed was similar between the native metals and after spiking with ni edta suggesting that the native metals occurred in strongly bound chelates after spiking with ni edta there was little removal by precipitation alone 30 but ozone significantly enhanced nickel precipitation 40 at facilities 3 and 5 particularly for the sample from facility 1 70 the stability of ni edta concurs with previous research nowack et al 1996 addition of free nickel to the sample from facility 1 did not alter the levels of total nickel measured after precipitation with or without ozonation suggesting complete removal of the added free nickel for samples from facilities 3 and 5 spiked with free nickel the levels of total nickel measured after precipitation with and without ozone were higher than in the sample from facility 1 but still lower than when ni edta was added these results suggest that free nickel became partially bound with strong ligands in the samples from facilities 3 and 5 that were not present at facility 1 addition of both free copper and cu edta nearly doubled the total copper concentrations measured after precipitation with and without ozone fig s14 for native free or edta bound copper precipitation alone removed 50 of the total copper ozone further promoted copper removal particularly at facility 1 given that the nickel results suggest the occurrence of strong chelating agents in the samples from these three facilities it is likely that the native copper was bound to similar chelating agents but that the copper chelates were more labile to precipitation overall precipitation alone was capable of removing a significant fraction of copper but ozone pre treatment was needed to facilitate nickel removal however the precipitation conditions would generate significant quantities of sludge e g 10 tons day for a 4 million l day facility thus technologies other than precipitation e g ion exchange or electrodialysis should be pursued in conjunction with ozone pre treatment to remove metals partially liberated from chelates 3 5 ms2 inactivation by ozone due to its greater selectivity as an oxidant o3 is expected to be a more effective disinfectant than oh thus o3 may be more effective for controlling pathogens in ro concentrates than other aops that rely solely on oh provided there is sufficient contact with o3 before its rapid degradation and partial conversion into oh ms2 bacteriophage was used as a surrogate virus because it is non pathogenic and because california uses 5 log inactivation of ms2 bacteriophage as one metric to validate disinfection systems for non potable reuse applications cadph 2014 when 106 107pfu ml of ms2 bacteriophage was spiked into each ro concentrate as an indicator virus 5 log removal was observed at 0 30 mg o3 mg doc for the samples from facilities 1 and 4 fig 5 where nitrite was not measurable samples from facilities 2 3 and 5 which contained nitrite required higher o3 doses to achieve 5 log inactivation of ms2 however 5 log removal was achieved in all 5 concentrates at 1 18 mg o3 mg doc 3 6 bromate formation and mitigation ozone reactions with bromide form bromate von gunten and hoigne 1994 a potential human carcinogen with a 10 μg l maximum contaminant level mcl in drinking water federal register 1998 similar to other carcinogenic disinfection byproducts e g ndma human cancer risk may not be the most relevant endpoint while aquatic toxicity thresholds are not well established the lowest observed effects concentration for inhibition of cell division in marine phytoplankton is 13 6 mg l hutchinson et al 1997 untreated ro concentrate from facility 1 had a significant bromate concentration 108 μg l likely because the potable reuse treatment train employs ozone prior to ro across the five concentrate samples bromate formation ranged from 34 to 247 μg l at 0 45 mg o3 mg doc and 139 451 μg l at 0 9 mg o3 mg doc fig 6 these concentrations were higher than the 35 μg l bromate observed by benner et al 2008 when ozonating a ro concentrate with 1 2 mg l br which is lower than br concentrations in ro concentrates from this study table 1 bromate formation was highest at facility 1 which featured the lowest doc and no detectable nitrite table 1 bromate formation was lowest at facility 5 which featured the highest doc and nitrite concentrations as a potential bromate mitigation measure we evaluated the addition of chlorine hocl and ammonia nh3 to convert br to hobr and then bromamines locking bromine into a less reactive form prior to ozonation buffle et al 2004 the second reagent was added 5 min after the first reagent and ozone was added 5 min after the second reagent ozone was allowed to react fully without quenching when hocl and nh3 were each added at a 2 1 molar ratio relative to br for the sample from facility 2 bromate formation decreased by 23 regardless of whether the hocl or nh3 was added first fig 6 addition of nh3 and then hocl to samples from the other four facilities reduced bromate formation by 9 38 when the chloramines were added at a two fold molar excess relative to bromide and by 16 48 at a four fold molar excess addition of preformed monochloramine not shown did not inhibit bromate formation the benefits associated with mitigation of bromate formation must be weighed against the risks posed by the production of halogenated dbps resulting from chloramine addition certain states have promulgated limits on trihalomethanes in discharges to marine waters over concerns regarding their potential to bioaccumulate in fish the florida department of environmental protection 2018 limits annual mean concentrations to 34 μg l dibromochloromethane and 22 μg l bromodichloromethane in discharges to marine waters the california ocean plan provides threshold concentrations of 8 6 μg l dibromochloromethane and 6 2 μg l bromodichloromethane california state water resources control board 2016 the concentrations of 15 halogenated dbps were measured in the sample from facility 2 without and with bromate mitigation treatments fig 7 a total dbp concentration of 20 μg l was detected prior to mitigation treatments resulting from the addition of chloramines upstream of microfiltration to reduce membrane biofouling of the measured dbps the 4 trihalomethanes were the dominant dbp class 10 μg l including 7 5 μg l chloroform treating ro concentrate with ozone slightly increased the concentrations of each dbp class except for thms total halogenated dbp formation increased with chlorine dose forming chloramines in situ during bromate mitigation experiments from 28 μg l at 41 μm 2 9 mg l as cl2 chlorine to 36 μg l at 83 μm 5 9 mg l as cl2 chlorine total halogenated dbp formation was lower 28 μg l vs 32 μg l when ammonia was added before chlorine thereby reducing the exposure to free chlorine for all treatments dibromochloromethane and bromodichloromethane maximum concentrations of 1 0 μg l and 5 2 μg l respectively were below their threshold concentrations 4 conclusions to address concerns regarding the discharge to marine waters of chemical contaminants and pathogens in ro concentrates this study evaluated 1 the ability of ozone to degrade chemical contaminants and 2 inactivate ms2 as a virus indicator 3 whether metals liberated from chelates by ozone could be precipitated and 4 the formation of bromate and halogenated dbps previous research had demonstrated that the degradation of contaminants during ozonation of municipal wastewater effluents could be predicted by sorting contaminants into five reactivity groups based upon their reaction rate constants with ozone and oh after spiking representatives for each of the five groupings into five ro concentrates we demonstrated that this contaminant grouping scheme could also predict contaminant degradation in the more concentrated matrices of ro concentrates while nitrite reduced the observed degradation of contaminants relative to the predicted degradation at low ozone doses the pattern of observed degradation matched expectations at higher ozone doses after nitrite was degraded the predictive capability of the contaminant grouping scheme was further illustrated with fipronil imidacloprid ni edta and cu edta four contaminants of concern in ro concentrate after measuring their ozone and oh reaction rate constants fipronil group ii iii imidacloprid group iii ni edta group iii iv and cu edta group iv were sorted into contaminant groups the degradation of these contaminants spiked into ro concentrate samples followed expectations based upon their assigned groups addition of 300 mg l cao at ph 11 achieved partial removal of the native nickel and copper by precipitation ozone pretreatment facilitated precipitation of nickel while copper precipitation occurred without ozonation ozonation achieved 5 log inactivation of ms2 in all 5 concentrate samples at 1 18 mg o3 mg doc ozonation at 0 9 mg o3 mg doc formed 139 451 μg l bromate pretreatment of ro concentrates with chlorine and ammonia reduced bromate formation by a maximum of 48 but increased total halogenated dbp formation from 20 μg l associated with chloramine application upstream of microfiltration to 36 μg l regardless neither bromate not trihalomethane concentrations

17983,microplastic particles entering aquatic systems are rapidly colonized by microbial biofilms the presence of microbial biomass may cause sinking of particles and as a consequence prevent their transport to the oceans we studied microbial colonization of different polymer particles exposed in the epi meta and hypolimnion of a freshwater reservoir during late summer for 47 days parameters measured included biofilm formation metal sorption and sinking velocities microbial biofilms contained bacteria cyanobacteria and algae as well as inorganic particles such as iron oxides regardless of biofilm thickness and biovolumes of different biofilm constituents single polyethylene pe particles stayed buoyant whereas the sinking velocity of single polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet particles did not change significantly compared to initial values during exposition a mixing event occurred by which anoxic iron rich water from the hypolimnion was mixed with water from upper layers this induced aggregation and sinking of hypolimnetic pe particles together with organic matter cyanobacteria colonies and iron minerals graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics reservoirs biofouling aggregation microscopy sinking 1 introduction microplastics mp are one of the widely distributed man made pollutants found in nearly any place of the earth zones with reduced flow velocities such as point bars impoundments and reservoirs allow particles to settle down to the sediment watkins et al 2019 reducing the plastic load of streams castañeda et al 2014 as a consequence high concentrations of mp are found in sediments of natural lakes anderson et al 2017 and man made reservoirs zhang et al 2015 which may even act as permanent sink corcoran et al 2015 elucidating the factors governing particle settling in zones with reduced flow such as reservoirs is therefore crucial for a comprehensive understanding of mp transport in the environment microplastic particles are rapidly colonized by various microorganisms like bacteria cyanobacteria and microalgae when submerged in freshwater this leads to the development of a biofilm comprising microbial communities distinct from the surrounding water zettler et al 2013 environmental conditions such as ph temperature light oxygen availability or dissolved nutrients mainly determine which organisms may occur within a biofilm whereas the surface properties seem to be less influential than these external factors mccormick et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2016 however if incubated under the same environmental conditions differences between microbial community composition and biofilm density can be observed among different surfaces parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 the settling of particles is influenced by their shape size and density chubarenko et al 2016 kowalski et al 2016 particles denser than water and above 5 μm in diameter will eventually settle down by gravitational force within a few meters after being submerged in water particles less dense than water or below 5 μm in size may stay buoyant or even float at the surface if not altered by environmental processes besseling et al 2017 for further transport aggregation with natural materials and colonization by organisms play a crucial role by increasing the size and density of these particles in oceans the aggregation of buoyant mp with algae long et al 2015 and marine snow michels et al 2018 leads to rapid settling coverage of larger particles with calcareous macroorganisms which is often referred to as biofouling also sinks buoyant plastic polymers kaiser et al 2017 conditions in freshwater differ from the marine environment with regard to physical currents waves tides wind temperature chemical ph salinity oxygen availability nutrients metals and biological parameters additionally the residence time in freshwater reservoirs is by magnitudes lower than in the ocean leading to the assumption that extensive aging and biofouling by heavy calcareous organisms is unlikely to take place transfer of buoyant mp to reservoir sediments may therefore rely rather on mechanisms distinct from those observed in marine environments besseling et al 2017 during summer many reservoirs become stratified and partly anoxic leading to the reduction of iron oxides to ferrous iron lake mixing leads to the autoxidation of ferrous iron and formation of iron oxide colloids in the water column tipping et al 1981 these colloids are known to sink together with algae and cyanobacteria by forming sticky agglomerates with the cells oliver et al 1985 we hypothesize that this aggregation may also be relevant for mp during mixing stratified reservoirs which exhibit gradients of redox potential and oxygen availability may therefore provide an ideal setting to study the factors governing biofilm development and plastic sedimentation which are presently not well understood we characterized biofilm formation on pe pet and ps in the stratified mesotrophic malter reservoir during late summer other factors such as aggregation with freshwater algae and cyanobacteria or sorption of metals were considered as well the following hypotheses were tested i incubation depth and time influence biofilm composition ii biofilm covered mp sorb metal oxides iii aggregation or biofouling influence mp settling in stratified reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 location the mesotrophic malter reservoir 0 84 km2 335 m above sea level is located in eastern germany dippoldiswalde saxony its maximum depth is 16 20 m and the maximum storage capacity is 9 6 million m3 due to continuous discharge during summer the water level may drop by several meters in summer the water column is stratified with an anoxic hypolimnion separated from the oxic epilimnion by a thermocline at 8 m depth in 2018 fig s1 and table s1 autumnal mixing usually occurs during september restoring oxic conditions near the

exhibited a curved shape whereas pe and pet particles were even the cutting edges of the particles were rougher compared to the uncut foil the squares and foils were stored at 20 c in a dry dark place in order to incubate the particles in malter reservoir 500 particles of each polymer pe ps pet were transferred to individual closed stainless steel cages cylindrical shape diameter 10 cm length 25 cm mesh width 3 mm each containing just a single polymer type arias andres et al 2018 particles were distributed to the cages as follows 3 500 particles three individual cages containing pe pet or ps in the epilimnion 3 500 in the metalimnion and 9 500 in 3 3 cages with pe pet or ps in the hypolimnion fig s2 cages were incubated from august 30 to october 16 2018 with three samplings after 6 days 09

chosen according to prevailing oxygen concentrations multi parameter probe sea sun technologies germany and light intensities licor 1400 li cor biosciences germany on august 30 fig s1a cages were lifted to the surface for sampling and particles were gently transferred using tweezers or flushing with reservoir water to pre combusted 450 c 4 h glass petri dishes filled with water from the incubation depth the hypolimnion was anoxic during the initial stage of the experiment fig s1 to avoid repeated oxygen exposure of anaerobic organisms during lifting of the cages for sampling additional cages on separate ropes were deployed in the hypolimnion so that for each sampling previously un sampled cages were used some ps particles were flushed out of the cages leading to missing values of crystal violet staining in the epilimnion and metalimnion for day 47 all samples were stored in the dark at 4 c until processing in the laboratory samples for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm were preserved in 4 formalin solution and particles for iron manganese measurement were directly placed in glass vials with hydroxyl ammonium chloride hydrochloric acid 0 5 m 1 m particles used to determine the sinking velocity and for conducting crystal violet staining were transported in reservoir water 2 3 clsm imaging at every sampling date 10 randomly chosen particles per polymer were taken from each incubation depth and 5 random locations on each of them were examined via clsm samples were washed in tap water and mounted in a 5 cm petri dish for this purpose the plastic squares were glued with silicone adhesive to the bottom of the dish nucleic acid staining was done with sybrgreen dilution 1 1000 after staining for 5 min the petri dish was flooded with tap water for clsm a tcs sp5x with upright microscope and super continuum light source was available the system was controlled by las af version 2 4 1 samples were examined by using a long working distance 63x na 0 9 water immersible objective lens excitation was at 490 561 and 633 nm emission was recorded sequentially from 480 to 500 nm reflection 510 580 nm sybrgreen together with 650 720 nm autofluorescence of chlorophyll a and separately from 575 to 650 nm autofluorescence of phycobilins datasets were recorded without average and a step size of 1 μm for visualisation imaris bitplane version 9 3 was employed projected image data sets were printed from photoshop adobe calculations of cell biovolumes contained in the digital images were done with an adapted version of imagej staudt et al 2004 extracellular polymeric substances eps were visualized by the glycoconjugate binding lectin aal a568 vector laboratories burlingame usa 2 4 iron and manganese analysis iron and manganese were determined by extracting 15 pooled particles per sampling date depth and polymer type with 2 ml hydroxyl ammonium chloride hydrochloric acid solution 0 5 1 m for 24 h in an overhead shaker 120 rpm iron was subsequently measured by ferrozine assay stookey 1970 at 562 nm using a spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 uv vis briefly 50 μl of acidic centrifuged sample 10 min 15000 rpm was added to 950 μl ferrozine solution 50 mm hepes 1 mg ml 1 ferrozine ph 7 0 and incubated for 10 min prior to the measurement if optical density exceeded 1 0 the remaining sample was diluted with acidified ultra pure h2o prior to the addition of ferrozine manganese was measured using the formaldoxime method adapted from burlage et al 1998 goto et al 1962 and brewer and spencer 1971 the following solutions were prepared 1 tris buffer 5 m tris hcl ph 9 0 adjusted with h2so4 2 formaldoxime 20 g hydroxyl ammonium chloride in 450 ml ultrapure h2o addition of 10 ml 10 formaldehyde filled up to 500 ml 3 0 1 m edta in water and 4 10 hydroxyl ammonium chloride in water one ml of tris solution was added to an eppendorf tube followed by addition of 100 μl supernatant from the centrifuged sample then 100 μl of formaldoxime was added followed by 2 min of incubation at room temperature to remove dissolved ferrous iron 100 μl edta and 200 μl hydroxyl ammonium chloride solution were added separately subsequently the solution was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and measured at 450 nm agilent cary 60 uv vis 2 5 crystal violet staining crystal violet staining was conducted to quantify total biofilm mass arias andres et al 2018 as the dye stains both cells and the biofilm eps xu et al 2016 on each sampling date 8 particles from each depth and of every polymer type were stained during the procedure some particles were lost leading to lower sample numbers fig 2 briefly particles were dried 60 c 24 h stained with 250 μl crystal violet 0 3 in ultrapure water for 15 min washed 4 times with ultrapure water and de stained with 200 μl ethanol 97 the ethanol crystal violet solution was measured at 595 nm od595 using a multiplate reader thermo fisher multiscan rc samples showing optical densities higher than 1 00 were diluted with 97 ethanol 2 6 measurement of sinking velocities sinking velocities were determined within 12 h after sampling a sinking column 0 15 m 2 m filled with deionized water and placed in a climate chamber 20 c was used the water was filled 2 3 days in advance to avoid currents and temperature differences in the column the time needed to settle 50 cm through the column was measured using a stop watch kaiser et al 2017 particles were placed carefully beneath the water surface using tweezers and then allowed to settle for 30 cm in order to reach their terminal velocity before measurement was started particles settling close to the tube walls were excluded from data analyses multicellular organisms attached to sinking polymers were identified via binocular and a field guide streble and krauter 1988 to the family level 2 7 analysis of iron colloids iron colloids resulting from reservoir mixing were obtained by centrifuging two water samples retrieved on september 21 10 min 15000 rpm the resulting pellets were dried 60 c for 24 h and iron and manganese were analysed according to methods described in 2 4 the remaining solids were washed three times with acidified water ph 1 8 and centrifuged dried again 60 c 24 h to determine the acid soluble fraction afterwards the ash content was determined by combusting the sample at 450 c for 24 h one aggregate formed by pe and iron colloids was treated similarly and analysed for its iron and manganese content 2 8 data analysis the critical thickness and mass of an attached fouling film in order to overcome a pe squares buoyancy was calculated following chubarenko et al 2016 1 d f i l m h 2 ρ w ρ 0 ρ f ρ w 2 m f a 2 d ρ f with ρ 0 density of unfouled pe particle 920 kg m 3 ρ f density

a length of ldpe particle 4 10 3 m results were compared among sampling dates and depths using non parametric bootstrapping efron and tibshirani 1986 because assumptions of the anova were not satisfied for each comparison we reported the median difference of 10000 bootstrapped samples with 95 confidence intervals differences in medians containing values other than zero were regarded as significantly different from each other by 95 chance software r r core team 2018 was used for all statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 biovolumes analysed by clsm biovolumes of three phylogenetic groups bacteria cyanobacteria and algae were analysed for three different reservoir depths epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion and time intervals day 6 day 22 and day 47 cages from the epilimnion were covered with visible biofilms after 47 days whereas no visible biofilm formation was observed on cages from the metalimnion and hypolimnion the cellular components of the biofilms on day 6 consisted predominantly of bacteria fig 1 pet had fewer bacteria compared to ps pe in the metalimnion and to pe in the epilimnion while ps had significantly more bacteria than pe and pet in the hypolimnion cyanobacteria and algae were scarce throughout nonetheless small but statically significant differences among the polymers were found fig 1b and c on day 22 fig 1 biofilms were again dominated by bacteria pe showed the highest bacterial biovolume of all polymers in each incubation depth fig 1a ps had higher values than pet in the epilimnion and metalimnion but lower bacterial biovolumes in the hypolimnion compared to pet cyanobacteria biovolumes were again negligible some algae were found on ps exceeding pe and especially pet in the epi and metalimnion in the hypolimnion pe had remarkably higher algae biovolumes than pet and ps biovolumes on day 47 were distinct from the previous sampling dates and characterized by higher shares of phototrophic organisms in the epilimnion bacterial biovolume showed less pronounced differences between the surfaces than before cyanobacteria in the epilimnion made up a significant proportion of the phototrophic biovolume comparing the surfaces pet and ps showed the highest volumes while pe only reached around 5 of the cyanobacteria biovolume found on pet or ps in the metalimnion cyanobacteria were scarce throughout in the hypolimnion cyanobacteria biovolume was low but significantly different between surfaces fig 1c substantial algae biovolumes were found on all polymers in the epilimnion with pet ps significantly exceeding pe few algae occurred in the metalimnion and hypolimnion although some significant differences were found fig 1b the biovolumes of bacteria cyanobacteria and algae increased over time on all polymers in each of the incubation depths remarkably algal biovolumes increased by at least one order of magnitude between day 22 and day 47 in the epilimnion no general differences regarding the final bacterial biovolumes were found at day 47 however pe tended to have lower biovolumes of phototrophic organisms than the other surfaces 3 2 biofilms analysed by crystal violet staining on day 6 the biofilm was not well established with od595 values being low for all polymers fig 2 but still significantly higher than the pristine particles used as blanks differences between the polymers were scarce with only pet exhibiting lower od595 values than pe in all samples on day 22 and day 47 biofilm mass on ps on day 22 was equal to that on pe in the epilimnion and metalimnion but lower than on pe in the hypolimnion ps values were equal to pet values on day 22 except for the epilimnion od595 was highest at day 47 for all sampled polymers which indicates an increase of stainable molecules over the incubation time the od595 values showed a positive linear correlation with their respective total biovolumes sum of algae bacteria and cyanobacteria derived from clsm imaging the increase of od595 per biovolume was higher for pe than for pet as expressed by a steeper regression line therefore higher od595 values would result from similar or lower biovolume on pe compared to pet fig s3 table s3 3 3 metal concentrations on mp iron and manganese detection limit 0 3 μg mg 1 were found on all tested biofilm covered mp on day 6 and 22 no manganese was detected but after 47 days manganese was found on every polymer in most incubation depths pe showed the highest manganese sorption exceeding 0 63 μg mg 1 in the epilimnion in contrast iron was detected from day 6 on at all polymers on day 22 substantial iron sorption was observed in the hypolimnion fig 3 the highest iron concentration occurred on pe on day 47 in the epilimnion 1 64 μg mg 1 at least for pe metal concentrations increased substantially over the incubation time sorption of iron exceeded that of manganese on all polymers as the data display an integrated mean of 15 particles per measurement no statistical analysis was conducted 3 4 sinking velocity of particles during the experiment no sinking of single pe particles regardless of incubation depth or time occurred and so no sinking velocities were recorded the terminal sinking velocities of pet squares were roughly three times higher than those of ps with values of 0 028 m s 1 compared to 0 0075 m s 1 respectively fig 4 no substantial differences between incubated particles and the control pristine particles of pet and ps were observed table s4 small differences between some incubation depths or sampling dates were occurring table s4 on day 47 larger organisms such as hydras and cladocerans were attached to the surface of 9 of the ps particles and 10 of the pet particles used in the sinking experiment these organisms influenced the sinking speed of ps slightly by accelerating the sinking speed by 4 median of particles with attached multicellular organisms 0 008 m s n 4 and decreased the sinking speed of pet by 1 median 0 0276 n 6 compared to particles with no attached larger organisms on day 6 and day 22 no such organisms were observed on the particles 3 5 mixing event and aggregation of mp with iron colloids oxygen intruded into the anoxic hypolimnion of the stratified malter reservoir between september 5 day 6 and september 21 day 22 fig s1b and c substantial amounts of brownish red iron flocs fig 5 a floated freely in the whole water column on september 21 these reservoir borne iron colloids consisted of approximately 12 per weight iron 40 per weight organics and 38 per weight ash content referring to the dry mass the acid soluble fraction was 26 per weight which corresponds well to the mass of 27 fe2o3 x 0 5 h2o stoichiometrically calculated from the measured iron content the colloids were not observed at day 47 october 16 aggregation of four pe particles with iron colloids was observed in the hypolimnion fig 5a and b the formed aggregate was stable enough for being transferred by tweezers without breaking apart its density was higher than water subsequently it sank down to the bottom of a water filled storage container non agglomerated pe particles retrieved from the hypolimnion on that day remained buoyant the biofilm on the aggregate showed higher biovolumes of bacteria algae and cyanobacteria compared to any other surface fig 5c the agglomerate was of brownish color indicating the presence of iron which made up approximately 3 fe 11 μg mg 1 of the total dry mass small amounts of manganese reaching 1 0 07 μg mg 1 of the total dry mass were measured as well 4 discussion in this study we measured biofilm formation and sorption of metals to different polymers in mp size in order to investigate the effects on their sinking behavior employing clsm crystal violet staining and spectrophotometric methods we found microbial biofilm formation to be not sufficient for promoting the sinking of single mp particles in malter reservoir during late summer sinking through aggregation with iron colloids and biomass cells eps was observed after reservoir mixing in a single case contrary to our findings biofouling with cyanobacteria was found to sink polypropylene particles in a eutrophic tropical lake chen et al 2019 the authors hypothesized that the binding of inorganic material contributed more significantly to the mass of the fouling film than the phototrophic cells chen et al 2019 differences to our results can be explained by distinct environmental conditions in malter reservoir such as lower concentrations of chlorophyll a 41 μg l vs 120 μg l 1 phosphate 0 03 vs 0 214 mg l 1 ammonia 0 07 vs 0 41 mg l 1 and suspended solids 4 vs 35 mg l 1 regarding the different conditions biofouling will be more intense in warm nutrient rich shallow lakes compared to temperate nutrient poor deep reservoirs the absence of calcareous macrofoulers which is considered as a major factor promoting sinking of mp in marine environments kaiser et al 2017 may also explain low impact of biofouling on the particle densities in this study however it cannot be excluded that more extensive biofouling occurs during different seasons and may facilitate mp sinking in malter reservoir biofilm formation may strongly influence aggregation dynamics and subsequently the sinking of mp by increasing the stickiness surface charge or altering the morphology e g lobes filaments of the particles aggregation with inorganic and organic particles is considered as another important process that determines the environmental fate of mp besseling et al 2017 sticky organic material such as marine snow porter et al 2018 biogenic particles michels et al 2018 eps summers et al 2018 organo mineral particulate matter möhlenkamp et al 2018 and marine long et al 2015 or freshwater microalgae lagarde et al 2016 can sink buoyant mp through formation of large hetero aggregates most studies used laboratory set ups employing conditions favoring aggregation such as low shear stress and high particle concentrations 101 104 particles ml 1 möhlenkamp et al 2018 which may not reflect natural conditions currents grazing microbial degradation and ingestion by larger organisms could lead to rapid break up or consumption of such aggregates in nature cole et al 2016 in this study aggregation of pe with organo mineral matter was observed the formation right after mixing indicates that iron oxide containing colloids induced the aggregation of pe with organic matter and cells of cyanobacteria algae and bacteria iron colloid formation is an important process capable to aggregate and sink buoyant cyanobacteria in natural lakes after mixing oliver et al 1985 given that only 4 large microplastic particles aggregated with such colloids this study cannot provide sufficient data on the importance and implications of this mechanisms for the fate of mp in reservoirs furthermore it should be considered that reservoir mixing is no prerequisite for the aggregation and subsequent settling of mp in the environment considering the oxic conditions of the hypolimnion prevailing at least since day 22 the majority of iron and manganese should have been present as metal oxides oxide minerals such as ferrihydrite fe5ho8 x 4 h2o magnetite fe3o4 or manganese iv oxide mno2 exhibit a high specific density and may influence the density of mp particles the density change of pe particles 4 4 0 15 mm covered by a fouling film was calculated by using the specific density of these minerals as input variable chubarenko et al 2016 afterwards the mass of fouling films comprising ferrihydrite magnetite manganese oxide or bacteria needed to sink the pe particle ρpe ρwater were determined following equation 2 accordingly the mass concentrations needed to sink pe are 54 μg mg 1 magnetite 58 μg mg 1 ferrihydrite 55 μg mg 1 manganese oxide and 131 156 or 218 μg mg 1 bacteria with different ρbacteria table s2 the maximum iron concentration found on buoyant pe 1 64 μg mg 1 corresponded to 2 2 μg mg 1 ferrihydrite or 2 1 μg mg 1 magnetite whereas the maximum manganese concentration 0 64 μg mg 1 corresponded to 0 94 μg mg 1 manganese oxide therefore the mass concentration of metals bound to freely floating pe particles was at least one order of magnitude too low to overcome their buoyancy the sinking aggregated pe particles showed iron concentrations of 11 μg mg 1 corresponding to 16 4 μg mg 1 ferrihydrite or 15 2 μg mg 1 magnetite biovolume in μm3 μm 2 of bacteria cyanobacteria and algae can be converted to cells mass per particle by multiplying with the particle surface area 1 6 107 μm2 and the specific density of microbial biomass table s2 buoyant pe particles contained approximately 8 μg mg 1 total biomass for ρbiomass 1500 kg m 3 while the microbial biomass on the sunken pe agglomerate made up 149 138 or 124 μg mg 1 depending on the specific density of microbial biomass applied the biomass calculated for the sunken agglomerated pe was in good agreement with the 131 μg mg 1 for ρbiomass 1500 kg m 3 chubarenko et al 2018 theoretically needed to sink buoyant pe particles assuming lower ρbacteria the results deviated slightly 156 μg mg 1 for ρbiomass 1388 kg m 3 besseling et al 2017 or moderately 218 μg mg 1 for ρbiomass 1250 kg m 3 kooi et al 2017 from the biomass theoretically required for sinking however it should be considered that most of the aggregate organic mass was not quantified via clsm as eps was not assessed with the used technique nonetheless ballasting effects of microorganisms considerably exceeded the effect of metal oxides comprising a likely reason for the observed loss in buoyancy this leads to the assumption that the aggregation of freshwater microorganisms can sink mp if sufficient biomass is provided however under low bio productivity or low temperature conditions the critical mass to sink the mp may not be reached within reasonable timescales the extent of eps production within the biofilms seemed to differ between the polymers as shown via crystal violet assay algae and cyanobacteria cells were present in lower densities on pe compared to pet and ps as seen from clsm imaging this may indicate that these organisms had to put more effort into attachment to pe surfaces than to pet ps low attachment efficiency leads to environmental stress vosshage et al 2018 and ultimately to more eps production by the stressed cells scott et al 2014 therefore the fewer but stressed cells on pe could have produced more eps than the cells on pet regarding the occurrence of metals on biofilm covered mp pe showed higher concentrations of iron and manganese compared to the other polymers concentrations of fe and mn exceeded up to 100 times fe or 10 times mn the concentrations found on beached plastic pellets at british shores ashton et al 2010 holmes et al 2012 and plastics exposed to seawater for several months rochman et al 2014 lower ionic strength and the higher abundance of fe mn in freshwater water may explain the higher mp metal concentrations found in this study according to previous studies long term metal sorption to plastics does not differ between polymer types rochman et al 2014 the metal sorption is rather controlled by the biofilm thickness and the available binding places therein rochman et al 2014 van hullebusch et al 2003 in our study pe showed the highest crystal violet stainable biomass of all polymers pe may therefore have provided more binding places for metals within the eps matrix leading to the highest measured iron and manganese concentrations the polymers were enclosed in steel cages during the experiment for ps and pet this produces artificial conditions as particles of the used size will settle down to the sediment within 10 pet to 30 min ps assuming a mean water depth of 16 m and no other currents or mixing however polymers with mechanically changed properties such as pet bottles with trapped air inside or expanded ps may stay afloat for a longer time span than the particles used in this experiment this makes the description of biofilm formation on ps and pet in the upper reservoir parts environmentally relevant even though the particles are not buoyant conditions for biofilm formation may differ between the interior of the cages and the open reservoir water as larger grazing organisms were excluded by the mesh size furthermore the cages had a shading effect reducing the light intensity by 33 due to biofilm formation on the cages this shading effect could have been even stronger than the 33 measured for blank cages reservoirs and especially their hypolimnia experience very low currents for this reason biofilms are only loosely bound to their carriers making biofilm loss due to shear stress likely this may partly explain the high variability of biovolumes on particles of the same material and exposure time formation of hetero aggregates between pe and organo mineral matter was only observed in the hypolimnion therefore the possible sinking of pe floating at the water surface could not be proven directly only one aggregate with four pe particles has been observed hence coincidence cannot be excluded the experiment was conducted from late summer to autumn which includes lowering of temperatures and light intensities during this time as the extent of biofouling depends on season chen et al 2019 it cannot be excluded that biofouling induced sinking may occur during other times of the year 5 conclusions late summer biofilm development within a temperate mesotrophic reservoir was not sufficient to facilitate sinking of buoyant mp or increasing the settling velocity of dense mp biofilms grown on pet and ps microplastics in the mesotrophic reservoir contained more phototrophic microorganisms than those on pe

17983,microplastic particles entering aquatic systems are rapidly colonized by microbial biofilms the presence of microbial biomass may cause sinking of particles and as a consequence prevent their transport to the oceans we studied microbial colonization of different polymer particles exposed in the epi meta and hypolimnion of a freshwater reservoir during late summer for 47 days parameters measured included biofilm formation metal sorption and sinking velocities microbial biofilms contained bacteria cyanobacteria and algae as well as inorganic particles such as iron oxides regardless of biofilm thickness and biovolumes of different biofilm constituents single polyethylene pe particles stayed buoyant whereas the sinking velocity of single polystyrene ps and polyethylene terephthalate pet particles did not change significantly compared to initial values during exposition a mixing event occurred by which anoxic iron rich water from the hypolimnion was mixed with water from upper layers this induced aggregation and sinking of hypolimnetic pe particles together with organic matter cyanobacteria colonies and iron minerals graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastics reservoirs biofouling aggregation microscopy sinking 1 introduction microplastics mp are one of the widely distributed man made pollutants found in nearly any place of the earth zones with reduced flow velocities such as point bars impoundments and reservoirs allow particles to settle down to the sediment watkins et al 2019 reducing the plastic load of streams castañeda et al 2014 as a consequence high concentrations of mp are found in sediments of natural lakes anderson et al 2017 and man made reservoirs zhang et al 2015 which may even act as permanent sink corcoran et al 2015 elucidating the factors governing particle settling in zones with reduced flow such as reservoirs is therefore crucial for a comprehensive understanding of mp transport in the environment microplastic particles are rapidly colonized by various microorganisms like bacteria cyanobacteria and microalgae when submerged in freshwater this leads to the development of a biofilm comprising microbial communities distinct from the surrounding water zettler et al 2013 environmental conditions such as ph temperature light oxygen availability or dissolved nutrients mainly determine which organisms may occur within a biofilm whereas the surface properties seem to be less influential than these external factors mccormick et al 2014 oberbeckmann et al 2016 however if incubated under the same environmental conditions differences between microbial community composition and biofilm density can be observed among different surfaces parrish and fahrenfeld 2019 the settling of particles is influenced by their shape size and density chubarenko et al 2016 kowalski et al 2016 particles denser than water and above 5 μm in diameter will eventually settle down by gravitational force within a few meters after being submerged in water particles less dense than water or below 5 μm in size may stay buoyant or even float at the surface if not altered by environmental processes besseling et al 2017 for further transport aggregation with natural materials and colonization by organisms play a crucial role by increasing the size and density of these particles in oceans the aggregation of buoyant mp with algae long et al 2015 and marine snow michels et al 2018 leads to rapid settling coverage of larger particles with calcareous macroorganisms which is often referred to as biofouling also sinks buoyant plastic polymers kaiser et al 2017 conditions in freshwater differ from the marine environment with regard to physical currents waves tides wind temperature chemical ph salinity oxygen availability nutrients metals and biological parameters additionally the residence time in freshwater reservoirs is by magnitudes lower than in the ocean leading to the assumption that extensive aging and biofouling by heavy calcareous organisms is unlikely to take place transfer of buoyant mp to reservoir sediments may therefore rely rather on mechanisms distinct from those observed in marine environments besseling et al 2017 during summer many reservoirs become stratified and partly anoxic leading to the reduction of iron oxides to ferrous iron lake mixing leads to the autoxidation of ferrous iron and formation of iron oxide colloids in the water column tipping et al 1981 these colloids are known to sink together with algae and cyanobacteria by forming sticky agglomerates with the cells oliver et al 1985 we hypothesize that this aggregation may also be relevant for mp during mixing stratified reservoirs which exhibit gradients of redox potential and oxygen availability may therefore provide an ideal setting to study the factors governing biofilm development and plastic sedimentation which are presently not well understood we characterized biofilm formation on pe pet and ps in the stratified mesotrophic malter reservoir during late summer other factors such as aggregation with freshwater algae and cyanobacteria or sorption of metals were considered as well the following hypotheses were tested i incubation depth and time influence biofilm composition ii biofilm covered mp sorb metal oxides iii aggregation or biofouling influence mp settling in stratified reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 location the mesotrophic malter reservoir 0 84 km2 335 m above sea level is located in eastern germany dippoldiswalde saxony its maximum depth is 16 20 m and the maximum storage capacity is 9 6 million m3 due to continuous discharge during summer the water level may drop by several meters in summer the water column is stratified with an anoxic hypolimnion separated from the oxic epilimnion by a thermocline at 8 m depth in 2018 fig s1 and table s1 autumnal mixing usually occurs during september restoring oxic conditions near the

exhibited a curved shape whereas pe and pet particles were even the cutting edges of the particles were rougher compared to the uncut foil the squares and foils were stored at 20 c in a dry dark place in order to incubate the particles in malter reservoir 500 particles of each polymer pe ps pet were transferred to individual closed stainless steel cages cylindrical shape diameter 10 cm length 25 cm mesh width 3 mm each containing just a single polymer type arias andres et al 2018 particles were distributed to the cages as follows 3 500 particles three individual cages containing pe pet or ps in the epilimnion 3 500 in the metalimnion and 9 500 in 3 3 cages with pe pet or ps in the hypolimnion fig s2 cages were incubated from august 30 to october 16 2018 with three samplings after 6 days 09

chosen according to prevailing oxygen concentrations multi parameter probe sea sun technologies germany and light intensities licor 1400 li cor biosciences germany on august 30 fig s1a cages were lifted to the surface for sampling and particles were gently transferred using tweezers or flushing with reservoir water to pre combusted 450 c 4 h glass petri dishes filled with water from the incubation depth the hypolimnion was anoxic during the initial stage of the experiment fig s1 to avoid repeated oxygen exposure of anaerobic organisms during lifting of the cages for sampling additional cages on separate ropes were deployed in the hypolimnion so that for each sampling previously un sampled cages were used some ps particles were flushed out of the cages leading to missing values of crystal violet staining in the epilimnion and metalimnion for day 47 all samples were stored in the dark at 4 c until processing in the laboratory samples for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm were preserved in 4 formalin solution and particles for iron manganese measurement were directly placed in glass vials with hydroxyl ammonium chloride hydrochloric acid 0 5 m 1 m particles used to determine the sinking velocity and for conducting crystal violet staining were transported in reservoir water 2 3 clsm imaging at every sampling date 10 randomly chosen particles per polymer were taken from each incubation depth and 5 random locations on each of them were examined via clsm samples were washed in tap water and mounted in a 5 cm petri dish for this purpose the plastic squares were glued with silicone adhesive to the bottom of the dish nucleic acid staining was done with sybrgreen dilution 1 1000 after staining for 5 min the petri dish was flooded with tap water for clsm a tcs sp5x with upright microscope and super continuum light source was available the system was controlled by las af version 2 4 1 samples were examined by using a long working

autofluorescence of chlorophyll a and separately from 575 to 650 nm autofluorescence of phycobilins datasets were recorded without average and a step size of 1 μm for visualisation imaris bitplane version 9 3 was employed projected image data sets were printed from photoshop adobe calculations of cell biovolumes contained in the digital images were done with an adapted version of imagej staudt et al 2004 extracellular polymeric substances eps were visualized by the glycoconjugate binding lectin aal a568 vector laboratories burlingame usa 2 4 iron and manganese analysis iron and manganese were determined by extracting 15 pooled particles per sampling date depth and polymer type with 2 ml hydroxyl ammonium chloride hydrochloric acid solution 0 5 1 m for 24 h in an overhead shaker 120 rpm iron was subsequently measured by ferrozine assay stookey 1970 at 562 nm using a spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 uv vis briefly 50 μl of acidic centrifuged sample 10 min 15000 rpm was added to 950 μl ferrozine solution 50 mm hepes 1 mg ml 1 ferrozine ph 7 0 and incubated for 10 min prior to the measurement if optical density exceeded 1 0 the remaining sample was diluted with acidified ultra pure h2o prior to the addition of ferrozine manganese was measured using the formaldoxime method adapted from burlage et al 1998 goto et al 1962 and brewer and spencer 1971 the following solutions

edta in water and 4 10 hydroxyl ammonium chloride in water one ml of tris solution was added to an eppendorf tube followed by addition of 100 μl supernatant from the centrifuged sample then 100 μl of formaldoxime was added followed by 2 min of incubation at room temperature to remove dissolved ferrous iron 100 μl edta and 200 μl hydroxyl ammonium chloride solution were added separately subsequently the solution was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and measured at 450 nm agilent cary 60 uv vis 2 5 crystal violet staining crystal violet staining was conducted to quantify total biofilm mass arias andres et al 2018 as the dye stains both cells and the biofilm eps xu et al 2016 on each sampling date 8 particles from each depth and of every polymer type were stained during the procedure some particles were lost leading to lower sample numbers fig 2 briefly particles were dried 60 c 24 h stained with 250 μl crystal violet 0 3 in ultrapure water for 15 min washed 4 times with ultrapure water and de stained with 200 μl ethanol 97 the ethanol crystal violet solution was measured at 595 nm od595 using a multiplate reader thermo fisher multiscan rc samples showing optical densities higher than 1 00 were diluted with 97 ethanol 2 6 measurement of sinking velocities sinking velocities were determined within 12 h after sampling a sinking column 0 15 m 2 m filled with deionized water and placed in a climate chamber 20 c was used the water was filled 2 3 days in advance to avoid currents and temperature differences in the column the time needed to settle 50 cm through the column was measured using a stop watch kaiser et al 2017 particles were placed carefully beneath the water surface using tweezers and then allowed to settle for 30 cm in order to reach their terminal velocity before measurement was started particles settling close to the tube walls were excluded from data analyses multicellular organisms attached to sinking polymers were identified via binocular and a field guide streble and krauter 1988 to the family level 2 7 analysis of iron colloids iron colloids resulting from reservoir mixing were obtained by centrifuging two water samples retrieved on september 21 10 min 15000 rpm the resulting pellets were dried 60 c for 24 h and iron and manganese were analysed according to methods described in 2 4 the remaining solids were washed three times with acidified water ph 1 8 and centrifuged dried again 60 c 24 h to determine the acid soluble fraction afterwards the ash content was determined by combusting the sample at 450 c for 24 h one aggregate formed by pe and iron colloids was treated similarly and analysed for its iron and manganese content 2 8 data analysis the critical thickness and mass of an attached fouling film in order to overcome a pe squares buoyancy was calculated following chubarenko et al 2016 1 d f i l m h 2 ρ w ρ 0 ρ f ρ w 2 m f a 2 d ρ f with ρ 0 density of unfouled pe particle 920 kg m 3 ρ f density

a length of ldpe particle 4 10 3 m results were compared among sampling dates and depths using non parametric bootstrapping efron and tibshirani 1986 because assumptions of the anova were not satisfied for each comparison we reported the median difference of 10000 bootstrapped samples with 95 confidence intervals differences in medians containing values other than zero were regarded as significantly different from each other by 95 chance software r r core team 2018 was used for all statistical analysis 3 results 3 1 biovolumes analysed by clsm biovolumes of three phylogenetic groups bacteria cyanobacteria and algae were analysed for three different reservoir depths epilimnion metalimnion and hypolimnion and time intervals day 6 day 22 and day 47 cages from the epilimnion were covered with visible biofilms after 47 days whereas no visible biofilm formation was observed on cages from the metalimnion and hypolimnion the cellular components of the biofilms on day 6 consisted predominantly of bacteria fig 1 pet had fewer bacteria compared to ps pe in the metalimnion and to pe in the epilimnion while ps had significantly more bacteria than pe and pet in the hypolimnion cyanobacteria and algae were scarce throughout nonetheless small but statically significant differences among the polymers were found fig 1b and c on day 22 fig 1 biofilms were again dominated by bacteria pe showed the highest bacterial biovolume of all polymers in each incubation depth fig 1a ps had higher values than pet in the epilimnion and metalimnion but lower bacterial biovolumes in the hypolimnion compared to pet cyanobacteria biovolumes were again negligible some algae were found on ps exceeding pe and especially pet in the epi and metalimnion in the hypolimnion pe had remarkably higher algae biovolumes than pet and ps biovolumes on day 47 were distinct from the previous sampling dates and characterized by higher shares of phototrophic organisms in the epilimnion bacterial biovolume showed less pronounced differences between the surfaces than before cyanobacteria in the epilimnion made up a significant proportion of the phototrophic biovolume comparing the surfaces pet and ps showed the highest volumes while pe only reached around 5 of the cyanobacteria biovolume found on pet or ps in the metalimnion cyanobacteria were scarce throughout in the hypolimnion cyanobacteria biovolume was low but significantly different between surfaces fig 1c substantial algae biovolumes were found on all polymers in the epilimnion with pet ps significantly exceeding pe few algae occurred in the metalimnion and hypolimnion although some significant differences were found fig 1b the biovolumes of bacteria cyanobacteria and algae increased over time on all polymers in each of the incubation depths remarkably algal biovolumes increased by at least one order of magnitude between day 22 and day 47 in the epilimnion no general differences regarding the final bacterial biovolumes were found at day 47 however pe tended to have lower biovolumes of phototrophic organisms than the other surfaces 3 2 biofilms analysed by crystal violet staining on day 6 the biofilm was not well established with od595 values being low for all polymers fig 2 but still significantly higher than the pristine particles used as blanks differences between the polymers were scarce with only pet exhibiting lower od595 values than pe in all samples on day 22 and day 47 biofilm mass on ps on day 22 was equal to that on pe in the epilimnion and metalimnion but lower than on pe in the hypolimnion ps values were equal to pet values on day 22 except for the epilimnion od595 was highest at day 47 for all sampled polymers which indicates an increase of stainable molecules over the incubation time the od595 values showed a positive linear correlation with their respective total biovolumes sum of algae bacteria and cyanobacteria derived from clsm imaging the increase of od595 per biovolume was higher for pe than for pet as expressed by a steeper regression line therefore higher od595 values would result from similar or lower biovolume on pe compared to pet fig s3 table s3 3 3 metal concentrations on mp iron and manganese detection limit 0 3 μg mg 1 were found on all tested biofilm covered mp on day 6 and 22 no manganese was detected but after 47 days manganese was found on every polymer in most incubation depths pe showed the highest manganese sorption exceeding 0 63 μg mg 1 in the epilimnion in contrast iron was detected from day 6 on at all polymers on day 22 substantial iron sorption was observed in the hypolimnion fig 3 the highest iron concentration occurred on pe on day 47 in the epilimnion 1 64 μg mg 1 at least for pe metal concentrations increased substantially over the incubation time sorption of iron exceeded that of manganese on all polymers as the data display an integrated mean of 15 particles per measurement no statistical analysis was conducted 3 4 sinking velocity of particles during the experiment no sinking of single pe particles regardless of incubation depth or time occurred and so no sinking velocities were recorded the terminal sinking velocities of pet squares were roughly three times higher than those of ps with values of 0 028 m s 1 compared to 0 0075 m s 1 respectively fig 4 no substantial differences between incubated particles and the control pristine particles of pet and ps were observed table s4 small differences between some incubation depths or sampling dates were occurring table s4 on day 47 larger organisms such as hydras and cladocerans were attached to the surface of 9 of the ps particles and 10 of the pet particles used in the sinking experiment these organisms influenced the sinking speed of ps slightly by accelerating the sinking speed by 4 median of particles with attached multicellular organisms 0 008 m s n 4 and decreased the sinking speed of pet by 1 median 0 0276 n 6 compared to particles with no attached larger organisms on day 6 and day 22 no such organisms were observed on the particles 3 5 mixing event and aggregation of mp with iron colloids oxygen intruded into the anoxic hypolimnion of the stratified malter reservoir between september 5 day 6 and september 21 day 22 fig s1b and c substantial amounts of brownish red iron flocs fig 5 a floated freely in the whole water column on september 21 these reservoir borne iron colloids consisted of approximately 12 per weight iron 40 per weight organics and 38 per weight ash content referring to the dry mass the acid soluble fraction was 26 per weight which corresponds well to the mass of 27 fe2o3 x 0 5 h2o stoichiometrically calculated from the measured iron content the colloids were not observed at day 47 october 16 aggregation of four pe particles with iron colloids was observed in the hypolimnion fig 5a and b the formed aggregate was stable enough for being transferred by tweezers without breaking apart its density was higher than water subsequently it sank down to the bottom of a water filled storage container non agglomerated pe particles retrieved from the hypolimnion on that day remained buoyant the biofilm on the aggregate showed higher biovolumes of bacteria algae and cyanobacteria compared to any other surface fig 5c the agglomerate was of brownish color indicating the presence of iron which made up approximately 3 fe 11 μg mg 1 of the total dry mass small amounts of manganese reaching 1 0 07 μg mg 1 of the total dry mass were measured as well 4 discussion in this study we measured biofilm formation and sorption of metals to different polymers in mp size in order to investigate the effects on their sinking behavior employing clsm crystal violet staining and spectrophotometric methods we found microbial biofilm formation to be not sufficient for promoting the sinking of single mp particles in malter reservoir during late summer sinking through aggregation with iron colloids and biomass cells eps was observed after reservoir mixing in a single case contrary to our findings biofouling with cyanobacteria was found to sink polypropylene particles in a eutrophic tropical lake chen et al 2019 the authors hypothesized that the binding of inorganic material contributed more significantly to the mass of the fouling film than the phototrophic cells chen et al 2019 differences to our results can be explained by distinct environmental conditions in malter reservoir such as lower concentrations of chlorophyll a 41 μg l vs 120 μg l 1 phosphate 0 03 vs 0 214 mg l 1 ammonia 0 07 vs 0 41 mg l 1 and suspended solids 4 vs 35 mg l 1 regarding the different conditions biofouling will be more intense in warm nutrient rich shallow lakes compared to temperate nutrient poor deep reservoirs the absence of calcareous macrofoulers which is considered as a major factor promoting sinking of mp in marine environments kaiser et al 2017 may also explain low impact of biofouling on the particle densities in this study however it cannot be excluded that more extensive biofouling occurs during different seasons and may facilitate mp sinking in malter reservoir biofilm formation may strongly influence aggregation dynamics and subsequently the sinking of mp by increasing the stickiness surface charge or altering the morphology e g lobes filaments of the particles aggregation with inorganic and organic particles is considered as another important process that determines the environmental fate of mp besseling et al 2017 sticky organic material such as marine snow porter et al 2018 biogenic particles michels et al 2018 eps summers et al 2018 organo mineral particulate matter möhlenkamp et al 2018 and marine long et al 2015 or freshwater microalgae lagarde et al 2016 can sink buoyant mp through formation of large hetero aggregates most studies used laboratory set ups employing conditions favoring aggregation such as low shear stress and high particle concentrations 101 104 particles ml 1 möhlenkamp et al 2018 which may not reflect natural conditions currents grazing microbial degradation and ingestion by larger organisms could lead to rapid break up or consumption of such aggregates in nature cole et al 2016 in this study aggregation of pe with organo mineral matter was observed the formation right after mixing indicates that iron oxide containing colloids induced the aggregation of pe with organic matter and cells of cyanobacteria algae and bacteria iron colloid formation is an important process capable to aggregate and sink buoyant cyanobacteria in natural lakes after mixing oliver et al 1985 given that only 4 large microplastic particles aggregated with such colloids this study cannot provide sufficient data on the importance and implications of this mechanisms for the fate of mp in reservoirs furthermore it should be considered that reservoir mixing is no prerequisite for the aggregation and subsequent settling of mp in the environment considering the oxic conditions of the hypolimnion prevailing at least since day 22 the majority of iron and manganese should have been present as metal oxides oxide minerals such as ferrihydrite fe5ho8 x 4 h2o magnetite fe3o4 or manganese iv oxide mno2 exhibit a high specific density and may influence the density of mp particles the density change of pe particles 4 4 0 15 mm covered by a fouling film was calculated by using the specific density of these minerals as input variable chubarenko et al 2016 afterwards the mass of fouling films comprising ferrihydrite magnetite manganese oxide or bacteria needed to sink the pe particle ρpe ρwater were determined following equation 2 accordingly the mass concentrations needed to sink pe are 54 μg mg 1 magnetite 58 μg mg 1 ferrihydrite 55 μg mg 1 manganese oxide and 131 156 or 218 μg mg 1 bacteria with different ρbacteria table s2 the maximum iron concentration found on buoyant pe 1 64 μg mg 1 corresponded to 2 2 μg mg 1 ferrihydrite or 2 1 μg mg 1 magnetite whereas the maximum manganese concentration 0 64 μg mg 1 corresponded to 0 94 μg mg 1 manganese oxide therefore the mass concentration of metals bound to freely floating pe particles was at least one order of magnitude too low to overcome their buoyancy the sinking aggregated pe particles showed iron concentrations of 11 μg mg 1 corresponding to 16 4 μg mg 1 ferrihydrite or 15 2 μg mg 1 magnetite biovolume in μm3 μm 2 of bacteria cyanobacteria and algae can be converted to cells mass per particle by multiplying with the particle surface area 1 6 107 μm2 and the specific density of microbial biomass table s2 buoyant pe particles contained approximately 8 μg mg 1 total biomass for ρbiomass 1500 kg m 3 while the microbial biomass on the sunken pe agglomerate made up 149 138 or 124 μg mg 1 depending on the specific density of microbial biomass applied the biomass calculated for the sunken agglomerated pe was in good agreement with the 131 μg mg 1 for ρbiomass 1500 kg m 3 chubarenko et al 2018 theoretically needed to sink buoyant pe particles assuming lower ρbacteria the results deviated slightly 156 μg mg 1 for ρbiomass 1388 kg m 3 besseling et al 2017 or moderately 218 μg mg 1 for ρbiomass 1250 kg m 3 kooi et al 2017 from the biomass theoretically required for sinking however it should be considered that most of the aggregate organic mass was not quantified via clsm as eps was not assessed with the used technique nonetheless ballasting effects of microorganisms considerably exceeded the effect of metal oxides comprising a likely reason for the observed loss in buoyancy this leads to the assumption that the aggregation of freshwater microorganisms can sink mp if sufficient biomass is provided however under low bio productivity or low temperature conditions the critical mass to sink the mp may not be reached within reasonable timescales the extent of eps production within the biofilms seemed to differ between the polymers as shown via crystal violet assay algae and cyanobacteria cells were present in lower densities on pe compared to pet and ps as seen from clsm imaging this may indicate that these organisms had to put more effort into attachment to pe surfaces than to pet ps low attachment efficiency leads to environmental stress vosshage et al 2018 and ultimately to more eps production by the stressed cells scott et al 2014 therefore the fewer but stressed cells on pe could have produced more eps than the cells on pet regarding the occurrence of metals on biofilm covered mp pe showed higher concentrations of iron and manganese compared to the other polymers concentrations of fe and mn exceeded up to 100 times fe or 10 times mn the concentrations found on beached plastic pellets at british shores ashton et al 2010 holmes et al 2012 and plastics exposed to seawater for several months rochman et al 2014 lower ionic strength and the higher abundance of fe mn in freshwater water may explain the higher mp metal concentrations found in this study according to previous studies long term metal sorption to plastics does not differ between polymer types rochman et al 2014 the metal sorption is rather controlled by the biofilm thickness and the available binding places therein rochman et al 2014 van hullebusch et al 2003 in our study pe showed the highest crystal violet stainable biomass of all polymers pe may therefore have provided more binding places for metals within the eps matrix leading to the highest measured iron and manganese concentrations the polymers were enclosed in steel cages during the experiment for ps and pet this produces artificial conditions as particles of the used size will settle down to the sediment within 10 pet to 30 min ps assuming a mean water depth of 16 m and no other currents or mixing however polymers with mechanically changed properties such as pet bottles with trapped air inside or expanded ps may stay afloat for a longer time span than the particles used in this experiment this makes the description of biofilm formation on ps and pet in the upper reservoir parts environmentally relevant even though the particles are not buoyant conditions for biofilm formation may differ between the interior of the cages and the open reservoir water as larger grazing organisms were excluded by the mesh size furthermore the cages had a shading effect reducing the light intensity by 33 due to biofilm formation on the cages this shading effect could have been even stronger than the 33 measured for blank cages reservoirs and especially their hypolimnia experience very low currents for this reason biofilms are only loosely bound to their carriers making biofilm loss due to shear stress likely this may partly explain the high variability of biovolumes on particles of the same material and exposure time formation of hetero aggregates between pe and organo mineral matter was only observed in the hypolimnion therefore the possible sinking of pe floating at the water surface could not be proven directly only one aggregate with four pe particles has been observed hence coincidence cannot be excluded the experiment was

17984,the degree to which a technology used for drinking water treatment physically removes or inactivates pathogenic microorganisms is commonly expressed as a log reduction or log removal and is of central importance to the provision of microbiologically safe drinking water many evaluations of water treatment process performance generate or compile multiple values of microorganism log reduction and it is common to report the average of these log reduction values as a summary statistic this work provides a cautionary note against misinterpretation and misuse of averaged log reduction values by mathematically proving that the average of a set of log reduction values characteristically overstates the average performance of which the set of log reduction values is believed to be representative this has two important consequences for drinking water and food safety as well as other applications of log reduction 1 a technology with higher average log reduction does not necessarily have higher average performance and 2 risk analyses using averaged log reduction values as point estimates of treatment efficiency will underestimate average risk sometimes by well over an order of magnitude when analyzing a set of log reduction values a summary statistic called the effective log reduction which averages reduction or passage rates and expresses this as a log reduction

removal is of particular importance in assessing risk and protecting public health but that average log removal is often used anyway teunis et al 2009 pointedly stated that for estimation of the average infection risk we need the arithmetic average reduction and not the average log reduction schaffner et al 2013 compared average log reduction and a quantity they named the effective log reduction which was mathematically equivalent to an average reduction rate expressed as a log reduction favouring the latter to incorporate information about treatment variability into a point estimate of treatment although these approaches have been advocated none of these works have 1 comprehensively demonstrated the appropriateness of such approaches relative to use of average log reduction 2 explored how widespread the use of average log reductions is in the scientific and regulatory literature or 3 evaluated the potential implications of misusing average log reduction using a mixture of mathematical theory and hypothetical or literature based examples this work 1 addresses how to average a set of log reduction values to describe average treatment performance and 2 re examines how average log reductions have been used to test hypotheses about a technology s typical performance and represent the expected level of treatment in drinking water qmra when no site specific information is available notably this work is concerned only with accurately portraying the information in a gathered set of log reduction values to represent average treatment performance thus the important topic of how to compute a log reduction value from a set of influent and effluent microbial concentration data e g teunis et al 2009 emelko et al 2010 is outside the scope of this work as is the selection process to gather only values deemed representative of the operating condition of interest 2 methods 2 1 evaluating average performance of treatment processes with variable log reduction two simple scenarios are modelled to evaluate average performance of a single treatment process i e the equivalent level of treatment that would yield the same effluent concentration on average considering different forms of variability in log reduction the term effective log reduction is used when this average performance is expressed as a log reduction the models consider pathogens e g cryptosporidium oocysts but could apply to indicator organisms or particles used as surrogates for pathogen removal the first considers the combined effluent of several parallel treatment units with shared influent and unit specific log reduction and flow rate the second considers the temporally composited effluent of a single treatment unit given temporally variable influent concentration log reduction and flow rate each is essentially a mass balance on pathogens so that the number of infectious pathogens in the effluent must equal the number of pathogens in the influent minus the pathogens removed or inactivated assuming no extraneous growth decay or storage the models are illustrative rather than a detailed representation of an actual treatment system so they are deliberately simplified by assuming plug flow and trivial retention time in the treatment process 2 2 hypothesis testing concerning mean log reduction hypothesis testing on mean log reduction is typically concerned with showing that a particular treatment process is better than some value on average or that one treatment process is better than another on average two simulations are used to explore how hypothesis test inferences concerning mean log reduction relate to average performance if a treatment technology s log reduction is normally distributed with unknown variance then t tests may be used to 1 compare the average of a set of log reduction data against a fixed value or 2 compare the averages of two such sets of log reduction data against each other simulated log reduction values were generated in microsoft excel as if each had been determined from a challenge test the latter simulation study featuring two sets of log reduction values as if challenge tests had been carried out to determine if a new technology is better on average than a conventional one used the t test on the difference between two averages with unequal variances if log reduction is normally distributed with mean μ l r and standard deviation σ l r i e l r n μ l r σ l r 2 then 10 l r is lognormally distributed i e ln 10 l r n μ σ 2 with parameters μ μ l r ln 10 and σ σ l r ln 10 and mean e 10 l r e x p μ σ 2 2 this conveniently allows explicit calculation of effective log reduction l r e f f e c t i v e μ l r 0 5 ln 10 σ l r 2 as derived in the supplementary material 2 3 quantitative microbial risk assessment using literature based treatment performance information the effect of using the average of a set of literature based log reduction values as a point estimate of treatment performance in drinking water qmra is explored by expanding upon an example presented in box 2 4 of the world health organization s qmra guidelines who 2016 in particular the example concerning removal of cryptosporidium oocysts by coagulation and filtration as well as inactivation by uv disinfection is considered in that example it was determined from a simple point estimation qmra that a hypothetical drinking water treatment system with a source concentration of 11 oocysts l would need 5 9 log of treatment to meet the acceptable risk target of 10 6 disability adjusted life years dalys per person per year in absence of site specific challenge testing data or other information about log reduction by coagulation and filtration the microorganism elimination credit mec of 3 2 developed by hijnen and medema 2007 2010 for removal of cryptosporidium oocysts by conventional treatment was used this mec was calculated as a weighted average of the assembled log reduction values that were deemed appropriate for inclusion with weighting based upon assigned full scale representativeness scores between one and five together with a 3 log mec for uv disinfection it was concluded that the treatment in the hypothetical system was sufficient to reduce risk below 10 6 dalys per person per year the expanded qmra analysis herein uses the full set of 23 log reduction values and corresponding full scale representativeness scores illustrated as a cumulative relative frequency plot in fig 1 that hijnen and medema 2007 used to calculate the 3 2 log mec for conventional treatment as reproduced in the supplementary material it is assumed that this distribution of log reduction values together with the representativeness scores is collectively representative of the uncertainty in how much treatment could be achieved by coagulation and filtration in a well operated system without further site specific information risk is calculated for each log reduction value using equation 1 as derived from the inputs of who 2016 in the supplementary material and the weighted average risk is calculated using the full scale representativeness scores 1 r i s k 0 84315 10 l r 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 demonstration that average log reduction characteristically overstates average performance a scenario featuring n parallel treatment units e g drinking water filters and a common influent concentration c i n is illustrated in fig 2 the effluent concentration of unit i with log reduction l r i will be c o u t i c i n 10 l r i the combined effluent concentration c o u t p o o l e d is a flow weighted average of the effluent concentrations from the individual units equation 2 where the flow from the i th unit is q i if each unit has equal flow rate then this simplifies to c o u t p o o l e d c i n 1 n i 1 n 10 l r i thus combined effluent water quality is a function of the flow weighted average of 10 l r not of average log reduction the average performance of the set of parallel treatment units can then be expressed in the form of an effective log reduction l r e f f e c t i v e as shown in equation 3 2 c o u t p o o l e d c i n i 1 n q i 10 l r i i 1 n q i 3 l r e f f e c t i v e l o g 10 i 1 n q i i 1 n q i 10 l r i a simple hypothetical example is two parallel filters with an influent concentration of 1 00 oocysts l equal flow rates and log reductions of 2 00 and 4 00 the effluent concentrations would be 1 00 10 2 oocysts l and 1 00 10 4 oocysts l respectively and the combined effluent concentration would be 5 05 10 3 oocysts l the effective log reduction would be log 10 1 00 0 00505 2 30 while the average log reduction is 3 00 here approximately 5 times more oocysts pass through the filters than what is implied by the average log reduction derivation of average performance for a temporally variable treatment process is mathematically similar to the above scenario with time increments t instead of parallel treatment units i when the period of time considered is divided into t equal time increments denoted by index t the temporally composited effluent concentration is a flow weighted average of the effluent concentration over time equation 4 this equation is generalized relative to equation 2 to allow the influent concentration to vary in time it simplifies to c o u t p o o l e d c i n 1 t t 1 t 10 l r t if both influent concentration and flow rate are constant thus temporally averaged effluent water quality is a function of the flow weighted average of 10 l r not of average log reduction given the temporally composited influent concentration c i n p o o l e d t 1 t q t c i n t t 1 t q t the average performance over time of the treatment process can be expressed in the form of an effective log reduction according to equation 5 4 c o u t p o o l e d t 1 t q t c i n t 10 l r t t 1 t q t 5 l r e f f e c t i v e l o g 10 t 1 t q t c i n t t 1 t q t c i n t 10 l r t a simple hypothetical example is an ultrafiltration unit with constant influent concentration of 1 00 oocysts l constant flow rate and 4 00 log reduction for 23 h followed by 1 h with a membrane breach not detected by online monitoring that reduces the performance to just 1 00 log reduction the effluent concentration would be 1 00 10 4 oocysts l for 23 h and 0 10 oocysts l for 1 h and the temporally composited effluent concentration would be 4 26 10 3 oocysts l the effective log reduction would be log 10 1 00 0 00426 2 37 while the average log reduction would be 3 87 in this case approximately 32 times more oocysts pass through the ultrafiltration unit than what is implied by the average log reduction the preceding derivations illustrate that average performance given constant flow rate and influent concentration determined from a set of log reduction values depends upon the average value of 10 l r which may be described as a rate of pathogen or surrogate passage not upon the average of the log reduction values themselves while average log reduction is a useful summary statistic to describe variability in log reduction it is not a measure of the average performance of a treatment process with such variability analogously it has been noted that it is inappropriate to average decibels in a noise exposure analysis because these sound pressure levels are reported in logarithmic units gray 2000 likewise average ph does not correspond to the average molar concentration of hydroxide ions because ph is in logarithmic units in each case it is the antilogarithms that must be averaged as a chemist must convert from grams to moles before using stoichiometric coefficients it is necessary to convert from log reduction to pathogen passage or reduction rates before calculating average treatment performance if the log reduction and influent concentration of a process are independent the mean effluent concentration whether it is pooled effluent of parallel treatment units temporally composited effluent from a single variable unit over time or what might be expected on average among separate treatment systems or from a particular treatment system with uncertain performance is e c o u t e c i n 10 l r e c i n e 10 l r substituting average log reduction e l r as a point estimate of log reduction effectively assumes equality of e 10 l r and 10 e l r but it can be mathematically proven that the latter expression characteristically overstates average performance of the treatment process the arithmetic mean is not invariant to non linear 1 1 the arithmetic mean is invariant to linear transformations f x a x b given probability density function p x for which e x exists e f x a x b p x d x a x p x d x b p x d x a e x b f e x transformations the mean of a specific function of a random variable e f x and this function applied to the mean of the random variable f e x are often unequal furthermore for a convex function such as f x 10 x jensen s inequality evans and rosenthal 2010 states that f e x e f x therefore 10 e l r e 10 l r meaning that average log reduction characteristically understates pathogen passage into treated water or overstates pathogen reduction except in the trivial case where log reduction is a constant apart from jensen s inequality it is already well known e g gale and stanfield 2000 that the average of a set of logarithmic values is related to the geometric mean of the antilogarithms of these values while the arithmetic mean of a set of rate of passage values a 10 l r is of practical interest equation 6 shows that substituting the average log reduction as a point estimate of log reduction i e 10 a l r actually corresponds to the geometric mean of the rate of passage g 10 l r it is known by inequality of the arithmetic and geometric means mcbean and rovers 1998 that the geometric mean of a set of non negative real numbers is characteristically less than the arithmetic mean unless all of the averaged numbers are equal so that 10 a l r a 10 l r for any set of variable log reduction values once again it can be conclusively stated that mean log reduction characteristically understates average pathogen passage to the treated water and overstates average performance of a treatment technology except in the trivial case of constant log reduction 6 g 10 l r i 10 l r 1 10 l r 2 10 l r n n 10 1 n i 1 n l r i 10 a l r i 3 2 demonstration that better average log reduction may not correspond to better average performance two simulations were conducted with parameter values hypotheses and results as summarized in table 1 to compare inferences about average log reduction and average performance expressed as an effective log reduction in the first with a treatment technology that has normally distributed log reduction with μ l r 3 00 and σ l r 1 00 the average of the generated log reduction values is tested with a one sided alternative hypothesis that the mean log reduction is greater than 2 00 of 10 000 repeated simulations 9931 yielded an average log reduction greater than 2 00 and 6800 yielded an average log reduction that could be characterized as significantly greater than 2 00 with p 0 05 meanwhile the effective log reduction is just 1 85 the technology has a mean log reduction much greater than 2 00 but it is no better in terms of average treatment than a technology that achieves a constant log reduction of just 1 85 in the second scenario two hypothetical treatment technologies a and b are compared using a one sided alternative hypothesis that technology b has a greater average log reduction than technology a technology b has greater mean log reduction μ l r b 3 00 and μ l r a 2 50 but also has greater variability in log reduction σ l r b 1 00 and σ l r a 0 50 of 10 000 repeated simulations 8827 had a higher average log reduction for technology b than for technology a in 2722 of these it may be concluded that technology b has significantly higher average log reduction than technology a with p 0 05 meanwhile the effective log reductions of technologies a and b are 2 21 and 1 85 respectively although technology b has a 0 50 log higher average log reduction it actually performs 0 36 log 2 3 times worse than technology a on average thus when a technology has higher average log reduction but also has greater variability in performance it may actually have worse average performance fig 3 it is concluded that comparisons of average log reduction e g using t tests should be avoided in general because they can be very misleading sometimes implying that sufficient treatment is provided on average when it is not or that one treatment technology is better than another on average when it is not it is plausible that a water utility may be misled to choose an inferior treatment technology with lower effective log reduction based upon a higher reported average log reduction this could lead to provision of insufficient treatment or misallocation of limited available resources unless there are other reasons to choose a technology in spite of its lower effective log reduction given this conclusion future research is needed to provide guidance regarding approaches for statistically demonstrating differences in effective log reduction particularly approaches that may be used generally with diverse distribution shapes rather than assuming normally distributed log reductions as is the case here one possibility is bootstrapping evans and rosenthal 2010 but it performs poorly with small sample sizes that are relatively common in this type of application 3 3 using averaged log reduction values in qmra can underestimate average risk reanalysis of the qmra example in box 2 4 of who 2016 using all of the details about variability in log reduction of cryptosporidium oocysts by conventional treatment gathered by hijnen and medema 2007 rather than just the default mec value results in an average risk of 4 1 10 6 dalys per person per year as calculated in the supplementary material critically this exceeds the acceptable annual risk value of 10 6 dalys per person per year the calculated risk values using the 3 2 log mec and effective log reduction of 2 3 are 5 3 10 7 and 4 2 10 6 dalys per person per year respectively in this simple example the risk calculated from the effective log reduction and the average risk differ only due to rounding error while it may be concluded that 3 2 log reduction by coagulation and filtration as well as 3 log inactivation by uv disinfection reduces risk sufficiently in this scenario the reported 3 2 log mec misrepresents the information about plausible log reduction values gathered by hijnen and medema 2007 and used to calculate the mec this is a striking example of how it can be dangerously misleading to use average log reduction as a point value from a variable set of log reductions in risk assessment because the easily overlooked statistical error of averaging logarithmic values in the calculation of the mec caused risk to be underestimated by approximately 0 9 log and resulted in an erroneous conclusion that adequate treatment was provided were this a real example more appropriate recommendations could include 1 implementing a watershed protection strategy to reduce the high cryptosporidium oocyst concentrations in the source 2 completing challenge testing or other research to confirm that the site specific coagulation and filtration implementation provides greater than 2 3 log reduction or 3 performing verification testing of the uv disinfection or increasing the uv dose to ensure greater than 3 0 log reduction fig 4 summarizes the results of this analysis including risk as a function of the variable log reduction values and showing how average log reduction e g the mec and effective log reduction lead to different conclusions relative to the acceptable risk level it is also noted that average log reduction relates to the geometric mean of risk while effective log reduction relates to the arithmetic mean of risk that is more practically meaningful i e the expected number of dalys per person per year in a more detailed qmra example that includes a single hit dose response model e g exponential exact beta poisson substituting effective log reduction as a point estimate is a good approximation of mean risk but the true mean risk would be slightly lower due to the increased variability in doses nilsen and wyller 2016 the mec values calculated as average log reductions are now shown to characteristically overstate average performance of treatment processes and understate risk consistent with the purpose for which they were developed by hijnen and medema 2007 2010 these values have been widely used as default treatment values in qmra when site specific information about log reduction is unavailable e g pintar et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 tfaily et al 2015 hamouda et al 2016 who 2016 health canada 2019 reanalysis of the sets of log reduction values and associated full scale representativeness scores in the appendices of hijnen and medema 2007 revealed that the discrepancy between the mec and the effective log reduction that better represents the information in the underlying set of log reduction values is as high as 1 58 log table 2 in some cases these results need to be updated to incorporate additional data reflected in hijnen and medema 2010 that were not readily available or any new log reduction values that ought to be added into the analysis also lower effective log reduction values relative to the current mec values do not necessarily mean that particular treatment processes are inherently risky for example rapid granular filtration with inline coagulation can provide reliable treatment of cryptosporidium oocysts with adequate filter bed depth and appropriate coagulant dose emelko et al 2005 huck et al 2002a b given the gravity of the qmra example presented herein and the differences between mec values calculated using average log reduction and the more appropriate effective log reduction the default treatment values generated by hijnen and medema 2007 2010 require renewed scrutiny use of the current default treatment values based upon average log reduction in qmra frameworks such as health canada 2019 overstates average treatment and understates average risk if the underlying sets of log reduction values are truly representative of well operated full scale treatment the low log reduction values in particular will require careful attention to ensure they are not overrepresented in compilations of log reduction values because effective log reduction is very sensitive to the lowest log reduction value in the set from which it is calculated 4 conclusions the average log reduction l r of a treatment process is commonly misconstrued as its average performance which is often of practical interest average treatment performance can be described by effective log reduction which is the average rate of pathogen passage 10 l r subsequently expressed in terms of log reduction the average of a set of variable log reduction values characteristically overstates the average performance of the treatment process it is intended to represent hypothesis testing based on average log reduction can be misconstrued as evidence that sufficient treatment is provided on average when it is not or that one treatment technology is better than another on average when it is not this could plausibly lead to misguided infrastructure investments by drinking water utilities risk assessments using average log reduction as a point estimate of treatment performance can substantially underestimate average risk sometimes by more than an order of magnitude this could lead to overconfidence that existing treatment processes reduce risks posed by waterborne pathogens to acceptable levels current microorganism elimination credits that average literature based log reduction values may be inappropriate for use as

qmra e g hokajärvi et al 2018 some researchers have noted that average log reduction i e the arithmetic mean of a set of l r values should not be used in this way instead favouring average reduction rates i e the arithmetic mean of the corresponding set of 1 10 l r values gale and stanfield 2000 differentiated between average log removal of pathogens and net removal noting that the net pathogen removal is of particular importance in assessing risk and protecting public health but that average log removal is often used anyway teunis et al 2009 pointedly stated that for estimation of the average infection risk we need the arithmetic average reduction and not the average log reduction schaffner et al 2013 compared average log reduction and a quantity they named the effective log reduction which was mathematically equivalent to an average reduction rate expressed as a log reduction favouring the latter to incorporate information about treatment variability into a point estimate of treatment although these approaches have been advocated none of these works have 1 comprehensively demonstrated the appropriateness of such approaches relative to use of average log reduction 2 explored how widespread the use of average log reductions is in the scientific and regulatory literature or 3 evaluated the potential implications of misusing average log reduction using a mixture of mathematical theory and hypothetical or literature based examples this work 1 addresses how to average a set of log reduction values to describe average treatment performance and 2 re examines how average log reductions have been used to test hypotheses about a technology s typical performance and represent the expected level of treatment in drinking water qmra when no site specific information is available notably this work is concerned only with accurately portraying the information in a gathered set of log reduction values to represent average treatment performance thus the important topic of how to compute a log reduction value from a set of influent and effluent microbial concentration data e g teunis et al 2009 emelko et al 2010 is outside the scope of this work as is the selection process to gather only values deemed representative of the operating condition of interest 2 methods 2 1 evaluating average performance of treatment processes with variable log reduction two simple scenarios are modelled to evaluate average performance of a single treatment process i e the equivalent level of treatment that would yield the same effluent concentration on average considering different forms of variability in log reduction the term effective log reduction is used when this average performance is expressed as a log reduction the models consider pathogens e g cryptosporidium oocysts but could apply to indicator organisms or particles used as surrogates for pathogen removal the first considers the combined effluent of several parallel treatment units with shared influent and unit specific log reduction and flow rate the second considers the temporally composited effluent of a single treatment unit given temporally variable influent concentration log reduction and flow rate each is essentially a mass balance on pathogens so that the number of infectious pathogens in the effluent must equal the number of pathogens in the influent minus the pathogens removed or inactivated assuming no extraneous growth decay or storage the models are illustrative rather than a detailed representation of an actual treatment system so they are deliberately simplified by assuming plug flow and trivial retention time in the treatment process 2 2 hypothesis testing concerning mean log reduction hypothesis testing on mean log reduction is typically concerned with showing that a particular treatment process is better than some value on average or that one treatment process is better than another on average two simulations are used to explore how hypothesis test inferences concerning mean log reduction relate to average performance if a treatment technology s log reduction is normally distributed with unknown variance then t tests may be used to 1 compare the average of a set of log reduction data against a fixed value or 2 compare the averages of two such sets of log reduction data against each other simulated log reduction values were generated in microsoft excel as if each had been determined from a challenge test the latter simulation study featuring two sets of log reduction values as if challenge tests had been carried out to determine if a new technology is better on average than a conventional one used the t test on the difference between two averages with unequal variances if log reduction is normally distributed with mean μ l r and standard deviation σ l r i e l r n μ l r σ l r 2 then 10 l r is lognormally distributed i e ln 10 l r n μ σ 2 with parameters μ μ l r ln 10 and σ σ l r ln 10 and mean e 10 l r e x p μ σ 2 2 this conveniently allows explicit calculation of effective log reduction l r e f f e c t i v e μ l r 0 5 ln 10 σ l r 2 as derived in the supplementary material 2 3 quantitative microbial risk assessment using literature based treatment performance information the effect of using the average of a set of literature based log reduction values as a point estimate of treatment performance in drinking water qmra is explored by expanding upon an example presented in box 2 4 of the world health organization s qmra guidelines who 2016 in particular the example concerning removal of cryptosporidium oocysts by coagulation and filtration as well as inactivation by uv disinfection is considered in that example it was determined from a simple point estimation qmra that a hypothetical drinking water treatment system with a source concentration of 11 oocysts l would need 5 9 log of treatment to meet the acceptable risk target of 10 6 disability adjusted life years dalys per person per year in absence of site specific challenge testing data or other information about log reduction by coagulation and filtration the microorganism elimination credit mec of 3 2 developed by hijnen and medema 2007 2010 for removal of cryptosporidium oocysts by conventional treatment was used this mec was calculated as a weighted average of the assembled log reduction values that were deemed appropriate for inclusion with weighting based upon assigned full scale representativeness scores between one and five together with a 3 log mec for uv disinfection it was concluded that the treatment in the hypothetical system was sufficient to reduce risk below 10 6 dalys per person per year the expanded qmra analysis herein uses the full set of 23 log reduction values and corresponding full scale representativeness scores illustrated as a cumulative relative frequency plot in fig 1 that hijnen and medema 2007 used to calculate the 3 2 log mec for conventional treatment as reproduced in the supplementary material it is assumed that this distribution of log reduction values together with the representativeness scores is collectively representative of the uncertainty in how much treatment could be achieved by coagulation and filtration in a well operated system without further site specific information risk is calculated for each log reduction value using equation 1 as derived from the inputs of who 2016 in the supplementary material and the weighted average risk is calculated using the full scale representativeness scores 1 r i s k 0 84315 10 l r 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 demonstration that average log reduction characteristically overstates average performance a scenario featuring n parallel treatment units e g drinking water filters and a common influent concentration c i n is illustrated in fig 2 the effluent concentration of unit i with log reduction l r i will be c o u t i c i n 10 l r i the combined effluent concentration c o u t p o o l e d is a flow weighted average of the effluent concentrations from the individual units equation 2 where the flow from the i th unit is q i if each unit has equal flow rate then this simplifies to c o u t p o o l e d c i n 1 n i 1 n 10 l r i thus combined effluent water quality is a function of the flow weighted average of 10 l r not of average log reduction the average performance of the set of parallel treatment units can then be expressed in the form of an effective log reduction l r e f f e c t i v e as shown in equation 3 2 c o u t p o o l e d c i n i 1 n q i 10 l r i i 1 n q i 3 l r e f f e c t i v e l o g 10 i 1 n q i i 1 n q i 10 l r i a simple hypothetical example is two parallel filters with an influent concentration of 1 00 oocysts l equal flow rates and log reductions of 2 00 and 4 00 the effluent concentrations would be 1 00 10 2 oocysts l and 1 00 10 4 oocysts l respectively and the combined effluent concentration would be 5 05 10 3 oocysts l the effective log reduction would be log 10 1 00 0 00505 2 30 while the average log reduction is 3 00 here approximately 5 times more oocysts pass through the filters than what is implied by the average log reduction derivation of average performance for a temporally variable treatment process is mathematically similar to the above scenario with time increments t instead of parallel treatment units i when the period of time considered is divided into t equal time increments denoted by index t the temporally composited effluent concentration is a flow weighted average of the effluent concentration over time equation 4 this equation is generalized relative to equation 2 to allow the influent concentration to vary in time it simplifies to c o u t p o o l e d c i n 1 t t 1 t 10 l r t if both influent concentration and flow rate are constant thus temporally averaged effluent water quality is a function of the flow weighted average of 10 l r not of average log reduction given the temporally composited influent concentration c i n p o o l e d t 1 t q t c i n t t 1 t q t the average performance over time of the treatment process can be expressed in the form of an effective log reduction according to equation 5 4 c o u t p o o l e d t 1 t q t c i n t 10 l r t t 1 t q t 5 l r e f f e c t i v e l o g 10 t 1 t q t c i n t t 1 t q t c i n t 10 l r t a simple hypothetical example is an ultrafiltration unit with constant influent concentration of 1 00 oocysts l constant flow rate and 4 00 log reduction for 23 h followed by 1 h with a membrane breach not detected by online monitoring that reduces the performance to just 1 00 log reduction the effluent concentration would be 1 00 10 4 oocysts l for 23 h and 0 10 oocysts l for 1 h and the temporally composited effluent concentration would be 4 26 10 3 oocysts l the effective log reduction would be log 10 1 00 0 00426 2 37 while the average log reduction would be 3 87 in this case approximately 32 times more oocysts pass through the ultrafiltration unit than what is implied by the average log reduction the preceding derivations illustrate that average performance given constant flow rate and influent concentration determined from a set of log reduction values depends upon the average value of 10 l r which may be described as a rate of pathogen or surrogate passage not upon the average of the log reduction values themselves while average log reduction is a useful summary statistic to describe variability in log reduction it is not a measure of the average performance of a treatment process with such variability analogously it has been noted that it is inappropriate to average decibels in a noise exposure analysis because these sound pressure levels are reported in logarithmic units gray 2000 likewise average ph does not correspond to the average molar concentration of hydroxide ions because ph is in logarithmic units in each case it is the antilogarithms that must be averaged as a chemist must convert from grams to moles before using stoichiometric coefficients it is necessary to convert from log reduction to pathogen passage or reduction rates before calculating average treatment performance if the log reduction and influent concentration of a process are independent the mean effluent concentration whether it is pooled effluent of parallel treatment units temporally composited effluent from a single variable unit over time or what might be expected on average among separate treatment systems or from a particular treatment system with uncertain performance is e c o u t e c i n 10 l r e c i n e 10 l r substituting average log reduction e l r as a point estimate of log reduction effectively assumes equality of e 10 l r and 10 e l r but it can be mathematically proven that the latter expression characteristically overstates average performance of the treatment process the arithmetic mean is not invariant to non linear 1 1 the arithmetic mean is invariant to linear transformations f x a x b given probability density function p x for which e x exists e f x a x b p x d x a x p x d x b p x d x a e x b f e x transformations the mean of a specific function of a random variable e f x and this function applied to the mean of the random variable f e x are often unequal furthermore for a convex function such as f x 10 x jensen s inequality evans and rosenthal 2010 states that f e x e f x therefore 10 e l r e 10 l r meaning that average log reduction characteristically understates pathogen passage into treated water or overstates pathogen reduction except in the trivial case where log reduction is a constant apart from jensen s inequality it is already well known e g gale and stanfield 2000 that the average of a set of logarithmic values is related to the geometric mean of the antilogarithms of these values while the arithmetic mean of a set of rate of passage values a 10 l r is of practical interest equation 6 shows that substituting the average log reduction as a point estimate of log reduction i e 10 a l r actually corresponds to the geometric mean of the rate of passage g 10 l r it is known by inequality of the arithmetic and geometric means mcbean and rovers 1998 that the geometric mean of a set of non negative real numbers is characteristically less than the arithmetic mean unless all of the averaged numbers are equal so that 10 a l r a 10 l r for any set of variable log reduction values once again it can be conclusively stated that mean log reduction characteristically understates average pathogen passage to the treated water and overstates average performance of a treatment technology except in the trivial case of constant log reduction 6 g 10 l r i 10 l r 1 10 l r 2 10 l r n n 10 1 n i 1 n l r i 10 a l r i 3 2 demonstration that better average log reduction may not correspond to better average performance two simulations were conducted with parameter values hypotheses and results as summarized in table 1 to compare inferences about average log reduction and average performance expressed as an effective log reduction in the first with a treatment technology that has normally distributed log reduction with μ l r 3 00 and σ l r 1 00 the average of the generated log reduction values is tested with a one sided alternative hypothesis that the mean log reduction is greater than 2 00 of 10 000 repeated simulations 9931 yielded an average log reduction greater than 2 00 and 6800 yielded an average log reduction that could be characterized as significantly greater than 2 00 with p 0 05 meanwhile the effective log reduction is just 1 85 the technology has a mean log reduction much greater than 2 00 but it is no better in terms of average treatment than a technology that achieves a constant log reduction of just 1 85 in the second scenario two hypothetical treatment technologies a and b are compared using a one sided alternative hypothesis that technology b has a greater average log reduction than technology a technology b has greater mean log reduction μ l r b 3 00 and μ l r a 2 50 but also has greater variability in log reduction σ l r b 1 00 and σ l r a 0 50 of 10 000 repeated simulations 8827 had a higher average log reduction for technology b than for technology a in 2722 of these it may be concluded that technology b has significantly higher average log reduction than technology a with p 0 05 meanwhile the effective log reductions of technologies a and b are 2 21 and 1 85 respectively although technology b has a 0 50 log higher average log reduction it actually performs 0 36 log 2 3 times worse than technology a on average thus when a technology has higher average log reduction but also has greater variability in performance it may actually have worse average performance fig 3 it is concluded that comparisons of average log reduction e g using t tests should be avoided in general because they can be very misleading sometimes implying that sufficient treatment is provided on average when it is not or that one treatment technology is better than another on average when it is not it is plausible that a water utility may be misled to choose an inferior treatment technology with lower effective log reduction based upon a higher reported average log reduction this could lead to provision of insufficient treatment or misallocation of limited available resources unless there are other reasons to choose a technology in spite of its lower effective log reduction given this conclusion future research is needed to provide guidance regarding approaches for statistically demonstrating differences in effective log reduction particularly approaches that may be used generally with diverse distribution shapes rather than assuming normally distributed log reductions as is the case here one possibility is bootstrapping evans and rosenthal 2010 but it performs poorly with small sample sizes that are relatively common in this type of application 3 3 using averaged log reduction values in qmra can underestimate average risk reanalysis of the qmra example in box 2 4 of who 2016 using all of the details about variability in log reduction of cryptosporidium oocysts by conventional treatment gathered by hijnen and medema 2007 rather than just the default mec value results in an average risk of 4 1 10 6 dalys per person per year as calculated in the supplementary material critically this exceeds the acceptable annual risk value of 10 6 dalys per person per year the calculated risk values using the 3 2 log mec and effective log reduction of 2 3 are 5 3 10 7 and 4 2 10 6 dalys per person per year respectively in this simple example the risk calculated from the effective log reduction and the average risk differ only due to rounding error while it may be concluded that 3 2 log reduction by coagulation and filtration as well as 3 log inactivation by uv disinfection reduces risk sufficiently in this scenario the reported 3 2 log mec misrepresents the information about plausible log reduction values gathered by hijnen and medema 2007 and used to calculate the mec this is a striking example of how it can be dangerously misleading to use average log reduction as a point value from a variable set of log reductions in risk assessment because the easily overlooked statistical error of averaging logarithmic values in the calculation of the mec caused risk to be underestimated by approximately 0 9 log and resulted in an erroneous conclusion that adequate treatment was provided were this a real example more appropriate recommendations could include 1 implementing a watershed protection strategy to reduce the high cryptosporidium oocyst concentrations in the source 2 completing challenge testing or other research to confirm that the site specific coagulation and filtration implementation provides greater than 2 3 log reduction or 3 performing verification testing of the uv disinfection or increasing the uv dose to ensure greater than 3 0 log reduction fig 4 summarizes the results of this analysis including risk as a function of the variable log reduction values and showing how average log reduction e g the mec and effective log reduction lead to different conclusions relative to the acceptable risk level it is also noted that average log reduction relates to the geometric mean of risk while effective log reduction relates to the arithmetic mean of risk that is more practically meaningful i e the expected number of dalys per person per year in a more detailed qmra example that includes a single hit dose response model e g exponential exact beta poisson substituting effective log reduction as a point estimate is a good approximation of mean risk but the true mean risk would be slightly lower due to the increased variability in doses nilsen and wyller 2016 the mec values calculated as average log reductions are now shown to characteristically overstate average performance of treatment processes and understate risk consistent with the purpose for which they were developed by hijnen and medema 2007 2010 these values have been widely used as default treatment values in qmra when site specific information about log reduction is unavailable e g pintar et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 tfaily et al 2015 hamouda et al 2016 who 2016 health canada 2019 reanalysis of the sets of log reduction values and associated full scale representativeness scores in the appendices of hijnen and medema 2007 revealed that the discrepancy between the mec and the effective log reduction that better represents the information in the underlying set of log reduction values is as high as 1 58 log table 2 in some cases these results need to be updated to incorporate additional data reflected in hijnen and medema 2010 that were not readily available or any new log reduction values that ought to be added into the analysis also lower effective log reduction values relative to the current mec values do not necessarily mean that particular treatment processes are inherently risky for example rapid granular filtration with inline coagulation can provide reliable treatment of cryptosporidium oocysts with adequate filter bed depth and appropriate coagulant dose emelko et al 2005 huck et al 2002a b given the gravity of the qmra example presented herein and the differences between mec values calculated using average log reduction and the more appropriate effective log reduction the default treatment values generated by hijnen and medema 2007 2010 require renewed scrutiny use of the current default treatment values based upon average log reduction in qmra frameworks such as health canada 2019 overstates average treatment and understates average risk if the underlying sets of log reduction values are truly representative of well operated full scale treatment the low log reduction values in particular will require careful attention to ensure they are not overrepresented in compilations of log reduction values because effective log reduction is very sensitive to the lowest log reduction value in the set from which it is calculated 4 conclusions the average log reduction l r of a treatment process is commonly misconstrued as its average performance which is often of practical interest average treatment performance can be described by effective log reduction which is the average rate of pathogen passage 10 l r subsequently expressed in terms of log reduction the average of a set of variable log reduction values characteristically overstates the average performance of the treatment process it is intended to represent hypothesis testing based on average log reduction can be misconstrued as evidence that sufficient treatment is provided on average when it is not or that one treatment technology is better than another on average when it is not this could plausibly lead to misguided infrastructure investments by drinking water utilities risk assessments using average log reduction as a point estimate of treatment performance can substantially underestimate average risk sometimes by more than an order of magnitude this could lead to overconfidence that existing treatment processes reduce risks posed by waterborne pathogens to acceptable levels current microorganism elimination credits that average literature based log reduction values may be inappropriate for use as default log reduction values in qmra when site specific treatment information is unavailable updated values based upon effective log reduction rather than average log reduction are needed declaration
