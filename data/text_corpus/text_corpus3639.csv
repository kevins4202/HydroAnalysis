18195,elevated atmospheric co2 concentration eco2 may have different effects on the bacterial community with regard to c assimilation and decomposition in eutrophic waters compared to that in fresh waters with intermediate levels of nutrients and oceans aquatic plant growth under eco2 could further modify microbial activities associated with the c cycle in eutrophic waters therefore there is an urgent need to further study how eco2 and its interactions with the growth of aquatic plants affect the composition and function of the bacterial community involved in mediating the c cycle in eutrophic waters accordingly we designed a microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of ambient and high co2 concentrations on bacterial community composition and function in eutrophic waters with and without the growth of eichhornia crassipes mart solms the results from 16s rrna gene sequencing function prediction and q pcr showed that eco2 significantly increased the abundance of bacterial and functional genes involved in co2 assimilation photosynthetic bacteria cbbl ia ic cbbl id cbbm pufm and c decomposition acidimicrobiia thermoleophilia gaiellales chia illustrating the functional enrichment with photoautotrophy hydrocarbon degradation cellulolysis and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation however eco2 decreased the abundance of some chemoautotrophic bacteria including nitrifying bacteria nitrospirae nitrosomonadaceae in contrast the cultivation of e crassipes decreased the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria but increased the abundance of bacteria involved in complex c decomposition associated with root exudates and degradation e g fibrobacteres sphingobacteriales sphingomonadales and rhizobiales eco2 and growth of e crassipes had opposite effects on algal density in eutrophic waters creating interactive effects that further decreased the diversity of the bacterial community and abundance of some co2 assimilating bacteria with nitrifying characteristics nitrosomonadaceae and some c degrading bacteria fibrobacteres with denitrifying properties flavobacteriaceae sphingomonadaceae and gemmobacter therefore the interactions between aquatic plants and the bacterial community in eutrophic waters under eco2 would be beneficial to the environment and help alleviate the greenhouse effect graphical abstract image 1 keywords co2 elevation floating aquatic plant bacterial community composition and function carbon cycle eutrophication 1 introduction bacteria are among the main drivers mediating the carbon c biogeochemical cycle in the aquatic ecosystem including carbon dioxide co2 assimilation and organic carbon decomposition all obligate and facultative autotrophic bacteria are involved in co2 assimilation through photoautotrophy and chemoautotrophy where co2 or hco3 is the carbon source however heterotrophic bacteria are involved in organic carbon decomposition using dissolved organic carbon doc as carbon source elevated atmospheric co2 concentration eco2 has become a global challenge which leads to an increase in gas diffusion rate and air exchange frequency at the water air interface the carbonate equilibrium will change with co2 elevation raven et al 2005 and affect the growth and propagation of autotrophic bacteria and algae beman et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 thereby affecting the doc pool of algal origin consequently eco2 will inevitably have a direct or indirect impact on the bacterial community including the bacteria involved in co2 assimilation and c decomposition to date most of the relative studies have mainly focused on the soil or ocean and have demonstrated that eco2 can alter bacterial community composition carney et al 2007 brussaard et al 2013 davidson et al 2016 and increase liu et al 2014 decrease he et al 2012 or have no impact on lipson et al 2005 bacterial community diversity and enhance the abundance of c fixation genes and heterotrophs carney et al 2007 lesaulnier et al 2008 he et al 2010 however the results from terrestrial and ocean ecosystems may differ from those of freshwater ecosystems unfortunately few relative studies have been conducted on inland aquatic systems especially eutrophic waters creating knowledge gaps regarding eco2 and changes in bacterial community composition and function in eutrophic water owing to the high algal density in eutrophic water bacterial community composition varies with changes in algal density previous studies have indicated that the formation of cyanobacterial aggregates in eutrophic water was associated with heterotrophic bacteria with different algal species and density fostering highly dissimilar bacterial communities eiler and bertilsson 2004 the composition of both free living and particle attached bacterial communities changed during the accumulation and breakdown phases of a microcystis bloom and differences were also evident with different levels of microcystis biomass li et al 2011 research results have suggested that eco2 could promote phytoplankton productivity schippers et al 2004 therefore the changes in algal density caused by eco2 inevitably affect bacterial community composition and function in eutrophic waters however further study is needed especially regarding how the bacterial community responds to eco2 in terms of co2 assimilation and c decomposition plant cultivation is an alternative method to mitigate the greenhouse effect furthermore it is an effective method for eutrophic water treatment aquatic plant growth can inhibit algal growth and propagation and decrease algal density jin et al 2003 which can be detrimental to increases in doc resulting from algae furthermore it can lead to a decrease in the proportion of algae attached bacteria on the other hand floating aquatic plants could quickly uptake n and p in eutrophic water and they have a much stronger assimilative ability for n than microbes kaye and hart 1997 inselsbacher et al 2010 the well developed roots of floating plants can form a rhizospheric microenvironment by providing adhesion for microbes o2 and high doc ma et al 2014 kosten et al 2016 which may be suitable for certain microbes therefore the eutrophic water environment can differ greatly with and without the growth of floating plants which can trigger changes in bacterial community composition and function there may be interactive effects between eco2 and plant growth on the bacterial community in eutrophic water eco2 could promote the growth of algae zhao et al 2013 and stimulate the growth of algae attached bacteria by providing increased dissolved inorganic carbon dic in eutrophic water on the other hand eco2 could accelerate the growth of plants by enhancing their co2 assimilation körner 2004 and promote doc secretion from roots phillips et al 2011 which could provide more electron donors or energy for heterotrophic bacteria in eutrophic water however floating aquatic plants could inhibit the growth of algae by competing for nutrients and secreting allelochemicals hu and hong 2008 which would lead to a decrease in doc from algae and algae attached bacteria therefore it is unclear how the interactive effects of eco2 and aquatic plant growth alter the bacterial community in eutrophic water and the effects of the interaction between eco2 and aquatic plant growth on bacterial community composition and function associated with c assimilation and decomposition to elucidate these responses we conducted a microcosmic experiment under conditions of ambient co2 concentrations and eco2 aco2 and eco2 400 and 800 μmol mol 1 respectively with or without the growth of the aquatic floating plant eichhornia crassipes mart solms to determine the interactive effects between eco2 and plant growth on the composition diversity and function of the microbial community in eutrophic water the 16s rrna gene sequencing targeting the v3 v4 hypervariable region was applied because of its highest classification accuracy compared to other combinations of variable regions claesson et al 2010 wear et al 2018 based on a literature review we hypothesised that the interactive effects between plant growth and eco2 may have a stronger effect on the bacterial community than either plant growth or eco2 alone as 1 plant growth and eco2 will have contrasting effects on photosynthetic microbes especially algae involved in co2 assimilation 2 plant growth and eco2 will have different mechanisms regulating the bacterial community involved in c decomposition i e eco2 may promote c decomposition via increasing algal density that leads to the propagation of associated heterotrophic bacteria whereas plant growth will weaken the effect of algae but will regulate c decomposition via root activity 3 the growth of plants will have a significant positive relationship with eco2 which may further intensify the above effects and lead to positive or negative interactive effects between eco2 and plant growth on the bacterial community with differing characteristics in eutrophic water this study will help to clarify the underlying microbial mechanism that drives the changes in carbon assimilation and decomposition in eutrophic water resulting from interactions between the eco2 and aquatic plant growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 plants and eutrophic water seedlings of the floating aquatic

plants or the growth of e crassipes under aco2 condition significantly increased the diversity of the bacterial community in eutrophic water p 0 01 however the growth of e crassipes under eco2 condition significantly decreased the diversity of the bacterial community in eutrophic water p 0 01 the two way anova of co2 concentration and plant growth further illustrated that there was a significant negative interaction between co2 concentration and the growth of e crassipes with regard to the reduction in the diversity shannon and simpson indices in the bacterial community p 0 01 3 2 the response of the bacterial community composition involved in the c cycle to eco2 or aquatic plant growth the nmds plot fig 1 anosim and adonis table s2 demonstrated that the bacterial community

verrucomicrobiales and rhizobiales and the genus acinetobacter significantly increased at the classification level fig 2 b fig 3 c d fig s3 bacteria involved in co2 assimilation and c decomposition had different responses to the growth of e crassipes in eutrophic water under aco2 condition the relative abundance of photosynthetic bacteria including the phylum chloroflexi class chloroflexia orders chloroflexales and synechococcales and family rhodospirillaceae decreased significantly with the growth of e crassipes under aco2 condition p 0 05 the relative abundance of chemoautotrophic bacteria including the family mycobacteriaceae and genera hydrogenophaga and mycobacterium increased in the beginning day 7 but decreased with plant growth whereas the family nitrosomonadaceae increased with plant growth p 0 05 in addition the relative abundance of bacteria involved in c decomposition significantly increased including the phyla of proteobacteria margulisbacteria fibrobacteres and firmicutes orders bacteroidales and sphingomonadales families sphingomonadaceae pseudomonadaceae and flavobacteriaceae and the genera pseudomonas flavobacterium steroidobacter terrimonas and novosphingobium with the growth of e crassipes under aco2 condition however the abundance of actinobacteria and its subgroups of acidimicrobiia corynebacteriales and frankiales decreased significantly p 0 05 furthermore the relative abundance of root attached bacteria involved in c decomposition was significantly higher than planktonic bacteria in eutrophic water under aco2 condition 3 3 the response of the bacterial community composition involved in the c cycle to interaction effects between eco2 and e crassipes the bacterial community composition in case of the eco2p21d treatment varied significantly from that of the eco221d and aco2p21d treatments as shown by the nmds plot and adonis analysis fig 1 table s2 at the classification level fig 4 the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria and some chemoautotrophic bacteria in the eco2p treatment was lower than that in case of the eco2 treatment including the phylum chloroflexi orders synechococcales rhodospirillales and oceanospirillales and families mycobacteriaceae roseiflexaceae and nitrosomonadaceae p 0 05 among these bacteria the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae in the eco2p treatment was lower than that in the aco2p treatment p 0 05 according to the two way anova table 2 there was a significant interaction between co2 concentration and the growth of e crassipes with regard to the reduction of the abundance of nitrosomonadaceae plant growth had a stronger effect on bacteria involved in co2 assimilation in the water whereas co2 concentration only had a significant effect on the abundance of the families mycobacteriaceae and nitrosomonadaceae and the genus mycobacterium in addition the relative abundance of most bacteria involved in c decomposition including the phyla of bacteroidetes and acidobacteria orders rhizobiales sphingobacteriales verrucomicrobiales corynebacteriales and gaiellales family rhizobiaceae and genera gemmobacter novosphingobium comamonas and limnobacter was lower in case of the eco2p treatment than in the eco2 treatment p 0 05 the abundance of the phyla planctomycetes and margulisbacteria orders sphingomonadales and gaiellales family

between the co2 concentration and the growth of e crassipes on bacteria involved in c decomposition including the phylum fibrobacteres families fibrobacteraceae flavobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae and genera flavobacterium novosphingobium and gemmobacter 3 4 the effects of eco2 and plant growth on bacterial community function in eutrophic water in eutrophic water without plants the abundance of cbbl bacterial cbbl ia ic and chromophytic algal cbbl id cbbm and pufm genes associated with co2 assimilation and the chia gene related to c decomposition were significantly higher under eco2 than those under the aco2 condition at the end of experiment p 0 05 however another functional gene gh48 related to c decomposition failed to exhibit a significant difference between the aco2 and eco2 treatments fig 5 according to the functional prediction based on 16s rrna fig 6 photoautotrophy anoxygenic photoautotrophy s oxidation and anoxygenic photoautotrophy were enriched in the eco2 treatment whereas chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy were enriched in the aco2 treatment in addition cellulolysis hydrocarbon degradation and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were enriched in the eco2 treatment the results were consistent with those of the cbbl ia ic cbbl id cbbm pufm and chia genes with the growth of plants the abundance of cbbl bacterial cbbl ia ic and chromophytic algal cbbl id cbbm pufm chia and gh48 genes decreased sharply in eutrophic water under the aco2 condition but were enriched in roots fig 5 according to the functional prediction based on the 16s rrna fig 6 the planktonic bacteria in eutrophic water showed functional enrichment in ligninolysis xylanolysis cellulolysis aliphatic non methane hydrocarbon degradation hydrocarbon degradation aromatic compound degradation and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation with plant growth whereas phototrophy and photoheterotrophy were lessened there was a significant interaction between eco2 and plant growth on the bacterial cbbl ia ic cbbm and pufm functional genes in eutrophic water table s3 from a functional perspective plant growth under the eco2 condition exhibited functional decreases in photoautotrophy anoxygenic photoautotrophy s oxidation and anoxygenic photoautotrophy relative to that of the eco2 and aco2p treatments the results were consistent with the statistical results of the bacterial cbbl ia ic cbbm and pufm functional genes in addition hydrocarbon degradation cellulolysis and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were reduced in the eco2p treatment fig 6 3 5 the relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors the dbrda analysis at the genus level indicated that ph no2 and doc played a significant role p 0 01 in structuring the bacterial community in eutrophic water without plants whereas n2o and no3 played a vital role p 0 01 in structuring the bacterial community in eutrophic water with the growth of e crassipes fig 7 table s4 the first axis accounted for the effects with or without the growth of e crassipes on bacterial community composition and the second axis accounted for the variation in the bacterial community composition over time on the other hand the dbrda analysis at the genus level indicated that no2 and no3 were very important to the genera gemmobacter acinetobacter pseudomonas and flavobacterium which perform the denitrification and degradation of organic carbon the dic and doc were closely related to the genera azospirillum and tistrella rhodospirillaceae which may be involved in the process of c fixation or decomposition vpa fig 8 a showed that the environmental variables ph n nutrients nh4 no3 no2 n2o and c sources dic doc explained 12 93 25 04 and 7 76 of the variation in the bacterial community composition respectively the n nutrient indices exhibited stronger effects on the bacterial community composition than did the c source indices on the other hand vpa fig 8 b showed that the effects of plant growth e crassipes on bacterial community composition were stronger than that of co2 concentration 4 discussion 4 1 the response of bacterial community involved in co2 assimilation to eco2 our study indicated that proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia firmicutes and chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial phyla in eutrophic water under both eco2 and aco2 conditions fig s4 these were similar to those in the eutrophic river where our experimental water was collected gao et al 2017 and other natural rivers or lakes mueller spitz et al 2009 humbert et al 2009 wu et al 2012 specifically in the surface water of the eutrophic river the species of cyanobacteria the genera microcystis and microcoleus and family rhodospirillaceae were the major photosynthetic bacteria involved in co2 assimilation gao et al 2017 however in our study the order synechococcales classified as oxyphotobacteria and the family rhodospirillaceae exhibited stronger responses to eco2 the results indicated that eco2 may stimulate the activity of some specific photosynthetic bacteria except the genera of microcystis and microcoleus in eutrophic water the increased atomic percentage of di13c in the eutrophic water fig s5 provided more dissolved 13co2 or h13co3 derived from the elevated atmospheric 13co2 for autotrophic microbes and was a prerequisite for the increase in photosynthetic bacteria in addition the increase of the cbbl ia ic cbbl id and cbbm functional genes related to co2 assimilation implied there was greater co2 assimilation under eco2 condition the results of functional genes combined with functional predictions by faprotax indicated that eco2 promoted co2 assimilation by photoautotrophy in our eutrophic water typical chemoautotrophic bacteria involved in co2 assimilation were distributed in the phylum nitrospirae orders nitrospirales and oceanospirillales families mycobacteriaceae roseiflexaceae hydrogenophilaceae and nitrosomonadaceae and genera mycobacterium and hydrogenophaga these also existed in the surface water of eutrophic rivers gao et al 2017 under eco2 condition the relative abundance of these chemoautotrophic bacteria decreased indicating the possible inhibition of their growth by eco2 among these chemoautotrophic bacteria nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospirae nitrospirales were typical nitrifying bacteria which exerted control over nitrification by oxidising ammonia to nitrites and oxidising nitrites to nitrates respectively the decrease in their abundance under eco2 condition indicated the inhibition of nitrification this result was consistent with our previous observation that the transformation rate of nh4 concentration was lower under eco2 condition in eutrophic water when compared to that under aco2 condition shi et al 2019 the rda results showed that ph was the main environmental factor affecting the bacterial community composition in eutrophic water without plants showing an upward trend for the utilisation of dic by algae even under eco2 condition hence increased algal density under eco2 condition may be the main reason for the decrease in the abundance of these chemoautotrophic bacteria e g the resource competition for dic or o2 between chemoautotrophic bacteria and algae or heterotrophic bacteria some studies indicated that ammonia oxidising bacteria aob a type of chemoautotrophic bacteria for nitrification were inferior competitors for some resources e g dic or o2 relative to algae and heterotrophic bacteria belser 1979 risgaard petersen et al 2004 choi et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 observed that the relative abundance of mycobacteriaceae and nitrospira in the 13c labeled functional bacteria decreased during incubation in the small and medium size microcystis aggregate dominated eutrophic water indicating similar competitive results previous studies also revealed that nitrifying bacteria nitrosococcus oxidises nh3 to no2 and nitrospirales oxidises no2 to no3 decreased with increasing pco2 in coastal sediments raulf et al 2015 moreover nitrification rates decreased under ocean acidification beman et al 2011 this may indicate there was a similar effect of eco2 on nitrification in freshwater and marine ecosystems but different major species of ammonia oxidising bacteria were involved in the nitrification process similar results also reported that there was a significant decrease in the abundance of chemoautotrophic bacteria bradyrhizobium roseiflexus and flavisolibacter in soil under eco2 condition lesaulnier et al 2008 yu et al 2016 4 2 the response of the bacterial community involved in c decomposition under eco2 condition in our eutrophic water typical bacteria involved in c decomposition were widely distributed in the phyla of proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and fibrobacteres and their subgroups for example the classes fibrobacteria bacteroidia thermoleophilia acidimicrobiia and acidobacteriia orders fibrobacterales cytophagales chitinophagales sphingomonadales sphingobacteriales and gaiellales families flavobacteriaceae pseudomonadaceae sphingomonadaceae comamonadaceae and chitinophagaceae and the genera flavobacterium alsobacter novosphingobium pseudomonas and acinetobacter this was consistent with the bacterial community composition observed in the surface water of the eutrophic river gao et al 2017 some of which were typical denitrifying bacteria among these bacteria the relative abundance of acidimicrobiia thermoleophilia class gaiellales order and comamonas and acinetobacter genera had a significantly stronger response to eco2 in addition the relative abundance of gemmobacter genus whose members are important denitrifying bacteria wang et al 2019 increased significantly under eco2 condition but this genus was not observed in the surface water of the eutrophic river furthermore the chia gene associated with c decomposition and functional prediction indicated that eco2 increased the abundance of the bacteria involved in c decomposition showing functional enrichment in hydrocarbon degradation cellulolysis and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation acidimicrobiia thermoleophilia and gaiellales classified as actinobacteria have cellulose decomposition characteristics de menezes et al 2015 the algal cell consists of a microfibrillar phase which is composed mostly of cellulose xylan or mannan tsekos 1999 therefore it is reasonable to predict that a high abundance of these bacteria may be closely related to algal decomposition in addition to degrading liable carbon most species of gemmobacter comamonas and acinetobacter are efficient in denitrification huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 implying greater denitrification the results were consistent with our previous observation that the abundance of functional genes associated with denitrification increased in the eutrophic water under the eco2 condition shi et al 2019 4 3 the response of the bacterial community involved in the c cycle to the growth of e crassipes the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria chloroflexi synechococcales and rhodospirillaceae in eutrophic water decreased with the growth of e crassipes because of the competition for light between plants and photosynthetic bacteria however the abundance of some chemoautotrophic bacteria increased at first and then decreased during the plant s growth period in eutrophic water except for the nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospirae the increase in the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospirae implied increased nitrification as well as no3 accumulation with the growth of e crassipes shi et al 2019 under the eco2 condition the growth of e crassipes also led to a significant reduction in the abundance of most photosynthetic and chemoautotrophic bacteria suggesting that plant growth had a stronger effect on most autotrophic bacteria in the eutrophic water than the eco2 although the growth of e crassipes inhibited algal propagation and thereby decreased the bacteria attached to algae its roots provided attachment sites and o2 for chemoautotrophic bacteria previous studies showed that plant root exudates significantly shaped rhizospheric bacterial community structure and bacteria related to root exudate assimilation e g sphingobacteriales sphingomonadales rhizobiales and myxococcus colonised roots of wheat maize rape and barrel clover el zahar haichar et al 2008 sphingobacteriales sphingomonadales and rhizobiaceae were also found on rice roots or in its rhizosphere and incorporated plant derived carbon qiu et al 2009 hernández et al 2015 the results were consistent with ours in that the abundance of sphingobacteriales sphingobacteriaceae sphingomonadales sphingomonadaceae and rhizobiales increased in the eutrophic water with the growth of e crassipes and were especially enriched on the rhizoplane the sphingobacteriaceae classified as sphingobacteriales which have the ability to degrade lignocellulose use available polycyclic or monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons basta et al 2005 wilhelm et al 2019 the sphingomonadales have genes encoding glycoside hydrolases vandana et al 2017 and some genera of rhizobiales were commonly detected in the heavy dna fraction of 13c labeled residues or cellulose fan et al 2014 these bacteria were all associated with root exudates or root degradation el zahar haichar et al 2008 this may indicate that there was a similar bacterial community enriched on roots of terrestrial and aquatic plants which was responsible for c utilisation derived from plants in addition some specific bacteria associated with c decomposition the phyla proteobacteria firmicutes fibrobacteres order bacteroidales and genera steroidobacter and terrimonas increased in abundance with the growth of e crassipes and were accompanied by functional enrichment in ligninolysis xylanolysis cellulolysis and hydrocarbon degradation this suggests that the increase in bacteria for decomposition of complex carbon compounds was associated with rhizodegradation furthermore the abundance of acidimicrobiia corynebacteriales and frankiales classified as actinobacteria significantly decreased with the growth of e crassipes this could be closely related to the obvious reduction of algae caused by e crassipes growth 4 4 the interactive effects between eco2 and e crassipes on the bacterial community involved in the c cycle our results clearly revealed that the interaction between eco2 and growth of e crassipes led to a significant reduction in the abundance of cbbl ia ic and cbbm functional genes and some nitrifying bacteria involved in co2 assimilation nitrosomonadaceae under eco2 condition the abundance of cbbl ia ic and cbbm genes increased whereas the family nitrosomonadaceae decreased in eutrophic water without plants however the growth of e crassipes under the aco2 condition led to a significant decline in cbbl ia ic and cbbm gene abundance whereas there was an increase in the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae although eco2 and e crassipes alone showed opposite effects on the changes in the abundance of cbbl ia ic cbbm genes and nitrosomonadaceae the growth of e crassipes under the eco2 condition led to a reduction in the abundance of cbbl ia ic cbbm genes and nitrosomonadaceae this suggests that eco2 had a stronger effect on changes in nitrosomonadaceae whereas plant growth had a stronger effect on cbbl ia ic and cbbm genes this indicates that the interactive effect between eco2 and the growth of e crassipes may depend on different bacterial functions nevertheless the decrease of functional genes cbbl ia ic and cbbm and some nitrifying bacteria under the interaction of eco2 and growth of e crassipes did not necessarily indicate reduced co2 assimilation throughout the entire eutrophic water ecosystem the photosynthesis of aquatic plants could make an important contribution to co2 fixation under the eco2 condition körner 2004 our results also revealed the interaction between eco2 and the growth of e crassipes on the reduction of the abundance of some bacteria involved in c decomposition in eutrophic water e g phylum fibrobacteres families fibrobacteriaceae flavobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae and genera flavobacterium novosphingobium and gemmobacter the decrease in the relative abundance of these bacteria may be caused by improved plant growth and less root degradation under the eco2 condition körner 2004 because the growth of e crassipes increased the relative abundance of these bacteria under the aco2 condition and the eco2 had only a minor effect on these bacteria in water without plants the synergistic effect between eco2 and e crassipes could be the main reason for the reduction of bacteria involved in c decomposition in water although some studies indicated that eco2 could increase microbial biomass and root turnover of some terrestrial plants and cellobiohydrolase activity lipson et al 2005 chung et al 2007 other studies have shown that eco2 decreased the microbial biomass with the growth of the herbs vulpia michrostachys and lolium multiflorumin and reduced fine root mortality in the woody plants in quercus spp zak et al 2000 this implied that plant species played a critical role in the shifts in the microbial community under the eco2 condition the effects of eco2 on the aquatic plant mediated changes of the microbial community deserve further research to reach a more definite conclusion such as the interaction effects between eco2 and other species of the floating aquatic plants on the alteration of bacteria involved in c decomposition in eutrophic water fibrobacteres is an important bacterial degrader of lignocellulosic materials ransom jones et al 2012 sphingomonadaceae was observed to have cellulolytic and chitinolytic capabilities sly et al 1999 xie et al 2007 flavobacteriaceae was involved in the degradation of the high molecular mass fraction of dissolved organic matter and several biopolymers saha and chakrabarti 2006 the shift in microbial community composition may reflect changes in microbial function this implied that the growth of e crassipes under eco2 condition would result in less c decomposition in eutrophic water in addition a further decrease in the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae with nitrification function and members of sphingomonadaceae flavobacteriaceae and gemmobacter with denitrification functions mills et al 2008 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 suggested the reduction in nitrification and denitrification in eutrophic water under the interactive effects of eco2 and e crassipes this was beneficial in the reduction of n2o emissions as shown in our recently published paper shi et al 2019 therefore cultivation of floating aquatic plants e crassipes under eco2 condition could alter the sink source relationship of c and n in eutrophic water leading to enhanced c sequestration but reduced n2o emission if plants could be harvested before senescence 5 conclusions in this study underlying microbial mechanisms that drove the changes in carbon assimilation and decomposition in eutrophic water under the eco2 condition as well as plant growth and their interactions were investigated through 16s rrna gene sequencing function prediction and q pcr we demonstrated that the eco2 condition significantly increased the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria and the cbbl ia ic cbbl id cbbm and pufm genes showing functional enrichment in photoautotrophy whereas the abundance of some chemoautotrophic bacteria decreased including nitrifying bacteria furthermore the eco2 condition increased the abundance of bacteria and functional genes associated with c decomposition indicating functional enrichment of hydrocarbon degradation cellulolysis and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation cultivation of the floating aquatic plant e crassipes decreased the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria but increased bacteria involved in complex c decomposition associated with root exudates and degradation the eco2 condition and growth of e crassipes had a significant positive relationship with opposite effects on the algal density in eutrophic water creating interactive effects that further decreased the diversity of the bacterial community the abundance of some co2 assimilating bacteria with nitrifying characteristics and some c degrading bacteria with denitrifying characteristics the interactions between aquatic plants and the bacterial community in eutrophic water under the eco2 condition could be beneficial in the alleviation of greenhouse effect declaration

18195,elevated atmospheric co2 concentration eco2 may have different effects on the bacterial community with regard to c assimilation and decomposition in eutrophic waters compared to that in fresh waters with intermediate levels of nutrients and oceans aquatic plant growth under eco2 could further modify microbial activities associated with the c cycle in eutrophic waters therefore there is an urgent need to further study how eco2 and its interactions with the growth of aquatic plants affect the composition and function of the bacterial community involved in mediating the c cycle in eutrophic waters accordingly we designed a microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of ambient and high co2 concentrations on bacterial community composition and function in eutrophic waters with and without the growth of eichhornia crassipes mart solms the results from 16s rrna gene sequencing function prediction and q pcr showed that eco2 significantly increased the abundance of bacterial and functional genes involved in co2 assimilation photosynthetic bacteria cbbl ia ic cbbl id cbbm pufm and c decomposition acidimicrobiia thermoleophilia gaiellales chia illustrating the functional enrichment with photoautotrophy hydrocarbon degradation cellulolysis and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation however eco2 decreased the abundance of some chemoautotrophic bacteria including nitrifying bacteria nitrospirae nitrosomonadaceae in contrast the cultivation of e crassipes decreased the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria but increased the abundance of bacteria involved in complex c decomposition associated with root exudates and degradation e g fibrobacteres sphingobacteriales sphingomonadales and rhizobiales eco2 and growth of e crassipes had opposite effects on algal density in eutrophic waters creating interactive effects that further decreased the diversity of the bacterial community and abundance of some co2 assimilating bacteria with nitrifying characteristics nitrosomonadaceae and some c degrading bacteria fibrobacteres with denitrifying properties flavobacteriaceae sphingomonadaceae and gemmobacter therefore the interactions between aquatic plants and the bacterial community in eutrophic waters under eco2 would be beneficial to the environment and help alleviate the greenhouse effect graphical abstract image 1 keywords co2 elevation floating aquatic plant bacterial community composition and function carbon cycle eutrophication 1 introduction bacteria are among the main drivers mediating the carbon c biogeochemical cycle in the aquatic ecosystem including carbon dioxide co2 assimilation and organic carbon decomposition all obligate and facultative autotrophic bacteria are involved in co2 assimilation through photoautotrophy and chemoautotrophy where co2 or hco3 is the carbon source however heterotrophic bacteria are involved in organic carbon decomposition using dissolved organic carbon doc as carbon source elevated atmospheric co2 concentration eco2 has become a global challenge which leads to an increase in gas diffusion rate and air exchange frequency at the water air interface the carbonate equilibrium will change with co2 elevation raven et al 2005 and affect the growth and propagation of autotrophic bacteria and algae beman et al 2011 zhao et al 2013 thereby affecting the doc pool of algal origin consequently eco2 will inevitably have a direct or indirect impact on the bacterial community including the bacteria involved in co2 assimilation and c decomposition to date most of the relative studies have mainly focused on the soil or ocean and have demonstrated that eco2 can alter bacterial community composition carney et al 2007 brussaard et al 2013 davidson et al 2016 and increase liu et al 2014 decrease he et al 2012 or have no impact on lipson et al 2005 bacterial community diversity and enhance the abundance of c fixation genes and heterotrophs carney et al 2007 lesaulnier et al 2008 he et al 2010 however the results from terrestrial and ocean ecosystems may differ from those of freshwater ecosystems unfortunately few relative studies have been conducted on inland aquatic systems especially eutrophic waters creating knowledge gaps regarding eco2 and changes in bacterial community composition and function in eutrophic water owing to the high algal density in eutrophic water bacterial community composition varies with changes in algal density previous studies have indicated that the formation of cyanobacterial aggregates in eutrophic water was associated with heterotrophic bacteria with different algal species and density fostering highly dissimilar bacterial communities eiler and bertilsson 2004 the composition of both free living and particle attached bacterial communities changed during the accumulation and breakdown phases of a microcystis bloom and differences were also evident with different levels of microcystis biomass li et al 2011 research results have suggested that eco2 could promote phytoplankton productivity schippers et al 2004 therefore the changes in algal density caused by eco2 inevitably affect bacterial community composition and function in eutrophic waters however further study is needed especially regarding how the bacterial community responds to eco2 in terms of co2 assimilation and c decomposition plant cultivation is an alternative method to mitigate the greenhouse effect furthermore it is an effective method for eutrophic water treatment aquatic plant growth can inhibit algal growth and propagation and decrease algal density jin et al 2003 which can be detrimental to increases in doc resulting from algae furthermore it can lead to a decrease in the proportion of algae attached bacteria on the other hand floating aquatic plants could quickly uptake n and p in eutrophic water and they have a much stronger assimilative ability for n than microbes kaye and hart 1997 inselsbacher et al 2010 the well developed roots of floating plants can form a rhizospheric microenvironment by providing adhesion for microbes o2 and high doc ma et al 2014 kosten et al 2016 which may be suitable for certain microbes therefore the eutrophic water environment can differ greatly with and without the growth of floating plants which can trigger changes in bacterial community composition and function there may be interactive effects between eco2 and plant growth on the bacterial community in eutrophic water eco2 could promote the growth of algae zhao et al 2013 and stimulate the growth of algae attached bacteria by providing increased dissolved inorganic carbon dic in eutrophic water on the other hand eco2 could accelerate the growth of plants by enhancing their co2 assimilation körner 2004 and promote doc secretion from roots phillips et al 2011 which could provide more electron donors or energy for heterotrophic bacteria in eutrophic water however floating aquatic plants could inhibit the growth of algae by competing for nutrients and secreting allelochemicals hu and hong 2008 which would lead to a decrease in doc from algae and algae attached bacteria therefore it is unclear how the interactive effects of eco2 and aquatic plant growth alter the bacterial community in eutrophic water and the effects of the interaction between eco2 and aquatic plant growth on bacterial community composition and function associated with c assimilation and decomposition to elucidate these responses we conducted a microcosmic experiment under conditions of ambient co2 concentrations and eco2 aco2 and eco2 400 and 800 μmol mol 1 respectively with or without the growth of the aquatic floating plant eichhornia crassipes mart solms to determine the interactive effects between eco2 and plant growth on the composition diversity and function of the microbial community in eutrophic water the 16s rrna gene sequencing targeting the v3 v4 hypervariable region was applied because of its highest classification accuracy compared to other combinations of variable regions claesson et al 2010 wear et al 2018 based on a literature review we hypothesised that the interactive effects between plant growth and eco2 may have a stronger effect on the bacterial community than either plant growth or eco2 alone as 1 plant growth and eco2 will have contrasting effects on photosynthetic microbes especially algae involved in co2 assimilation 2 plant growth and eco2 will have different mechanisms regulating the bacterial community involved in c decomposition i e eco2 may promote c decomposition via increasing algal density that leads to the propagation of associated heterotrophic bacteria whereas plant growth will weaken the effect of algae but will regulate c decomposition via root activity 3 the growth of plants will have a significant positive relationship with eco2 which may further intensify the above effects and lead to positive or negative interactive effects between eco2 and plant growth on the bacterial community with differing characteristics in eutrophic water this study will help to clarify the underlying microbial mechanism that drives the changes in carbon assimilation and decomposition in eutrophic water resulting from interactions between the eco2 and aquatic plant growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 plants and eutrophic water seedlings of the floating aquatic

plants or the growth of e crassipes under aco2 condition significantly increased the diversity of the bacterial community in eutrophic water p 0 01 however the growth of e crassipes under eco2 condition significantly decreased the diversity of the bacterial community in eutrophic water p 0 01 the two way anova of co2 concentration and plant growth further illustrated that there was a significant negative interaction between co2 concentration and the growth of e crassipes with regard to the reduction in the diversity shannon and simpson indices in the bacterial community p 0 01 3 2 the response of the bacterial community composition involved in the c cycle to eco2 or aquatic plant growth the nmds plot fig 1 anosim and adonis table s2 demonstrated that the bacterial community

rhizobiaceae and the genera gemmobacter comamonas and limnohabitans increased following the eco2 treatment p 0 05 and the relative abundance of the phyla actinobacteria verrucomicrobia orders verrucomicrobiales and rhizobiales and the genus acinetobacter significantly increased at the classification level fig 2 b fig 3 c d fig s3 bacteria involved in co2 assimilation and c decomposition had different responses to the growth of e crassipes in eutrophic water under aco2 condition the relative abundance of photosynthetic bacteria including the phylum chloroflexi class chloroflexia orders chloroflexales and synechococcales and family rhodospirillaceae decreased significantly with the growth of e crassipes under aco2 condition p 0 05 the relative abundance of chemoautotrophic bacteria including the family mycobacteriaceae and genera hydrogenophaga and mycobacterium increased in the beginning day 7 but decreased with plant growth whereas the family nitrosomonadaceae increased with plant growth p 0 05 in addition the relative abundance of bacteria involved in c decomposition significantly increased including the phyla of proteobacteria margulisbacteria fibrobacteres and firmicutes orders bacteroidales and sphingomonadales families sphingomonadaceae pseudomonadaceae and flavobacteriaceae and the genera pseudomonas flavobacterium steroidobacter terrimonas and novosphingobium with the growth of e crassipes under aco2 condition however the abundance of actinobacteria and its subgroups of acidimicrobiia corynebacteriales and frankiales decreased significantly p 0 05 furthermore the relative abundance of root attached bacteria involved in c decomposition was significantly higher than planktonic bacteria in eutrophic water under aco2 condition 3 3 the response of the bacterial community composition involved in the c cycle to interaction effects between eco2 and e crassipes the bacterial community composition in case of the eco2p21d treatment varied significantly from that of the eco221d and aco2p21d treatments as shown by the nmds plot and adonis analysis fig 1 table s2 at the classification level fig 4 the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria and some chemoautotrophic bacteria in the eco2p treatment was lower than that in case of the eco2 treatment including the phylum chloroflexi orders synechococcales

was lower than that in the aco2p treatment p 0 05 according to the two way anova table 2 there was a significant interaction between co2 concentration and the growth of e crassipes with regard to the reduction of the abundance of nitrosomonadaceae plant growth had a stronger effect on bacteria involved in co2 assimilation in the water whereas co2 concentration only had a significant effect on the abundance of the families mycobacteriaceae and nitrosomonadaceae and the genus mycobacterium in addition the relative abundance of most bacteria involved in c decomposition including the phyla of bacteroidetes and acidobacteria orders rhizobiales sphingobacteriales verrucomicrobiales corynebacteriales and gaiellales family rhizobiaceae and genera gemmobacter novosphingobium comamonas and limnobacter was lower in case of the eco2p treatment than in the eco2 treatment p 0 05 the abundance of the phyla planctomycetes and margulisbacteria orders sphingomonadales and gaiellales family

between the co2 concentration and the growth of e crassipes on bacteria involved in c decomposition including the phylum fibrobacteres families fibrobacteraceae flavobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae and genera flavobacterium novosphingobium and gemmobacter 3 4 the effects of eco2 and plant growth on bacterial community function in eutrophic water in eutrophic water without plants the abundance of cbbl bacterial cbbl ia ic and chromophytic algal cbbl id cbbm and pufm genes associated with co2 assimilation and the chia gene related to c decomposition were significantly higher under eco2 than those under the aco2 condition at the end of experiment p 0 05 however another functional gene gh48 related to c decomposition failed to exhibit a significant difference between the aco2 and eco2 treatments fig 5 according to the functional prediction based on 16s rrna fig 6 photoautotrophy anoxygenic photoautotrophy s oxidation and anoxygenic photoautotrophy were enriched in the eco2 treatment whereas chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophy were enriched in the aco2 treatment in addition cellulolysis hydrocarbon degradation and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were enriched in the eco2 treatment the results were consistent with those of the cbbl ia ic cbbl id cbbm pufm and chia genes with the growth of plants the abundance of cbbl bacterial cbbl ia ic and chromophytic algal cbbl id cbbm pufm chia and gh48 genes decreased sharply in eutrophic water under the aco2 condition but were enriched in roots fig 5 according to the functional prediction based on the 16s rrna fig 6 the planktonic bacteria in eutrophic water showed functional enrichment in ligninolysis xylanolysis cellulolysis aliphatic non methane hydrocarbon degradation hydrocarbon degradation aromatic compound degradation and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation with plant growth whereas phototrophy and photoheterotrophy were lessened there was a significant interaction between eco2 and plant growth on the bacterial cbbl ia ic cbbm and pufm functional genes in eutrophic water table s3 from a functional perspective plant growth under the eco2 condition exhibited functional decreases in photoautotrophy anoxygenic photoautotrophy s oxidation and anoxygenic photoautotrophy relative to that of the eco2 and aco2p treatments the results were consistent with the statistical results of the bacterial cbbl ia ic cbbm and pufm functional genes in addition hydrocarbon degradation cellulolysis and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation were reduced in the eco2p treatment fig 6 3 5 the relationship between microbial communities and environmental factors the dbrda analysis at the genus level indicated that ph no2 and doc played a significant role p 0 01 in structuring the bacterial community in eutrophic water without plants whereas n2o and no3 played a vital role p 0 01 in structuring the bacterial community in eutrophic water with the growth of e crassipes fig 7 table s4 the first axis accounted for the effects with or without the growth of e crassipes on bacterial community composition and the second axis accounted for the variation in the bacterial community composition over time on the other hand the dbrda analysis at the genus level indicated that no2 and no3 were very important to the genera gemmobacter acinetobacter pseudomonas and flavobacterium which perform the denitrification and degradation of organic carbon the dic and doc were closely related to the genera azospirillum and tistrella rhodospirillaceae which may be involved in the process of c fixation or decomposition vpa fig 8 a showed that the environmental variables ph n nutrients nh4 no3 no2 n2o and c sources dic doc explained 12 93 25 04 and 7 76 of the variation in the bacterial community composition respectively the n nutrient indices exhibited stronger effects on the bacterial community composition than did the c source indices on the other hand vpa fig 8 b showed that the effects of plant growth e crassipes on bacterial community composition were stronger than that of co2 concentration 4 discussion 4 1 the response of bacterial community involved in co2 assimilation to eco2 our study indicated that proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia firmicutes and chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial phyla in eutrophic water under both eco2 and aco2 conditions fig s4 these were similar to those in the eutrophic river where our experimental water was collected gao et al 2017 and other natural rivers or lakes mueller spitz et al 2009 humbert et al 2009 wu et al 2012 specifically in the surface water of the eutrophic river the species of cyanobacteria the genera microcystis and microcoleus and family rhodospirillaceae were the major photosynthetic bacteria involved in co2 assimilation gao et al 2017 however in our study the order synechococcales classified as oxyphotobacteria and the family rhodospirillaceae exhibited stronger responses to eco2 the results indicated that eco2 may stimulate the activity of some specific photosynthetic bacteria except the genera of microcystis and microcoleus in eutrophic water the increased atomic percentage of di13c in the eutrophic water fig s5 provided more dissolved 13co2 or h13co3 derived from the elevated atmospheric 13co2 for autotrophic microbes and was a prerequisite for the increase in photosynthetic bacteria in addition the increase of the cbbl ia ic cbbl id and cbbm functional genes related to co2 assimilation implied there was greater co2 assimilation under eco2 condition the results of functional genes combined with functional predictions by faprotax indicated that eco2 promoted co2 assimilation by photoautotrophy in our eutrophic water typical chemoautotrophic bacteria involved in co2 assimilation were distributed in the phylum nitrospirae orders nitrospirales and oceanospirillales families mycobacteriaceae roseiflexaceae hydrogenophilaceae and nitrosomonadaceae and genera mycobacterium and hydrogenophaga these also existed in the surface water of eutrophic rivers gao et al 2017 under eco2 condition the relative abundance of these chemoautotrophic bacteria decreased indicating the possible inhibition of their growth by eco2 among these chemoautotrophic bacteria nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospirae nitrospirales were typical nitrifying bacteria which exerted control over nitrification by oxidising ammonia to nitrites and oxidising nitrites to nitrates respectively the decrease in their abundance under eco2 condition indicated the inhibition of nitrification this result was consistent with our previous observation that the transformation rate of nh4 concentration was lower under eco2 condition in eutrophic water when compared to that under aco2 condition shi et al 2019 the rda results showed that ph was the main environmental factor affecting the bacterial community composition in eutrophic water without plants showing an upward trend for the utilisation of dic by algae even under eco2 condition hence increased algal density under eco2 condition may be the main reason for the decrease in the abundance of these chemoautotrophic bacteria e g the resource competition for dic or o2 between chemoautotrophic bacteria and algae or heterotrophic bacteria some studies indicated that ammonia oxidising bacteria aob a type of chemoautotrophic bacteria for nitrification were inferior competitors for some resources e g dic or o2 relative to algae and heterotrophic bacteria belser 1979 risgaard petersen et al 2004 choi et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 observed that the relative abundance of mycobacteriaceae and nitrospira in the 13c labeled functional bacteria decreased during incubation in the small and medium size microcystis aggregate dominated eutrophic water indicating similar competitive results previous studies also revealed that nitrifying bacteria nitrosococcus oxidises nh3 to no2 and nitrospirales oxidises no2 to no3 decreased with increasing pco2 in coastal sediments raulf et al 2015 moreover nitrification rates decreased under ocean acidification beman et al 2011 this may indicate there was a similar effect of eco2 on nitrification in freshwater and marine ecosystems but different major species of ammonia oxidising bacteria were involved in the nitrification process similar results also reported that there was a significant decrease in the abundance of chemoautotrophic bacteria bradyrhizobium roseiflexus and flavisolibacter in soil under eco2 condition lesaulnier et al 2008 yu et al 2016 4 2 the response of the bacterial community involved in c decomposition under eco2 condition in our eutrophic water typical bacteria involved in c decomposition were widely distributed in the phyla of proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and fibrobacteres and their subgroups for example the classes fibrobacteria bacteroidia thermoleophilia acidimicrobiia and acidobacteriia orders fibrobacterales cytophagales chitinophagales sphingomonadales sphingobacteriales and gaiellales families flavobacteriaceae pseudomonadaceae sphingomonadaceae comamonadaceae and chitinophagaceae and the genera flavobacterium alsobacter novosphingobium pseudomonas and acinetobacter this was consistent with the bacterial community composition observed in the surface water of the eutrophic river gao et al 2017 some of which were typical denitrifying bacteria among these bacteria the relative abundance of acidimicrobiia thermoleophilia class gaiellales order and comamonas and acinetobacter genera had a significantly stronger response to eco2 in addition the relative abundance of gemmobacter genus whose members are important denitrifying bacteria wang et al 2019 increased significantly under eco2 condition but this genus was not observed in the surface water of the eutrophic river furthermore the chia gene associated with c decomposition and functional prediction indicated that eco2 increased the abundance of the bacteria involved in c decomposition showing functional enrichment in hydrocarbon degradation cellulolysis and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation acidimicrobiia thermoleophilia and gaiellales classified as actinobacteria have cellulose decomposition characteristics de menezes et al 2015 the algal cell consists of a microfibrillar phase which is composed mostly of cellulose xylan or mannan tsekos 1999 therefore it is reasonable to predict that a high abundance of these bacteria may be closely related to algal decomposition in addition to degrading liable carbon most species of gemmobacter comamonas and acinetobacter are efficient in denitrification huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 implying greater denitrification the results were consistent with our previous observation that the abundance of functional genes associated with denitrification increased in the eutrophic water under the eco2 condition shi et al 2019 4 3 the response of the bacterial community involved in the c cycle to the growth of e crassipes the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria chloroflexi synechococcales and rhodospirillaceae in eutrophic water decreased with the growth of e crassipes because of the competition for light between plants and photosynthetic bacteria however the abundance of some chemoautotrophic bacteria increased at first and then decreased during the plant s growth period in eutrophic water except for the nitrifying bacteria nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospirae the increase in the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae and nitrospirae implied increased nitrification as well as no3 accumulation with the growth of e crassipes shi et al 2019 under the eco2 condition the growth of e crassipes also led to a significant reduction in the abundance of most photosynthetic and chemoautotrophic bacteria suggesting that plant growth had a stronger effect on most autotrophic bacteria in the eutrophic water than the eco2 although the growth of e crassipes inhibited algal propagation and thereby decreased the bacteria attached to algae its roots provided attachment sites and o2 for chemoautotrophic bacteria previous studies showed that plant root exudates significantly shaped rhizospheric bacterial community structure and bacteria related to root exudate assimilation e g sphingobacteriales sphingomonadales rhizobiales and myxococcus colonised roots of wheat maize rape and barrel clover el zahar haichar et al 2008 sphingobacteriales sphingomonadales and rhizobiaceae were also found on rice roots or in its rhizosphere and incorporated plant derived carbon qiu et al 2009 hernández et al 2015 the results were consistent with ours in that the abundance of sphingobacteriales sphingobacteriaceae sphingomonadales sphingomonadaceae and rhizobiales increased in the eutrophic water with the growth of e crassipes and were especially enriched on the rhizoplane the sphingobacteriaceae classified as sphingobacteriales which have the ability to degrade lignocellulose use available polycyclic or monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons basta et al 2005 wilhelm et al 2019 the sphingomonadales have genes encoding glycoside hydrolases vandana et al 2017 and some genera of rhizobiales were commonly detected in the heavy dna fraction of 13c labeled residues or cellulose fan et al 2014 these bacteria were all associated with root exudates or root degradation el zahar haichar et al 2008 this may indicate that there was a similar bacterial community enriched on roots of terrestrial and aquatic plants which was responsible for c utilisation derived from plants in addition some specific bacteria associated with c decomposition the phyla proteobacteria firmicutes fibrobacteres order bacteroidales and genera steroidobacter and terrimonas increased in abundance with the growth of e crassipes and were accompanied by functional enrichment in ligninolysis xylanolysis cellulolysis and hydrocarbon degradation this suggests that the increase in bacteria for decomposition of complex carbon compounds was associated with rhizodegradation furthermore the abundance of acidimicrobiia corynebacteriales and frankiales classified as actinobacteria significantly decreased with the growth of e crassipes this could be closely related to the obvious reduction of algae caused by e crassipes growth 4 4 the interactive effects between eco2 and e crassipes on the bacterial community involved in the c cycle our results clearly revealed that the interaction between eco2 and growth of e crassipes led to a significant reduction in the abundance of cbbl ia ic and cbbm functional genes and some nitrifying bacteria involved in co2 assimilation nitrosomonadaceae under eco2 condition the abundance of cbbl ia ic and cbbm genes increased whereas the family nitrosomonadaceae decreased in eutrophic water without plants however the growth of e crassipes under the aco2 condition led to a significant decline in cbbl ia ic and cbbm gene abundance whereas there was an increase in the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae although eco2 and e crassipes alone showed opposite effects on the changes in the abundance of cbbl ia ic cbbm genes and nitrosomonadaceae the growth of e crassipes under the eco2 condition led to a reduction in the abundance of cbbl ia ic cbbm genes and nitrosomonadaceae this suggests that eco2 had a stronger effect on changes in nitrosomonadaceae whereas plant growth had a stronger effect on cbbl ia ic and cbbm genes this indicates that the interactive effect between eco2 and the growth of e crassipes may depend on different bacterial functions nevertheless the decrease of functional genes cbbl ia ic and cbbm and some nitrifying bacteria under the interaction of eco2 and growth of e crassipes did not necessarily indicate reduced co2 assimilation throughout the entire eutrophic water ecosystem the photosynthesis of aquatic plants could make an important contribution to co2 fixation under the eco2 condition körner 2004 our results also revealed the interaction between eco2 and the growth of e crassipes on the reduction of the abundance of some bacteria involved in c decomposition in eutrophic water e g phylum fibrobacteres families fibrobacteriaceae flavobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae and genera flavobacterium novosphingobium and gemmobacter the decrease in the relative abundance of these bacteria may be caused by improved plant growth and less root degradation under the eco2 condition körner 2004 because the growth of e crassipes increased the relative abundance of these bacteria under the aco2 condition and the eco2 had only a minor effect on these bacteria in water without plants the synergistic effect between eco2 and e crassipes could be the main reason for the reduction of bacteria involved in c decomposition in water although some studies indicated that eco2 could increase microbial biomass and root turnover of some terrestrial plants and cellobiohydrolase activity lipson et al 2005 chung et al 2007 other studies have shown that eco2 decreased the microbial biomass with the growth of the herbs vulpia michrostachys and lolium multiflorumin and reduced fine root mortality in the woody plants in quercus spp zak et al 2000 this implied that plant species played a critical role in the shifts in the microbial community under the eco2 condition the effects of eco2 on the aquatic plant mediated changes of the microbial community deserve further research to reach a more definite conclusion such as the interaction effects between eco2 and other species of the floating aquatic plants on the alteration of bacteria involved in c decomposition in eutrophic water fibrobacteres is an important bacterial degrader of lignocellulosic materials ransom jones et al 2012 sphingomonadaceae was observed to have cellulolytic and chitinolytic capabilities sly et al 1999 xie et al 2007 flavobacteriaceae was involved in the degradation of the high molecular mass fraction of dissolved organic matter and several biopolymers saha and chakrabarti 2006 the shift in microbial community composition may reflect changes in microbial function this implied that the growth of e crassipes under eco2 condition would result in less c decomposition in eutrophic water in addition a further decrease in the relative abundance of nitrosomonadaceae with nitrification function and members of sphingomonadaceae flavobacteriaceae and gemmobacter with denitrification functions mills et al 2008 zhu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 suggested the reduction in nitrification and denitrification in eutrophic water under the interactive effects of eco2 and e crassipes this was beneficial in the reduction of n2o emissions as shown in our recently published paper shi et al 2019 therefore cultivation of floating aquatic plants e crassipes under eco2 condition could alter the sink source relationship of c and n in eutrophic water leading to enhanced c sequestration but reduced n2o emission if plants could be harvested before senescence 5 conclusions in this study underlying microbial mechanisms that drove the changes in carbon assimilation and decomposition in eutrophic water under the eco2 condition as well as plant growth and their interactions were investigated through 16s rrna gene sequencing function prediction and q pcr we demonstrated that the eco2 condition significantly increased the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria and the cbbl ia ic cbbl id cbbm and pufm genes showing functional enrichment in photoautotrophy whereas the abundance of some chemoautotrophic bacteria decreased including nitrifying bacteria furthermore the eco2 condition increased the abundance of bacteria and functional genes associated with c decomposition indicating functional enrichment of hydrocarbon degradation cellulolysis and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation cultivation of the floating aquatic plant e crassipes decreased the abundance of photosynthetic bacteria but increased bacteria involved in complex c decomposition associated with root exudates and degradation the eco2 condition and growth of e crassipes had a significant positive relationship with opposite effects on the algal density in eutrophic water creating interactive effects that further decreased the diversity of the bacterial community the abundance of some co2 assimilating bacteria with nitrifying characteristics and some c degrading bacteria with denitrifying characteristics the interactions between aquatic plants and the bacterial community in eutrophic water under the eco2 condition could be beneficial in the alleviation of greenhouse effect declaration

18196,nitrate no3 affected perchlorate clo4 reduction in a membrane batch biofilm reactor mbbr even though the electron donor ch4 was available well in excess of its demand for example the perchlorate reduction rate was 1 7 mmol m2 d when perchlorate was the sole electron acceptor but it dropped to 0 64 mmol m2 d when nitrate also was present the perchlorate reduction rate returned to 1 60 mmol m2 d after all nitrate was consumed denitratisoma and azospirillum were main genera involved in perchlorate and nitrate reduction and both could utilize no3 and clo4 as electron acceptors results of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr showed that transcript abundances of nitrate reductase narg nitrite reductase nirs and perchlorate reductase pcra increased when the perchlorate and nitrate concentrations were higher specifically pcra transcripts correlated to the sum of perchlorate and nitrate rather than perchlorate individually analysis based on density functional theory dft suggests that bacteria able to utilize both acceptors preferred no3 over clo4 due to nitrate reduction having lower energy barriers for proton and electron transfers graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate competition perchlorate reductase reversible inhibition membrane batch biofilm reactor 1 introduction perchlorate clo4 bioreduction is an effective water remediation strategy perchlorate reducing bacteria prb reduce clo4 or chlorate clo3 to chlorite clo2 by perchlorate reductase pcrabcd and then clo2 is disproportionated to cl and o2 by chlorite dismutase cld butler et al 2010 the supplied electron donor for perchlorate reduction often is an organic compound such as methanol and acetate bardiya and bae 2011 coates 2004 inorganic donors such as h2 and s also are able to drive perchlorate reduction ju et al 2007 nerenberg et al 2002 moreover researchers recently reported that prb are able to reduce perchlorate using methane as the electron donor luo 2015 lv et al 2019 xie et al 2018 a frequent co contaminated with clo4 is nitrate no3 and its bioreduction called denitrification has been studied extensively denitrifiers reduce no3 to n2 stepwise no3 to no2 by nitrate reductase nar or nap no2 to nitric oxide no by a copper or a cytochrome dependent no2 reductase nirk or nirs no to nitrous oxide n2o by no reductase nor and n2o to n2 by n2o reductase nos richardson et al 2001 numerous of prb are able to reduce nitrate and nitrite as respiratory electron acceptors choi and silverstein 2008 okeke et al 2002 in early studies researchers found that perchlorate and nitrate reductions were catalyzed by the nonspecific nitrate reductase herman and frankenberger 1999 roldán et al 1994 however wolterink et al 2002 reported that the chlorate reducing bacteria pseudomonas chloritidismutans sp nov could not reduce nitrate indicating the existence of diverse perchlorate reduction pathways xu et al 2004 certified that related enzymes for perchlorate and nitrate reduction were separately expressed in azospira sp kj and this situation was called a two substrate induced enzyme system in this system reduction pathways of clo4 and no3 were not constitutive but individually induced by the respective compound clo4 or clo3 and no3 small amounts of no3 may have accelerated clo4 reduction once the no3 was completely removed studies have shown that no3 is more rapidly utilized compared to clo4 due to the enzymatic specificity rather than thermodynamics nerenberg 2013 recently youngblut et al 2016 found that the pcra enzyme had a relatively higher substrate affinity k m and lower catalysis rate k cat for perchlorate than nitrate which means prb could utilize lower concentration of substrate perchlorate lower k m but catalyze nitrate more quickly higher k cat when perchlorate and nitrate coexisted while pcra and narg could catalyze perchlorate to chlorite only cld could disproportionate the chlorite here a methane based biofilm batch reactor mbbr was applied to explore the nitrate effect on perchlorate reduction we studied the reduction patterns of perchlorate and nitrate when the electron donor ch4 supply was sufficient how the microbial community adapted to a nitrate shock was investigated using high throughput sequencing phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust also was employed to identity changes in the presence of genes for functional enzymes the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr also was used to evaluate transcript abundance of key functional enzymes with or without nitrate present the presence and expression of respiratory enzymes interpreted using density functional theory dft reveals the mechanism underlying competition between perchlorate and nitrate reductions in the methane based mbbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbbr startup and operation the mbbr system was the same as that in lv et al 2019 the total volume of the bottle was 1 l one main set of 32 composite hollow fibers model mhf 200tl mitsubishi ltd japan received ch4 gas and the second set served as biofilm sampling port the total surface of membrane was about 76 cm2 all these fibers were glued together and sealed within norprene tubing model a 60 g 16 saint gobain france the ch4 pressure was maintained at 15 psig 2 07 atm and the temperature was 35 1 c during the whole experiment about 700 ml mineral salt medium in the mbbr was de gassed with argon gas ar for 25 min to maintain an anaerobic condition dissolved o2 in medium was measured with a dissolved

to perform anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to perchlorate reduction anmo pr and we enriched the biofilm by adding mineral salt medium containing 18 mg l clo4 for microbial adaptation after the first batch of perchlorate was removed stage 1 we added 18 mg l clo4 and 15 mg l no3 in stage 2 in stage 3 about 36 mg l clo4 and no3 were added respectively to investigate nitrate effect on perchlorate reduction at a higher concentration level in stage 4 36 mg l perchlorate was added individually to estimate perchlorate reduction after the nitrate shock actual concentrations were measured and are shown in fig 1 in results and discussion 2 2 chemical analyses liquid samples were sampled from the mbbr with 2 ml syringes and filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm membrane filter pes green union uk every three days after the reactor reached steady state we used ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 usa to measure clo4 as 16 column eluent concentration of 40 mm koh and a 1 ml min flow rate and reduction products clo3 clo2 and cl as 19 column with the eluent concentration of 20 mm koh and a 1 ml min flow rate no3 and no2 were detected using an as 11 column with the eluent concentration of 10 mm koh and a 1 ml min flow rate the detection limits of clo4 clo3 clo2 were 0 1 mg l while that of cl no3 no2 were 0 01 mg l the ph was measured by a portable ph meter seven2go mettler toledo switzerland and adjusted by hcl to maintain 7 0 7 5 in all stages o2 in the headspace was collected in a gas sampling bag single valve delin china and measured with gas chromatography 7890a agilent technologies inc u s a the gas phase concentration of o2 was used to calculate the dissolved oxygen concentration in liquid phase according to henry s law zhang and siepmann 2006 2 3 biofilm sampling and bioinformatic analysis all biomass samples were taken in an anaerobic glove box yqx ii cimo china to avoid any o2 permeation we cut off three 3 cm sections from the middle and two ends of the coupon fiber as duplicates and then combined them together for subsequent operation the left hollow fibers were knotted in the end by manually sealed them with an epoxy adhesive ec 2216 3m company usa at last in order to reduce the interference on the biofilm we took biomass samples at different times according to its usage the biomass samples taken at day 9 18 26 48 61 and 87 were for rt pcr analysis while the samples taken at day 9 stage 1 26 stage 2 and 67 stage 3 were for microbial community and the predicted genes analyses dna was extracted using the power soil dna isolation kit qiagen usa primers 341f and 806r were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna gene in v3 and v4 regions gregory et al 2010 the purified amplicons were send to novogene company beijing china to process illumina miseq sequencing with standard protocols the sequencing data were processed using qiime version 1 7 0 as described by zhao et al 2014 we also used picrust to predict the metagenomic functional composition for all samples based on the 16s data in the latest kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database as described by langille et al 2013 and lai et al 2018 to explore whether a functional gene was enriched in the mbbr at stage 1 3 compared with the inoculum we calculated odds ratios according to zhou et al 2016 2 4 rna extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr rt pcr was employed to analyze mrna expression associated with the reduction of perchlorate and nitrate rna of biofilm samples were extracted using the power soil rna

mcra all pcr reactions had three replicates and the data were analyzed with the methods of livak and schmittgen 2001 the primer names primer sequences and pcr conditions for each target gene are in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 reversible inhibition of nitrate on perchlorate reduction fig 1 shows clo4 and no3 reductions in the mbbr fed with ch4 as the electron donor throughout the four stages the delivery capacity of ch4 was far in excess of stoichiometric demands for each stage table s2 tang et al 2012 take into account the back diffusion perez calleja et al 2017 we measured ch4 in the gas sampling bag every few days and found ch4 was always sufficient there were no intermediates clo3 or clo2 accumulated the final clo4 reduction product cl proportionally increased in parallel to clo4 reductions 89 of the theoretical cl yield reinforcing that the perchlorate was reduced completely gao et al 2015 in stage 1 about 18 mg l of clo4 was reduced to below the detection level 0 1 mg l within 10 days the reduction rate of clo4 in stage 1 was 1 66 mmol m2 d however it rapidly decreased to 0 64 mmol m2 d when 15 mg l no3 was added in the beginning of stage 2a for comparison no3 was reduced at the rate of 2 76 mmol m2 d in stage 2a after no3 was consumed completely the reduction rate of clo4 increased back to 1 68 mmol m2 d stage 2b similarly when clo4 and no3 co existed at higher influent concentrations of 36 mg l in stage 3 no3 was fully reduced within 21 days at a rate of 2 54 mmol m2 d after no3 was completely reduced the clo4 reduction rate increased from 0 53 mmol m2 d stage 3a to 1 60 mmol m2 d stage 3b the results clearly show that nitrate could reversibly inhibit perchlorate reduction in the methane fed biofilm this trend might due to the enriched microorganisms preferentially utilizing no3 when clo4 and no3 coexist zhao et al 2011 reported no3 reduction was superior to clo4 reduction when electron donor h2 was limiting xu et al 2004 stated that both no3 and clo3 reduction pathways were individually induced by the respective substrate the reversibly inhibition of no3 on clo3 reduction was attributed to the competition of induction when substrate no3 and clo3 coexisted in stage 4 the perchlorate reduction rate reached 2 03 mmol m2 d probably because the high loadings of perchlorate and nitrate in stage 3 increased the reduction capacity of the biofilm gal et al 2008 xu et al 2004 found that nitrate promoted perchlorate reduction once the nitrate was completely consumed since microbes could grow more biomass through nitrate reduction coates 2004 3 2 microbial community adapted to nitrate bacterial abundances in the biofilm changed remarkably at the order level fig 2 a as did the relative abundances of the key bacterial genera fig 2b the relative abundance of methanotroph methylococcus accounted for about 58 in stage 1 but sharply decreased to 26 and 7 in stages 2 and 3 respectively the abundance of methylocystis dropped from 12 to less than 1 in the same timeframe the decrease of methanotrophs probably was due to the long term operation without oxygen in the mbbr zhong et al 2017 found that the methanotrophs rapidly decreased in a ch4 based cr reducing membrane biofilm reactor during operation when no oxygen was available in contrast to the methanotrophs rhodocyclales which includes many of denitrifiers and perchlorate reducing bacteria prb was enriched from 5 in stage 1 18 in stage 3 denitratisoma a genus of rhodocyclales reached 7 at the end of stage 3 denitratisoma is phylogenetically close to the well known prb azospira and dechloromonas and it can utilize nitrate nitrite perchlorate and chlorate as electron acceptors oren 2014 another well known prb azospirillum which can completely reduce clo4 to cl increased from 1 stage 1 to 8 stage 3 thus higher loadings of clo4 and no3 significantly enriched prb and denitrifiers as they did in work reported by logan and lapoint 2002 another enriched bacteria ignavibateriales was widely found in the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems ontiveros valencia et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the abundance of order ignavibateriales increased from 6 stage 1 to 26 stage 3 while ignavibacterium the single genus of ignavibateriales was 0 1 in all stages in view of the existence of sulfate in our system we reckoned that ignavibateriales may use h2s and s0 sulfate reducing products as electron donors for autotrophic denitrification when nitrate was added 3 3 functional enzyme genes prediction based on picrust to explore the roles of functional enzymes we applied picrust to predict the metagenomic functional enzymes present in biofilms of all stages based on the high throughput sequencing analysis of the 16s rdna gene picrust results are shown in fig 3 and table s3 because no specific perchlorate reductase gene is included in the kegg pathway database the genes of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso reductase heme dependent oxidoreductase and cytochrome c reductase which are related to perchlorate reduction process were used to assess the potential for perchlorate reduction nerenberg 2013 all three genes increased in stages 2 and 3 in parallel higher numbers of predicted genes related to denitrification nitrate reductase nitrite reductase and nitrous oxide reductase were much higher in stages 2 and 3 than that in stage 1 which is consistent with the increased no3 removal these trends support that perchlorate reductase and nitrate reductase likely were responsible for clo4 and no3 reductions bardiya and bae 2011 nerenberg 2013 genes that encode a protein for the electron transport complex which plays a significant role in dissimilatory respiration of perchlorate and nitrate also were enriched as more nitrate was added in stages 2 and 3 lai et al 2014 2016 predicted key genes related to reverse methanogesis for example methylmalonyl coa mutase and f420 hydrogenase were enriched compared with the inoculum especially in stage 3 this provides indirect evidence that reverse methanogesis was involved in driving perchlorate and nitrate reduction xie et al 2018 3 4 transcriptional activities of the functional enzymes in parallel to the picrust analysis we did rt qpcr to evaluate the transcriptional activities of the functional enzymes fig 4 shows the transcript abundance of narg nirs pcra and mcra in all stages as well as the amount of reduced electron acceptors the transcript abundance of mcra reported to be able to oxidize methane anaerobically xie et al 2018 always was proportional to the generation of total reduced electron acceptors the trend of transcript abundance of narg and nirs were similar to each other though all stages significantly enriched when nitrate was introduced in stage 2a but decreased after nitrate was fully reduced in stage 2b the narg and nirs transcript abundances reached peaks of 4 7 1013 and 5 7 1011 copies m2 when 0 17 mmol nitrate was re introduced in stage 3a but rapidly dropped to 1 8 1012 and 9 2 1010 copies m2 after nitrate was all consumed in stage 3b the narg and nirs transcript abundances continued to decrease in stage 4 as blue solid arrow pointed showing a weak correlation between narg nirs and clo4 removal and suggesting that narg nirs played a relatively small role in perchlorate reduction in the mbbr the extremely poor affinity of narg for perchlorate k m 1060 μm also supports that narg has a weak perchlorate reduction capacity youngblut et al 2016 the transcript abundance of pcra increased from stage 1 to stage 3a following the increase in total reduced electron acceptors clo4 and no3 analysis with a pearson correlation matrix table s4 showed that the transcript abundance of pcra was better linked to the sum amount of clo4 and no3 rather than clo4 individually this is logical because most prbs are able to utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor bardiya and bae 2011 moreover the transcript abundance of pcra slightly decreased to 9 7 1011 copies m2 when no3 was removed completely in stage 3b but then returned to 6 5 1012 copies m2 in stage 4 as green solid arrow pointed these results support that nitrate was primarily responsible for the transcription of pcra this is consistent with gal et al 2008 who reported that nitrate could expand the perchlorate reduction capacity by stimulating the expression of pcra and youngblut et al 2016 who confirmed that pcra possessed a higher catalyze rate for no3 k cat 51 e 1 min 1 than for clo4 k cat 27 1 e 1 min 1 together with previous studies these results indicate that bacteria consumed nitrate preferentially when no3 and clo4 coexisted in fact pcra and narg belong to the dmso reductase super family and share the same molybdenum mo cofactor the only structural differences between pcra and narg being the sequence of the n terminal of the β subunit and the existence of selenite seo3 in the perchlorate reductase youngblut et al 2016 recently sun and chen 2019 assumed a minimal energy pathway for perchlorate reduction based on density functional theory dft as shown in fig s1 they demonstrated that the reduction of perchlorate in pcra occurs through a very fast o cl bond breaking to regenerate clo3 and the movi o intermediate which is then followed by the rate limiting proton coupled electron transfer process here we compared the pathways of perchlorate and nitrate reduction catalyzed by pcra and narg respectively laughlin et al 2007 silaghi dumitrescu et al 2012 sun and chen 2019 tenderholt et al 2010 xie and cao 2010 the dft analysis is shown in fig 5 reducing no3 to no2 and clo4 to clo3 is carried out by a molybdenum mo dependent reductase following two main steps ① x o x stand for cl or n bond breaking ts1 and ② proton coupled electron transfer ts2 in the first step no3 directly bounds to the mo center which causes the n o bond length to increase from 1 265 to 1 792 å along with the stretching vibration of mo o and n o the activation barrier for n o bond breaking is 12 6 kcal mol 1 in the liquid phase xie and cao 2010 but that of the cl o bond is only 3 0 kcal mol 1 pandiyan et al 2010 in the second step the proton and electron transfers are much difficult for perchlorate reduction compared with nitrate reduction the movi o needs 18 kcal mol energy to release h2o and clo3 which bounds to the mo center and causes cl o to break and gives movi o reduction on the other hand nitrate reduction by pcra has a higher energy barrier in proton coupled electron transfer processes than the reduction by narg it may result from the structural superiority of energy saving membrane of narg in summary the priority of proton and electron transfer in movi o reduction allows nitrate to outcompete perchlorate in the competition for narg and pcra which is consistent with the results of dynamics and functional enzymes discussed previously 4 conclusion studying the effects of nitrate on perchlorate reduction in a methane based mbbr we found these three main phenomena no3 had reversible inhibition towards clo4 reduction as it was reduced preferentially when no3 and clo4 coexisted the denitrifier denitratisoma and the prb azospirillum were the most strongly enriched genera involved in perchlorate and nitrate reduction both utilized nitrate preferentially over perchlorate since narg and pcra catalyzed nitrate reduction more rapidly than perchlorate reduction the priority of no3 in competition with clo4 may be caused by the lower energy needed by narg and pcra for proton and electron transfers in nitrate reduction compared to perchlorate reduction these findings may not only reveal the deep reason of the effect of nitrate and perchlorate s bio reduction to each other but also provides valuable information for actual nitrate and perchlorate removal in wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18196,nitrate no3 affected perchlorate clo4 reduction in a membrane batch biofilm reactor mbbr even though the electron donor ch4 was available well in excess of its demand for example the perchlorate reduction rate was 1 7 mmol m2 d when perchlorate was the sole electron acceptor but it dropped to 0 64 mmol m2 d when nitrate also was present the perchlorate reduction rate returned to 1 60 mmol m2 d after all nitrate was consumed denitratisoma and azospirillum were main genera involved in perchlorate and nitrate reduction and both could utilize no3 and clo4 as electron acceptors results of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr showed that transcript abundances of nitrate reductase narg nitrite reductase nirs and perchlorate reductase pcra increased when the perchlorate and nitrate concentrations were higher specifically pcra transcripts correlated to the sum of perchlorate and nitrate rather than perchlorate individually analysis based on density functional theory dft suggests that bacteria able to utilize both acceptors preferred no3 over clo4 due to nitrate reduction having lower energy barriers for proton and electron transfers graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate competition perchlorate reductase reversible inhibition membrane batch biofilm reactor 1 introduction perchlorate clo4 bioreduction is an effective water remediation strategy perchlorate reducing bacteria prb reduce clo4 or chlorate clo3 to chlorite clo2 by perchlorate reductase pcrabcd and then clo2 is disproportionated to cl and o2 by chlorite dismutase cld butler et al 2010 the supplied electron donor for perchlorate reduction often is an organic compound such as methanol and acetate bardiya and bae 2011 coates 2004 inorganic donors such as h2 and s also are able to drive perchlorate reduction ju et al 2007 nerenberg et al 2002 moreover researchers recently reported that prb are able to reduce perchlorate using methane as the electron donor luo 2015 lv et al 2019 xie et al 2018 a frequent co contaminated with clo4 is nitrate no3 and its bioreduction called denitrification has been studied extensively denitrifiers reduce no3 to n2 stepwise no3 to no2 by nitrate reductase nar or nap no2 to nitric oxide no by a copper or a cytochrome dependent no2 reductase nirk or nirs no to nitrous oxide n2o by no reductase nor and n2o to n2 by n2o reductase nos richardson et al 2001 numerous of prb are able to reduce nitrate and nitrite as respiratory electron acceptors choi and silverstein 2008 okeke et al 2002 in early studies researchers found that perchlorate and nitrate reductions were catalyzed by the nonspecific nitrate reductase herman and frankenberger 1999 roldán et al 1994 however wolterink et al 2002 reported that the chlorate reducing bacteria pseudomonas chloritidismutans sp nov could not reduce nitrate indicating the existence of diverse perchlorate reduction pathways xu et al 2004 certified that related enzymes for perchlorate and nitrate reduction were separately expressed in azospira sp kj and this situation was called a two substrate induced enzyme system in this system reduction pathways of clo4 and no3 were not constitutive but individually induced by the respective compound clo4 or clo3 and no3 small amounts of no3 may have accelerated clo4 reduction once the no3 was completely removed studies have shown that no3 is more rapidly utilized compared to clo4 due to the enzymatic specificity rather than thermodynamics nerenberg 2013 recently youngblut et al 2016 found that the pcra enzyme had a relatively higher substrate affinity k m and lower catalysis rate k cat for perchlorate than nitrate which means prb could utilize lower concentration of substrate perchlorate lower k m but catalyze nitrate more quickly higher k cat when perchlorate and nitrate coexisted while pcra and narg could catalyze perchlorate to chlorite only cld could disproportionate the chlorite here a methane based biofilm batch reactor mbbr was applied to explore the nitrate effect on perchlorate reduction we studied the reduction patterns of perchlorate and nitrate when the electron donor ch4 supply was sufficient how the microbial community adapted to a nitrate shock was investigated using high throughput sequencing phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust also was employed to identity changes in the presence of genes for functional enzymes the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr also was used to evaluate transcript abundance of key functional enzymes with or without nitrate present the presence and expression of respiratory enzymes interpreted using density functional theory dft reveals the mechanism underlying competition between perchlorate and nitrate reductions in the methane based mbbr 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbbr startup and operation the mbbr system was the same as that in lv et al 2019 the total volume of the bottle was 1 l one main set of 32 composite hollow fibers model mhf 200tl mitsubishi ltd japan received ch4 gas and the second set served as biofilm sampling port the total surface of membrane was about 76 cm2 all these fibers were glued together and sealed within norprene tubing model a 60 g 16 saint gobain france the ch4 pressure was maintained at 15 psig 2 07 atm and the temperature was 35 1 c during the whole experiment about 700 ml mineral salt medium in the mbbr was de gassed with argon gas ar for 25 min to maintain an anaerobic condition dissolved o2 in medium was measured with a dissolved oxygen probe starter model 300d ohaus instruments company germany after degassing and the concentration was 30 μg l the medium contained per l of demineralized water nahco3 0 3 g cacl2 1 mg mgso4 7h2o

to perform anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to perchlorate reduction anmo pr and we enriched the biofilm by adding mineral salt medium containing 18 mg l clo4 for microbial adaptation after the first batch of perchlorate was removed stage 1 we added 18 mg l clo4 and 15 mg l no3 in stage 2 in stage 3 about 36 mg l clo4 and no3 were added respectively to investigate nitrate effect on perchlorate reduction at a higher concentration level in stage 4 36 mg l perchlorate was added individually to estimate perchlorate reduction after the nitrate shock actual concentrations were measured and are shown in fig 1 in results and discussion 2 2 chemical analyses liquid samples were sampled from the mbbr with 2 ml syringes and filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm membrane filter pes green union uk every three days after the reactor reached steady state we used ion chromatography dionex ics 1000 usa to measure clo4 as 16 column eluent concentration of 40 mm koh and a 1 ml min flow rate and reduction products clo3 clo2 and cl as 19 column with the eluent concentration of 20 mm koh and a 1 ml min flow rate no3 and no2 were detected using an as 11 column with the eluent concentration of 10 mm koh and a 1 ml min flow rate the detection limits of clo4 clo3 clo2 were 0 1 mg l while that of cl no3 no2 were 0 01 mg l the ph was measured by a portable ph meter seven2go mettler toledo switzerland and adjusted by hcl to maintain 7 0 7 5 in all stages o2 in the headspace was collected in a gas sampling bag single valve delin china and measured with gas chromatography 7890a agilent technologies inc u s a the gas phase concentration of o2 was used to calculate the dissolved oxygen concentration in liquid phase according to henry s law zhang and siepmann 2006 2 3 biofilm sampling and bioinformatic analysis all biomass samples were taken in an anaerobic glove box yqx ii cimo china to avoid any o2 permeation we cut off three 3 cm sections from the middle and two ends of the coupon fiber as duplicates and then combined them together for subsequent operation the left hollow fibers were knotted in the end by manually sealed them with an epoxy adhesive ec 2216 3m company usa at last in order to reduce the interference on the biofilm we took biomass samples at different times according to its usage the biomass samples taken at day 9 18 26 48 61 and 87 were for rt pcr analysis while the samples taken at day 9 stage 1 26 stage 2 and 67 stage 3 were for microbial community and the predicted genes analyses dna was extracted using the power soil dna isolation kit qiagen usa primers 341f and 806r were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna gene in v3 and v4 regions gregory et al 2010 the purified amplicons were send to novogene company beijing china to process illumina miseq sequencing with standard protocols the sequencing data were processed using qiime version 1 7 0 as described by zhao et al 2014 we also used picrust to predict the metagenomic functional composition for all samples based on the 16s data in the latest kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database as described by langille et al 2013 and lai et al 2018 to explore whether a functional gene was enriched in the mbbr at stage 1 3 compared with the inoculum we calculated odds ratios according to zhou et al 2016 2 4 rna extraction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr rt pcr was employed to analyze mrna expression associated with the reduction of perchlorate and nitrate rna of biofilm samples were extracted using the power soil rna

primer 1 μl reverse primer and 10 μl sybr qpcr mix we used primers that targeted the perchlorate reductase gene pcra nitrate reductase narg nitrite reductase nirs and methyl coenzyme m reductase gene mcra all pcr reactions had three replicates and the data were analyzed with the methods of livak and schmittgen 2001 the primer names primer sequences and pcr conditions for each target gene are in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 reversible inhibition of nitrate on perchlorate reduction fig 1 shows clo4 and no3 reductions in the mbbr fed with ch4 as the electron donor throughout the four stages the delivery capacity of ch4 was far in excess of stoichiometric demands for each stage table s2 tang et al 2012 take into account the back diffusion perez calleja et al 2017 we measured ch4 in the gas sampling bag every few days and found ch4 was always sufficient there were no intermediates clo3 or clo2 accumulated the final clo4 reduction product cl proportionally increased in parallel to clo4 reductions 89 of the theoretical cl yield reinforcing that the perchlorate was reduced completely gao et al 2015 in stage 1 about 18 mg l of clo4 was reduced to below the detection level 0 1 mg l within 10 days the reduction rate of clo4 in stage 1 was 1 66 mmol m2 d however it rapidly decreased to 0 64 mmol m2 d when 15 mg l no3 was added in the beginning of stage 2a for comparison no3 was reduced at the rate of 2 76 mmol m2 d in stage 2a after no3 was consumed completely the reduction rate of clo4 increased back to 1 68 mmol m2 d stage 2b similarly when clo4 and no3 co existed at higher influent concentrations of 36 mg l in stage 3 no3 was fully reduced within 21 days at a rate of 2 54 mmol m2 d after no3 was completely reduced the clo4 reduction rate increased from 0 53 mmol m2 d stage 3a to 1 60 mmol m2 d stage 3b the results clearly show that nitrate could reversibly inhibit perchlorate reduction in the methane fed biofilm this trend might due to the enriched microorganisms preferentially utilizing no3 when clo4 and no3 coexist zhao et al 2011 reported no3 reduction was superior to clo4 reduction when electron donor h2 was limiting xu et al 2004 stated that both no3 and clo3 reduction pathways were individually induced by the respective substrate the reversibly inhibition of no3 on clo3 reduction was attributed to the competition of induction when substrate no3 and clo3 coexisted in stage 4 the perchlorate reduction rate reached 2 03 mmol m2 d probably because the high loadings of perchlorate and nitrate in stage 3 increased the reduction capacity of the biofilm gal et al 2008 xu et al 2004 found that nitrate promoted perchlorate reduction once the nitrate was completely consumed since microbes could grow more biomass through nitrate reduction coates 2004 3 2 microbial community adapted to nitrate bacterial abundances in the biofilm changed remarkably at the order level fig 2 a as did the relative abundances of the key bacterial genera fig 2b the relative abundance of methanotroph methylococcus accounted for about 58 in stage 1 but sharply decreased to 26 and 7 in stages 2 and 3 respectively the abundance of methylocystis dropped from 12 to less than 1 in the same timeframe the decrease of methanotrophs probably was due to the long term operation without oxygen in the mbbr zhong et al 2017 found that the methanotrophs rapidly decreased in a ch4 based cr reducing membrane biofilm reactor during operation when no oxygen was available in contrast to the methanotrophs rhodocyclales which includes many of denitrifiers and perchlorate reducing bacteria prb was enriched from 5 in stage 1 18 in stage 3 denitratisoma a genus of rhodocyclales reached 7 at the end of stage 3 denitratisoma is phylogenetically close to the well known prb azospira and dechloromonas and it can utilize nitrate nitrite perchlorate and chlorate as electron acceptors oren 2014 another well known prb azospirillum which can completely reduce clo4 to cl increased from 1 stage 1 to 8 stage 3 thus higher loadings of clo4 and no3 significantly enriched prb and denitrifiers as they did in work reported by logan and lapoint 2002 another enriched bacteria ignavibateriales was widely found in the sulfur based autotrophic denitrification systems ontiveros valencia et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 the abundance of order ignavibateriales increased from 6 stage 1 to 26 stage 3 while ignavibacterium the single genus of ignavibateriales was 0 1 in all stages in view of the existence of sulfate in our system we reckoned that ignavibateriales may use h2s and s0 sulfate reducing products as electron donors for autotrophic denitrification when nitrate was added 3 3 functional enzyme genes prediction based on picrust to explore the roles of functional enzymes we applied picrust to predict the metagenomic functional enzymes present in biofilms of all stages based on the high throughput sequencing analysis of the 16s rdna gene picrust results are shown in fig 3 and table s3 because no specific perchlorate reductase gene is included in the kegg pathway database the genes of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso reductase heme dependent oxidoreductase and cytochrome c reductase which are related to perchlorate reduction process were used to assess the potential for perchlorate reduction nerenberg 2013 all three genes increased in stages 2 and 3 in parallel higher numbers of predicted genes related to denitrification nitrate reductase nitrite reductase and nitrous oxide reductase were much higher in stages 2 and 3 than that in stage 1 which is consistent with the increased no3 removal these trends support that perchlorate reductase and nitrate reductase likely were responsible for clo4 and no3 reductions bardiya and bae 2011 nerenberg 2013 genes that encode a protein for the electron transport complex which plays a significant role in dissimilatory respiration of perchlorate and nitrate also were enriched as more nitrate was added in stages 2 and 3 lai et al 2014 2016 predicted key genes related to reverse methanogesis for example methylmalonyl coa mutase and f420 hydrogenase were enriched compared with the inoculum especially in stage 3 this provides indirect evidence that reverse methanogesis was involved in driving perchlorate and nitrate reduction xie et al 2018 3 4 transcriptional activities of the functional enzymes in parallel to the picrust analysis we did rt qpcr to evaluate the transcriptional activities of the functional enzymes fig 4 shows the transcript abundance of narg nirs pcra and mcra in all stages as well as the amount of reduced electron acceptors the transcript abundance of mcra reported to be able to oxidize methane anaerobically xie et al 2018 always was proportional to the generation of total reduced electron acceptors the trend of transcript abundance of narg and nirs were similar to each other though all stages significantly enriched when nitrate was introduced in stage 2a but decreased after nitrate was fully reduced in stage 2b the narg and nirs transcript abundances reached peaks of 4 7 1013 and 5 7 1011 copies m2 when 0 17 mmol nitrate was re introduced in stage 3a but rapidly dropped to 1 8 1012 and 9 2 1010 copies m2 after nitrate was all consumed in stage 3b the narg and nirs transcript abundances continued to decrease in stage 4 as blue solid arrow pointed showing a weak correlation between narg nirs and clo4 removal and suggesting that narg nirs played a relatively small role in perchlorate reduction in the mbbr the extremely poor affinity of narg for perchlorate k m 1060 μm also supports that narg has a weak perchlorate reduction capacity youngblut et al 2016 the transcript abundance of pcra increased from stage 1 to stage 3a following the increase in total reduced electron acceptors clo4 and no3 analysis with a pearson correlation matrix table s4 showed that the transcript abundance of pcra was better linked to the sum amount of clo4 and no3 rather than clo4 individually this is logical because most prbs are able to utilize nitrate as an electron acceptor bardiya and bae 2011 moreover the transcript abundance of pcra slightly decreased to 9 7 1011 copies m2 when no3 was removed completely in stage 3b but then returned to 6 5 1012 copies m2 in stage 4 as green solid arrow pointed these results support that nitrate was primarily responsible for the transcription of pcra this is consistent with gal et al 2008 who reported that nitrate could expand the perchlorate reduction capacity by stimulating the expression of pcra and youngblut et al 2016 who confirmed that pcra possessed a higher catalyze rate for no3 k cat 51 e 1 min 1 than for clo4 k cat 27 1 e 1 min 1 together with previous studies these results indicate that bacteria consumed nitrate preferentially when no3 and clo4 coexisted in fact pcra and narg belong to the dmso reductase super family and share the same molybdenum mo cofactor the only structural differences between pcra and narg being the sequence of the n terminal of the β subunit and the existence of selenite seo3 in the perchlorate reductase youngblut et al 2016 recently sun and chen 2019 assumed a minimal energy pathway for perchlorate reduction based on density functional theory dft as shown in fig s1 they demonstrated that the reduction of perchlorate in pcra occurs through a very fast o cl bond breaking to regenerate clo3 and the movi o intermediate which is then followed by the rate limiting proton coupled electron transfer process here we compared the pathways of perchlorate and nitrate reduction catalyzed by pcra and narg respectively laughlin et al 2007 silaghi dumitrescu et al 2012 sun and chen 2019 tenderholt et al 2010 xie and cao 2010 the dft analysis is shown in fig 5 reducing no3 to no2 and clo4 to clo3 is carried out by a molybdenum mo dependent reductase following two main steps ① x o x stand for cl or n bond breaking ts1 and ② proton coupled electron transfer ts2 in the first step no3 directly bounds to the mo center which causes the n o bond length to increase from 1 265 to 1 792 å along with the stretching vibration of mo o and n o the activation barrier for n o bond breaking is 12 6 kcal mol 1 in the liquid phase xie and cao 2010 but that of the cl o bond is only 3 0 kcal mol 1 pandiyan et al 2010 in the second step the proton and electron transfers are much difficult for perchlorate reduction compared with nitrate reduction the movi o needs 18 kcal mol energy to release h2o and clo3 which bounds to the mo center and causes cl o to break and gives movi o reduction on the other hand nitrate reduction by pcra has a higher energy barrier in proton coupled electron transfer processes than the reduction by narg it may result from the structural superiority of energy saving membrane of narg in summary the priority of proton and electron transfer in movi o reduction allows nitrate to outcompete perchlorate in the competition for narg and pcra which is consistent with the results of dynamics and functional enzymes discussed previously 4 conclusion studying the effects of nitrate on perchlorate reduction in a methane based mbbr we found these three main phenomena no3 had reversible inhibition towards clo4 reduction as it was reduced preferentially when no3 and clo4 coexisted the denitrifier denitratisoma and the prb azospirillum were the most strongly enriched genera involved in perchlorate and nitrate reduction both utilized

18197,the bicarbonate and carbonate ions hco 3 co 3 2 will consume hydroxyl radical ho to generate carbonate radical anion co 3 in hydroxyl radical based advanced oxidation processes ho aops resulting in reduced oxidation efficiencies of the systems however despite the ho quenching effect of carbonate species the contribution of co 3 to the degradation of bisphenol a bpa was observed in uv sodium

peroxide uv h2o2 were compared at equivalent concentration of h2o2 in this study the observed degradation rates of bpa by uv spc and by uv h2o2 in milli q water were similar variation of the bpa degradation rates in the presence of radical quenchers tert butanol and phenol suggested that both co 3 and ho contributed to the degradation of bpa in uv spc second order rate constant of co 3

8 5 the high co 3 ss observed in uv spc compensated for the smaller k c o 3 b p a compared to k h o b p a and the consumption of ho making the degradation rate of bpa in uv spc comparable to that in uv h2o2 detailed studies on identification of transformation products tps of bpa in uv spc revealed that phenol ring and isopropylidene bridge were the main reactive sites of bpa degradation pathways were proposed accordingly the results of kinetic and mechanistic studies provide better fundamental understanding of the degradation of bpa in uv spc and hco 3 co 3 2 impact on bpa degradation by ho aops this also demonstrates potential for co 3 based water purification technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords bisphenol a uv sodium percarbonate carbonate radical anion kinetics and mechanism 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa an important monomer for the synthesis of epoxy resins and polycarbonate has been widely used in packaging and coating industry for example in nursing bottles food plastic wrapping and protective coatings staples et al 1998 it has been extensively detected in water soil food and biota fromme et al 2002 vandenberg et al 2007 yamamoto et al 2001 exposure to bpa can cause series of health problems such as endocrine disorder gould et al 1998 kuiper et al 1998 gene mutation naciff et al 2005 smith and taylor 2005 precocious puberty lahnsteiner et al 2005 reproductive failure watts et al 2001 metabolism disorder zhou et al 2013 and increased risk of cancer nesan et al 2018 therefore tremendous efforts have been devoted to prevent human exposure to bpa which includes legislation on the usage of bpa monitoring of bpa presence in the environment and development of technologies for efficient treatment of bpa jiang et al 2013 by this far hydroxyl radical based advanced oxidation processes ho aops are one group of the most promising technologies for bpa remediation gültekin and ince 2007 liang et al 2015 liquid hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a common additive in ho aops but its usage comes with the concern of explosion during transportation and storage in practice sodium percarbonate spc has been widely used as an alternative to liquid h2o2 in chemical synthesis ando et al 1986 and manufacture of laundry and home cleaning products khanmohammadi et al 2012 the molecular formula of spc is generally written as na2co3 1 5h2o2 based on its crystal structure adams and pritchard 1977 however commercially available granular spc may have higher na2co3 to h2o2 ratio because additional na2co3 is added to form protective surface layer during granulation process to prevent spc crystals from deactivation in ambient environment the granular spc used in this study has a na2co3 to h2o2 ratio of 1 1 15 as indicated by the product specification and the re examination in our lab the advantages of spc vs liquid h2o2 are as followings 1 the reserved h2o2 in spc maintains the same chemical properties as liquid h2o2 which will be fully recovered once dissolved in water ma et al 2018 2 the stability storage time and anti explosion property of spc are significantly better than liquid h2o2 as the spc crystals are protected inside the granular shell mckillop and sanderson 1995 3 the cost in terms of transportation storage safety considerations and chemical purchase are expected to be much lower than liquid h2o2 the normalized prices for every metric ton of h2o2 are 300 350 for spc and 1000 1200 for liquid h2o2 the transportation and storage of spc require less expensive and smaller containers previous studies of spc for application of ho aops mainly focused on the degradation of organic contaminants catalyzed by iron complexes fu et al 2016 2017 yan et al 2018 only a few attempts have been made to explore the oxidation performance of spc activated by uv i e uv spc babaei and ghanbari 2016 sindelar et al 2014 in uv spc uv activation of h2o2 will generate ho eq 11 and then the ho will turn hco 3 co 3 2 into co 3 eqs 12 13 although some physiological studies have claimed that both co 3 and bicarbonate radical hco 3 can be generated in the human body when an electron is removed from carbonate or bicarbonate bühl et al 2015 hco 3 generation needs specific enzymes e g xanthine oxidase and it will be immediately dissociated into co 3 in polar environments e g h2o moreover czapski et al have reported that the pka of carbonate radical anion is below zero pka 0 czapski et al 1999 this means co 3 will remain in the deprotonated form at the examined ph of 8 5 therefore it is safe to assume that co 3 is the dominant species in this study as both ho and co 3 have potentials for the degradation of organic contaminants uv spc is supposed to be a promising technology for water and wastewater treatment the kinetics and mechanisms of the degradation of organic contaminants by ho have been well studied wojnárovits and takács 2014 yet less information is available for co 3 induced degradation this is because co 3 e co 3 co 3 2 1 78 v vs she at ph 7 shafirovich et al 2001 is a weaker oxidant compared to ho e h o h 2 o 2 32 v vs she at ph 7 wood 1988 and its generation consumes ho larson and zepp 1988 however the high reactivity of co 3 with electron rich moieties have been noticed especially with those n and s containing substrates and aromatic compounds neta et al 1988 for instance moore et al found that co 3 reacts with substituted phenols 107 108 m 1 s 1 via a electrophilic reaction co 3 attaches on or grab one electron from phenolic ring to produce transient phenolic radical moore et al 1977 huang and mabury demonstrated co 3 reacts with substituted anilines and pesticides 105 107 m 1 s 1 huang and mabury 2000 zhang et al identified co 3 as an important reactive species in the tio2 photocatalytic destruction of cylindrospermopsin zhang et al 2015 the positive effect of co 3 on the degradation of oxytetracycline in uv aops was also observed by liu et al 2016 moreover co 3 ss in the sunlit surface water is about two orders of magnitude higher than ho ss sulzberger et al 1997 thus co 3 may play important roles in the degradation and transformation of organic contaminants with electron rich moieties in the aquatic environments this study herein investigated the degradation and transformation of bpa in uv spc to reveal the role of co 3 in ho aops in this study the degradation of bpa

were collected from the west secondary effluent channel of a local wastewater treatment plant before chlorination the collected wastewater samples were used as reaction matrices without further processing to investigate the application of uv spc for existing wastewater treatment processes related qualities of the collected wastewater samples were summarized in table 1 2 2 photochemical experiments the photochemical experiments were conducted in a bench scale uv cabin consisting of one quartz reactor one fan one magnetic stirrer and two collimated low pressure mercury uv lamps 15w λ 253 7 nm cole parmer the quartz reactor consists of a pyrex petri dish with a quartz cover the configuration of the uv cabin was based on the design reported by bolton et al bolton and linden 2003 the uv fluence applied to reaction volume was calculated to be 336 34 mj cm 2 at uv flux of 0 1 mw cm 2 for 60 min in order to ensure the same input of uv fluence the uv flux was checked before every experiment with a calibrated radiometer model il 1700 xrd xrl 140t254 low profile germicidal probe international light co newburyport ma chemical actinometry methods i e iodide iodate actinometry rahn 1997 and ferrioxalate actinometry montalti and murov 2006 were periodically performed to verify measurements conducted by calibrated radiometer a typical photochemical experiment was initiated by sequential addition of the required reagents to the quartz reactor for a total volume of 10 ml the ph was firstly adjusted to 8 5 with 0 1 m h2so4 and then maintained with 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 8 5 if spc involved or buffered by 5 mm pbs ph 8 5 only for h2o2 related reactions the prepared solution was mixed completely on the magnetic stirrer before a shutter was opened to apply uv irradiation constant stirring 200 rpm and room temperature 21 1 c were maintained over the entire experiment each reaction sample 100 μl withdrawn from the reactor at specific uv fluence level was mixed with 100 μl sodium thiosulfate to terminate remaining reactions of residual oxidants samples of dark controls were collected at the same time intervals as the irradiated solutions the initial concentration of bpa was 2 μm for kinetic studies while 45 μm for identification of transformation products the analytical methods used for concentration measurement and transformation products identification were summarized in text s1 2 3 calculations bpa pka 10 3 clara et al 2004 existed as neutral molecule under experimental ph of 8 5 the second order rate constant of co 3 towards bpa k c o 3 b p a at ph 8 5 was determined by competition kinetics using phenol phoh as the standard competitor bpa and phoh of the same concentration 2 μm were added into uv spc t buoh the degradations of bpa and phoh in spc t

assumed the co 3 ss and ho ss were obtained by competition kinetics as well through bpa phoh competition in uv spc bpa phoh competition in uv and in spc was performed as controls the reaction rates

evaluated by the comparison of degradation rates of bpa in uv spc uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 na2co3 the uv fluence dependent profile of bpa degradation in different systems was plotted in fig 1 the controls i e uv na2co3 h2o2 na2co3 uv only h2o2 only na2co3 only and spc only were plotted in fig s1 fig 1 demonstrates that bpa of 2 μm was efficiently degraded in uv spc uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 na2co3 with similar rates of 87 8 88 9 and 89 9 respectively at uv fluence of 336 mj cm 2 1 mm spc or equivalent concentration of h2o2 and ph 8 5 however the degradation of bpa in uv na2co3 h2o2 na2co3 uv only h2o2 only na2co3 only and spc only was negligible given the ho scavenging effect of na2co3 the results demonstrate that uv h2o2 and na2co3 are necessary for uv spc to achieve the observed degradation of bpa the degradation of bpa by uv h2o2 and uv spc was also conducted in different water matrices milli q water secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment plant we a we b and we c fig 2 see table 1 for water qualities to evaluate the application of uv spc for existing wastewater treatment processes the bpa degradation in matrices of we a we b and we c either by uv h2o2 or uv spc had much lower rate constants in comparison to that in milli q water this is most probably due to the significant decrease of radical concentrations caused by the scavenging effects of the complex content in wastewater samples and the decrease of light utility with various turbidity moreover in the same water matrix the bpa degradation rate constant of uv spc was lower than the one of uv h2o2 this may be because the reduced ho cannot support the abundant generation of co 3 resulting in the further depletion of reactive species for bpa degradation it thus appears that uv spc may be more suitable for treatment of reused water 3 2 identification of reactive species the degradation of bpa in uv h2o2 is realized mainly by ho oxidation while comparable degradation was observed in uv spc where na2co3 consumes ho to generate co 3 eqs 12 13 this implies that co 3 may play a significant role in the degradation of bpa in uv spc in order to investigate the reactive species responsible for the degradation of bpa in uv spc tert butanol t buoh k ho t buoh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 k co 3 t buoh 1 6 102 m 1 s 1 chen et al 1973 and phenol phoh k ho phoh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 land and ebert 1967 k co 3 phoh 2 2 107 m 1 s 1 huang and mabury 2000 were added to uv spc as radical quenchers results were presented in fig 3 a suppressed degradation of bpa was observed in the presence of t buoh the ho quencher which confirmed that ho was responsible for partial degradation of bpa the degradation of bpa was completely inhibited upon addition of phenol the quencher of both ho and co 3 this competition kinetics demonstrates that ho and co 3 are primary reactive species for degradation of bpa in uv spc moreover almost no degradation of bpa was observed in uv na2co3 and h2o2 na2co3 fig s1 in contrast to the efficient degradation of bpa in uv spc this indicates that co 3 cannot be significantly generated by direct uv photolysis or h2o2 oxidation of na2co3 the abundant generation of co 3 in uv spc is based on the efficient generation of ho by the uv activation of h2o2 as expressed by eqs 12 13 3 3 determination of k c o 3 b p a c o 3 s s and h o s s competition kinetics in uv spc t buoh and uv spc were conducted to determine k c o 3 b p a co 3 ss and ho ss respectively using phoh as reference competitor see results in figs 4 and 5 see calculations in material and methods the k c o 3 b p a was determined to be 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 which is in agreement with k c o 3 b p a 2 8 108 m 1 s 1 reported by huang et al using uv h2o2 hco 3 to generate co 3 and 4 chlorophenol as reference competitor huang et al 2018 the co 3 ss and ho ss were determined to be 2 3 10 12 m and 1 82 10 14 m respectively the k c o 3 b p a is two orders of magnitude lower than k h o b p a 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 but the co 3 ss is two orders of magnitude higher than ho ss this indicates that the high co 3 ss in uv spc compensates the low k c o 3 b p a and the consumption of ho making the degradation of bpa in uv spc comparable to that in uv h2o2 3 4 identification of transformation products the transformation products tps of bpa in uv spc and uv h2o2 were identified by uhplc eis q tof ms a high initial concentration of bpa of 45 μm was adapted to currently studied systems i e uv 0 1 mw cm 2 spc 0 1 mm h2o2 0 1 15 mm ph 8 5 to increase the concentrations of tps to allow detection of minor products and thus more accurate pathways can be proposed as a result 52 and 31 tps were identified in uv spc and uv h2o2 respectively which were proposed and summarized in table s1 with tp number no retention time rt measured mass to charge ratios m z and suggested pseudo molecular formulas based on the structures tps were classified into four categories 1 hydroxybenzene and benzoquinone tps from modification of aromatic ring 2 aldehyde olefin alcohol alkane tps from the modification of isopropylidene bridge 3 single aromatic ring based tps from the cleavage at the carbon carbon bond linking isopropylidene bridge and aromatic ring 4 carboxylic acid tps from ring cleavage caused by the deep oxidation of aromatic ring in addition the detection of polyhydroxybenzene tps oh 4 e g tp no 4 5 15 19 in uv spc illustrates that uv spc has strong ability of polyhydroxylation of aromatic ring this is likely due to the electron accepting property of co 3 the addition of hydroxyl group oh to aromatic ring enhances the electron rich character of aromatic ring thus its reactivity towards co 3 resulting in the increased likelihood for polyhydroxylation although ho can also lead to hydroxylation of aromatic ring by direct addition its competing pathway such as hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group in the isopropylidene group of bpa lessens the chance of polyhydroxylation by ho enhanced hydroxylation of aromatic ring may also be promoted by the longer lifetime of co 3 k co 3 co 3 k h o h o 10 2 slow self recombination eqs 14 15 however tps of double ring cleavage no 40 41 were detected only in uv h2o2 which implies that uv h2o2 has strong ability of oxidation of aromatic ring tps in the two systems were respectively sorted into four groups according to the sampling uv fluence for observed maximum volume of each tp i 1177 mj cm 2 ii 2590 mj cm 2 iii 4709 mj cm 2 and iv 10987 mj cm 2 the uv fluence dependent evolution of grouped tps in uv spc and in uv h2o2 were depicted in figs s2 and s3 respectively because of the lack of standards the standardized volume v vmax was used as reference results show that in both systems some tps were completely transformed after generation while some tps remained as final products that could be of environmental concern in uv spc most tps were in group ii and reached their maximum volume at uv fluence of 2590 mj cm 2 the volumes of tps of group iv kept increasing until 10987 mj cm 2 a number of total tps were remained even upon extended treatment in uv h2o2 most tps were in group iii no tps of group iv were founded most tps were fully transformed and the remaining tps tended to be fully transformed this indicates that uv spc has weak transformation ability which gradually advances transformation of tps with more remaining tps the comparison of uv fluence dependent evolution within specific categories can provide more information about transformation pathways the increased uv fluence needed for maximum volume of no 3 in group no 2 5 and no 11 in group no 9 11 indicates that there may be more than one pathway to form catechol tps or maybe the formation of catechol tps is different from that of other hydroxybenzene tps in uv spc hydroxybenzene double ring tps e g no 12 14 evolved in a nonconsecutive manner but hydroxybenzene single ring tps e g no 28 30 evolved successively in uv h2o2 hydroxybenzene tps e g no 12 14 double ring tps no 26 27 single ring tps generated in a step wised manner this also indicates that additional transformation pathways may exist in uv spc other than ho pathway the additional pathway is likely to be co 3 pathway because the electron density difference of double ring tps and single ring tps will differentiate their affinity to selective co 3 but it will not influence significantly on their reactivity towards nonselective ho this could well explain the different evolution patterns for the transformation of double ring tps and single ring tps in uv spc and the uniform pattern for both tps in uv h2o2 moreover the evolution of no 9 11 and no 12 15 was nonconsecutive and no 13 and no 14 reached their maximum volume after that of no 2 and no 4 respectively this illustrates that isopropylidene bridge modification may occur after ring modification 3 5 proposal of transformation pathways since sharma et al 2016 has studied the mechanism of bpa transformation in uv h2o2 this study mainly focuses on bpa transformation in uv spc based on the discussion in identification of transformation products transformation mechanisms of bpa were proposed here from four pathways 1 ring modification 2 isopropylidene bridge modification 3 isopropylidene bridge cleavage and 4 ring cleavage 1 ring modification schematic 1 two forms of modification were detected on rings hydroxylation and quinonation such modifications probably initiated in two mechanisms direct electron transfer and radical attachment in terms of direct electron transfer the attack of co 3 captures one electron from phenolic ring of bpa forming phenolic bpa radical cation a and carbonate anion moore et al 1977 neta and schuler 1975 the formed phenolic bpa radical cation further interacts with water leading to the final formation of hydroxybenzene tps as the electron intensity on the aromatic ring is increased after hydroxylation co 3 tends to polyhydroxylate aromatic ring following the same mechanism for radical attachment ho attaches onto phenolic ring of bpa to form catechol bpa radical b and then further oxidized by dissolved o2 to form hydroxybenzene tps the hydroxybenzene tps formed in both mechanisms can be further oxidized into benzoquinone tps zhou et al 2004 2 isopropylidene bridge modification schematic 2 the isopropylidene bridge was identified to be another active site during transformation because abundant tps were formed from the alteration at isopropylidene bridge no 9 19 this pathway is also supported by the identification of no 10 17 and 18 as tps in previous studies ioannidou et al 2016 kanigaridou et al 2017 kondrakov et al 2014 potakis et al 2017 the modification of isopropylidene bridge can be initiated by h abstraction from the methyl group by ho to form isopropylidene bpa radical c the isopropylidene bpa radical can be further oxidized to chain superoxide bpa radical d by dissolved o2 which will be finalized into propyl aldehyde f alcohol g not detected or carboxyl h not detected terminals moreover the chain superoxide bpa radical can also interact with h on the adjacent methyl group to release one carbon forming ethyl bpa radical e which ends with ethyl i ethyl alcohol j olefin k or ketone l not detected terminals molkenthin et al 2013 3 isopropylidene bridge cleavage schematic 3 isopropylidene bridge cleavage can be achieved through multiple oxidation steps on this site i e primary or secondary β scission the primary β scission will directly break the bond that links the bridge and the aromatic ring into propyl phenol radical m and phenol radical n followed by oxidation to form propyl o not detected propyl alcohol p olefin q or ketone r terminals barontini et al 2004 yang et al 2014 the secondary β scission occurs to the ethyl bpa radical e formed during the process of isopropylidene bridge modification in this case the oxidation of ethyl bpa radical will lead to the cleavage of the bridge ring bond to form ketone r terminal directly jang and wilkie 2005 phenol s not detected and hydroquinone t not detected are complimentary tps during these transformations 4 ring cleavage schematic 4 deep oxidation of aromatic compounds will typically go through ring cleavage process generating carboxylic products i e tp no 33 61 the ring cleavage process is normally initiated by radical mediated oxidization of a pair of ortho hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring causing destabilization of electron coordination cerniglia 1993 fukahori et al 2003 seo et al 2009 the unstable aromatic ring will break between the hydroxyl groups theoretically to form primary carboxylic products u v v not detected followed by a series of oxidation to generate subsequent carboxylic acids w z y not detected fukahori et al 2003 harayama and rekik 1989 seo et al 2009 however no primary cleavage products of trihydroxybenzene tps were detected in uv spc and uv h2o2 so ring cleavage of bpa may mainly occur to catechol tps 4 conclusions this study investigated the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of bpa in uv spc the degradation of bpa in uv spc was comparable to that in uv h2o2 at equivalent concentration of h2o2 the contribution of co 3 to the degradation of bpa in uv spc was confirmed by radical quenching experiments the k b p a co 3 was determined to be 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 the co 3 ss and ho ss in uv spc were obtained to be 2 3 10 12 m and 1 82 10 14 m respectively the comparable degradation of bpa in uv spc and uv h2o2 is probably caused by the high co 3 ss in uv spc which compensates the low k b p a co 3 and the loss of ho however significant numbers of tps were remained in uv spc while most tps were fully transformed in uv h2o2 this suggests that uv spc is relatively insufficient for transformation of tps four transformation pathways of bpa in uv spc were proposed 1 modification of aromatic ring 2 modification of isopropylidene bridge 3 cleavage of isopropylidene bridge 4 cleavage of aromatic ring this study suggests that the existence of hco 3 co 3 2 in ho aops has limited impact on the degradation of bpa at the certain ratio of na2co3 h2o2 1 1 15 uv spc is comparable to uv h2o2 for the degradation of bpa in milli q water but it is relatively inefficient in real wastewater samples and the transformation of tps in uv spc are slowed down thus it is recommended to apply uv spc for water reuse or to combine uv spc with other technologies e g ozonation for complete remediation of bpa contamination also this study provides valuable information for a better understanding of the transformation kinetics and mechanisms of bpa in uv spc and the impact of hco 3 co 3 2 on bpa transformation in ho aop

18197,the bicarbonate and carbonate ions hco 3 co 3 2 will consume hydroxyl radical ho to generate carbonate radical anion co 3 in hydroxyl radical based advanced oxidation processes ho aops resulting in reduced oxidation efficiencies of the systems however despite the ho quenching effect of carbonate species the contribution of co 3 to the degradation of bisphenol a bpa was observed in uv sodium percarbonate uv spc in order to study the performance of uv spc for bpa degradation and the role of co 3 in this process the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of bpa in uv spc and in uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 were compared at equivalent concentration of h2o2 in this study the observed degradation rates of bpa by uv spc and by uv h2o2 in milli q water were similar variation of the bpa degradation rates in the presence of radical quenchers tert butanol and phenol suggested that both co 3 and ho contributed to the degradation of bpa in uv spc second order rate constant of co 3 towards bpa k c o 3 b p a 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 and steady state concentrations of co 3 co 3 ss 2 3 10 12 m and ho ho ss 1 82 10 14 m in uv spc were determined with competition kinetics at 1 mm spc and ph 8 5 the high co 3 ss observed in uv spc compensated for the smaller k c o 3 b p a compared to k h o b p a and the consumption of ho making the degradation rate of bpa in uv spc comparable to that in uv h2o2 detailed studies on identification of transformation products tps of bpa in uv spc revealed that phenol ring and isopropylidene bridge were the main reactive sites of bpa degradation pathways were proposed accordingly the results of kinetic and mechanistic studies provide better fundamental understanding of the degradation of bpa in uv spc and hco 3 co 3 2 impact on bpa degradation by ho aops this also demonstrates potential for co 3 based water purification technologies graphical abstract image 1 keywords bisphenol a uv sodium percarbonate carbonate radical anion kinetics and mechanism 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa an important monomer for the synthesis of epoxy resins and polycarbonate has been widely used in packaging and coating industry for example in nursing bottles food plastic wrapping and protective coatings staples et al 1998 it has been extensively detected in water soil food and biota fromme et al 2002 vandenberg et al 2007 yamamoto et al 2001 exposure to bpa can cause series of health problems such as endocrine disorder gould et al 1998 kuiper et al 1998 gene mutation naciff et al 2005 smith and taylor 2005 precocious puberty lahnsteiner et al 2005 reproductive failure watts et al 2001 metabolism disorder zhou et al 2013 and increased risk of cancer nesan et al 2018 therefore tremendous efforts have been devoted to prevent human exposure to bpa which includes legislation on the usage of bpa monitoring of bpa presence in the environment and development of technologies for efficient treatment of bpa jiang et al 2013 by this far hydroxyl radical based advanced oxidation processes ho aops are one group of the most promising technologies for bpa remediation gültekin and ince 2007 liang et al 2015 liquid hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is a common additive in ho aops but its usage comes with the concern of explosion during transportation and storage in practice sodium percarbonate spc has been widely used as an alternative to liquid h2o2 in chemical synthesis ando et al 1986 and manufacture of laundry and home cleaning products khanmohammadi et al 2012 the molecular formula of spc is generally written as na2co3 1 5h2o2 based on its crystal structure adams and pritchard 1977 however commercially available granular spc may have higher na2co3 to h2o2 ratio because additional na2co3 is added to form protective surface layer during granulation process to prevent spc crystals from deactivation in ambient environment the granular spc used in this study has a na2co3 to h2o2 ratio of 1 1 15 as indicated by the product specification and the re examination in our lab the advantages of spc vs liquid h2o2 are as followings 1 the reserved h2o2 in spc maintains the same chemical properties as liquid h2o2 which will be fully recovered once dissolved in water ma et al 2018 2 the stability storage time and anti explosion property of spc are significantly better than liquid h2o2 as the spc crystals are protected inside the granular shell mckillop and sanderson 1995 3 the cost in terms of transportation storage safety considerations and chemical purchase are expected to be much lower than liquid h2o2 the normalized prices for every metric ton of h2o2 are 300 350 for spc and 1000 1200 for liquid h2o2 the transportation and storage of spc require less expensive and smaller containers previous studies of spc for application of ho aops mainly focused on the degradation of organic contaminants catalyzed by iron complexes fu et al 2016 2017 yan et al 2018 only a few attempts have been made to explore the oxidation performance of spc activated by uv i e uv spc babaei and ghanbari 2016 sindelar et al 2014 in uv spc uv activation of h2o2 will generate ho eq 11 and then the ho will turn hco 3 co 3 2 into co 3 eqs 12 13 although some physiological studies have claimed that both co 3 and bicarbonate radical hco 3 can be generated in the human body when an electron is removed from carbonate or bicarbonate bühl et al 2015 hco 3 generation needs specific enzymes e g xanthine oxidase and it will be immediately dissociated into co 3 in polar environments e g h2o moreover czapski et al have reported that the pka of carbonate radical anion is below zero pka 0 czapski et al 1999 this means co 3 will remain in the deprotonated form at the examined ph of 8 5 therefore it is safe to assume that co 3 is the dominant species in this study as both ho and co 3 have potentials for the degradation of organic contaminants uv spc is supposed to be a promising technology for water and wastewater treatment the kinetics and mechanisms of the degradation of organic contaminants by ho have been well studied wojnárovits and takács 2014 yet less information is available for co 3 induced degradation this is because co 3 e co 3 co 3 2 1 78 v vs she at ph 7 shafirovich et al 2001 is a weaker oxidant compared to ho e h o h 2 o 2 32 v vs she at ph 7 wood 1988 and its generation consumes ho larson and zepp 1988 however the high reactivity of co 3 with electron rich moieties have been noticed especially with those n and s containing substrates and aromatic compounds neta et al 1988 for instance moore et al found that co 3 reacts with substituted phenols 107 108 m 1 s 1 via a electrophilic reaction co 3 attaches on or grab one electron from phenolic ring to produce transient phenolic radical moore et al 1977 huang and

destruction of cylindrospermopsin zhang et al 2015 the positive effect of co 3 on the degradation of oxytetracycline in uv aops was also observed by liu et al 2016 moreover co 3 ss in the sunlit surface water is about two orders of magnitude higher than ho ss sulzberger et al 1997 thus co 3 may play important roles in the degradation and transformation of organic contaminants with electron rich moieties in the aquatic environments this study herein investigated the degradation and transformation of bpa in uv spc to reveal the role of co 3 in ho aops in this study the degradation of bpa

processing to investigate the application of uv spc for existing wastewater treatment processes related qualities of the collected wastewater samples were summarized in table 1 2 2 photochemical experiments the photochemical experiments were conducted in a bench scale uv cabin consisting of one quartz reactor one fan one magnetic stirrer and two collimated low pressure mercury uv lamps 15w λ 253 7 nm cole parmer the quartz reactor consists of a pyrex petri dish with a quartz cover the configuration of the uv cabin was based on the design reported by bolton et al bolton and linden 2003 the uv fluence applied to reaction volume was calculated to be 336 34 mj cm 2 at uv flux of 0 1 mw cm 2 for 60 min in order to ensure the same input of uv fluence the uv flux was checked before every experiment with a calibrated radiometer model il 1700 xrd xrl 140t254 low profile germicidal probe international light co newburyport ma chemical actinometry methods i e iodide iodate actinometry rahn 1997 and ferrioxalate actinometry montalti and murov 2006 were periodically performed to verify measurements conducted by calibrated radiometer a typical photochemical experiment was initiated by sequential addition of the required reagents to the quartz reactor for a total volume of 10 ml the ph was firstly adjusted to 8 5 with 0 1 m h2so4 and then maintained with 5 mm phosphate buffer ph 8 5 if spc involved or buffered by 5 mm pbs ph 8 5 only for h2o2 related reactions the prepared solution was mixed completely on the magnetic stirrer before a shutter was opened to apply uv irradiation constant stirring 200 rpm and room temperature 21 1 c were maintained over the entire experiment each reaction sample 100 μl withdrawn from the reactor at specific uv fluence level was mixed with 100 μl sodium thiosulfate to terminate remaining reactions of residual oxidants samples of dark controls were collected at the same time intervals as the irradiated solutions the initial concentration of bpa was 2 μm for kinetic studies while 45 μm for identification of transformation products the analytical methods used for concentration measurement and transformation products identification were summarized in text s1 2 3 calculations bpa pka 10 3 clara et al 2004 existed as neutral molecule under experimental ph of 8 5 the second order rate constant of co 3 towards bpa k c o 3 b p a at ph 8 5 was determined by competition kinetics using phenol phoh as the standard competitor bpa and phoh of the same concentration 2 μm were added into uv spc t buoh the degradations of bpa and phoh in spc t buoh and uv t buoh were conducted as controls the degradation rates of bpa d b p a d t and phoh d p h o h d t in uv spc t buoh can be expressed as eqs 1 2 respectively 1 d b p a d t k o b s u v s p c

phoh respectively degradation of bpa and phoh by ho in uv spc t buoh was assumed to be fully quenched by 10 mm of t buoh because k h o t b u o h t b u o h 6 10 12 k h o b p a b p a 2 10 10 and k h o t

assumed the co 3 ss and ho ss were obtained by competition kinetics as well through bpa phoh competition in uv spc bpa phoh competition in uv and in spc was performed as controls the reaction rates

evaluated by the comparison of degradation rates of bpa in uv spc uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 na2co3 the uv fluence dependent profile of bpa degradation in different systems was plotted in fig 1 the controls i e uv na2co3 h2o2 na2co3 uv only h2o2 only na2co3 only and spc only were plotted in fig s1 fig 1 demonstrates that bpa of 2 μm was efficiently degraded in uv spc uv h2o2 and uv h2o2 na2co3 with similar rates of 87 8 88 9 and 89 9 respectively at uv fluence of 336 mj cm 2 1 mm spc or equivalent concentration of h2o2 and ph 8 5 however the degradation of bpa in uv na2co3 h2o2 na2co3 uv only h2o2 only na2co3 only and spc only was negligible given the ho scavenging effect of na2co3 the results demonstrate that uv h2o2 and na2co3 are necessary for uv spc to achieve the observed degradation of bpa the degradation of bpa by uv h2o2 and uv spc was also conducted in different water matrices milli q water secondary effluent from a local wastewater treatment plant we a we b and we c fig 2 see table 1 for water qualities to evaluate the application of uv spc for existing wastewater treatment processes the bpa degradation in matrices of we a we b and we c either by uv h2o2 or uv spc had much lower rate constants in comparison to that in milli q water this is most probably due to the significant decrease of radical concentrations caused by the scavenging effects of the complex content in wastewater samples and the decrease of light utility with various turbidity moreover in the same water matrix the bpa degradation rate constant of uv spc was lower than the one of uv h2o2 this may be because the reduced ho cannot support the abundant generation of co 3 resulting in the further depletion of reactive species for bpa degradation it thus appears that uv spc may be more suitable for treatment of reused water 3 2 identification of reactive species the degradation of bpa in uv h2o2 is realized mainly by ho oxidation while comparable degradation was observed in uv spc where na2co3 consumes ho to generate co 3 eqs 12 13 this implies that co 3 may play a significant role in the degradation of bpa in uv spc in order to investigate the reactive species responsible for the degradation of bpa in uv spc tert butanol t buoh k ho t buoh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 k co 3 t buoh 1 6 102 m 1 s 1 chen et al 1973 and phenol phoh k ho phoh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 land and ebert 1967 k co 3 phoh 2 2 107 m 1 s 1 huang and mabury 2000 were added to uv spc as radical quenchers results were presented in fig 3 a suppressed degradation of bpa was observed in the presence of t buoh the ho quencher which confirmed that ho was responsible for partial degradation of bpa the degradation of bpa was completely inhibited upon addition of phenol the quencher of both ho and co 3 this competition kinetics demonstrates that ho and co 3 are primary reactive species for degradation of bpa in uv spc moreover almost no degradation of bpa was observed in uv na2co3 and h2o2 na2co3 fig s1 in contrast to the efficient degradation of bpa in uv spc this indicates that co 3 cannot be significantly generated by direct uv photolysis or h2o2 oxidation of na2co3 the abundant generation of co 3 in uv spc is based on the efficient generation of ho by the uv activation of h2o2 as expressed by eqs 12 13 3 3 determination of k c o 3 b p a c o 3 s s and h o s s competition kinetics in uv spc t buoh and uv spc were conducted to determine k c o 3 b p a co 3 ss and ho ss respectively using phoh as reference competitor see results in figs 4 and 5 see calculations in material and methods the k c o 3 b p a was determined to be 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 which is in agreement with k c o 3 b p a 2 8 108 m 1 s 1 reported by huang et al using uv h2o2 hco 3 to generate co 3 and 4 chlorophenol as reference competitor huang et al 2018 the co 3 ss and ho ss were determined to be 2 3 10 12 m and 1 82 10 14 m respectively the k c o 3 b p a is two orders of magnitude lower than k h o b p a 1 02 1010 m 1 s 1 rosenfeldt and linden 2004 but the co 3 ss is two orders of magnitude higher than ho ss this indicates that the high co 3 ss in uv spc compensates the low k c o 3 b p a and the consumption of ho making the degradation of bpa in uv spc comparable to that in uv h2o2 3 4 identification of transformation products the transformation products tps of bpa in uv spc and uv h2o2 were identified by uhplc eis q tof ms a high initial concentration of bpa of 45 μm was adapted to currently studied systems i e uv 0 1 mw cm 2 spc 0 1 mm h2o2 0 1 15 mm ph 8 5 to increase the concentrations of tps to allow detection of minor products and thus more accurate pathways can be proposed as a result 52 and 31 tps were identified in uv spc and uv h2o2 respectively which were proposed and summarized in table s1 with tp number no retention time rt measured mass to charge ratios m z and suggested pseudo molecular formulas based on the structures tps were classified into four categories 1 hydroxybenzene and benzoquinone tps from modification of aromatic ring 2 aldehyde olefin alcohol alkane tps from the modification of isopropylidene bridge 3 single aromatic ring based tps from the cleavage at the carbon carbon bond linking isopropylidene bridge and aromatic ring 4 carboxylic acid tps from ring cleavage caused by the deep oxidation of aromatic ring in addition the detection of polyhydroxybenzene tps oh 4 e g tp no 4 5 15 19 in uv spc illustrates that uv spc has strong ability of polyhydroxylation of aromatic ring this is likely due to the electron accepting property of co 3 the addition of hydroxyl group oh to aromatic ring enhances the electron rich character of aromatic ring thus its reactivity towards co 3 resulting in the increased likelihood for polyhydroxylation although ho can also lead to hydroxylation of aromatic ring by direct addition its competing pathway such as hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group in the isopropylidene group of bpa lessens the chance of polyhydroxylation by ho enhanced hydroxylation of aromatic ring may also be promoted by the longer lifetime of co 3 k co 3 co 3 k h o h o 10 2 slow self recombination eqs 14 15 however tps of double ring cleavage no 40 41 were detected only in uv h2o2 which implies that uv h2o2 has strong ability of oxidation of aromatic ring tps in the two systems were respectively sorted into four groups according to the sampling uv fluence for observed maximum volume of each tp i 1177 mj cm 2 ii 2590 mj cm 2 iii 4709 mj cm 2 and iv 10987 mj cm 2 the uv fluence dependent evolution of grouped tps in uv spc and in uv h2o2 were depicted in figs s2 and s3 respectively because of the lack of standards the standardized volume v vmax was used as reference results show that in both systems some tps were completely transformed after generation while some tps remained as final products that could be of environmental concern in uv spc most tps were in group ii and reached their maximum volume at uv fluence of 2590 mj cm 2 the volumes of tps of group iv kept increasing until 10987 mj cm 2 a number of total tps were remained even upon extended treatment in uv h2o2 most tps were in group iii no tps of group iv were founded most tps were fully transformed and the remaining tps tended to be fully transformed this indicates that uv spc has weak transformation ability which gradually advances transformation of tps with more remaining tps the comparison of uv fluence dependent evolution within specific categories can provide more information about transformation pathways the increased uv fluence needed for maximum volume of no 3 in group no 2 5 and no 11 in group no 9 11 indicates that there may be more than one pathway to form catechol tps or maybe the formation of catechol tps is different from that of other hydroxybenzene tps in uv spc hydroxybenzene double ring tps e g no 12 14 evolved in a nonconsecutive manner but hydroxybenzene single ring tps e g no 28 30 evolved successively in uv h2o2 hydroxybenzene tps e g no 12 14 double ring tps no 26 27 single ring tps generated in a step wised manner this also indicates that additional transformation pathways may exist in uv spc other than ho pathway the additional pathway is likely to be co 3 pathway because the electron density difference of double ring tps and single ring tps will differentiate their affinity to selective co 3 but it will not influence significantly on their reactivity towards nonselective ho this could well explain the different evolution patterns for the transformation of double ring tps and single ring tps in uv spc and the uniform pattern for both tps in uv h2o2 moreover the evolution of no 9 11 and no 12 15 was nonconsecutive and no 13 and no 14 reached their maximum volume after that of no 2 and no 4 respectively this illustrates that isopropylidene bridge modification may occur after ring modification 3 5 proposal of transformation pathways since sharma et al 2016 has studied the mechanism of bpa transformation in uv h2o2 this study mainly focuses on bpa transformation in uv spc based on the discussion in identification of transformation products transformation mechanisms of bpa were proposed here from four pathways 1 ring modification 2 isopropylidene bridge modification 3 isopropylidene bridge cleavage and 4 ring cleavage 1 ring modification schematic 1 two forms of modification were detected on rings hydroxylation and quinonation such modifications probably initiated in two mechanisms direct electron transfer and radical attachment in terms of direct electron transfer the attack of co 3 captures one electron from phenolic ring of bpa forming phenolic bpa radical cation a and carbonate anion moore et al 1977 neta and schuler 1975 the formed phenolic bpa radical cation further interacts with water leading to the final formation of hydroxybenzene tps as the electron intensity on the aromatic ring is increased after hydroxylation co 3 tends to polyhydroxylate aromatic ring following the same mechanism for radical attachment ho attaches onto phenolic ring of bpa to form catechol bpa radical b and then further oxidized by dissolved o2 to form hydroxybenzene tps the hydroxybenzene tps formed in both mechanisms can be further oxidized into benzoquinone tps zhou et al 2004 2 isopropylidene bridge modification schematic 2 the isopropylidene bridge was identified to be another active site during transformation because abundant tps were formed from the alteration at isopropylidene bridge no 9 19 this pathway is also supported by the identification of no 10 17 and 18 as tps in previous studies ioannidou et al 2016 kanigaridou et al 2017 kondrakov et al 2014 potakis et al 2017 the modification of isopropylidene bridge can be initiated by h abstraction from the methyl group by ho to form isopropylidene bpa radical c the isopropylidene bpa radical can be further oxidized to chain superoxide bpa radical d by dissolved o2 which will be finalized into propyl aldehyde f alcohol g not detected or carboxyl h not detected terminals moreover the chain superoxide bpa radical can also interact with h on the adjacent methyl group to release one carbon forming ethyl bpa radical e which ends with ethyl i ethyl alcohol j olefin k or ketone l not detected terminals molkenthin et al 2013 3 isopropylidene bridge cleavage schematic 3 isopropylidene bridge cleavage can be achieved through multiple oxidation steps on this site i e primary or secondary β scission the primary β scission will directly break the bond that links the bridge and the aromatic ring into propyl phenol radical m and phenol radical n followed by oxidation to form propyl o not detected propyl alcohol p olefin q or ketone r terminals barontini et al 2004 yang et al 2014 the secondary β scission occurs to the ethyl bpa radical e formed during the process of isopropylidene bridge modification in this case the oxidation of ethyl bpa radical will lead to the cleavage of the bridge ring bond to form ketone r terminal directly jang and wilkie 2005 phenol s not detected and hydroquinone t not detected are complimentary tps during these transformations 4 ring cleavage schematic 4 deep oxidation of aromatic compounds will typically go through ring cleavage process generating carboxylic products i e tp no 33 61 the ring cleavage process is normally initiated by radical mediated oxidization of a pair of ortho hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring causing destabilization of electron coordination cerniglia 1993 fukahori et al 2003 seo et al 2009 the unstable aromatic ring will break between the hydroxyl groups theoretically to form primary carboxylic products u v v not detected followed by a series of oxidation to generate subsequent carboxylic acids w z y not detected fukahori et al 2003 harayama and rekik 1989 seo et al 2009 however no primary cleavage products of trihydroxybenzene tps were detected in uv spc and uv h2o2 so ring cleavage of bpa may mainly occur to catechol tps 4 conclusions this study investigated the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of bpa in uv spc the degradation of bpa in uv spc was comparable to that in uv h2o2 at equivalent concentration of h2o2 the contribution of co 3 to the degradation of bpa in uv spc was confirmed by radical quenching experiments the k b p a co 3 was determined to be 2 23 108 m 1 s 1 the co 3 ss and ho ss in uv spc were obtained to be 2 3 10 12 m and 1 82 10 14 m respectively the comparable degradation of bpa in uv spc and uv h2o2 is probably caused by the high co 3 ss in uv spc which compensates the low k b p a co 3 and the loss of ho however significant numbers of tps were remained in uv spc while most tps were fully transformed in uv h2o2 this suggests that uv spc is relatively insufficient for transformation of tps four transformation pathways of bpa in uv spc were proposed 1 modification of aromatic ring 2 modification of isopropylidene bridge 3 cleavage of isopropylidene bridge 4 cleavage of aromatic ring this study suggests that the existence of hco 3 co 3 2 in ho aops has limited impact on the degradation of bpa at the certain ratio of na2co3 h2o2 1 1 15 uv spc is comparable to uv h2o2 for the degradation of bpa in milli q water but it is relatively inefficient in real wastewater samples and the transformation of tps in uv spc are slowed down thus it is recommended to apply uv spc for water reuse or to combine uv spc with other technologies e g ozonation for complete remediation of bpa contamination also this study provides valuable information for a better understanding of the transformation kinetics and mechanisms of bpa in uv spc and the impact of hco 3 co 3 2 on bpa transformation in ho aop

18198,this work synthesized catalytic cufe2o4 tailored ceramic membrane cufecm and systematically investigated the intercorrelated oxidation filtration mechanism of peroxymonosulfate pms cufecm catalytic filtration for treating humic acid ha pms cufecm filtration exhibited enhanced ha removal efficiency while reduced the irreversible fouling resistance as compared with the conventional cm filtration results from ha characterizations showed that pms cufecm catalytic filtration oxidized ha into conjugated structures of smaller molecular weight the unsaturated bonds further caused the re agglomeration of ha hence enhancing the size exclusion of cufecm meanwhile oxidized ha particles with changing physicochemical properties reduced the total attractive interaction energy between cufecm and ha mainly attributed to the reduced acid base interaction energy according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo analysis the changing of ha properties and ha cufecm physicochemical interactions rendered more re agglomerated ha particles retained above membrane with less attachment which induced decreasing irreversible fouling resistance and facilitated easier external fouling removal by hydraulic cleaning overall the pms cufecm configuration demonstrated in this study could provide a new insight into the synergistic oxidation filtration interaction

significant environmental concerns mainly attributed to its active binding with organic contaminants complexation of trace metals and influence on water ph and bioactivities deng et al 2019 hua et al 2019 during the past decades ultrafiltration uf membranes have been extensively applied in the removal of nom yet the problematic nom is considered as a significant source of fouling to uf membranes with a comparatively low removal efficiency cheng et al 2016 2017a park et al 2012 as advanced oxidation processes aops enable reactive oxygen species generation and thus hold promise for contaminant degradation uf membranes have been exploited by integrating with aops for achieving lower membrane fouling potential higher foulant removal efficiency and or efficient membrane cleaning effect byun et al 2011 de angelis and fidalgo de cortalezzi 2016 park et al 2012 among numerous uf membrane materials ceramic membranes cm with strong chemical and thermal resilience possess appealing features in enduring harsh operation environment and integrating with aops for synergistic enhancement of membrane performance lu et al 2015 2016 zhao et al 2018 integrated aop cm filtrations for nom treatment have been investigated in previous studies which have shown improved nom fouling control and removal efficiency harman et al 2010 kim and van der bruggen 2010 although foulant degradation mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species ros analysis during aop cm filtration were broadly investigated in previous works bao et al 2018 guo et al 2018 shi et al 2019 the analysis of the intercorrelation between catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration in integrated aop cm filtration process was lacking furthermore their consequent mutual influence on nom removal and fouling were rarely studied in depth meanwhile among the various integrated aops with cm sulfate radical so4 based aop is considered as an attractive alternative to the conventional hydroxyl radical oh based aop as so4 was found to be highly reactive and possessed a longer half life compared to oh allowing better diffusion of so4 for oxidation reaction in the bulk solution ding et al 2013 guan et al 2013 oh et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 so4 can be generated by environmental friendly peroxymonosulfate pms via irradiation ultraviolet heat or transition metal catalysis among which transition metal is considered most economical mainly attributed to its minimum energy supplement li et al 2018 ling et al 2017 matafonova and batoev 2018 cobalt based catalysts were reported to be the most efficient for pms activation yet due to the high toxicity of cobalt substitute metals need to be investigated ling et al 2018 wei et al 2019 in replacement copper based catalysts were less toxic and more economic to synthesize among which cufe2o4 spinel was able to efficiently activate pms while remained structurally stable i e less leaching of cu and fe metal ions into the bulk solution and able to maintain crystalline form during the catalytic oxidation process guan et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 therefore integration of cufe2o4 with cm would be of potential significance in improving the filtration performance and membrane cleaning effect of hybrid catalytic ceramic membrane filtration however to the best of our knowledge little work has been conducted in this field hosseini et al 2019 luan et al 2019 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2019b this study was to obtain a thorough understanding in terms of the synergistic influence of catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration on nom treatment specifically cufe2o4 tailored cm cufecm

catalytic oxidation to investigate the catalytic oxidation effect of cufecm batch experiment was conducted cufecm and 20 mg l ha solution 200 ml were placed in a beaker and desired amount of pms solution the effect of pms concentration on ha degradation see fig s1 of the supporting information si was added into the beaker to start the reaction mechanical stirring 70 rpm was employed during the reaction samples were taken at different time intervals i e 0 min 5 min 10 min 30 min and 60 min and were filtered with 0 22 μm acetate fiber syringe filters 4 g l na2s2o3 was applied as reaction quench agent according to figs s1 and si cufecm with 0 4 g l pms possessed the optimal degradation efficiency of ha 2 4 2 hybrid pms cufecm filtration filtration was carried out in dead end mode and driven by gravity force at the operation height of 80 cm the configuration of gravity driven filtration gdf was employed because of its low energy consumption and simple maintenance ding et al 2017 wang et al 2017a wu et al 2017 more importantly thorough contact between foulant and catalytic reactive sites was enabled by the relatively low water flux of gdf system wang et al 2017b the filtration procedures were elucidated as follows clean membrane was immersed in milli q water for 12 h prior to filtration milli q water was first filtered to obtain pure water flux ha feed solution 20 mg l was then filtrated at a fixed volume of 200 ml with 0 4 g l of pms added to the feed solution prior to filtration hydraulic cleaning was conducted after the first filtration cycle fouled membrane was backwashed under 0 1 mpa with 100 ml milli q water and membrane surface was further cleaned by cross flow cross flow velocity 1 2 l min with 100 ml milli q water pure water flux at 80 cm was measured after hydraulic cleaning and the second cycle of ha filtration was then conducted the permeate flux was measured periodically by the electronic balance 2 5 theoretical analysis 2 5 1 fouling analysis

fabrication procedure fig 1 b the sem images of cufecm and the pristine cm exhibited resembling morphologies fig 1 c f meanwhile according to the sem eds mapping results cu and fe elements were evenly scattered on membrane surface suggesting the uniform distribution of cufe2o4 on membrane surface fig 2 a additionally eds signals of cu and fe elements were found within membrane pore structures fig 2 b indicating that cufe2o4 was impregnated into the cm substrate bao et al 2018 to further verify the molecular structures and elemental states of the functionalized surface of cufecm xrd and xps characterizations were conducted as shown in fig 3 xrd patterns fig 3 a of cufecm surface showed that the diffraction peaks at 34 7 35 9 41 8 and 43 8 were indexed to 103 211 004 and 220 planes of the cufe2o4 spinel structure jcpds no 34 0425 ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 which verified the structure of cufe2o4 on membrane surface the other xrd diffraction peaks corresponded to the components of the cm substrate i e rutile jcpds no 73 1232 and zirconium oxide jcpds no 49 1642 additionally the valence states of cu and fe were further validated by xps analysis the main peak of cu 2p3 2 at 933 6 ev validated the presence of cu2 cation fig 3 c while the main peak of fe 2p3 2 at 711 3 ev and shakeup satellite peak at 719 6 ev verified the existence of fe3 cation fig 3 d ding et al 2013 wang et al 2014 the electrostatic properties of cufecm and the pristine cm were further compared figs s2 a and si zeta potentials of both membranes decreased along with the growth of ph with cufecm more positively charged than the pristine cm in addition the pore size distribution of cufecm was similar and slightly lower than that of the pristine cm figs s2 b and si which also corresponded with the minorly reduced water flux of cufecm under gravity driven filtration with the operation height of 80 cm figs s2 c and si 3 2 pms cufecm catalytic filtration performance 3 2 1 fouling tendency and reversibility analysis flux performances of cufecm and cm were depicted in fig 4 a fluxes declined to 58 and 56 of the initial values by cufecm and cm in the first filtration cycle for both cufecm and cm single filtrations single filtration refers to conventional filtration without pms flux declined sharply initially and tended to decline more slowly and stably afterwards during the first filtration cycle fast slow decline pattern while fluxes of both pms hybrid membranes appeared to decline continuously with a flux reduction of 50 and 66 by pms cufecm hybrid filtration and pms cm hybrid filtration hybrid filtration refers to filtration with pms respectively however flux recovery rates were notably improved by 25 9 and 11 9 in pms cufecm and pms cm hybrid filtrations after hydraulic cleaning as compared with 5 7 and 5 6 in cufecm and cm single filtrations corresponding fouling resistances were analyzed as shown in fig 4 b with the addition of pms irreversible resistance of pms cufecm hybrid filtration 0 13 10 12 m 1 decreased compared to that of cufecm single filtration 0 22 10 12 m 1 while its reversible resistance 0 27 10 12 m 1 was higher than that of cufecm single filtration 0 06 10 12 m 1 in addition the total resistance and irreversible resistance of cufecm single filtration 0 29 10 12 m 1 and 0 22 10 12 m 1 were both slightly lower than those of cm single filtration 0 3 10 12 m 1 and 0 25 10 12 m 1 the corresponding mechanism analysis was discussed in the following subsection 3 3 3 2 2 ha retention performance the fluorescence spectra of ha feed solution and permeate were analyzed in fig 5 from the feem spectra of ha fig 5 a two characteristic fluorescence regions of ha were detected i e ex em 280 300 445 480 nm and ex em 360 380 465 480 nm which were assigned to carboxylic like fluorophores marked as region 1 in fig 5 a and phenolic like fluorophores marked as region 2 in fig 5 a of ha respectively li et al 2011 mcknight et al 2001 ohno 2002 without pms addition cufecm removed 1 group and 2 group by 48 3 and 66 7 fig 5 c when integrating pms with filtration the removal efficiencies of the two fluorescence groups both improved as evidenced by 66 6 removal of 1 group and complete removal of 2 group fig 5 e the ha fluorescence spectra by single pms cufecm oxidation were also investigated from fig s4 a1 and b1 si region 1 and region 2 of ha were rarely degraded by pms alone and were degraded by approximately 62 1 and 53 3 via pms cufecm oxidation the ha removal rates of pms cufecm oxidation and cufecm single filtration were both lower than that of pms cufecm hybrid filtration suggesting that the synergistic effect of catalytic oxidation and filtration process enhanced the ha removal efficiency of pms cufecm hybrid filtration in addition virgin cm also showed increasing ha removal rate when combined with pms fig 5 b d which could be attributed to the certain catalytic effect of the virgin cm specifically cm was formed by tio2 and zro2 which were reported to be catalytic towards pms oxidation ali et al 2019 rostami vartooni et al 2019 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2019a toc removal efficiency was further evaluated to qualitatively assess the ha removal performance fig 5 f the toc removal rate by cufecm single filtration was 30 1 while it greatly improved to 76 2 in pms cufecm hybrid filtration the corresponding pms cost for removing unit toc was also estimated 2 02 gtoc with detailed parameters provided in tables s2 and si in addition pms cufecm oxidation removed 12 0 of toc content within 60 min figs s6 and si which indicated that the mineralization extent was negligible by catalytic oxidation process alone taken together the synergistic oxidation filtration process in pms cufecm catalytic filtration achieved more thorough removal of ha compared to that in single oxidation or single filtration process 3 3 synergistic oxidation filtration process analysis 3 3 1 influence of pms cufecm oxidation on ha properties in fig 6 a ft ir spectra illustrated the change of ha functional groups before and after pms cufecm catalytic oxidation the broad band at 3440 cm 1 of ha sample represented oh stretching of phenolic compound and the adsorption peak at 1640 cm 1 indicated c o stretching of aromatic ring band at 1400 cm 1 came from the deformation of oh and c o stretching of phenol oh elkins and nelson 2001 enev et al 2018 guo et al 2019 yang et al 2019 with the prolongation of the catalytic oxidation ir bands at 3440 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 gradually decreased and the adsorption band at 1400 cm 1 disappeared indicating that complex structure i e phenolic compound or aromatic ring degraded to certain extent meanwhile the mitigation of oh ligand suggested that the ha particles after catalytic oxidation were more hydrophobic which was confirmed by the contact angle ca measurement table 1 cawater of ha was 59 and increased to 92 after catalytic oxidation additionally c o stretching of aliphatic compound e g esters ethers and alcohols at 1130 cm 1 and 1000 cm 1 became stronger after catalytic oxidation which suggested that the rings of complex aromatic structures were opened and degraded to aliphatic compound via pms cufecm catalytic oxidation molecular weight mw distribution was further investigated via hp sec fig 6 b1 b2 characterization the original ha particles presented two peaks 8181 da and 1130 da and degraded to three peaks after pms cufecm catalytic oxidation i e 6683da 2578 da and 841 da interestingly ha after catalytic oxidation short as haaop showed extremely high uv254 absorbance approximately 1 v of the dominant peak compared to that of virgin ha approximately 3644 10 6 v of the dominant peak the significantly high uv254 adsorption of the new structures indicated the formation of k band which was normally formed by π π transition of conjugated structure fukushima and tatsumi 2006 yakimenko et al 2018 in addition with the prolongation of the batch experiment main peak at 6683 da increased during the reaction time at 5 min 30 min then tended to be stable after 30 min this suggested that pms cufecm catalytic oxidation degraded ha into conjugated structures with smaller mw but could not further degrade the ha structure completely due to the transformation of ha structure uv254 absorbance comparison between virgin ha and haaop permeate from the hybrid filtrations could not be directly applied to evaluate ha removal efficiency instead in replacement of virgin ha feed solution ha from the pms cufecm oxidation batch experiment at 30min haaop30 were employed to evaluate the removal efficiency i e the removal rate uv254 absorbance of haaop permeate uv254 absorbance of ha aop30 without the combination of pms both cufecm and virgin cm single filtrations showed weak rejection of ha which corresponded to the feem result fig 5 specifically cufecm and cm removed 49 4 and 24 5 of the ha main structure at 8181da when combining with pms the removal efficiency greatly improved as evidenced by 80 1 and 67 2 removal of the haaop main structure at 6683da by pms cufecm and pms cm hybrid filtration respectively suggesting that the high uv absorbing compounds of haaop were largely rejected above cufecm in hybrid filtration this also consisted with the higher reversible fouling resistance of pms cufecm hybrid filtration compared to that of single filtration as more rejected haaop foulant likely caused heavier external fouling and consequently increased the reversible fouling resistance chang et al 2017 lu et al 2015 it is worth noted that the hydrodynamic diameter of ha increased from 243 nm at 0 min to 988 nm at 60 min fig 7 a during the batch experiment in pms cufecm catalytic oxidation system the growing hydrodynamic size of haaop could be explained by the newly formed conjugated structures as suggested by hp sec analysis fig 6 b1 b2 conjugated structures consisted of large amount of unsaturated bonds which tended to cause aggregation and thus formed larger flocs scheme 1 a hertkorn et al 2013 zhong et al 2017 2018 additionally fig 7 b showed the filtration and deposition of different ha foulants sampled from different time intervals of pms cufecm oxidation process on 100 kda pes membrane with the prolongation of oxidation given amount of haaop foulant sampled from the longer time interval of the oxidation system was rejected more above 100 kda pes membrane which consisted with the growing size of ha in pms cufecm catalytic oxidation process this result indicated that ha particles were more prone to be retained above membrane due to the enhanced size exclusion effect and consequently caused more external fouling in pms cufecm hybrid filtration than those in single filtration additionally the larger flocs of the aggregated haaop likely prevented individual small pieces of haaop from directly penetrating through the membrane thus assisting cufecm to remove the ha foulant more thoroughly and consequently enhancing the toc removal rate fig 5 f 3 3 2 membrane fouling analysis by classic fouling model fittings the four classic fouling models including standard blocking intermediate blocking complete blocking and cake fouling were employed to explain the fouling patterns of pms cufecm hybrid filtration correlation coefficient values r2 of the regression analysis were shown in fig 8 a r2 values of cake fouling and standard blocking in cufecm and cm single filtrations were the highest indicating that cake fouling and standard blocking mainly occurred this could be due to the much smaller molecular weight of ha than the molecular weight cut off of cm 300 kda smaller ha foulants thus likely penetrated membrane surface causing pore blocking i e standard blocking and piled up on membrane surface forming cake layer i e cake fouling when adding pms into the filtration r2 values of cake fouling and standard blocking were still the highest yet r2 values of intermediate blocking and complete blocking increased in hybrid filtrations fig 8 b this could be ascribed to the growing size of haaop particles during catalytic oxidation fig 7 instead of penetrating membrane surface sticking inside membrane pore and causing standard blocking bigger haaop particles could not squeeze into membrane pore thus were more prone to be retained above membrane and blocked membrane pore i e complete blocking or aggregated with other ha particles to block pore i e intermediate blocking on the membrane surface sem characterizations of the fouled cufecm further corroborated with the modeling analysis from figs s7 and si agglomerated ha particles were accumulated and stacked on membrane surface after pms cufecm catalytic filtration fig s7 a1 si while smaller ha particles were observed on membrane surface after single cufecm filtration fig s7 b1 si additionally ha fouling layer mainly deposited above cufecm surface after pms cufecm catalytic filtration fig s7 a2 si yet ha foulants penetrated deeply into the membrane pores after single cufecm filtration fig s7 b2 si the analysis of the four classic fouling models also consisted with the higher reversible fouling resistance and lower irreversible fouling resistance of pms cufecm hybrid filtration as compared with those of cufecm single filtration in previous studies the reversible fouling resistance was reported to be caused mostly by external fouling due to the accumulation of foulant above membrane i e intermediate blocking and complete blocking and the formation of cake gel layer i e cake fouling thus could be easily removed by hydraulic cleaning chang et al 2017 de angelis and fidalgo de cortalezzi 2016 lu et al 2016 lu et al 2015 similarly in pms cufecm hybrid filtration the haaop particles that aggregated more on cufecm surface likely caused more external fouling which resulted in higher reversible fouling resistance and more efficient hydraulic cleaning compared to those in single filtrations 3 3 3 physicochemical interaction analysis of cufecm ha according to the physicochemical properties of ha and membranes table 1 the physicochemical interactions between ha foulant and membranes were calculated and shown in table 2 ab and lw free energies were all negative which indicated attractive ab and lw interactions between ha and membranes el free energy between cufecm and haaop was negative and thus indicated attractive interaction meanwhile el free energies in other three scenarios were positive suggesting repulsive interactions in table 2 the trend of ab free energy gab of cufecm haaop gab of cm haaop gab of cufecm ha gab of cm ha was in reverse order with the trend of lw free energy glw of cufecm haaop glw of cm haaop glw of cufecm ha glw of cm ha the less ab free energy and higher lw free energy of cufecm haaop compared to those in other three filtrations indicated that the polar interaction occurred less while apolar interaction occurred more between cufecm and haaop in pms cufecm hybrid filtration anadao et al 2018 chu et al 2017 shen et al 2017 as compared with those in other three scenarios meanwhile the trend of total attractive interaction gtot of cufecm haaop gtot of cm haaop gtot of cufecm ha gtot of cm ha was in accordance with the trend of ab attractive interaction this was due to that ab free energy was the highest among three free energies i e ab lw and el free energies in each foulant membrane interaction which suggested the dominant influence of ab free energy on total attractive interaction energy in this case compared to the ab interaction of cm ha the reduced ab attractive interaction of cufecm ha suggested less attraction and attachment of ha foulant on cufecm thus likely causing the better flux performance of cufecm than that of cm fig 4 a similarly due to the lowest ab free energy the lowest total attractive interaction between haaop and cufecm in pms cufecm hybrid filtration indicated least attraction of haaop foulant towards membrane and further least penetration thus assisted improving the retention performance scheme 1 b1 c1 this also corresponded to the notably reduced irreversible fouling resistance and highest flux recovery of pms cufecm hybrid filtration as less attraction between membrane and foulant suggested easier removal of the foulant above membrane by hydraulic cleaning scheme 1 b2 c2 however it is worth noted that albeit the least attractive interaction of cufecm haaop pms cufecm hybrid filtration presented continuous flux decline and higher reversible fouling resistance than single filtration this could be due to that size exclusion besides physicochemical factors i e ab lw and el factors also exerted critical influence on the filtration pattern of hybrid filtration as shown in fig 7 the size of ha particles continually increased with the prolongation of pms cufecm oxidation therefore it was likely that the growing particle size of ha continually caused membrane fouling along with the hybrid filtration hence leading to the continuous flux decline rather than the pattern of fast slow flux decline as shown in the single filtrations 4 conclusion we demonstrated the fabrication and characterization of cufe2o4 tailored ceramic membrane cufecm and further evaluated its catalytic filtration performance and intercorrelated oxidation filtration mechanism in treating ha via pms activation pms cufecm hybrid filtration exhibited substantially enhanced ha removal efficiency with a reduced irreversible fouling resistance compared to conventional cm filtration which could be ascribed to the changing properties of haaop and further decreased ab attractive interaction between haaop and cufecm specifically pms cufecm catalytic oxidation degraded ha particles into lower molecular weight and relatively stable structures with unsaturated bonds which assisted aggregation of haaop and thus facilitated the size exclusion of cufecm filtration additionally the less polar interaction between haaop and cufecm caused less total attraction of haaop on cufecm suggesting easier haaop removal by hydraulic cleaning the synergistic effect of pms cufecm catalytic filtration increased the overall ha rejection while decreased the irreversible fouling resistance and notably enhanced the hydraulic cleaning efficiency which showed potential promising application in practical low pressure cross flow filtration for the nom removal it is worth noted that compared to other catalytic filtration processes where pollutants were generally oxidized and decomposed into smaller structures pms cufecm configuration enabled the re agglomeration of the oxidized ha which further improved toc removal efficiency due to membrane steric effect this phenomenon could broaden the current understanding towards the features and functionalities of the integrated catalytic membrane filtration processes additionally it should be mentioned that influencing factors i e varied nom sources with different properties coexistence of the general divalent ions etc possess important impact on membrane performance meanwhile the estimated cost of pms cufecm configuration for nom removal is still comparatively higher as compared with those of current technologies therefore future works regarding the analysis of relevant influencing factors and economic factors could be conducted to gain more comprehensive understanding and promote practicality of the pms cufecm filtration

18198,this work synthesized catalytic cufe2o4 tailored ceramic membrane cufecm and systematically investigated the intercorrelated oxidation filtration mechanism of peroxymonosulfate pms cufecm catalytic filtration for treating humic acid ha pms cufecm filtration exhibited enhanced ha removal efficiency while reduced the irreversible fouling resistance as compared with the conventional cm filtration results from ha characterizations showed that pms cufecm catalytic filtration oxidized ha into conjugated structures of smaller molecular weight the unsaturated bonds further caused the re agglomeration of ha hence enhancing the size exclusion of cufecm meanwhile oxidized ha particles with changing physicochemical properties reduced the total attractive interaction energy between cufecm and ha mainly attributed to the reduced acid base interaction energy according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo analysis the changing of ha properties and ha cufecm physicochemical interactions rendered more re agglomerated ha particles retained above membrane with less attachment which induced decreasing irreversible fouling resistance and facilitated easier external fouling removal by hydraulic cleaning overall the pms cufecm configuration demonstrated in this study could provide a new insight into the synergistic oxidation filtration interaction

matter nom is chemically complex macro molecular compound that can be ubiquitously found in natural water system adusei gyamfi et al 2019 jamil et al 2019 wang et al 2013 nom treatment is of significant environmental concerns mainly attributed to its active binding with organic contaminants complexation of trace metals and influence on water ph and bioactivities deng et al 2019 hua et al 2019 during the past decades ultrafiltration uf membranes have been extensively applied in the removal of nom yet the problematic nom is considered as a significant source of fouling to uf membranes with a comparatively low removal efficiency cheng et al 2016 2017a park et al 2012 as advanced oxidation processes aops enable reactive oxygen species generation and thus hold promise for contaminant degradation uf membranes have been exploited by integrating with aops for achieving lower membrane fouling potential higher foulant removal efficiency and or efficient membrane cleaning effect byun et al 2011 de angelis and fidalgo de cortalezzi 2016 park et al 2012 among numerous uf membrane materials ceramic membranes cm with strong chemical and thermal resilience possess appealing features in enduring harsh operation environment and integrating with aops for synergistic enhancement of membrane performance lu et al 2015 2016 zhao et al 2018 integrated aop cm filtrations for nom treatment have been investigated in previous studies which have shown improved nom fouling control and removal efficiency harman et al 2010 kim and van der bruggen 2010 although foulant degradation mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species ros analysis during aop cm filtration were broadly investigated in previous works bao et al 2018 guo et al 2018 shi et al 2019 the analysis of the intercorrelation between catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration in integrated aop cm filtration process was lacking furthermore their consequent mutual influence on nom removal and fouling were rarely studied in depth meanwhile among the various integrated aops with cm sulfate radical so4 based aop is considered as an attractive alternative to the conventional hydroxyl radical oh based aop as so4 was found to be highly reactive and possessed a longer half life compared to oh allowing better diffusion of so4 for oxidation reaction in the bulk solution ding et al 2013 guan et al 2013 oh et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 so4 can be generated by environmental friendly peroxymonosulfate pms via irradiation ultraviolet heat or transition metal catalysis among which transition metal is considered most economical mainly attributed to its minimum energy supplement li et al 2018 ling et al 2017 matafonova and batoev 2018 cobalt based catalysts were reported to be the most efficient for pms activation yet due to the high toxicity of cobalt substitute metals need to be investigated ling et al 2018 wei et al 2019 in replacement copper based catalysts were less toxic and more economic to synthesize among which cufe2o4 spinel was able to efficiently activate pms while remained structurally stable i e less leaching of cu and fe metal ions into the bulk solution and able to maintain crystalline form during the catalytic oxidation process guan et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 therefore integration of cufe2o4 with cm would be of potential significance in improving the filtration performance and membrane cleaning effect of hybrid catalytic ceramic membrane filtration however to the best of our knowledge little work has been conducted in this field hosseini et al 2019 luan et al 2019 shi et al 2019 wang et al 2019b this study was to obtain a thorough understanding in terms of the synergistic influence of catalytic oxidation and membrane filtration on nom treatment specifically cufe2o4 tailored cm cufecm via one step synthesis was presented humic acid ha a typical nom foulant was selected as feed solution the fouling and retention performances by pms cufecm catalytic filtration in treating ha solution were thoroughly evaluated the ha property changes by pms cufecm oxidation and pms cufecm catalytic filtration were investigated in detail furthermore the physicochemical interactions between ha and cufecm were analyzed according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory the results were expected to explain the fouling and retention behaviors of pms cufecm catalytic filtration in depth additionally this study demonstrated the intercorrelated oxidation filtration mechanism in catalytic ceramic membrane performance further highlighting the potential of integrated aop cm

catalytic oxidation to investigate the catalytic oxidation effect of cufecm batch experiment was conducted cufecm and 20 mg l ha solution 200 ml were placed in a beaker and desired amount of pms solution the effect of pms concentration on ha degradation see fig s1 of the supporting information si was added into the beaker to start the reaction mechanical stirring 70 rpm was employed during the reaction samples were taken at different time intervals i e 0 min 5 min 10 min 30 min and 60 min and were filtered with 0 22 μm acetate fiber syringe filters 4 g l na2s2o3 was applied as reaction quench agent according to figs s1 and si cufecm with 0 4 g l pms possessed the optimal degradation efficiency of ha 2 4 2 hybrid pms cufecm filtration filtration was carried out in dead end mode and driven by gravity force at the operation height of 80 cm the configuration of gravity driven filtration gdf was employed because of its low energy consumption and simple maintenance ding et al 2017 wang et al 2017a wu et al 2017 more importantly thorough contact between foulant and catalytic reactive sites was enabled by the relatively low water flux of gdf system wang et al 2017b the filtration procedures were elucidated as follows clean membrane was immersed in milli q water for 12 h prior to filtration milli q water was first filtered to obtain pure water flux ha feed solution 20 mg l was then filtrated at a fixed volume of 200 ml with 0 4 g l of pms added to the feed solution prior to filtration hydraulic cleaning was conducted after the first filtration cycle fouled membrane was backwashed under 0 1 mpa with 100 ml milli q water and membrane surface was further cleaned by cross flow cross flow velocity 1 2 l min with 100 ml milli q water pure water flux at 80 cm was measured after hydraulic cleaning and the second cycle of ha filtration was then conducted the permeate flux was measured periodically by the electronic balance 2 5 theoretical analysis 2 5 1 fouling analysis

fabrication procedure fig 1 b the sem images of cufecm and the pristine cm exhibited resembling morphologies fig 1 c f meanwhile according to the sem eds mapping results cu and fe elements were evenly scattered on membrane surface suggesting the uniform distribution of cufe2o4 on membrane surface fig 2 a additionally eds signals of cu and fe elements were found within membrane pore structures fig 2 b indicating that cufe2o4 was impregnated into the cm substrate bao et al 2018 to further verify the molecular structures and elemental states of the functionalized surface of cufecm xrd and xps characterizations were conducted as shown in fig 3 xrd patterns fig 3 a of cufecm surface showed that the diffraction peaks at 34 7 35 9 41 8 and 43 8 were indexed to 103 211 004 and 220 planes of the cufe2o4 spinel structure jcpds no 34 0425 ren et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 which verified the structure of cufe2o4 on membrane surface the other xrd diffraction peaks corresponded to the components of the cm substrate i e rutile jcpds no 73 1232 and zirconium oxide jcpds no 49 1642 additionally the valence states of cu and fe were further validated by xps analysis the main peak of cu 2p3 2 at 933 6 ev validated the presence of cu2 cation fig 3 c while the main peak of fe 2p3 2 at 711 3 ev and shakeup satellite peak at 719 6 ev verified the existence of fe3 cation fig 3 d ding et al 2013 wang et al 2014 the electrostatic properties of cufecm and the pristine cm were further compared figs s2 a and si zeta potentials of both membranes decreased along with the growth of ph with cufecm more positively charged than the pristine cm in addition the pore size distribution of cufecm was similar and slightly lower than that of the pristine cm figs s2 b and si which also corresponded with the minorly reduced water flux of cufecm under gravity driven filtration with the operation height of 80 cm figs s2 c and si 3 2 pms cufecm catalytic filtration performance 3 2 1 fouling tendency and reversibility analysis flux performances of cufecm and cm were depicted in fig 4 a fluxes declined to 58 and 56 of the initial values by cufecm and cm in the first filtration cycle for both cufecm and cm single filtrations single filtration refers to conventional filtration without pms flux declined sharply initially and tended to decline more slowly and stably afterwards during the first filtration cycle fast slow decline pattern while fluxes of both pms hybrid membranes appeared to decline continuously with a flux reduction of 50 and 66 by pms cufecm hybrid filtration and pms cm hybrid filtration hybrid filtration refers to filtration with pms respectively however flux recovery rates were notably improved by 25 9 and 11 9 in pms cufecm and pms cm hybrid filtrations after hydraulic cleaning as compared with 5 7 and 5 6 in cufecm and cm single filtrations corresponding fouling resistances were analyzed as shown in fig 4 b with the addition of pms irreversible resistance of pms cufecm hybrid filtration 0 13 10 12 m 1 decreased compared to that of cufecm single filtration 0 22 10 12 m 1 while its reversible resistance 0 27 10 12 m 1 was higher than that of cufecm single filtration 0 06 10 12 m 1 in addition the total resistance and irreversible resistance of cufecm single filtration 0 29 10 12 m 1 and 0 22 10 12 m 1 were both slightly lower than those of cm single filtration 0 3 10 12 m 1 and 0 25 10 12 m 1 the corresponding mechanism analysis was discussed in the following subsection 3 3 3 2 2 ha retention performance the fluorescence spectra of ha feed solution and permeate were analyzed in fig 5 from the feem spectra of ha fig 5 a two characteristic fluorescence regions of ha were detected i e ex em 280 300 445 480 nm and ex em 360 380 465 480 nm which were assigned to carboxylic like fluorophores marked as region 1 in fig 5 a and phenolic like fluorophores marked as region 2 in fig 5 a of ha respectively li et al 2011 mcknight et al 2001 ohno 2002 without pms addition cufecm removed 1 group and 2 group by 48 3 and 66 7 fig 5 c when integrating pms with filtration the removal efficiencies of the two fluorescence groups both improved as evidenced by 66 6 removal of 1 group and complete removal of 2 group fig 5 e the ha fluorescence spectra by single pms cufecm oxidation were also investigated from fig s4 a1 and b1 si region 1 and region 2 of ha were rarely degraded by pms alone and were degraded by approximately 62 1 and 53 3 via pms cufecm oxidation the ha removal rates of pms cufecm oxidation and cufecm single filtration were both lower than that of pms cufecm hybrid filtration suggesting that the synergistic effect of catalytic oxidation and filtration process enhanced the ha removal efficiency of pms cufecm hybrid filtration in addition virgin cm also showed increasing ha removal rate when combined with pms fig 5 b d which could be attributed to the certain catalytic effect of the virgin cm specifically cm was formed by tio2 and zro2 which were reported to be catalytic towards pms oxidation ali et al 2019 rostami vartooni et al 2019 wan et al 2019 wang et al 2019a toc removal efficiency was further evaluated to qualitatively assess the ha removal performance fig 5 f the toc removal rate by cufecm single filtration was 30 1 while it greatly improved to 76 2 in pms cufecm hybrid filtration the corresponding pms cost for removing unit toc was also estimated 2 02 gtoc with detailed parameters provided in tables s2 and si in addition pms cufecm oxidation removed 12 0 of toc content within 60 min figs s6 and si which indicated that the mineralization extent was negligible by catalytic oxidation process alone taken together the synergistic oxidation filtration process in pms cufecm catalytic filtration achieved more thorough removal of ha compared to that in single oxidation or single filtration process 3 3 synergistic oxidation filtration process analysis 3 3 1 influence of pms cufecm oxidation on ha properties in fig 6 a ft ir spectra illustrated the change of ha functional groups before and after pms cufecm catalytic oxidation the broad band at 3440 cm 1 of ha sample represented oh stretching of phenolic compound and the adsorption peak at 1640 cm 1 indicated c o stretching of aromatic ring band at 1400 cm 1 came from the deformation of oh and c o stretching of phenol oh elkins and nelson 2001 enev et al 2018 guo et al 2019 yang et al 2019 with the prolongation of the catalytic oxidation ir bands at 3440 cm 1 and 1640 cm 1 gradually decreased and the adsorption band at 1400 cm 1 disappeared indicating that complex structure i e phenolic compound or aromatic ring degraded to certain extent meanwhile the mitigation of oh ligand suggested that the ha particles after catalytic oxidation were more hydrophobic which was confirmed by the contact angle ca measurement table 1 cawater of ha was 59 and increased to 92 after catalytic oxidation additionally c o stretching of aliphatic compound e g esters ethers and alcohols at 1130 cm 1 and 1000 cm 1 became stronger after catalytic oxidation which suggested that the rings of complex aromatic structures were opened and degraded to aliphatic compound via pms cufecm catalytic oxidation molecular weight mw distribution was further investigated via hp sec fig 6 b1 b2 characterization the original ha particles presented two peaks 8181 da and 1130 da and degraded to three peaks after pms cufecm catalytic oxidation i e 6683da 2578 da and 841 da interestingly ha after catalytic oxidation short as haaop showed extremely high uv254 absorbance approximately 1 v of the dominant peak compared to that of virgin ha approximately 3644 10 6 v of the dominant peak the significantly high uv254 adsorption of the new structures indicated the formation of k band which was normally formed by π π transition of conjugated structure fukushima and tatsumi 2006 yakimenko et al 2018 in addition with the prolongation of the batch experiment main peak at 6683 da increased during the reaction time at 5 min 30 min then tended to be stable after 30 min this suggested that pms cufecm catalytic oxidation degraded ha into conjugated structures with smaller mw but could not further degrade the ha structure completely due to the transformation of ha structure uv254 absorbance comparison between virgin ha and haaop permeate from the hybrid filtrations could not be directly applied to evaluate ha removal efficiency instead in replacement of virgin ha feed solution ha from the pms cufecm oxidation batch experiment at 30min haaop30 were employed to evaluate the removal efficiency i e the removal rate uv254 absorbance of haaop permeate uv254 absorbance of ha aop30 without the combination of pms both cufecm and virgin cm single filtrations showed weak rejection of ha which corresponded to the feem result fig 5 specifically cufecm and cm removed 49 4 and 24 5 of the ha main structure at 8181da when combining with pms the removal efficiency greatly improved as evidenced by 80 1 and 67 2 removal of the haaop main structure at 6683da by pms cufecm and pms cm hybrid filtration respectively suggesting that the high uv absorbing compounds of haaop were largely rejected above cufecm in hybrid filtration this also consisted with the higher reversible fouling resistance of pms cufecm hybrid filtration compared to that of single filtration as more rejected haaop foulant likely caused heavier external fouling and consequently increased the reversible fouling resistance chang et al 2017 lu et al 2015 it is worth noted that the hydrodynamic diameter of ha increased from 243 nm at 0 min to 988 nm at 60 min fig 7 a during the batch experiment in pms cufecm catalytic oxidation system the growing hydrodynamic size of haaop could be explained by the newly formed conjugated structures as suggested by hp sec analysis fig 6 b1 b2 conjugated structures consisted of large amount of unsaturated bonds which tended to cause aggregation and thus formed larger flocs scheme 1 a hertkorn et al 2013 zhong et al 2017 2018 additionally fig 7 b showed the filtration and deposition of different ha foulants sampled from different time intervals of pms cufecm oxidation process on 100 kda pes membrane with the prolongation of oxidation given amount of haaop foulant sampled from the longer time interval of the oxidation system was rejected more above 100 kda pes membrane which consisted with the growing size of ha in pms cufecm catalytic oxidation process this result indicated that ha particles were more prone to be retained above membrane due to the enhanced size exclusion effect and consequently caused more external fouling in pms cufecm hybrid filtration than those in single filtration additionally the larger flocs of the aggregated haaop likely prevented individual small pieces of haaop from directly penetrating through the membrane thus assisting cufecm to remove the ha foulant more thoroughly and consequently enhancing the toc removal rate fig 5 f 3 3 2 membrane fouling analysis by classic fouling model fittings the four classic fouling models including standard blocking intermediate blocking complete blocking and cake fouling were employed to explain the fouling patterns of pms cufecm hybrid filtration correlation coefficient values r2 of the regression analysis were shown in fig 8 a r2 values of cake fouling and standard blocking in cufecm and cm single filtrations were the highest indicating that cake fouling and standard blocking mainly occurred this could be due to the much smaller molecular weight of ha than the molecular weight cut off of cm 300 kda smaller ha foulants thus likely penetrated membrane surface causing pore blocking i e standard blocking and piled up on membrane surface forming cake layer i e cake fouling when adding pms into the filtration r2 values of cake fouling and standard blocking were still the highest yet r2 values of intermediate blocking and complete blocking increased in hybrid filtrations fig 8 b this could be ascribed to the growing size of haaop particles during catalytic oxidation fig 7 instead of penetrating membrane surface sticking inside membrane pore and causing standard blocking bigger haaop particles could not squeeze into membrane pore thus were more prone to be retained above membrane and blocked membrane pore i e complete blocking or aggregated with other ha particles to block pore i e intermediate blocking on the membrane surface sem characterizations of the fouled cufecm further corroborated with the modeling analysis from figs s7 and si agglomerated ha particles were accumulated and stacked on membrane surface after pms cufecm catalytic filtration fig s7 a1 si while smaller ha particles were observed on membrane surface after single cufecm filtration fig s7 b1 si additionally ha fouling layer mainly deposited above cufecm surface after pms cufecm catalytic filtration fig s7 a2 si yet ha foulants penetrated deeply into the membrane pores after single cufecm filtration fig s7 b2 si the analysis of the four classic fouling models also consisted with the higher reversible fouling resistance and lower irreversible fouling resistance of pms cufecm hybrid filtration as compared with those of cufecm single filtration in previous studies the reversible fouling resistance was reported to be caused mostly by external fouling due to the accumulation of foulant above membrane i e intermediate blocking and complete blocking and the formation of cake gel layer i e cake fouling thus could be easily removed by hydraulic cleaning chang et al 2017 de angelis and fidalgo de cortalezzi 2016 lu et al 2016 lu et al 2015 similarly in pms cufecm hybrid filtration the haaop particles that aggregated more on cufecm surface likely caused more external fouling which resulted in higher reversible fouling resistance and more efficient hydraulic cleaning compared to those in single filtrations 3 3 3 physicochemical interaction analysis of cufecm ha according to the physicochemical properties of ha and membranes table 1 the physicochemical interactions between ha foulant and membranes were calculated and shown in table 2 ab and lw free energies were all negative which indicated attractive ab and lw interactions between ha and membranes el free energy between cufecm and haaop was negative and thus indicated attractive interaction meanwhile el free energies in other three scenarios were positive suggesting repulsive interactions in table 2 the trend of ab free energy gab of cufecm haaop gab of cm haaop gab of cufecm ha gab of cm ha was in reverse order with the trend of lw free energy glw of cufecm haaop glw of cm haaop glw of cufecm ha glw of cm ha the less ab free energy and higher lw free energy of cufecm haaop compared to those in other three filtrations indicated that the polar interaction occurred less while apolar interaction occurred more between cufecm and haaop in pms cufecm hybrid filtration anadao et al 2018 chu et al 2017 shen et al 2017 as compared with those in other three scenarios meanwhile the trend of total attractive interaction gtot of cufecm haaop gtot of cm haaop gtot of cufecm ha gtot of cm ha was in accordance with the trend of ab attractive interaction this was due to that ab free energy was the highest among three free energies i e ab lw and el free energies in each foulant membrane interaction which suggested the dominant influence of ab free energy on total attractive interaction energy in this case compared to the ab interaction of cm ha the reduced ab attractive interaction of cufecm ha suggested less attraction and attachment of ha foulant on cufecm thus likely causing the better flux performance of cufecm than that of cm fig 4 a similarly due to the lowest ab free energy the lowest total attractive interaction between haaop and cufecm in pms cufecm hybrid filtration indicated least attraction of haaop foulant towards membrane and further least penetration thus assisted improving the retention performance scheme 1 b1 c1 this also corresponded to the notably reduced irreversible fouling resistance and highest flux recovery of pms cufecm hybrid filtration as less attraction between membrane and foulant suggested easier removal of the foulant above membrane by hydraulic cleaning scheme 1 b2 c2 however it is worth noted that albeit the least attractive interaction of cufecm haaop pms cufecm hybrid filtration presented continuous flux decline and higher reversible fouling resistance than single filtration this could be due to that size exclusion besides physicochemical factors i e ab lw and el factors also exerted critical influence on the filtration pattern of hybrid filtration as shown in fig 7 the size of ha particles continually increased with the prolongation of pms cufecm oxidation therefore it was likely that the growing particle size of ha continually caused membrane fouling along with the hybrid filtration hence leading to the continuous flux decline rather than the pattern of fast slow flux decline as shown in the single filtrations 4 conclusion we demonstrated the fabrication and characterization of cufe2o4 tailored ceramic membrane cufecm and further evaluated its catalytic filtration performance and intercorrelated oxidation filtration mechanism in treating ha via pms activation pms cufecm hybrid filtration exhibited substantially enhanced ha removal efficiency with a reduced irreversible fouling resistance compared to conventional cm filtration which could be ascribed to the changing properties of haaop and further decreased ab attractive interaction between haaop and cufecm specifically pms cufecm catalytic oxidation degraded ha particles into lower molecular weight and relatively stable structures with unsaturated bonds which assisted aggregation of haaop and thus facilitated the size exclusion of cufecm filtration additionally the less polar interaction between haaop and cufecm caused less total attraction of haaop on cufecm suggesting easier haaop removal by hydraulic cleaning the synergistic effect of pms cufecm catalytic filtration increased the overall ha rejection while decreased the irreversible fouling resistance and notably enhanced the hydraulic cleaning efficiency which showed potential promising application in practical low pressure cross flow filtration for the nom removal it is worth noted that compared to other catalytic filtration processes where pollutants were generally oxidized and decomposed into smaller structures pms cufecm configuration enabled the re agglomeration of the oxidized ha which further improved toc removal efficiency due to membrane steric effect this phenomenon could broaden the current understanding towards the features and functionalities of the integrated catalytic membrane filtration processes additionally it should be mentioned that influencing factors i e varied nom sources with different properties coexistence of the general divalent ions etc possess important impact on membrane performance meanwhile the estimated cost of pms cufecm configuration for nom removal is still comparatively higher as compared with those of current technologies therefore future works regarding the analysis of relevant influencing factors and economic factors could be conducted to gain more comprehensive understanding and promote practicality of the pms cufecm filtration

18199,livestock production is utilizing large amounts of protein rich feed ingredients such as soybean meal the proven negative environmental impacts of soybean meal production incentivize the search for alternative protein sources one promising alternative is microbial protein mp i e dried microbial biomass to date only few life cycle assessments lcas for mp have been carried out none of which has used a consequential modelling approach nor has been investigating the production of mp on food and beverage wastewater therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental impact of mp production on a food and beverage effluent as a substitute for soybean meal using a consequential modelling approach three different types of mp production were analysed namely consortia containing aerobic heterotrophic bacteria ahb microalgae and ahb mab and purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb the production of mp was modelled for high strength potato wastewater cod 10 kg m3 at a flow rate of 1 000 m3 day lca results were compared against soybean meal production for the endpoint impact categories human health ecosystems and resources soybean meal showed up to 52 higher impact on human health and up to 87 higher impact on ecosystems than mp however energy related aspects resulted in an 8 88 higher resource exploitation for mp a comparison between the mp production systems showed that mab performed best when considering ecosystems between 13 and 14 better and resource between 71 and 80 better impact categories while ahb and pnsb had lower values for the impact category human health 8 12 the sensitivity analysis suggests that the conclusions drawn are robust as in the majority of 1 000 monte carlo runs the initial results are confirmed in conclusion it is suggested that mp is an alternative protein source of comparatively low environmental impact that should play a role in the future protein transition in particular when further process improvements can be implemented and more renewable or waste energy sources will be used graphical abstract image 1 keywords resource recovery nutrient recovery novel protein protein transition single cell protein purple

meal production for which an annual increase of 1 6 until 2027 is expected oecd fao 2018 this increase continues to be driven mainly by protein feed demand in china in the eu a current issue of concern is the dependency on imported soybean meal that accounts for 64 of the protein rich feed material of which 97 is imported eu 2019 most of the global soybean and soybean meal production originates from the usa brazil and argentina oecd fao 2018 in particular the production increase of soybean cultivation in recent decades in south america has raised concerns about environmental impacts as a result of land use change these impacts include amongst others greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss castanheira and freire 2013 chaudhary and kastner 2016 the increasing global demand for protein and concerns about the environmental impacts of feed and food production have led to a call for a protein transition aiking and de boer 2018 amongst the many actions necessary for this transition to take place is the search for novel feed protein sources with a lower environmental impact than traditional protein crops indeed the eu recently called for urgent action to replace imported protein with alternative european sources denanot 2018 novel protein sources include for instance insects duckweed yeasts other fungi macro and microalgae incl cyanobacteria as well as bacterial protein excl cyanobacteria of the above yeasts microalgae and bacteria can be classified as microbial protein mp or single cell protein the proponents of mp bring forward a number of compelling arguments such as matassa et al 2016 protein content comparable to soybean meal microalgae contain 40 70 and bacteria 50 80 crude protein on a dry matter dm basis compared to soybean meal with 45 57 dm high protein yields up to 20 times more protein per ha per year than soybean and 40 times more than corn excellent protein quality essential amino acid profile comparable to that of soybean meal and the majority of feeding trials indicates a similar growth and digestibility performance for a summary see pikaar et al 2018 another advantage of mp is that many types can be cultivated on wastewater and that they present a resource recovery opportunity for carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p verstraete et al 2016 especially food and beverage wastewater has been suggested to be suitable for mp production due to its relatively low contamination with pathogens and other harmful pollutants e g heavy metals exception slaughterhouse wastewater muys 2019 furthermore food and beverage wastewater can contain high concentrations of nutrients and carbon that can be utilized for mp production the present study is utilizing potato industry wastewater which typically has a cod content of 4 15 g l a n content of 0 15 0 5 g l and a phosphorus content between 0 035 and 0 08 g l these figures are based on a study of the potato industry in flanders more details can be found in supplemental material sm section 1 a literature study indicates that three mp consortia have been cultivated on wastewater including aerobic heterotrophic bacteria ahb microalgae and ahb mab and purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb ahb consortia are mainly composed of aerobic chemoorganoheterotrophs i e bacteria that use organic compounds as carbon source and electron donor and oxygen as electron acceptor similar ahb communities are widely used for biological treatment of wastewater in the conventional activated sludge process aiming at intensified mp production a high rate activated sludge process would be the most suitable technology with activated sludge to be understood as microbial biomass the high rate technology aims to maximize biomass production through using short sludge retention times srt at which a relatively large proportion of the available organic carbon is directed towards biomass growth as a consequence of oxidizing a minimum of organics to co2 the aeration demand per unit biomass produced is relatively low high rate activated sludge is thus far mainly studied and applied in sewage treatment to redirect organics to anaerobic digestion for energy production or organic commodities alloul et al 2018 meerburg et al 2015 the microbial community in high rate sewage treatment is less rich than in its conventional counterpart meerburg et al 2016 and is containing specific core genera belonging to the betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes sub phyla gonzalez martinez et al 2016 high rate communities for food and beverage wastewater treatment are yet to be studied high rate activated sludge plants with the aim to produce mp are operating at full scale on a brewery wastewater flow of 1 500 m3 day zhejiang china terry et al 2019 and have been started up at a pilot plant operating on a potato wastewater flow of 80 100 m3 day at clarebout potatoes flanders belgium avecom 2019 microalgae ahb mab cultivation systems or high rate algal ponds for wastewater treatment take advantage of a bidirectional product substrate exchange between photolithoautotrophic microalgae and ahb in light microalgae provide o2 for ahb growth and the ahb supply co2 as a carbon source for the microalgae therefore minimizing or even avoiding the need for conventional aeration van den hende et al 2014 another rationale to consider heterotrophs in algal reactors for wastewater treatment is that heterotrophs are likely to naturally thrive in non sterile microalgae cultivation in the presence of influent cod which consequently improves the cod removal and effluent quality in addition mab biomass was found to bioflocculate and hence settle well therefore improving harvestability compared to pure microalgal cultures valigore et al 2012 the predominant microalgal genera in mab systems on wastewater differ by study but often belong to the genera scenedesmus acutudesmus oocystis microspora stigeoclonium actinastrum micractinium pediastrum monoraphidium coelastrum chlorella ankistrodesmus or and phormidium van den hende 2014 ahb detected in these systems include bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia firmicutes planctomycetes and alpha beta gamma delta and epsilonproteobacteria lee et al 2013 su et al 2011 microalgae are used as feed products or feed ingredients and especially mab biomass has been studied as an aquaculture feed van den hende et al 2014 the technology for production of microalgae in raceway reactors is commercially available with a number of full scale installations mainly in asia but also in europe and other continents pnsb are purple phototrophic bacteria belonging to the alpha and betaproteobacteria even though they are considered to be the metabolically most versatile microorganisms anaerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophy is the growth mode that has received most attention in literature in this mode with volatile fatty acids vfa as organics pnsb have a near to 100 carbon yield biomass c produced vfa c removed alloul et al 2019 only pnsb can be grown on infra red light which enables the selective enrichment of these organisms in open mixed cultures another advantage is that pnsb do not require aeration with o2 or co2 supply for their growth which is one of the limiting factors in aerobic heterotrophic or photolithoautotrophic growth hülsen et al 2014 pnsb used for or enriched during wastewater treatment include rhodopseudomonas palustris rhodovulum sulfidophilum rhodocyclus gelatinosus rubrivivax gelatinosus rhodobacter sphaeroides rhodospirillum rubrum of which r palustris was found to dominate at longer srt and r sphaeroides at shorter srt alloul et al 2019 mp production from pnsb grown on wastewater is an innovative approach and to the authors knowledge not yet available at full scale its potential has also been realized by the european space agency which investigates pnsb as a food protein source to grow on fermented organic waste for regenerative life support clauwaert et al 2017 of the mp described above comparative life cycle assessments lcas to evaluate the environmental impacts caused by mp production have so far only been carried out for microalgae production systems in photolithoautotrophic or heterotrophic metabolism furthermore no study has investigated the life cycle of mp produced on food and beverage wastewater from the available lca studies conclusions about the environmental sustainability of mp in comparison to soybean meal were mixed according to smetana et al 2017 the autotrophic and heterotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris and autotrophic growth of arthrospira platensis were considered to have a higher environmental impact than the reference feeds e g soybean meal however in their discussion they indicated that the production under heterotrophic conditions with the use of food waste as a carbon source would be most promising sfez et al 2015 evaluated the production of a consortium of mab flocs on recirculation aquaculture water in an outdoor open raceway pond opr they concluded that valorization of dried mab flocs as shrimp feed has a lower marine eutrophication and a similar freshwater eutrophication than using mab flocs for biogas production in a comparative exergy evaluation of microalgae and soybean meal taelman et al 2015 concluded that soybean meal is the preferred feed ingredient when benchmarked against phototrophic microalgae production however they also suggested that with further optimisation a similar exergy based resource footprint can be realized in an earlier study by taelman et al 2013 microalgae nannochloropsis sp were cultivated in an orp it was concluded that the production of microalgae can have a smaller exergy based impact than fish feed 8 fishmeal and 25 soybean meal if the process is further optimized in addition to these lca studies pikaar et al 2018 investigated mp production using aerobic heterotrophic fermentation as well as autotrophic production from hydrogen gas and methane most of their scenarios show avoided crop land expansion co2 eq emissions and nitrogen pollution by producing mp they however did not apply an lca methodology and did compare to an animal feed basket rather than soybean meal production all the lca studies reviewed above employed an attributional modelling approach to assess the environmental impact this type of lca aims to answer the question of how are pollutants resources and exchanges among processes flowing within a chosen temporal window weidema et al 2018 in other words the results represent the environmental impact of an average product which is already produced to investigate the environmental consequences of the implementation of mp production a more appropriate method is consequential lca modelling which seeks to answer the question of how will flows of pollutants resources and exchanges among processes change in response to decisions weidema et al 2018 therefore the results only include products processes or suppliers that are affected by a change i e the marginal suppliers for instance through the introduction of a novel and innovative technology to the market in this regard a consequential modelling approach is the most appropriate in the context of this study due to the absence of lca studies that compare different types of microbial metabolisms and the lack of a consequential lca on this topic it is the objective of this study to evaluate the environmental impact of the three different mp production systems introduced using a consequential modelling method 2 methodology 2 1 lca methodology this study follows the consequential lca modelling approach as described by weidema et al 2009 this approach implies that only the environmental impact of processes that are expected to be affected by a change are accounted for in the present case for example mp production alters the state of the art or baseline of potato wastewater treatment process when implementing mp production the baseline potato wastewater treatment process is replaced in the model this is accounted for as follows 1 net flow x mp gross flow x mp fu q gross flow x base fu q where gross flow xmp is the flow or emission of substance x of the mp production system and gross flow xbase is the flow of substance x of the baseline potato wastewater treatment fuq is a scaling factor or reference flow that sets the gross flows to the volume of wastewater required to produce 1 functional unit fu the fu of this cradle to plant gate study is the production of 1 ton crude protein cp another feature of consequential lca is that an increase in demand will be met by suppliers that are more competitive while a decrease in demand for a product will result in the least competitive suppliers leaving the market in other words only the marginal suppliers are affected by a change instead of simply increasing or decreasing the current average production mix therefore the production systems of the three mp types described above were compared to the current marginal supplier for protein feed namely soybean meal multiple suppliers were taken into account and represented in a marginal mix the process soybean meal at the global market of the consequential system model of ecoinvent 3 4 was taken to represent the marginal market mix for soybean meal another frequently discussed protein sources is fishmeal however fishmeal production is considered to be declining or stagnating globally olsen and hasan 2012 and products with this characteristic do not qualify as marginal suppliers therefore fishmeal is not investigated in this study a final feature of the consequential modelling is that by products are accounted for through substitution of functionally similar products at the market e g those supplied by a marginal supplier as in this study is the case for the substitution of palm oil by soybean oil section 3 3 the geographical location of mp production facilities is belgium a zero burden approach was implemented i e upstream production of the potato and its processing is not accounted for as potato wastewater is currently considered a waste product that undergoes treatment ekvall et al 2007 foreground life cycle inventory lci data for mp production and treatment of potato wastewater were derived from a mass balance prepared in excel all assumptions applied in the mass balance are based on literature data sm section 1 all exchanges e g emissions energy demand etc were entered into simapro 8 4 using data from the ecoinvent 3 4 database applying the ecoinvent consequential system model for determination of marginal suppliers to facilitate interpretation of the results they are presented at endpoint level in the categories human health ecosystems and resources derived using the recipe v1 13 impact assessment method hierarchist version with global normalization the determination of emission and energy demand generation is detailed in the sm section 1 4 a sensitivity analysis was carried out using monte carlo simulations implemented in simapro the foreground parameters varied were those with the highest impact on the results background parameters were varied as defined in the relevant ecoinvent processes specifically this concerned the energy related parameters and ammonia emissions uniform distributions using the ranges shown in the sm section 5 were implemented to generate 1 000 pairwise comparative runs of mp production systems and soybean meal uniform distributions were chosen because more detailed distributions could not be generated from the limited literature information 2 2 process descriptions and data collection 2 2 1 potato wastewater definition the scale of the mp production as well as the baseline was defined by a model potato processing effluent with flow rate of 1 000 m3 day and an influent composition of 10 kg cod m³ 0 3 kg n m³ 0 06 kg p m³ this corresponds to a high strength potato wastewater as found in potato processing companies in belgium sm section 1 the temperature of the incoming process water was assumed to be 40 c as it is commonly found in the potato industry all effluent is treated before discharge to meet the effluent quality common in the potato industry fig 1 section 2 2 6 n ammonium sulfate and p triple superphosphate were supplied in addition to the wastewater where this was required to either maximize biomass growth or to avoid nutrient limitation during the final effluent treatment for ahb only biomass composition sm section 1 for photolithotrophic production values from studies using summer conditions were used i e temperature and light any sludge produced that was not used as a feed ingredient was applied to land replacing n and p fertilizers the substitution is estimated for n based on the mineral fertilizer equivalent mfe of sewage sludge delin et al 2012 2 m f e 87 5 c n r a t i o at a the c n ratio of 5 in sewage sludge this results in a mineral fertilizer equivalent of 62 which is the value adopted in this study the agronomic effectiveness of p derived from sludge biomass was derived from studies that investigated sewage sludge in general the results show a wide range of values of between 10 and 100 when compared to triple superphosphate the value adopted in the research is 64 derived from the work of andriamananjara et al 2016 which is comparable to the work of o riordan et al 1987 who detected average efficiencies between 74 and 79 both studies included sludge that was precipitated with iron or aluminum salts 2 2 2 baseline water treatment the baseline process describes a wastewater treatment process as it is encountered in the potato processing industry it is comprised of an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor followed by an activated sludge process the uasb is used to remove a part of the influent cod and for biogas generation the activated sludge process with nitrification denitrification is applied to meet cod and n discharge limits while the defined p limit is met via chemical precipitation of fepo4 by dosing fecl3 fig 1 section 2 2 6 2 2 3 production of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria ahb ahb cultivation is carried out on potato processing wastewater in two stages fig 1 the first stage is a fully aerated tank at an srt of 1 day the ahb biomass produced at this stage is separated with a lamella settler doubling the biomass concentration to 6 86 kg tss m3 0 7 dm the liquid from this settler still contains about 3 kg cod m3 which is utilized to produce more ahb biomass in a second stage reactor with an srt of 6 days modelled as described in section 2 2 6 this biomass is again settled and centrifuged together with the biomass from reactor 1 25 dm after which the biomass is dried to obtain a market ready product with a dm concentration of 90 supernatants and permeates produced here are again channeled to the second reactor for treatment as biomass growth is limited by n and p concentrations in the wastewater these nutrients are added to maximize biomass production since n ammonium sulfate and p triple superphosphate are dosed to match the biomass growth demand residual concentrations of these elements in the effluent are below the defined standard and therefore no fecl3 dosing or nitrification denitrification is required 2 2 4 production of microalgae ahb mab mab biomass is cultivated on the effluent of the uasb reactor in naturally illuminated orps using a paddle wheel for agitation as applied by van den hende et al 2014 the uasb converts cod to ch4 enabling the recovery of electricity and thermal energy in a combined heat and power chp unit furthermore the dissolved inorganic carbon present in the uasb effluent is used as a carbon source and ph buffer the consortium composition of the microalgae and bacteria in the mab flocs was estimated stoichiometrically the o2 demand by heterotrophs is met at a heterotrophs to microalgae ratio of about 0 7 sm section 1 3 however because not all o2 is accessible for the heterotrophs a ratio of 0 6 was assumed in practice the ph of the orp may rise to levels above 9 during periods of intense illumination due to photosynthetic co2 removal to avoid the negative consequences of such a ph rise i e lower biomass production and nh3 emissions flue gas from the chp unit process is sparged to maintain a ph below 8 van den hende et al 2014 the biomass concentration realized in the orp is 0 5 kg tss m3 van den hende et al 2014 the biomass produced in the orp is settled resulting in 0 1 dm centrifuged 25 dm and spray dried to 90 dm all supernatants and permeates are treated in the effluent treatment step that comprises biological cod removal nitrification denitrification and fecl3 addition for p removal fig 1 no bypass of the effluent is required as the cod demand for denitrification is satisfied by the effluent from the solid liquid separation steps 2 2 5 production of purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb the cultivation of pnsb begins with a hydrolytic acidogenic and acetogenic fermentation step with the purpose of converting incoming cod into vfa that act as electron donor and carbon source for pnsb biomass growth the produced h2 is burned in a chp generating electrical and thermal energy following the anaerobic fermentation pnsb are produced in an outdoor tubular photobioreactor illuminated with natural light fig 1 as in carlozzi and sacchi 2001 an srt of 1 day was used resulting in a biomass concentration of 1 2 kg tss m3 the biomass is harvested using ultrafiltration uf to a concentration of 10 dm followed by a centrifugation step resulting in a dm concentration of 25 before finally being spray dried to 90 dm as the codvfa removal efficiency of pnsb at srt 1 day is only 57 and since the acidification step only removes 11 of the cod sm section 1 1 2 76 of the incoming cod is still available to further remove this remaining cod the tubular photobioreactor is followed by a uasb reactor to remove cod and produce biogas a bypass of 0 7 7 m3 d of the influent to the uasb is implemented to provide cod for denitrification in the activated sludge process 2 2 6 final water treatment to dischargeable quality all mp production systems are followed by an effluent treatment step the target composition of the effluent has been defined as the average of the flemish potato industries sm section 1 specifically the target values are 37 mg cod l 7 mg n l and 1 5 mg p l all treatment systems are based on the activated sludge processes for cod and n removal including nitrification denitrification except ahb and on chemical p removal by fecl3 dosage except for ahb the biomass yield and associated removal rates were calculated as detailed in sm section 1 4 following the biological treatment sludge is settled in a lamella separator and centrifuged to realize a dm of 25 before disposal of the sludge to land the fecl3 dosing is determined based on the stoichiometric ratio of 5 25 g fecl3 g p removed and multiplied by the efficiency factor of 1 5 tchobanoglous et al 2003 the sludge produced from the precipitation i e fepo4 is added to the biologically produced sludge sludge is applied to land replacing n and p fertilizers except for ahb where all sludge is used as a feed section 2 2 3 3 results 3 1 energy balance energy generation energy demand as well as the gross energy flows per fu i e the generated energy during mp production minus the energy consumed during mp production are shown in fig 2 the gross energy flow for the different mp systems are ahb of about 1 800 kwh el fu and 9 100 kwh th fu mab of about 40 000 kwh el fu and about 52 000 kwh th fu and pnsb of about 8 000 kwh el fu and 8 800 kwh th fu the large difference in the overall values between the mp systems are partially a function of the mp system characteristics such as their ability to generate energy while producing mp as is the case for mab however importantly the differences are also a result of the production efficiencies measured as fuq see equation 1 while ahb produces one ton of crude protein i e the fu on fuq 375 m3 of wastewater mab requires fuq 4 333 m3 and pnsb fuq 1 734 m3 these different efficiencies are also reflected in the base values which are calculated using the same fuq in accordance with equation 1 these base values or the energy production demand of conventional baseline potato wastewater treatment are subtracted from the values obtained for the mp production systems i e because the process is avoided the resulting value is denoted as netahbmp netmabmp and netpnsbmp respectively in fig 2 it can be observed that all processes have a net electrical and thermal energy demand with the exception of mab that has a net positive electrical energy balance of about 2 500 kwh the reason that mab has a net electricity production is that biomass growth in this system is partially autotrophic and n is incorporated in microalgal biomass without cod demand therefore compared to the baseline more cod can be anaerobically digested in the mab scenario as no cod needs to be bypassed for n removal in the denitrification effluent treatment step as a result the overall electricity balance is positive as more biogas and energy is produced the main processes contributing to the net electricity demand are in particular harvesting production for pnsb and avoided energy generation ahb pnsb fig 2 however heat demand generally exceeds electrical energy demand and is dominated by the drying process 9 100 kwh fu ahb 8 500 kwh fu mab 9 600 kwh fu pnsb in addition to the energy data described above detailed and comprehensive life cycle inventory data are provided in sm table 6 in this section only the energy related information were presented in detail as they have a pivotal impact see section 3 3 3 2 impact assessment results show that for the human health and the ecosystem categories mp cause lower impacts than soybean meal while they cause a higher impact in the category resources fig 3 life cycle inventory sm table 6 in detail for human health disability adjusted life years dalys ahb and pnsb obtain a similar score of 48 52 relative to soybean meal while the impact of mab is somewhat higher at 60 for ecosystems impacts species year again ahb and pnsb have similar values of 28 and 26 relative to soybean meal with mab showing a clearly lower value of 13 for resource depletion us dollar usd ahb has the highest impact 100 followed by pnsb with 91 of the impact relative to ahb mab show an impact of only 20 of that of ahb and soybean meal production causes an impact of 12 relative to ahb fig 4 shows the contribution of individual mindpoint categories to the endpoint impacts it clearly displays that impacts on human health are mainly a function of climate change indicators with the exception of mab where most of the endpoint impact is originating from particulate matter formation the main contributors to ecosystem impacts are climate change and agricultural land occupation for ahb and pnsb mab show comparatively low impacts in this category for soybean meal the agricultural land occupation natural land transformation and climate change impacts have high contributions in particular soybean meal shows three times higher contribution in agricultural land occupation and nearly double the natural land transformation than mp it is hence these two impact categories that are responsible for the big difference on the ecosystems endpoint impacts above in this study resource use is measured as fossil depletion only and hence simply reflects the results as shown in the impact assessment of fig 3 3 3 contribution analysis in order to further understand the reasons for the observed impacts results are presented as a function of the contributing processes fig 5 shows that the contributions across all endpoint impact categories are a result of heat demand sm table 7 for details the exception to this is mab where the main contribution to human health impact is derived from direct emissions 0 006 dalys this is mainly due to gaseous emissions of nh3 from the orp section 2 2 4 another reason for this is that mab has a relatively low heat demand and is even a net electricity producing system therefore the relative impact originating from thermal energy related processes is reduced and impacts originating from electrical energy is even avoided 0 0005 dalys in addition to thermal energy electrical energy demand has a considerable impact in particular on human health and resources use it can also be noted that all systems avoid environmental and resource related impacts through the reduced utilization of iron iii chloride from 0 0004 dalys for mab to 0 0006 dalys for ahb 7 1 usd for mab to 10 9 usd for ahb this can be realized because mp incorporate p in their biomass and hence less fecl3 needs to be dosed for p precipitation however for the same reason mp systems have an impact through a reduced production of n and p rich sludge that is used as fertilizer on land this reduced nutrient application results in an increase in demand for n and p fertilizers from other sources which is reflected in the graph by impacts generated through n and p fertilizers up to 0 00029 dalys for p in ahb and up to 0 001 dalys for n in mab up to 0 000001 species year for p in ahb and up to 0 000008 for n in for mab for ahb it must also be noted that the addition of ammonium sulfate to avoid n limitation also contributes to all impact categories this effect is less pronounced for triple superphosphate that is dosed to avoid p limitation investigation of the results for soybean meal shows that for human health key contributions are a consequence of clear cutting of secondary forests in argentina and primary forests in brazil contributing more than 71 of the caused impacts fig 6 other important impacts are a result of the soybean production process itself 17 and arable land use change to annual cropping in brazil 6 a fraction of the impact 6 is avoided due to reduced production of palm oil that is substituted by the soybean oil which is a co product of the soybean meal production for ecosystem impacts species loss is mainly caused by clear cutting primary forests in brazil 33 a similar contribution is made by the production process of soybean in the us 28 followed by production in brazil 10 argentina 9 and the supplies from the rest of the world 8 finally again clear cutting of secondary forests in argentina plays a key role 6 with the remaining processes contributing less than 7 the impact of palm fruit production is not explicitly shown in the figure as individual processes have an avoided impact of less than 5 and are thus aggregated in the sum of the remaining processes see sm table 8 for a detailed breakdown of impacts resource use is a function of the ethylene petroleum and gas production ethylene must be produced because palm oil production is avoided and petrochemical based substitutes for a fraction of the palm kernel oil are now manufactured overall it can be concluded that land occupation and land use changes are key contributing categories 3 4 sensitivity analysis the results show that the overall conclusions of the lca are robust fig 7 namely there is no case in which more than 50 of the 1 000 monte carlo runs suggest that soybean meal exceeds impacts of mp on ecosystems or human health in particular the impact on ecosystems is robustly lower for mp with a maximum of 5 of the monte carlo runs indicating the opposite for human health results show that 30 of the scenarios for ahb and 7 of the scenarios for pnsb could have a lower impact than soybean meal similarly in 15 of the runs for mab the impact of soybean meal could be higher with regards to the impact on resources it can be seen that no scenario for neither ahb nor pnsb results in a better performance of these mp for mab however 29 of the runs obtained a result with a lower impact than soybean meal 4 discussion 4 1 environmental impact of microbial protein to the knowledge of the authors the present study is the first to investigate the production of mp on food and beverage wastewater using the case of potato wastewater the results show that mp exert a lower impact than soybean meal within the categories human health and ecosystems but a higher impact when resource exploitation is considered a similar conclusion is reached by taelman et al 2015 based on an exergy analysis of a small scale plant producing microalgal biomass and comparing it to soybean meal they suggest that this system leads to higher resource exploitation than soybean meal feed production in particular because of the high fossil energy use however their sensitivity analysis suggests that the microalgal mp production can become more resource efficient when energy related optimizations are implemented at larger scale indeed for resources also the sensitivity analysis of the present study suggests that mab could become more resource efficient under certain circumstances smetana et al 2017 carried out a sensitivity analysis for different microalgae production systems i e autotrophic and heterotrophic in different reactor configurations orp photobioreactor and aerobic fermenter for chlorella vulgaris and arthrospira platensis they concluded that the most promising scenario would be the combination of microalgae production in heterotrophic conditions with the use of food waste as a source of carbon and photovoltaic energy generation for cultivation however their results still indicate that even under these conditions soybean meal production would have a lower environmental impact when measured as co2 eq yet their assessment did not account for land use changes caused by the demand for soybean meal if land use changes would be included their findings may be more in line with the present study as the results indicate that land use changes contribute substantially to the impact furthermore smetana et al 2017 suggested that mp cultivation under heterotrophic conditions is preferable the present study can only confirm this conclusion for the human health category where the heterotrophic production systems for ahb and pnsb exert the lowest impact the partially photolithoautotrophic mab system shows higher impacts in the human health category due to nh3 emissions from the orp which occur at times of high photosynthetic activity and an associated rise in ph further lowering the ph may eliminate this impact but it needs to be further investigated whether more intensive flue gas sparging or other approaches can achieve this in conclusion the common denominator of the present and past studies is that for the mp investigated production can be preferable to soybean production at large scale energy optimized conditions 4 2 energy use and other process improvements results suggest that mp production generally has a high energy demand reflected in all endpoint impact categories indeed there is a consensus in the lca studies that the most resource demanding processes in the mp production systems are heat demand for drying heating of reactors as well as electricity demand for harvesting smetana et al 2017 taelman et al 2015 in the present study one exception to the above claim is the mab process while also for mab energy related issues are of importance fig 5 shows that in the human health and ecosystem categories thermal energy demand plays not the major role mab is therefore relatively energy efficient which is realized through the partially autotrophic metabolism the autotrophic metabolism enables biomass production without the utilization of cod together with the biomass n is removed from the wastewater as a consequence less cod is bypassing the uasb reactor to supply carbon to the denitrification process in the effluent treatment step in fact no by pass is implemented in this study as the required cod is provided by the reject water biomass from solid liquid separation section 2 2 4 as a result the mab system produces more biogas than the baseline scenario resulting in a net positive electricity production and a comparatively low thermal energy demand section 3 1 the mab production system therefore has the advantage of maintaining and even increasing energy i e el recuperation while producing mp another pathway to tackle energy related issues in mp production is to satisfy the energy demand with currently unused waste heat or renewable electricity sources with regards to thermal energy low grade waste heat that is currently not utilized could be used for example waste heat of refrigerator systems that are common in the potato industry could be explored as a source of heat patel and kar 2012 electricity demand for production and harvest is relatively high in the pnsb system due to the operation of the tubular photobioreactor and a poor settleability of the biomass this may further be reduced as there are indications that pnsb can be cultivated in orp garcía et al 2019 if this can be followed by a conventional settler as the first solid liquid separation step and not by using uf as in this research energy demand can be further reduced another key impact for mab and pnsb is the demand for fecl3 for p removal currently a number of potato processing industries have installed p removal through struvite precipitation desmidt et al 2013 struvite is considered a slow release p fertilizer and a recent lca study of struvite produced from municipal wastewater treatment plants suggests that environmental benefits can arise in the categories cumulative energy demand global warming potential and acidification through reduction of flocculant demand and replacement of n and p fertilizers amann et al 2018 in conclusion energetically mab production is most promising but also for the other mp production systems energy demand can further be reduced and other process improvements may be implemented in the future as a consequence a further reduction of environmental impacts in particular in the resource category can be expected 4 3 future research needs results of the study show that in particular for the human health and ecosystems categories the impacts of soybean meal exceed that of any mp by 40 and 70 respectively the analysis shows that these are strongly related to land use changes in the tropical regions and to arable land occupation by the production of soybean indeed literature does confirm the importance of land use changes but it also demonstrates that it can be rather variable castanheira and freire 2013 showed that co2 eq emissions vary between 0 1 and 17 8 kg co2 eq kg of soybean produced depending on whether land use change is avoided or whether rainforests or other types of land use are converted to soybean production given this variability the importance of determining the location of the marginal soybean production and associated land use change is crucial while the present study makes use of the widely accepted ecoinvent 3 4 data base to determine marginal suppliers it could be of research interest to evaluate the present results against the outcomes obtained when applying the methodology to determine marginal suppliers as proposed by weidema et al 2009 in that manner the impact of the uncertainty in the currently used data could be explored however more important than considering the direct land use changes may be indirect land use change schmidt et al 2015 proposes that indirect land use changes can play a more significant role than direct land use change caused by the clear cutting of land for crop cultivation adopted to the present study their proposal is that the additional area of soybean production on for example agricultural land in the us will result in a situation where the crop that is replaced by soybean must be produced elsewhere they argue that this production or the indirect land use change will almost always involve deforestation and hence have substantive environmental impact these considerations would imply that if indirect land use changes are accounted for adequately impacts of soybean meal production could be even higher than found in this study currently however the ecoinvent database does not follow the modelling methodology as proposed by schmidt et al 2015 but future studies should aim to also include these aspects finally the present lca does not account for additional functionalities of mp in particular the mab i e the microalgae specifically and pnsb do not only contain protein but also valuable essential fatty acids carotenoids and vitamins chumpol et al 2017 in a strict implementation of the consequential lca methodology environmental impacts of by products are accounted for through substitution for soybean meal this is the case of the soybean oil that is substituting other vegetable oils at the market future lca studies may therefore seek to include these other functionalities of mp by substituting comparable products at the market 5 conclusions from the results of this study it can be concluded that microbial protein mp is a novel protein source that should play a role in the future protein transition the comparison with soybean meal shows that mp produced on potato wastewater exerts lower impacts in the human health and ecosystem categories however thermal and electrical energy demand as well as avoided energy production from the baseline result in a higher impact of mp than soybean meal for the endpoint impact category resources between the three mp production systems studied mab has the lowest impact in categories ecosystems and resource use while ahb and pnsb have lower values for human health therefore another tentative conclusion is that the autotrophic growth mode has a low environmental impact in particular because the energy recuperation is maximized future research should explore further reduction in energy demand and the use of alternative energy sources especially with focus on heat demand future lca studies should also account for the fact that mp do not only contain protein but also valuable components such as polyunsaturated fatty acids carotenoids and vitamins accounting for the impact of indirect land use changes for soybean production may further increase the environmental impact gap between mp and soybean meal declaration of

18199,livestock production is utilizing large amounts of protein rich feed ingredients such as soybean meal the proven negative environmental impacts of soybean meal production incentivize the search for alternative protein sources one promising alternative is microbial protein mp i e dried microbial biomass to date only few life cycle assessments lcas for mp have been carried out none of which has used a consequential modelling approach nor has been investigating the production of mp on food and beverage wastewater therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate the environmental impact of mp production on a food and beverage effluent as a substitute for soybean meal using a consequential modelling approach three different types of mp production were analysed namely consortia containing aerobic heterotrophic bacteria ahb microalgae and ahb mab and purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb the production of mp was modelled for high strength potato wastewater cod 10 kg m3 at a flow rate of 1 000 m3 day lca results were compared against soybean meal production for the endpoint impact categories human health ecosystems and resources soybean meal showed up to 52 higher impact on human health and up to 87 higher impact on ecosystems than mp however energy related aspects resulted in an 8 88 higher resource exploitation for mp a comparison between the mp production systems showed that mab performed best when considering ecosystems between 13 and 14 better and resource between 71 and 80 better impact categories while ahb and pnsb had lower values for the impact category human health 8 12 the sensitivity analysis suggests that the conclusions drawn are robust as in the majority of 1 000 monte carlo runs the initial results are confirmed in conclusion it is suggested that mp is an alternative protein source of comparatively low environmental impact that should play a role in the future protein transition in particular when further process improvements can be implemented and more renewable or waste energy sources will be used graphical abstract image 1 keywords resource recovery nutrient recovery novel protein protein transition single cell protein purple

meal production for which an annual increase of 1 6 until 2027 is expected oecd fao 2018 this increase continues to be driven mainly by protein feed demand in china in the eu a current issue of concern is the dependency on imported soybean meal that accounts for 64 of the protein rich feed material of which 97 is imported eu 2019 most of the global soybean and soybean meal production originates from the usa brazil and argentina oecd fao 2018 in particular the production increase of soybean cultivation in recent decades in south america has raised concerns about environmental impacts as a result of land use change these impacts include amongst others greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss castanheira and freire 2013 chaudhary and kastner 2016 the increasing global demand for protein and concerns about the environmental impacts of feed and food production have led to a call for a protein transition aiking and de boer 2018 amongst the many actions necessary for this transition to take place is the search for novel feed protein sources with a lower environmental impact than traditional protein crops indeed the eu recently called for urgent action to replace imported protein with alternative european sources denanot 2018 novel protein sources include for instance insects duckweed yeasts other fungi macro and microalgae incl cyanobacteria as well as bacterial protein excl cyanobacteria of the above yeasts microalgae and bacteria can be classified as microbial protein mp or single cell protein the proponents of mp bring forward a number of compelling arguments such as matassa et al 2016 protein content comparable to soybean meal microalgae contain 40 70 and bacteria 50 80 crude protein on a dry matter dm basis compared to soybean meal with 45 57 dm high protein yields up to 20 times more protein per ha per year than soybean and 40 times more than corn excellent protein quality essential amino acid profile comparable to that of soybean meal and the majority of feeding trials indicates a similar growth and digestibility performance for a summary see pikaar et al 2018 another advantage of mp is that many types can be cultivated on wastewater and that they present a resource recovery opportunity for carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p verstraete et al 2016 especially food and beverage wastewater has been suggested to be suitable for mp production due to its relatively low contamination with pathogens and other harmful pollutants e g heavy metals exception slaughterhouse wastewater muys 2019 furthermore food and beverage wastewater can contain high concentrations of nutrients and carbon that can be utilized for mp production the present study is utilizing potato industry wastewater which typically has a cod content of 4 15 g l a n content of 0 15 0 5 g l and a phosphorus content between 0 035 and 0 08 g l these figures are based on a study of the potato industry in flanders more details can be found in supplemental material sm section 1 a literature study indicates that three mp consortia have been cultivated on wastewater including aerobic heterotrophic bacteria ahb microalgae and ahb mab and purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb ahb consortia are mainly composed of aerobic chemoorganoheterotrophs i e bacteria that use organic compounds as carbon source and electron donor and oxygen as electron acceptor similar ahb communities are widely used for biological treatment of wastewater in the conventional activated sludge process aiming at intensified mp production a high rate activated sludge process would be the most suitable technology with activated sludge to be understood as microbial biomass the high rate technology aims to maximize biomass production through using short sludge retention times srt at which a relatively large proportion of the available organic carbon is directed towards biomass growth as a consequence of oxidizing a minimum of organics to co2 the aeration demand per unit biomass produced is relatively low high rate activated sludge is thus far mainly studied and applied in sewage treatment to redirect organics to anaerobic digestion for energy production or organic commodities alloul et al 2018 meerburg et al 2015 the microbial community in high rate sewage treatment is less rich than in its conventional counterpart meerburg et al 2016 and is containing specific core genera belonging to the betaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes sub phyla gonzalez martinez et al 2016 high rate communities for food and beverage wastewater treatment are yet to be studied high rate activated sludge plants with the aim to produce mp are operating at full scale on a brewery wastewater flow of 1 500 m3 day zhejiang china terry et al 2019 and have been started up at a pilot plant operating on a potato wastewater flow of 80 100 m3 day at clarebout potatoes flanders belgium avecom 2019 microalgae ahb mab cultivation systems or high rate algal ponds for wastewater treatment take advantage of a bidirectional product substrate exchange between photolithoautotrophic microalgae and ahb in light microalgae provide o2 for ahb growth and the ahb supply co2 as a carbon source for the microalgae therefore minimizing or even avoiding the need for conventional aeration van den hende et al 2014 another rationale to consider heterotrophs in algal reactors for wastewater treatment is that heterotrophs are likely to naturally thrive in non sterile microalgae cultivation in the presence of influent cod which consequently improves the cod removal and effluent quality in addition mab biomass was found to bioflocculate and hence settle well therefore improving harvestability compared to pure microalgal cultures valigore et al 2012 the predominant microalgal genera in mab systems on wastewater differ by study but often belong to the genera scenedesmus acutudesmus oocystis microspora stigeoclonium actinastrum micractinium pediastrum monoraphidium coelastrum chlorella ankistrodesmus or and phormidium van den hende 2014 ahb detected in these systems include bacteroidetes verrucomicrobia firmicutes planctomycetes and alpha beta gamma delta and epsilonproteobacteria lee et al 2013 su et al 2011 microalgae are used as feed products or feed ingredients and especially mab biomass has been studied as an aquaculture feed van den hende et al 2014 the technology for production of microalgae in raceway reactors is commercially available with a number of full scale installations mainly in asia but also in europe and other continents pnsb are purple phototrophic bacteria belonging to the alpha and betaproteobacteria even though they are considered to be the metabolically most versatile microorganisms anaerobic anoxygenic photoheterotrophy is the growth mode that has received most attention in literature in this mode with volatile fatty acids vfa as organics pnsb have a near to 100 carbon yield biomass c produced vfa c removed alloul et al 2019 only pnsb can be grown on infra red light which enables the selective enrichment of these organisms in open mixed cultures another advantage is that pnsb do not require aeration with o2 or co2 supply for their growth which is one of the limiting factors in aerobic heterotrophic or photolithoautotrophic growth hülsen et al 2014 pnsb used for or enriched during wastewater treatment include rhodopseudomonas palustris rhodovulum sulfidophilum rhodocyclus gelatinosus rubrivivax gelatinosus rhodobacter sphaeroides rhodospirillum rubrum of which r palustris was found to dominate at longer srt and r sphaeroides at shorter srt alloul et al 2019 mp production from pnsb grown on wastewater is an innovative approach and to the authors knowledge not yet available at full scale its potential has also been realized by the european space agency which investigates pnsb as a food protein source to grow on fermented organic waste for regenerative life support clauwaert et al 2017 of the mp described above comparative life cycle assessments lcas to evaluate the environmental impacts caused by mp production have so far only been carried out for microalgae production systems in photolithoautotrophic or heterotrophic metabolism furthermore no study has investigated the life cycle of mp produced on food and beverage wastewater from the available lca studies conclusions about the environmental sustainability of mp in comparison to soybean meal were mixed according to smetana et al 2017 the autotrophic and heterotrophic growth of chlorella vulgaris and autotrophic growth of arthrospira platensis were considered to have a higher environmental impact than the reference feeds e g soybean meal however in their discussion they indicated that the production under heterotrophic conditions with the use of food waste as a carbon source would be most promising sfez et al 2015 evaluated the production of a consortium of mab flocs on recirculation aquaculture water in an outdoor open raceway pond opr they concluded that valorization of dried mab flocs as shrimp feed has a lower marine eutrophication and a similar freshwater eutrophication than using mab flocs for biogas production in a comparative exergy evaluation of microalgae and soybean meal taelman et al 2015 concluded that soybean meal is the preferred feed ingredient when benchmarked against phototrophic microalgae production however they also suggested that with further optimisation a similar exergy based resource footprint can be realized in an earlier study by taelman et al 2013 microalgae nannochloropsis sp were cultivated in an orp it was concluded that the production of microalgae can have a smaller exergy based impact than fish feed 8 fishmeal and 25 soybean meal if the process is further optimized in addition to these lca studies pikaar et al 2018 investigated mp production using aerobic heterotrophic fermentation as well as autotrophic production from hydrogen gas and methane most of their scenarios show avoided crop land expansion co2 eq emissions and nitrogen pollution by producing mp they however did not apply an lca methodology and did compare to an animal feed basket rather than soybean meal production all the lca studies reviewed above employed an attributional modelling approach to assess the environmental impact this type of lca aims to answer the question of how are pollutants resources and exchanges among processes flowing within a chosen temporal window weidema et al 2018 in other words the results represent the environmental impact of an average product which is already produced to investigate the environmental consequences of the implementation of mp production a more appropriate method is consequential lca modelling which seeks to answer the question of how will flows of pollutants resources and exchanges among processes change in response to decisions weidema et al 2018 therefore the results only include products processes or suppliers that are affected by a change i e the marginal suppliers for instance through the introduction of a novel and innovative technology to the market in this regard a consequential modelling approach is the most appropriate in the context of this study due to the absence of lca studies that compare different types of microbial metabolisms and the lack of a consequential lca on this topic it is the objective of this study to evaluate the environmental impact of the three different mp production systems introduced using a consequential modelling method 2 methodology 2 1 lca methodology this study follows the consequential lca modelling approach as described by weidema et al 2009 this approach implies that only the environmental impact of processes that are expected to be affected by a change are accounted for in the present case for example mp production alters the state of the art or baseline of potato wastewater treatment process when implementing mp production the baseline potato wastewater treatment process is replaced in the model this is accounted for as follows 1 net flow x mp gross flow x mp fu q gross flow x base fu q where gross flow xmp is the flow or emission of substance x of the mp production system and gross flow xbase is the flow of substance x of the baseline potato wastewater treatment fuq is a scaling factor or reference flow that sets the gross flows to the volume of wastewater required to produce 1 functional unit fu the fu of this cradle to plant gate study is the production of 1 ton crude protein cp another feature of consequential lca is that an increase in demand will be met by suppliers that are more competitive while a decrease in demand for a product will result in the least competitive suppliers leaving the market in other words only the marginal suppliers are affected by a change instead of simply increasing or decreasing the current average production mix therefore the production systems of the three mp types described above were compared to the current marginal supplier for protein feed namely soybean meal multiple suppliers were taken into account and represented in a marginal mix the process soybean meal at the global market of the consequential system model of ecoinvent 3 4 was taken to represent the marginal market mix for soybean meal another frequently discussed protein sources is fishmeal however fishmeal production is considered to be declining or stagnating globally olsen and hasan 2012 and products with this characteristic do not qualify as marginal suppliers therefore fishmeal is not investigated in this study a final feature of the consequential modelling is that by products are accounted for through substitution of functionally similar products at the market e g those supplied by a marginal supplier as in this study is the case for the substitution of palm oil by soybean oil section 3 3 the geographical location of mp production facilities is belgium a zero burden approach was implemented i e upstream production of the potato and its processing is not accounted for as potato wastewater is currently considered a waste product that undergoes treatment ekvall et al 2007 foreground life cycle inventory lci data for mp production and treatment of potato wastewater were derived from a mass balance prepared in excel all assumptions applied in the mass balance are based on literature data sm section 1 all exchanges e g emissions energy demand etc were entered into simapro 8 4 using data from the ecoinvent 3 4 database applying the ecoinvent consequential system model for determination of marginal suppliers to facilitate interpretation of the results they are presented at endpoint level in the categories human health ecosystems and resources derived using the recipe v1 13 impact assessment method hierarchist version with global normalization the determination of emission and energy demand generation is detailed in the sm section 1 4 a sensitivity analysis was carried out using monte carlo simulations implemented in simapro the foreground parameters varied were those with the highest impact on the results background parameters were varied as defined in the relevant ecoinvent processes specifically this concerned the energy related parameters and ammonia emissions uniform distributions using the ranges shown in the sm section 5 were implemented to generate 1 000 pairwise comparative runs of mp production systems and soybean meal uniform distributions were chosen because more detailed distributions could not be generated from the limited literature information 2 2 process descriptions and data collection 2 2 1 potato wastewater definition the scale of the mp production as well as the baseline was defined by a model potato processing effluent with flow rate of 1 000 m3 day and an influent composition of 10 kg cod m³ 0 3 kg n m³ 0 06 kg p m³ this corresponds to a high strength potato wastewater as found in potato processing companies in belgium sm section 1 the temperature of the incoming process water was assumed to be 40 c as it is commonly found in the potato industry all effluent is treated before discharge to meet the effluent quality common in the potato industry fig 1 section 2 2 6 n ammonium sulfate and p triple superphosphate were supplied in addition to the wastewater where this was required to either maximize biomass growth or to avoid nutrient limitation during the final effluent treatment for ahb only biomass composition sm section 1 for photolithotrophic production values from studies using summer conditions were used i e temperature and light any sludge produced that was not used as a feed ingredient was applied to land replacing n and p fertilizers the substitution is estimated for n based on the mineral fertilizer equivalent mfe of sewage sludge delin et al 2012 2 m f e 87 5 c n r a t i o at a the c n ratio of 5 in sewage sludge this results in a mineral fertilizer equivalent of 62 which is the value adopted in this study the agronomic effectiveness of p derived from sludge biomass was derived from studies that investigated sewage sludge in general the results show a wide range of values of between 10 and 100 when compared to triple superphosphate the value adopted in the research is 64 derived from the work of andriamananjara et al 2016 which is comparable to the work of o riordan et al 1987 who detected average efficiencies between 74 and 79 both studies included sludge that was precipitated with iron or aluminum salts 2 2 2 baseline water treatment the baseline process describes a wastewater treatment process as it is encountered in the potato processing industry it is comprised of an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor followed by an activated sludge process the uasb is used to remove a part of the influent cod and for biogas generation the activated sludge process with nitrification denitrification is applied to meet cod and n discharge limits while the defined p limit is met via chemical precipitation of fepo4 by dosing fecl3 fig 1 section 2 2 6 2 2 3 production of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria ahb ahb cultivation is carried out on potato processing wastewater in two stages fig 1 the first stage is a fully aerated tank at an srt of 1 day the ahb biomass produced at this stage is separated with a lamella settler doubling the biomass concentration to 6 86 kg tss m3 0 7 dm the liquid from this settler still contains about 3 kg cod m3 which is utilized to produce more ahb biomass in a second stage reactor with an srt of 6 days modelled as described in section 2 2 6 this biomass is again settled and centrifuged together with the biomass from reactor 1 25 dm after which the biomass is dried to obtain a market ready product with a dm concentration of 90 supernatants and permeates produced here are again channeled to the second reactor for treatment as biomass growth is limited by n and p concentrations in the wastewater these nutrients are added to maximize biomass production since n ammonium sulfate and p triple superphosphate are dosed to match the biomass growth demand residual concentrations of these elements in the effluent are below the defined standard and therefore no fecl3 dosing or nitrification denitrification is required 2 2 4 production of microalgae ahb mab mab biomass is cultivated on the effluent of the uasb reactor in naturally illuminated orps using a paddle wheel for agitation as applied by van den hende et al 2014 the uasb converts cod to ch4 enabling the recovery of electricity and thermal energy in a combined heat and power chp unit furthermore the dissolved inorganic carbon present in the uasb effluent is used as a carbon source and ph buffer the consortium composition of the microalgae and bacteria in the mab flocs was estimated stoichiometrically the o2 demand by heterotrophs is met at a heterotrophs to microalgae ratio of about 0 7 sm section 1 3 however because not all o2 is accessible for the heterotrophs a ratio of 0 6 was assumed in practice the ph of the orp may rise to levels above 9 during periods of intense illumination due to photosynthetic co2 removal to avoid the negative consequences of such a ph rise i e lower biomass production and nh3 emissions flue gas from the chp unit process is sparged to maintain a ph below 8 van den hende et al 2014 the biomass concentration realized in the orp is 0 5 kg tss m3 van den hende et al 2014 the biomass produced in the orp is settled resulting in 0 1 dm centrifuged 25 dm and spray dried to 90 dm all supernatants and permeates are treated in the effluent treatment step that comprises biological cod removal nitrification denitrification and fecl3 addition for p removal fig 1 no bypass of the effluent is required as the cod demand for denitrification is satisfied by the effluent from the solid liquid separation steps 2 2 5 production of purple non sulfur bacteria pnsb the cultivation of pnsb begins with a hydrolytic acidogenic and acetogenic fermentation step with the purpose of converting incoming cod into vfa that act as electron donor and carbon source for pnsb biomass growth the produced h2 is burned in a chp generating electrical and thermal energy following the anaerobic fermentation pnsb are produced in an outdoor tubular photobioreactor illuminated with natural light fig 1 as in carlozzi and sacchi 2001 an srt of 1 day was used resulting in a biomass concentration of 1 2 kg tss m3 the biomass is harvested using ultrafiltration uf to a concentration of 10 dm followed by a centrifugation step resulting in a dm concentration of 25 before finally being spray dried to 90 dm as the codvfa removal efficiency of pnsb at srt 1 day is only 57 and since the acidification step only removes 11 of the cod sm section 1 1 2 76 of the incoming cod is still available to further remove this remaining cod the tubular photobioreactor is followed by a uasb reactor to remove cod and produce biogas a bypass of 0 7 7 m3 d of the influent to the uasb is implemented to provide cod for denitrification in the activated sludge process 2 2 6 final water treatment to dischargeable quality all mp production systems are followed by an effluent treatment step the target composition of the effluent has been defined as the average of the flemish potato industries sm section 1 specifically the target values are 37 mg cod l 7 mg n l and 1 5 mg p l all treatment systems are based on the activated sludge processes for cod and n removal including nitrification denitrification except ahb and on chemical p removal by fecl3 dosage except for ahb the biomass yield and associated removal rates were calculated as detailed in sm section 1 4 following the biological treatment sludge is settled in a lamella separator and centrifuged to realize a dm of 25 before disposal of the sludge to land the fecl3 dosing is determined based on the stoichiometric ratio of 5 25 g fecl3 g p removed and multiplied by the efficiency factor of 1 5 tchobanoglous et al 2003 the sludge produced from the precipitation i e fepo4 is added to the biologically produced sludge sludge is applied to land replacing n and p fertilizers except for ahb where all sludge is used as a feed section 2 2 3 3 results 3 1 energy balance energy generation energy demand as well as the gross energy flows per fu i e the generated energy during mp production minus the energy consumed during mp production are shown in fig 2 the gross energy flow for the different mp systems are ahb of about 1 800 kwh el fu and 9 100 kwh th fu mab of about 40 000 kwh el fu and about 52 000 kwh th fu and pnsb of about 8 000 kwh el fu and 8 800 kwh th fu the large difference in the overall values between the mp systems are partially a function of the mp system characteristics such as their ability to generate energy while producing mp as is the case for mab however importantly the differences are also a result of the production efficiencies measured as fuq see equation 1 while ahb produces one ton of crude protein i e the fu on fuq 375 m3 of wastewater mab requires fuq 4 333 m3 and pnsb fuq 1 734 m3 these different efficiencies are also reflected in the base values which are calculated using the same fuq in accordance with equation 1 these base values or the energy production demand of conventional baseline potato wastewater treatment are subtracted from the values obtained for the mp production systems i e because the process is avoided the resulting value is denoted as netahbmp netmabmp and netpnsbmp respectively in fig 2 it can be observed that all processes have a net electrical and thermal energy demand with the exception of mab that has a net positive electrical energy balance of about 2 500 kwh the reason that mab has a net electricity production is that biomass growth in this system is partially autotrophic and n is incorporated in microalgal biomass without cod demand therefore compared to the baseline more cod can be anaerobically digested in the mab scenario as no cod needs to be bypassed for n removal in the denitrification effluent treatment step as a result the overall electricity balance is positive as more biogas and energy is produced the main processes contributing to the net electricity demand are in particular harvesting production for pnsb and avoided energy generation ahb pnsb fig 2 however heat demand generally exceeds electrical energy demand and is dominated by the drying process 9 100 kwh fu ahb 8 500 kwh fu mab 9 600 kwh fu pnsb in addition to the energy data described above detailed and comprehensive life cycle inventory data are provided in sm table 6 in this section only the energy related information were presented in detail as they have a pivotal impact see section 3 3 3 2 impact assessment results show that for the human health and the ecosystem categories mp cause lower impacts than soybean meal while they cause a higher impact in the category resources fig 3 life cycle inventory sm table 6 in detail for human health disability adjusted life years dalys ahb and pnsb obtain a similar score of 48 52 relative to soybean meal while the impact of mab is somewhat higher at 60 for ecosystems impacts species year again ahb and pnsb have similar values of 28 and 26 relative to soybean meal with mab showing a clearly lower value of 13 for resource depletion us dollar usd ahb has the highest impact 100 followed by pnsb with 91 of the impact relative to ahb mab show an impact of only 20 of that of ahb and soybean meal production causes an impact of 12 relative to ahb fig 4 shows the contribution of individual mindpoint categories to the endpoint impacts it clearly displays that impacts on human health are mainly a function of climate change indicators with the exception of mab where most of the endpoint impact is originating from particulate matter formation the main contributors to ecosystem impacts are climate change and agricultural land occupation for ahb and pnsb mab show comparatively low impacts in this category for soybean meal the agricultural land occupation natural land transformation and climate change impacts have high contributions in particular soybean meal shows three times higher contribution in agricultural land occupation and nearly double the natural land transformation than mp it is hence these two impact categories that are responsible for the big difference on the ecosystems endpoint impacts above in this study resource use is measured as fossil depletion only and hence simply reflects the results as shown in the impact assessment of fig 3 3 3 contribution analysis in order to further understand the reasons for the observed impacts results are presented as a function of the contributing processes fig 5 shows that the contributions across all endpoint impact categories are a result of heat demand sm table 7 for details the exception to this is mab where the main contribution to human health impact is derived from direct emissions 0 006 dalys this is mainly due to gaseous emissions of nh3 from the orp section 2 2 4 another reason for this is that mab has a relatively low heat demand and is even a net electricity producing system therefore the relative impact originating from thermal energy related processes is reduced and impacts originating from electrical energy is even avoided 0 0005 dalys in addition to thermal energy electrical energy demand has a considerable impact in particular on human health and resources use it can also be noted that all systems avoid environmental and resource related impacts through the reduced utilization of iron iii chloride from 0 0004 dalys for mab to 0 0006 dalys for ahb 7 1 usd for mab to 10 9 usd for ahb this can be realized because mp incorporate p in their biomass and hence less fecl3 needs to be dosed for p precipitation however for the same reason mp systems have an impact through a reduced production of n and p rich sludge that is used as fertilizer on land this reduced nutrient application results in an increase in demand for n and p fertilizers from other sources which is reflected in the graph by impacts generated through n and p fertilizers up to 0 00029 dalys for p in ahb and up to 0 001 dalys for n in mab up to 0 000001 species year for p in ahb and up to 0 000008 for n in for mab for ahb it must also be noted that the addition of ammonium sulfate to avoid n limitation also contributes to all impact categories this effect is less pronounced for triple superphosphate that is dosed to avoid p limitation investigation of the results for soybean meal shows that for human health key contributions are a consequence of clear cutting of secondary forests in argentina and primary forests in brazil contributing more than 71 of the caused impacts fig 6 other important impacts are a result of the soybean production process itself 17 and arable land use change to annual cropping in brazil 6 a fraction of the impact 6 is avoided due to reduced production of palm oil that is substituted by the soybean oil which is a co product of the soybean meal production for ecosystem impacts species loss is mainly caused by clear cutting primary forests in brazil 33 a similar contribution is made by the production process of soybean in the us 28 followed by production in brazil 10 argentina 9 and the supplies from the rest of the world 8 finally again clear cutting of secondary forests in argentina plays a key role 6 with the remaining processes contributing less than 7 the impact of palm fruit production is not explicitly shown in the figure as individual processes have an avoided impact of less than 5 and are thus aggregated in the sum of the remaining processes see sm table 8 for a detailed breakdown of impacts resource use is a function of the ethylene petroleum and gas production ethylene must be produced because palm oil production is avoided and petrochemical based substitutes for a fraction of the palm kernel oil are now manufactured overall it can be concluded that land occupation and land use changes are key contributing categories 3 4 sensitivity analysis the results show that the overall conclusions of the lca are robust fig 7 namely there is no case in which more than 50 of the 1 000 monte carlo runs suggest that soybean meal exceeds impacts of mp on ecosystems or human health in particular the impact on ecosystems is robustly lower for mp with a maximum of 5 of the monte carlo runs indicating the opposite for human health results show that 30 of the scenarios for ahb and 7 of the scenarios for pnsb could have a lower impact than soybean meal similarly in 15 of the runs for mab the impact of soybean meal could be higher with regards to the impact on resources it can be seen that no scenario for neither ahb nor pnsb results in a better performance of these mp for mab however 29 of the runs obtained a result with a lower impact than soybean meal 4 discussion 4 1 environmental impact of microbial protein to the knowledge of the authors the present study is the first to investigate the production of mp on food and beverage wastewater using the case of potato wastewater the results show that mp exert a lower impact than soybean meal within the categories human health and ecosystems but a higher impact when resource exploitation is considered a similar conclusion is reached by taelman et al 2015 based on an exergy analysis of a small scale plant producing microalgal biomass and comparing it to soybean meal they suggest that this system leads to higher resource exploitation than soybean meal feed production in particular because of the high fossil energy use however their sensitivity analysis suggests that the microalgal mp production can become more resource efficient when energy related optimizations are implemented at larger scale indeed for resources also the sensitivity analysis of the present study suggests that mab could become more resource efficient under certain circumstances smetana et al 2017 carried out a sensitivity analysis for different microalgae production systems i e autotrophic and heterotrophic in different reactor configurations orp photobioreactor and aerobic fermenter for chlorella vulgaris and arthrospira platensis they concluded that the most promising scenario would be the combination of microalgae production in heterotrophic conditions with the use of food waste as a source of carbon and photovoltaic energy generation for cultivation however their results still indicate that even under these conditions soybean meal production would have a lower environmental impact when measured as co2 eq yet their assessment did not account for land use changes caused by the demand for soybean meal if land use changes would be included their findings may be more in line with the present study as the results indicate that land use changes contribute substantially to the impact furthermore smetana et al 2017 suggested that mp cultivation under heterotrophic conditions is preferable the present study can only confirm this conclusion for the human health category where the heterotrophic production systems for ahb and pnsb exert the lowest impact the partially photolithoautotrophic mab system shows higher impacts in the human health category due to nh3 emissions from the orp which occur at times of high photosynthetic activity and an associated rise in ph further lowering the ph may eliminate this impact but it needs to be further investigated whether more intensive flue gas sparging or other approaches can achieve this in conclusion the common denominator of the present and past studies is that for the mp investigated production can be preferable to soybean production at large scale energy optimized conditions 4 2 energy use and other process improvements results suggest that mp production generally has a high energy demand reflected in all endpoint impact categories indeed there is a consensus in the lca studies that the most resource demanding processes in the mp production systems are heat demand for drying heating of reactors as well as electricity demand for harvesting smetana et al 2017 taelman et al 2015 in the present study one exception to the above claim is the mab process while also for mab energy related issues are of importance fig 5 shows that in the human health and ecosystem categories thermal energy demand plays not the major role mab is therefore relatively energy efficient which is realized through the partially autotrophic metabolism the autotrophic metabolism enables biomass production without the utilization of cod together with the biomass n is removed from the wastewater as a consequence less cod is bypassing the uasb reactor to supply carbon to the denitrification process in the effluent treatment step in fact no by pass is implemented in this study as the required cod is provided by the reject water biomass from solid liquid separation section 2 2 4 as a result the mab system produces more biogas than the baseline scenario resulting in a net positive electricity production and a comparatively low thermal energy demand section 3 1 the mab production system therefore has the advantage of maintaining and even increasing energy i e el recuperation while producing mp another pathway to tackle energy related issues in mp production is to satisfy the energy demand with currently unused waste heat or renewable electricity sources with regards to thermal energy low grade waste heat that is currently not utilized could be used for example waste heat of refrigerator systems that are common in the potato industry could be explored as a source of heat patel and kar 2012 electricity demand for production and harvest is relatively high in the pnsb system due to the operation of the tubular photobioreactor and a poor settleability of the biomass this may further be reduced as there are indications that pnsb can be cultivated in orp garcía et al 2019 if this can be followed by a conventional settler as the first solid liquid separation step and not by using uf as in this research energy demand can be further reduced another key impact for mab and pnsb is the demand for fecl3 for p removal currently a number of potato processing industries have installed p removal through struvite precipitation desmidt et al 2013 struvite is considered a slow release p fertilizer and a recent lca study of struvite produced from municipal wastewater treatment plants suggests that environmental benefits can arise in the categories cumulative energy demand global warming potential and acidification through reduction of flocculant demand and replacement of n and p fertilizers amann et al 2018 in conclusion energetically mab production is most promising but also for the other mp production systems energy demand can further be reduced and other process improvements may be implemented in the future as a consequence a further reduction of environmental impacts in particular in the resource category can be expected 4 3 future research needs results of the study show that in particular for the human health and ecosystems categories the impacts of soybean meal exceed that of any mp by 40 and 70 respectively the analysis shows that these are strongly related to land use changes in the tropical regions and to arable land occupation by the production of soybean indeed literature does confirm the importance of land use changes but it also demonstrates that it can be rather variable castanheira and freire 2013 showed that co2 eq emissions vary between 0 1 and 17 8 kg co2 eq kg of soybean produced depending on whether land use change is avoided or whether rainforests or other types of land use are converted to soybean production given this variability the importance of determining the location of the marginal soybean production and associated land use change is crucial while the present study makes use of the widely accepted ecoinvent 3 4 data base to determine marginal suppliers it could be of research interest to evaluate the present results against the outcomes obtained when applying the methodology to determine marginal suppliers as proposed by weidema et al 2009 in that manner the impact of the uncertainty in the currently used data could be explored however more important than considering the direct land use changes may be indirect land use change schmidt et al 2015 proposes that indirect land use changes can play a more significant role than direct land use change caused by the clear cutting of land for crop cultivation adopted to the present study their proposal is that the additional area of soybean production on for example agricultural land in the us will result in a situation where the crop that is replaced by soybean must be produced elsewhere they argue that this production or the indirect land use change will almost always involve deforestation and hence have substantive environmental impact these considerations would imply that if indirect land use changes are accounted for adequately impacts of soybean meal production could be even higher than found in this study currently however the ecoinvent database does not follow the modelling methodology as proposed by schmidt et al 2015 but future studies should aim to also include these aspects finally the present lca does not account for additional functionalities of mp in particular the mab i e the microalgae specifically and pnsb do not only contain protein but also valuable essential fatty acids carotenoids and vitamins chumpol et al 2017 in a strict implementation of the consequential lca methodology environmental impacts of by products are accounted for through substitution for soybean meal this is the case of the soybean oil that is substituting other vegetable oils at the market future lca studies may therefore seek to include these other functionalities of mp by substituting comparable products at the market 5 conclusions from the results of this study it can be concluded that microbial protein mp is a novel protein source that should play a role in the future protein transition the comparison with soybean meal shows that mp produced on potato wastewater exerts lower impacts in the human health and ecosystem categories however thermal and electrical energy demand as well as avoided energy production from the baseline result in a higher impact of mp than soybean meal for the endpoint impact category resources between the three mp production systems studied mab has the lowest impact in categories ecosystems and resource use while ahb and pnsb have lower values for human health therefore another tentative conclusion is that the autotrophic growth mode has a low environmental impact in particular because the energy recuperation is maximized future research should explore further reduction in energy demand and the use of alternative energy sources especially with focus on heat demand future lca studies should also account for the fact that mp do not only contain protein but also valuable components such as polyunsaturated fatty acids carotenoids and vitamins accounting for the impact of indirect land use changes for soybean production may further increase the environmental impact gap between mp and soybean meal declaration of
