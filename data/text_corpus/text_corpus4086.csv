20430,wave current interaction affects both wave characteristics and current properties and therefore the combined forces on coastal structures in the first part of this paper a series of experiments on the solitary wave current interaction are conducted to investigate how the wave height and water velocity are affected by the wave current interaction then a vertical cylinder widely used as the foundation of coastal structures is mounted into the wave flume a series of experiments on the solitary wave current interaction with the cylinder are carried out to investigate the combined flow induced forces the experimental results indicate that 1 when solitary wave travels with following currents current travels with the same direction of the solitary wave wave height decreases with increasing current velocity the effect of following current on wave height reduction is more significant for waves with smaller original wave height and in deeper water depth when traveling with opposing currents current travels with the opposing direction of the solitary wave wave height does not vary monotonically with current velocity but shows an increase followed by a decrease 2 when a solitary wave travels with following currents the water velocity near still water level is equal to the linear superposition of water velocity of wave alone and current alone 3 a nonlinear superposition method is suggested to predict the combined solitary wave following current induced forces keywords solitary wave current interaction wave current cylinder interaction wave height current velocity wave force 1 introduction in the natural marine environment ocean waves and current flows exist simultaneously for example during the early stage of a storm surge event with the rise of the water level landward currents are formed meanwhile waves traveling toward the seashore ride on the landward currents the situation of the wave with a following current whereas when a storm surge is leaving currents change the propagation direction to seaward and the waves still travel to the seashore the situation of the wave with opposing current xiao et al 2013 the nonlinear interactions between waves and currents imply exchanges of energy and therefore wave characteristics current properties and their combined forces acting on coastal structures are affected the characteristics such as eulerian mean velocity reynolds stress and turbulent intensities of combined wave current flow have been extensively studied since the 1970s van hoften and karaki 1976 kemp and simons 1982 1983 asano and iwagaki 1985 van der kaaij and nueuwjaar 1987 nap and van kampen 1988 van rijn et al 1993 klopman 1994 1997 umeyama 2005 2009 2011 olabarrieta et al 2010 teles et al 2013 among these eulerian mean velocity is of great concern for its important impact on sediment transportation and wave forces acting on coastal structures prior studies indicated that the mean velocity profiles observed in current alone are modified due to the supposition of waves on the current when waves travel with following currents the mean velocity near the flume bed is increased and decreased near the water surface whereas when waves travel with opposing currents mean velocity along the water column departs from the logarithmic velocity especially near the water surface some analytical and numerical models were developed to explain the mechanisms of the observed changes in mean velocity some researchers such as dingemans et al 1996 klopman 1997 attributed the changes to the craik leibovich cl vortex force some other researchers such as you 1996 nielsen and you 1997 groeneweg and klopman 1998 huang and mei 2003 considered the wave induced reynolds stress as the main possible explanation of the changes in the mean velocity profile in order to investigate which effect are relatively important to the mean velocity changes groeneweg and battjes 2003 developed a 2dv wave current interaction model and concluded that the reynolds stress is dominant over the cl vortex force in addition yang et al 2006 investigated other factors that influence the velocity profile they found that both the reynolds stress the flow s uniformity and the secondary current caused by the sidewall greatly affect the velocity profile besides the wave induced influence on the current the changes of wave characteristics such as wave amplitudes wave lengths and wave traveling speed due to the interaction are also important issues for ocean engineering several experimental studies van hoften and karaki 1976 kemp and simons 1983 asano et al 1986 simons et al 1988 umeyama 2005 koo and kim 2007 ning et al 2014 liu et al 2016 chen et al 2017 and numerical studies ryu et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 2015 have been carried out to investigate such problems general conclusions have been obtained when wave rides on following currents the stretching effect of the following currents decreases wave height and prolongs wavelength contrariwise the compression effect of opposing currents increases wave height and shortens wavelength wave travels faster due to the addition of following current and travels slower due to the addition of opposing currents additionally the experimental results of van hoften and karaki 1976 and kemp and simons 1983 indicated that the attenuation rate of wave height decreases if waves propagate with a following current whereas it increases if waves ride on opposing currents although great efforts have been made to study the effect of wave current interaction on both the waves and current flows the previously mentioned studies mainly focused on the interactions between currents and regular or irregular waves limited studies are focusing on the interaction of solitary wave and current solitary wave as a classical wave model with large wave length is widely used for describing the storm leading waves tsunami waves and long period waves during storm surges or tsunami events the combined action of wave and current may pose great threats to coastal structures benjamin 1962 calculated the propagation of a solitary wave on currents with any type of velocity distribution by using stream function vanden broeck 1994 investigated the solitary wave in the presence of the linear shear background currents by using a boundary integral equation choi 2003 derived a set of evolution equations for the solitary wave in the presence of a linear shear background current by using the asymptotic solution their results indicated that the following current narrows the wave profile and opposing currents widens the wave profile pak and chow 2009 studied the wave profile wave speed and streamline when the solitary wave travels with non uniform shear currents by using third order expansions duan et al 2018 obtained a steady solution of the combined solitary wave linear shear current motion by using the gn green naghdi equations the wave profiles obtained by duan et al 2018 provided higher accuracy than that of pak and chow 2009 for large amplitude solitary waves in addition they founded that the velocity distribution for the wave current motion is quite different from the linear sum of the velocity distribution for the wave alone and current alone wang et al 2020 obtained the steady solution of solitary waves in shear currents by using the hlgn high level green naghdi model focusing on large amplitude solitary waves in strong opposing shear current and considering linear quadratic and cubic type currents their results indicated that the current type shows little influence on wave profile but significant influence on velocity distribution wave speed and particle trajectory zhang et al 2014 2015 studied the nonlinear interaction between solitary wave and current based on ns navier stokes equation they concluded that the solitary wave has a smaller wave height larger wave span and higher traveling speed after interacting with a following current contrariwise the solitary wave becomes higher with smaller wave span and lower traveling speed after interacting with an opposing current meanwhile the solitary wave coastal structure interaction has been widely studied for example the solitary wave induced forces on coastal bridges with a wide variety of deck geometries including the plate deck kulin 1958 french 1969 seiffert et al 2016 t type deck mcpherson 2008 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 xu and cai 2014 2015 xu et al 2015 xu et al 2016a 2016b 2016c 2017 2018 and box type deck azadbakht 2013 hayashi 2013 mazinani et al 2014 istrati 2017 huang et al 2018a 2018b 2019a 2019b have been studied both experimentally and numerically as expected the solitary wave induced forces on these bridge models are larger with higher wave height and higher wave velocity the process of the solitary wave propagating over the cylinder piles also attracted great interest because the cylinder piles have been widely used as the foundation of coastal structures the wave forces on a cylinder and the wave run up around the cylinder have been investigated yates and wang 1994 zhao et al 2007 mo et al 2007 2013 2013 cao and wan 2015 li et al 2018 additionally the wave body interaction under combined wave current flow for gravity cages zhao et al 2007 xu et al 2013 surface piecing structures li and lin 2015 cylinders lin and li 2003 kim et al 2016 bridge tower wei et al 2017 bridge girder zhang et al 2020 and bridge cofferdam kang et al 2020 have been studied when it comes to the solitary wave current structure interaction there are limited studies qu et al 2018 investigated the hydrodynamic load on a bridge deck under the joint action of solitary waves and currents the numerical investigation indicated that the horizontal maximum force becomes larger due to the presence of the following current and it becomes smaller due to the addition of the opposing current xiao et al 2013 developed a numerical model to simulate the joint action of solitary wave and uniform current on a horizontal cylinder the wave current induced forces on the cylinder are compared with wave force current force and the linear sum of wave force and current force results showed that the combined flow induced forces are different from the simple summation although these analytical and numerical literature make great efforts to understand the mechanics of solitary wave current interaction and solitary wave current structure interaction experimental studies are indispensable to further understand the nonlinear interaction in the present paper a series of experiments on solitary wave current interaction are conducted to investigate how the wave height and water velocity are affected by the nonlinear interaction then a vertical cylinder widely used as the foundation of coastal structures is mounted into the wave current flume a series of experiments on the combined solitary wave current interaction with the cylinder are carried out to investigate the combined flow induced forces the paper is arranged as follows the first part introduces the experimental setup and the facilities used in the experiments in the second part experimental results of the solitary wave current interaction are presented the effect of wave current interaction on wave heights and water particle velocities are discussed separately then experimental results of solitary wave current cylinder interaction are presented in the third part the interaction process of the cylinder with wave alone wave following current and wave opposing current are compared and discussed in detail finally some conclusions are given based on prior discussions 2 experimental setup 2 1 facilities and instrumentation experiments are conducted in the southwest jiaotong university s deep water long span bridge laboratory in the school of civil engineering the wave current flume is 60 m long 2 0 m wide and 1 8 m high as shown in fig 1 waves are generated by the piston type wavemaker installed at the right side of the flume the wavemaker system consists of a servo controller servo driver servo moto and wave paddle when in use the servo controller receives the motion direction signal and the motion speed signal which is translated from the aimed waves then the signals are sent to the servo driver to drive the reciprocating movement of the servo motor connected to the ball screw which in turn drives the wave paddle to push and pull the water generating aimed waves to generate smooth solitary waves trajectory of the wave paddle follows the equations as below 1 d ξ d t u ξ t c η x ξ d η x ξ 2 η h sec h h 2 k c t ξ 3 k 3 h 4 d 3 4 c g d h where h is the solitary wave height d is the water depth ξ is the position of the wave paddle c is the solitary wave speed t is the time η is the solitary wave surface and g is the acceleration of gravity once the initial position of the wave crest the wave height and the still water depth have been given the motion of the wave paddle ξ can be derived as follows goring 1979 5 ξ t h k d tanh k c t ξ currents are driven by a recirculation system which consists of the bidirectional flow pump frequency transducer flow pipeline and current sharing tanks when in use the control program calculates the control current according to the aimed current velocity and outputs it to the frequency transducer to control the rotation speed and the rotation direction of the pump the wave absorber is placed at the left side of the wave current flume to reduce the wave reflection and eliminate the majority of wave energy it is tested that the absorption capacity of the wave absorber is more than 92 in the main wavelength range in addition there is an instrument test frame at the top of the wave flume which is used to attach the model the instrument test frame can slide in the test section with a length of 7 m in three directions to adjust the model position five wave gauges with a sampling rate of 100 hz and 0 1 mm spatial resolution are used to measure the wave elevations an acoustic doppler velocity meter with a maximum range of 2 0 m s an accuracy of 0 5 and a sampling rate of 200 hz is used to acquire the velocity of water particles a 3 component dynamometer is used to measure wave forces on the cylinder force data are sampled at a rate of 200hz which is sufficient to capture the peak forces 2 2 test setup the experiments include two parts in part ⅰ a series of experiments on wave current interaction are conducted four water depths four wave heights and eight current velocities are considered the parameters of the tested cases are listed in table 1 in which the cases of wave height h 0 m represent current alone and the cases of current velocity u c 0 00 m s represent the wave alone to measure the variation of wave height along the flume five wave gauges wg are arranged along the centerline of the wave flume they are 10 m wg1 18 m wg2 26 m wg3 28 m wg4 and 30 m wg5 downstream of the wave paddle as shown in fig 1 the velocity meter vm1 is positioned 28 m downstream of the wave paddle and 0 5 m besides the wg4 in part ⅱ vm1 wg1 wg2 wg4 and wg5 are removed and a cylinder with a radius of r 0 125 m and a height of l 1 2 m is mounted into the wave current flume to investigate the combined flow induced forces see fig 1 the test parameters of water depths wave heights and current velocities are the same as those in part ⅰ the cylinder model is made of polymathic methacrylate the interior of the model is empty and the exterior is closed it is placed 28 m downstream of the wave paddle the original position of wg4 and fixed by attaching its top surface to the instrument test frame through the 3 component dynamometer as shown in fig 1 2 3 test procedure and data acquisition to examine the accuracy and repeatability in generating solitary waves a series of wave alone cases are tested for each water depth and wave height fig 2 a shows the comparisons of water elevation between the experimental results measured by wg4 and the analytical results calculated by eq 2 for the experimental results a water depression behind the solitary wave is observed that is caused by the instantaneous truncation in the time law of the paddle motion it is a common future in solitary wave generation and has been documented previously in guizien and barthelemy 2002 and goring 1979 and malek mohammadi and testik 2010 the amplitudes of these depressions are reported to be 6 12 goring 1979 and 3 8 guizien and barthelemy 2002 of the heights of the generated waves for all the wave alone cases tested in present experiments the amplitudes are checked to be 4 6 10 2 in spite of the difference of the water surface behind the solitary wave general agreements in terms of the wave height and wave shape of the solitary wave between the experimental results and the analytical results are observed indicating the wavemaker is capable to generate good quality solitary waves each wave alone case is repeated three times the averages of the wave heights measured by wg4 during the three repeated experiments are listed in table 2 for all these cases the relative errors between the generated wave height and aimed wave height are within 3 besides a series of current alone cases are conducted for each water depth and each current velocity the measured mean velocity along the water column is shown in fig 3 for the specific cases of d 0 8 m u c 0 15 m s and 0 45 m s it is observed due to the friction of the bottom surface of the flume the velocity near the bottom surface is smaller than the aimed velocity and the deviation is 10 1 and 7 3 for u c 0 15 m s and u c 0 45 m s respectively at the elevation of z 0 1 m however the influence height is within 0 3 m when the elevation is higher than 0 3 m the deviation is within 3 and the average deviation along water depth 0 3 m 0 75 m is 2 4 and 1 6 respectively for u c 0 15 m s and u c 0 45 m s thus the generated current can be considered uniform over the water depth the current velocities measured at 0 1 m below the still water level for other cases are listed in table 3 in addition the measured velocities indicate the currents can reach steady state within x 10 m ensuring a long distance for wave current interaction for all these current alone cases the relative errors between the generated velocities and aimed velocities are within 3 it should be highlighted that the generated velocities presented in fig 3 and table 3 are the mean velocities recorded by vm1 during 120 s for each wave current case the current flow is generated first to acquire a steady current velocity then the wavemaker system is activated to generate a solitary wave when simulating cases of the waves with the following currents currents are introduced through the bed of the flume in front of the wavemaker see fig 1 a when simulating cases of the waves with opposing currents currents are removed through the bed in front of the wavemaker therefore it s necessary to check the influences of the current inflow and outflow on wave generation to examine these influences on wave generation the wave surface elevation measured under wave current conditions measured by wg1 are compared with the analytical surface of solitary wave alone calculated by eq 2 using the measured wave height as shown in fig 2 b wg1 is 10 m downstream of the wave paddle and 6 m downstream of the current outlet those distances ensure that the generated wave can evolve to the aimed solitary wave and the following opposing current have a relatively smaller effect on the wave the measured wave surface agrees well with the analytical results indicating the current inflow and outflow have little influence on wave generation and good quality of solitary wave can be generated when conducting wave current interaction in addition the water surface variation alone the flume under current alone condition is reported to be very small when compared with the water depth its influence on the experimental results can be neglected to ensure the accuracy of the experimental data each case where water depth wave height and current velocity remain constant is repeated three times the wave heights current velocities and maximum forces presented in the following sections are the averages of the statistical analysis of the three trials 3 solitary wave current interaction 3 1 effect on wave height fig 4 shows time histories of wave elevation for the cases of wave alone u c 0 m s wave with following currents u c 0 15 m s and 0 45 m s and wave with opposing currents u c 0 15 m s and 0 45 m s for these typical cases the water depth is 0 6 m and the wave height is 0 20 m after interacting with the following currents the wave crest moves ahead compared with that of wave alone and it moves back for the cases of the wave with opposing currents it indicates that the presence of following currents accelerates the wave traveling speed and the presence of opposing currents slows down the wave traveling speed however how much the wave traveling speed is increased by the following currents and decreased by the opposing currents could not be reflected from fig 4 accurately because time errors caused by humans inevitably exist in the experimental tests zhang et al 2015 investigated the influence of currents on the wave traveling speed by numerical model the numerical model can accurately monitor the wave traveling speed they concluded that when the solitary wave rides on a low speed current the wave traveling speed could be predicted by the linear superposition of the wave phase velocity and the current velocity however it cannot be applied to predict wave traveling speed when the wave travels on a high speed current fig 4 additionally indicates that the wave height is affected by the wave current interaction when the wave rides on the following currents the wave has a lower wave height than the wave alone whereas it is higher when the wave rides on the opposing currents after interacting with the following current with u c 0 15 m s the wave height reduces to 0 98h 0 and with the current of u c 0 45 m s it reduces to 0 92h 0 the effect of solitary wave current interaction on wave height is enhanced when the velocity of the following current increases after interacting with the opposing current of u c 0 15 m s the wave height increases to 1 04h 0 and it increases to 1 02h 0 after interacting with the current of u c 0 45 m s the effect of solitary wave current on wave height is not enhanced when the velocity of the opposing current increases to further study the effect of solitary wave current interaction on wave height more cases with a broad range of current velocities wave heights and water depths are performed the results for water depth d 0 5 m 0 6 m 0 7 m and 0 8 m are shown in fig 5 a b c and d respectively in which the wave height is normalized by the original wave height h 0 and the current velocity is normalized by the original wave velocity c 0 calculated by using eq 4 the wave heights presented here are measured by wg4 the effect of following currents and opposing currents on the wave height are separately discussed in the following as previously observed when the solitary wave rides on following currents the induced wave height becomes lower than its original wave height and continuously decreases with increasing current velocity that is caused by the stronger energy exchange between the wave and current when the current velocity is increased in addition it is observed that the original wave height and water depth also influences the induced wave height for example see in fig 5 d when the waves with an original wave height of h 0 0 08 m and h 0 0 20 m interact with the current with u c c 0 0 2 the induced wave heights are 0 78h 0 and 0 85h 0 respectively the relative reduction in wave height are more obvious for the waves with smaller original wave height indicating that the effect of the current on the induced wave height is stronger for the smaller waves comparisons between fig 5 a b c and d indicate that the effect of following current on wave height reduction is enhanced when the water depth increases to provide an estimation equation of the wave height for engineering applications the regression analysis is conducted on the experimental data as shown in fig 6 a relationship between the wave height and the current velocity is obtained see eq 5 the equation can be used to roughly estimate the wave height for the practical conditions of h 0 d within 0 1 0 4 and u c gh 0 2 d 0 5 within 0 2 2 for practical ocean engineering 6 h h 0 1 00426 0 14236 u c g h 0 2 d 0 02153 u c g h 0 2 d 2 w i t h r 2 0 85 7 h m e a s u r e d h w g 1 e a x although fig 4 reflects that the presence of opposing current increases wave height this observation is not suitable for all opposing current cases when traveling with opposing currents the wave height does not vary monotonically with current velocity but shows an increase followed by a decrease as shown in fig 5 the increments caused by the opposing current are limited to 0 06h 0 for all the tested cases however the decrements even reach to 0 12h 0 for strong current cases the critical current velocity that the wave height begins to decrease is smaller for shallower water for the tested case with d h 0 2 5 the critical current velocity u c c 0 tails off to 0 063 when the current velocity larger than the critical velocity the wave height begins to decrease with the increase of current velocity it even decreases to a value smaller than its original wave height for stronger current such as in the cases of u c c 0 0 18 0 25 h 0 0 08 m 0 20 m d 0 5 m see in fig 5 a the same phenomenon was observed in the experiments conducted by umeyama 2005 for regular waves their results showed that the regular wave has a smaller wave height for traveling with an opposing current than traveling alone it is anomalous in that wave height is expected to be increased after introducing an opposing current some numerical studies such as zhang et al 2015 did find that the wave height of the solitary wave increases when traveling on an opposing current and continuously increases with current velocity the decreasing trend observed in umeyama 2005 and present experiments is attributed to wave attenuation kemp and simons 1983 concluded that the rate of wave attenuation is greatly increased by the addition of an opposing current this conclusion focusing on regular wave current interaction is also applicable to the solitary wave current interaction to display the influence of wave attenuation the wave heights are measured at five different positions along the flume centerline see in fig 1 a fig 7 a and b present typical examples for wave traveling on a following current u c 0 60 m s and an opposing current u c 0 60 m s respectively the bottom axis of fig 7 represents the distance from the location of wgs to the wave paddle normalized by water depth d and the vertical axis is the wave height measured by wgs normalized by the wave height measured by wg1 h wg1 it is shown that the wave attenuation is not obvious when the solitary wave travels with the following current whereas the wave attenuation is significantly increased when the solitary wave travels with the opposing current fig 8 presents the measured exponential attenuation modulus a for all the tested cases in fig 8 the current velocity is normalized by c 0 and the exponential attenuation modulus is calculated by the least squares fit of eq 6 to the measured profiles in eq 6 h wg1 is the wave height measured by wg1 and x represents the distance of the measuring point to wg1 it can be seen that the interactions between waves and opposing currents significantly increase the attenuation modulus especially for cases with larger current velocity the average wave attenuation modulus for wave opposing current cases is nearly 5 5 times of that for wave alone cases regarding the cases of the waves with the following currents it doesn t conform with the conclusion of kemp and simons 1983 and simons et al 1988 they found that the presences of following currents reduce the attenuation rate of the regular wave however the results presented in fig 7 show that when the solitary wave travels with following currents the wave attenuation modulus is slightly increased nearly being 1 6 times the average wave attenuation modulus for wave alone cases a possible explanation for the slight increase is the shear stress caused by the velocity gradient for the solitary wave alone cases the velocity gradient along the vertical direction du dz is small as seen in fig 9 a the curve of u c 0 m s whereas when a following current is introduced the velocity gradient along the vertical direction du dz is relatively larger as seen in fig 10 a the curve of u c 6 m s the shear force makes additional wave attenuation therefore the attenuation modular is slightly increased by the addition of the following current due to the large wave attenuation the wave height for wave opposing current highly depends on the propagation distance a prediction equation of wave height considering the propagation distance needs further study 3 2 particle velocity of the combined wave current flow fig 9 presents the time histories of water particle velocity for five typical cases wave with a following current u c 0 3 m s wave with an opposing current u c 0 3 m s following current alone opposing current alone and wave alone for these typical cases the water depth the original wave height are 0 7 m and 0 16 m respectively and the velocity meter is located 0 86d 0 6 m above the bottom of the wave flume for the current alone cases the generated currents have a steady velocity in the whole time domain ensuring that the current flow travels with the aimed velocity whenever the wave is generated the time averaging velocities are 0 10c 0 and 0 10c 0 for the following current and opposing current respectively for the wave alone case when the wave crest is arriving the horizontal velocity increases to 0 18c 0 then it decreases to zero again as the wave travels far away for both wave current cases the velocity increases first and then decreases when a solitary wave travels through the measuring point similar to the wave alone case however due to the presence of currents water particles have an initial velocity it is noticed that the peak velocity particle velocity when the wave crest passes through the measuring point of the wave following current case is 0 28c 0 which is equal to the linear sum of the peak velocity of the wave alone case 0 18c 0 and the mean velocity of the current alone case 0 10c 0 one may expect that the horizontal velocity of water particles for the combined wave current flow could be predicted by the linear summation of that for wave alone and current alone it will be discussed in detail later for some selected cases the water depth is d 0 7 m wave height is h 0 0 16 m and the current velocity is ranged from 0 60 m s to 0 60 m s the velocities of the water particle along the water column are measured along the water depth five measuring points z d 0 43 0 57 0 71 0 86 and 0 93 are set due to the limitation of the velocity meter vm1 used in the present experiments which can only measure the particle velocity at one elevation z the elevation of vm1 is adjusted several times according to the measuring point so each selected cases is repeated until the particle velocity at z 0 43d 0 57d 0 71d 0 86d and 0 93d are measured the velocity measured under the wave crest for cases of the wave with following currents and opposing currents are presented in fig 10 a and b respectively shown with the dimensionless axis the peak velocities for the wave alone case are also presented for comparison for the wave alone case u c 0 0 m s the velocity gradient in the vertical direction du dz is small the velocities at middle level z d 0 43 0 57 are slightly smaller than those at top level z d 0 86 0 93 the deviation of the velocity between the middle level and top level is within 7 which can be regarded as uniform distribution after interacting with the following currents the velocity along the water column increases with current velocity additionally it is observed after interacting with the following current the velocity gradient in the vertical direction du dz is increased especially for the cases of u c 0 60 m s the deviation of the velocity between the middle level and top level increases to 11 the linear sums ls of the velocity under wave crest for wave alone flow and the mean velocity for current alone flow are additionally presented to examine the accuracy of this prediction method when the current has a smaller velocity the predicted velocities are close to the measured velocity along the whole water column for example when u c 0 15 m s the ls are very close to the measured velocity and the maximum difference occurred at z d 0 43 is within 2 5 of the measured data with the current velocity increase the ls overestimates the particle velocity at the middle level but still has good accuracy at the top level for the wave with opposing current cases fig 10 b as is expected the peak velocity decrease with the current velocity the ls accurately predicts the particle velocity when the current velocity is small for the current with larger velocity the ls has poor accuracy more experimental results with a broad range of wave heights and water depths are presented in fig 11 the presented velocity results focusing on the peak value are measured 0 1 m below the still water level for example when the water depth is 0 5 m the measuring point is located 0 4 m above the bottom surface of the flume fig 11 a b c and d show that the horizontal velocity of water particles almost linearly increases with current velocity for the wave following current cases and it almost linearly decreases with current velocity for the wave opposing current cases additionally the velocity is higher for the cases with larger wave heights that is attributed to the fact that the velocity of the solitary wave increases with wave height see when u c c 0 0 by comparing fig 11 a b c and d it is observed the velocity of solitary wave current is slightly higher when the water depth is smaller similarly that is due to the velocity of the solitary wave is slightly higher when the water depth is smaller see when u c c 0 0 the ls of the velocity for wave and current alone cases are also presented for all the cases of the wave with the following current the linear sums predict the velocities well with a maximum error of barely 4 90 for the wave with opposing current cases the linear sums agree well with the measured velocities when the current velocity is small however there exists an obvious deviation between the predicted velocity and measured velocity when the opposing current has a large velocity zhang et al 2015 presented the velocity field of the combined solitary wave current motion it is shown that when traveling with following currents the solitary wave retains a similar velocity field with increased intensity whereas the velocity field is significantly modified when the solitary wave travels against a current duan et al 2018 also concluded that the velocity field is significantly modified when the solitary wave travels against a shear current an obvious vortex is observed in the velocity field for the strongly nonlinear interaction between solitary wave and shear currents combining the velocity field presented in these studies and the experimental results presented in this paper it can be concluded that when traveling with a following current the linear sum can accurately predict the velocity near the still water level and it gives a conservative prediction at middle zone when traveling with a weak opposing current it predicts well whereas as the current velocity increase the velocity field is significantly modified and the particle velocity cannot be predicted by the simple linear superimposition 4 experimental results of wave current cylinder interaction 4 1 wave alone condition take the case of d 0 6 m h 0 0 20 m for example the wave elevation measured by wg3 and the history of horizontal force f x and transversal force f y are presented in fig 12 a and b respectively in the following figures the forces are normalized by using ρgr 2 d r is the radius of the cylinder model the marked letters a to d on the horizontal force curve refer to different time moments in the interaction process and the corresponding snapshots are shown in fig 13 a to fig 13 d as seen in fig 13 a before the wave arrives the horizontal force f x on the model is zero see fig 12 b when the wave front strikes the model the water level in the upstream side gradually increases and it is higher than the water level in the downstream side of the model resulting in a positive pressure difference in addition the water particles with positive velocity and positive acceleration act on the model resulting in positive hydrodynamic pressure consequently the horizontal force increases rapidly during the first few seconds of the interaction when the wave crest closes to the model fig 13 b the horizontal force f x gets up to its positive peak fig 13 b also shows that when the wave impacts the model a small part of the wave runs up along the cylinder on the upstream side meanwhile a cavity is observed on the downstream side of the model then with the spread of the wave the cavity expends downstream and on a larger scale fig 13 c in this period the water level in the downstream side gradually increases and the water particles with negative acceleration impact the model thus the horizontal force decreases until reach the negative peak fig 12 b as the water level falls back and the cavity collapses a back flow is formed then the back flow acts on the model fig 13 d resulting in a negative horizontal force as the wave travels far away the horizontal forces finally back to the zero position the positive horizontal peak force f x on the cylinder 68 n is greater than the negative peak force f x 46 n by over 47 8 the transversal force f y on the circle cylinder is almost zero during the whole interaction process 4 2 wave following current condition fig 14 a and b show the time history of wave elevation and wave force for a typical case of the wave with a following current u c 0 60 m s the water depth and wave height are identical to the wave alone case the marked letters a to d on the horizontal force curve refer to different time moments in the interaction process and the corresponding snapshots are shown in fig 15 a to fig 15 d unlike the wave alone case before the solitary wave approaches the cylinder fig 15 a the cylinder subjects a constant and positive horizontal force 0 25ρgr 2 d 23 n exerted by the following current as the wave passes through the model the horizontal force rapidly increases to its peak value and then falls to the balance position and oscillates around the balance position for a while similar to the wave alone case wave run up on the upstream side and a cavity on the downstream side are observed in the wave following current cylinder interaction process fig 15 b and c however it is observed that the wave run up is more obvious and the cavity becomes wider and longer taking an elliptical shape due to the addition of following currents that is mainly attributed to the larger particle velocity of the combined wave following current flow compared with the wave alone case the transversal force induced by the combined wave current flow oscillates more obviously attributing to the current induced vortexes as seen in fig 15 a the current flow is separated into two flows by the model and then the two flows meet again behind the model generating two asymmetric vortexes behind the model fig 16 gives a comparison of the horizontal force induced by the combined wave following current flow and the linear sum of horizontal forces induced by the wave alone and current alone flow the transversal force is not discussed due to its small magnitude the time steps of the wave current results are shifted for matching the linear sum curve it can be seen beside the time difference the shape of the force curve is modified significantly the force induced by the combined flow does not show a negative peak force it is attributed to the addition of the following current on the one hand the continuous action of the following current exerts a stable positive force on the cylinder canceling part of the wave induced negative force out on the other hand due to the presence of the following current the action of back flow on the cylinder is weakened although the cavity downstream of the model is on a larger scale fig 15 c and stronger back flow is formed fig 15 d the back flow interacts with the incident following current before acting on the model fig 15 d the energy of the back flow is consumed due to the interaction in addition due to the presence of the larger cavity the water level in upstream is higher than the water level in downstream fig 15 c resulting in positive pressure in the whole interaction process therefore the negative force does not occur under this condition it should be highlighted that the negative peak force still occurs when the velocity of the following current is lower however the negative peak force is smaller than the positive peak force for all the wave following current cases when it comes to the positive peak forces it is shown that the positive peak force induced by wave following current 1 37ρgr 2 d is larger than the linear sum 0 88ρgr 2 d and it is 1 6 times of the linear sum as previously discussed the water velocity of solitary wave following current is nearly equal to the linear sum of water velocity of wave alone and current alone u wc u w u c u wc velocity of wave current u w water velocity of wave alone and u c water velocity of current alone however the horizontal force on the cylinder is proportional to the velocity square u 2 of the water particles the u wc 2 is larger than the linear sum of u w 2 and u c 2 in addition the wave run up height in the wave current cylinder interaction is higher than that in wave cylinder interaction see in fig 13 b and fig 15 b which further increases the positive peak force therefore the linear sum underestimated the forces induced by the combined wave following current flow xiao et al 2013 studied the solitary wave current induced forces on a horizontal cylinder by numerical simulation in their study the cylinder is placed horizontally and fully submerged into the water their numerical results also showed that both in the horizontal and vertical direction the wave following current induced forces are greater than the linear sum of wave alone and current alone induced forces fig 17 presents the positive peak forces f x on the cylinder model for all the wave following current tests as expected the positive peak force is increased due to the addition of a following current and it continually increases with current velocity that is attributed to the water particle velocity increase with the current velocity in addition it is observed that the positive peak forces have a larger value when the wave height is higher it is also ascribed to the larger particle velocity and the larger action area the linear sum of the peak force induced by wave alone and constant force induced by current alone are additionally presented in fig 17 to make a comparison the linear sum underestimates the combined flow induced force and the differences between the measured force and the estimated force increase with the increase of wave height and current velocity for some conditions the differences is in excess of 36 to provide a simple and accurate prediction method it is assumed that the particle velocity of wave following current is equal to the linear sum of that for wave and current alone flow u wc u w u c and when the wave crest strikes the model the horizontal force gets up to the peak value according to the morison equation it is derived that the solitary wave following current induced positive peak force f wcx can be estimated by the nonlinear superposition of wave induced peak force f wx and current induced force f cx the nonlinear superposition method is shown in eq 7 fig 18 shows the comparison of the peak forces between the measured and the predicted values it is shown that the nonlinear superposition has good agreement with the measured results the relative error shown in eq 8 is used to evaluate the accuracy of the nonlinear superposition method in which f i and f i p are the measured wave force and the predicted wave force respectively and n is the number of tested cases based on eq 8 the related errors between the measured results and the predicted results are 0 0097 it indicates that the nonlinear superposition has good accuracy to predict the solitary wave following current induced peak force for practical engineering application the wave induced force f wx and the current induced force f cx used in eq 7 can be calculated by morison equation and therefore the wave current induced force on vertical cylinders can be obtained by using eq 7 8 f w c x f w x f c x f w x f c x 2 9 e i 1 n f i f i p f i 2 1 n 4 3 wave opposing current condition fig 19 shows the free surface elevation and forces on the cylinder model in the wave opposing current cylinder interaction process the wave height and water depth are identical to the previously discussed two cases but the current has a velocity of u c 0 60 m s the marked letters a to d on the horizontal force curve refer to different time moments in the interaction process and the corresponding snapshots are shown in fig 20 a to fig 20 d before solitary wave arrives the current effect is in dominance and it exerts a stable negative horizontal force as the solitary wave approaches the model the horizontal force first increases to the positive peak and then decreases to the negative peak just as seen in the wave alone case as the wave travels away the horizontal force finally back to its stable value in general the variation trend of the horizontal force is similar to that in the wave alone case however for the wave opposing current cases the negative peak force 0 71ρgr 2 d is larger than the positive peak force 0 48ρgr 2 d by over 48 due to the presence of the opposing current for the transversal force it is similar to the case of a wave with the following current that the transversal force slightly oscillates around zero that is induced by the two vortexes in the upstream side of the model seen in fig 20 a by comparing fig 20 with fig 15 and 13 it is observed that when the combined wave opposing current flow interacts with the cylinder no obvious wave run up occurs and only a small scale cavity in the downstream side occurs fig 20 b the presence of the opposing current impedes the spread of the cavity fig 20 c in addition the generated back flow is very weak compared with the wave following current case fig 20 d fig 21 shows a comparison of horizontal force between the combined wave opposing current flow and the linear sum the time steps of the wave current results are shifted for matching the linear sum curve the curve shapes of the wave current are the same as the linear superposition curve in addition the positive and negative peak forces predicted by the linear superposition are nearly equal to the wave current induced positive and negative peak forces for this specific case fig 22 presents the negative peak forces for the wave opposing currents in general the negative peak force increases with current velocity but for some cases such as for the case of d 0 5 m h 0 0 12 m and 0 16 m when the dimensionless velocity of opposing current increases from 0 05 to 0 20 the negative peak forces show a decreasing trend it is attributed to the decrease of the wave height as shown in fig 5 a for these specific cases the wave height decreases with current velocity due to the larger wave attenuation when the current velocity is constant the negative peak force increases with the original wave height the linear sums of the negative peak force for the wave alone and the negative mean force for the current alone are additionally presented to make a comparison although fig 21 indicates that the negative peak force predicated by the linear sum is close to the negative peak force measured in the combined wave opposing current flow fig 22 indicates that it is not applicable for most cases the linear sum has a poor accuracy to predict the wave opposing current induced negative peak force because the negative peak force is complex and affected by many factors such as the back flow and the cavity in the downstream side of the model it needs further study 5 conclusions the solitary wave current interaction and the solitary wave current interaction with a cylinder are studied by conducting experiments based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 when solitary wave travels with following currents the wave height decreases with increasing current velocity the effect of following current on wave height reduction is more significant for waves with smaller original wave height and in deeper water the reduction in wave height is in excess of 0 2h 0 in the tested cases to predict the wave height when the storm leading wave or tsunami wave travels in the same direction as currents a regression equation is suggested which can serve as a tool to determine the optimal elevation of offshore platforms when traveling with opposing currents the wave height does not vary monotonically with current velocity but shows an increase followed by a decrease the increments caused by the opposing current are limited to 0 06h 0 for all the tested cases however the decrements even reach to 0 12h 0 for strong current cases the critical current velocity that the wave height begins to decrease is smaller for shallower water for the tested case with d h 0 2 5 the critical current velocity uc c 0 tails off to 0 063 when the current velocity larger than the critical velocity the wave height begins to decrease with the increase of current velocity it even decreases to a value smaller than its original wave height for stronger current meanwhile the traveling speed of storm leading wave or tsunami wave slows down due to the presence of the opposing current it suggests that the strong opposing current during tsunami or storm events could attenuate tsunami or storm attacks on the structures in shallow water 2 the attenuation rate of the solitary wave is increased due to the presence of current the average wave attenuation modulus for wave following current cases is nearly 1 6 times of that for wave alone cases for the wave opposing current cases the wave attenuation is greatly increased reaching 5 5 times of that for wave alone cases the large wave attenuation is the main reason for the fact that the wave height presents decrease trend after acting with strong opposing current if the wave attenuation is neglected for the conditions of storm wave or tsunami wave traveling with opposing current the wave height may be overestimated 3 when a solitary wave travels with following currents the water velocity near still water level is nearly equal to the linear superposition of water velocity of wave alone and current alone that means when a storm leading wave tsunami wave and long period wave travel with following currents the water velocity near still water level can be accurately estimated by the linear superposition 4 the wave cylinder interaction process is significantly affected by the addition of currents compared with the wave alone cases the wave induced cavity at downstream side of the cylinder becomes wider and longer taking an elliptical shape and a stronger back flow is generated due to the addition of following currents whereas the presence of the opposing current impedes the spread of the cavity the positive peak forces on the vertical cylinder is amplified due to the combined effect of the wave and the following current reaching 1 2 3 4 times of the corresponding wave induced positive peak force the linear superimposition of wave induced peak force and the current induced force seriously underestimated the actual peak forces by 36 for the strong current condition therefore a nonlinear superimposition method with higher accuracy is suggested for estimating the tsunami wave or storm leading wave and following current induced combined forces on a cylinder structure for practical engineering credit authorship contribution statement

20430,wave current interaction affects both wave characteristics and current properties and therefore the combined forces on coastal structures in the first part of this paper a series of experiments on the solitary wave current interaction are conducted to investigate how the wave height and water velocity are affected by the wave current interaction then a vertical cylinder widely used as the foundation of coastal structures is mounted into the wave flume a series of experiments on the solitary wave current interaction with the cylinder are carried out to investigate the combined flow induced forces the experimental results indicate that 1 when solitary wave travels with following currents current travels with the same direction of the solitary wave wave height decreases with increasing current velocity the effect of following current on wave height reduction is more significant for waves with smaller original wave height and in deeper water depth when traveling with opposing currents current travels with the opposing direction of the solitary wave wave height does not vary monotonically with current velocity but shows an increase followed by a decrease 2 when a solitary wave travels with following currents the water velocity near still water level is equal to the linear superposition of water velocity of wave alone and current alone 3 a nonlinear superposition method is suggested to predict the combined solitary wave following current induced forces keywords solitary wave current interaction wave current cylinder interaction wave height current velocity wave force 1 introduction in the natural marine environment ocean waves and current flows exist simultaneously for example during the early stage of a storm surge event with the rise of the water level landward currents are formed meanwhile waves traveling toward the seashore ride on the landward currents the situation of the wave with a following current whereas when a storm surge is leaving currents change the propagation direction to seaward and the waves still travel to the seashore the situation of the wave with opposing current xiao et al 2013 the nonlinear interactions between waves and currents imply exchanges of energy and therefore wave characteristics current properties and their combined forces acting on coastal structures are affected the characteristics such as eulerian mean velocity reynolds stress and turbulent intensities of combined wave current flow have been extensively studied since the 1970s van hoften and karaki 1976 kemp and simons 1982 1983 asano and iwagaki 1985 van der kaaij and nueuwjaar 1987 nap and van kampen 1988 van rijn et al 1993 klopman 1994 1997 umeyama 2005 2009 2011 olabarrieta et al 2010 teles et al 2013 among these eulerian mean velocity is of great concern for its important impact on sediment transportation and wave forces acting on coastal structures prior studies indicated that the mean velocity profiles observed in current alone are modified due to the supposition of waves on the current when waves travel with following currents the mean velocity near the flume bed is increased and decreased near the water surface whereas when waves travel with opposing currents mean velocity along the water column departs from the logarithmic velocity especially near the water surface some analytical and numerical models were developed to explain the mechanisms of the observed changes in mean velocity some researchers such as dingemans et al 1996 klopman 1997 attributed the changes to the craik leibovich cl vortex force some other researchers such as you 1996 nielsen and you 1997 groeneweg and klopman 1998 huang and mei 2003 considered the wave induced reynolds stress as the main possible explanation of the changes in the mean velocity profile in order to investigate which effect are relatively important to the mean velocity changes groeneweg and battjes 2003 developed a 2dv wave current interaction model and concluded that the reynolds stress is dominant over the cl vortex force in addition yang et al 2006 investigated other factors that influence the velocity profile they found that both the reynolds stress the flow s uniformity and the secondary current caused by the sidewall greatly affect the velocity profile besides the wave induced influence on the current the changes of wave characteristics such as wave amplitudes wave lengths and wave traveling speed due to the interaction are also important issues for ocean engineering several experimental studies van hoften and karaki 1976 kemp and simons 1983 asano et al 1986 simons et al 1988 umeyama 2005 koo and kim 2007 ning et al 2014 liu et al 2016 chen et al 2017 and numerical studies ryu et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 2015 have been carried out to investigate such problems general conclusions have been obtained when wave rides on following currents the stretching effect of the following currents decreases wave height and prolongs wavelength contrariwise the compression effect of opposing currents increases wave height and shortens wavelength wave travels faster due to the addition of following current and travels slower due to the addition of opposing currents additionally the experimental results of van hoften and karaki 1976 and kemp and simons 1983 indicated that the attenuation rate of wave height decreases if waves propagate with a following current whereas it increases if waves ride on opposing currents although great efforts have been made to study the effect of wave current interaction on both the waves and current flows the previously mentioned studies mainly focused on the interactions between currents and regular or irregular waves limited studies are focusing on the interaction of solitary wave and current solitary wave as a classical wave model with large wave length is widely used for describing the storm leading waves tsunami waves and long period waves during storm surges or tsunami events the combined action of wave and current may pose great threats to coastal structures benjamin 1962 calculated the propagation of a solitary wave on currents with any type of velocity distribution by using stream function vanden broeck 1994 investigated the solitary wave in the presence of the linear shear background currents by using a boundary integral equation choi 2003 derived a set of evolution equations for the solitary wave in the presence of a linear shear background current by using the asymptotic solution their results indicated that the following current narrows the wave profile and opposing currents widens the wave profile pak and chow 2009 studied the wave profile wave speed and streamline when the solitary wave travels with non uniform shear currents by using third order expansions duan et al 2018 obtained a steady solution of the combined solitary wave linear shear current motion by using the gn green naghdi equations the wave profiles obtained by duan et al 2018 provided higher accuracy than that of pak and chow 2009 for large amplitude solitary waves in addition they founded that the velocity distribution for the wave current motion is quite different from the linear sum of the velocity distribution for the wave alone and current alone wang et al 2020 obtained the steady solution of solitary waves in shear currents by using the hlgn high level green naghdi model focusing on large amplitude solitary waves in strong opposing shear current and considering linear quadratic and cubic type currents their results indicated that the current type shows little influence on wave profile but significant influence on velocity distribution wave speed and particle trajectory zhang et al 2014 2015 studied the nonlinear interaction between solitary wave and current based on ns navier stokes equation they concluded that the solitary wave has a smaller wave height larger wave span and higher traveling speed after interacting with a following current contrariwise the solitary wave becomes higher with smaller wave span and lower traveling speed after interacting with an opposing current meanwhile the solitary wave coastal structure interaction has been widely studied for example the solitary wave induced forces on coastal bridges with a wide variety of deck geometries including the plate deck kulin 1958 french 1969 seiffert et al 2016 t type deck mcpherson 2008 hayatdavoodi et al 2014 xu and cai 2014 2015 xu et al 2015 xu et al 2016a 2016b 2016c 2017 2018 and box type deck azadbakht 2013 hayashi 2013 mazinani et al 2014 istrati 2017 huang et al 2018a 2018b 2019a 2019b have been studied both experimentally and numerically as expected the solitary wave induced forces on these bridge models are larger with higher wave height and higher wave velocity the process of the solitary wave propagating over the cylinder piles also attracted great interest because the cylinder piles have been widely used as the foundation of coastal structures the wave forces on a cylinder and the wave run up around the cylinder have been investigated yates and wang 1994 zhao et al 2007 mo et al 2007 2013 2013 cao and wan 2015 li et al 2018 additionally the wave body interaction under combined wave current flow for gravity cages zhao et al 2007 xu et al 2013 surface piecing structures li and lin 2015 cylinders lin and li 2003 kim et al 2016 bridge tower wei et al 2017 bridge girder zhang et al 2020 and bridge cofferdam kang et al 2020 have been studied when it comes to the solitary wave current structure interaction there are limited studies qu et al 2018 investigated the hydrodynamic load on a bridge deck under the joint action of solitary waves and currents the numerical investigation indicated that the horizontal maximum force becomes larger due to the presence of the following current and it becomes smaller due to the addition of the opposing current xiao et al 2013 developed a numerical model to simulate the joint action of solitary wave and uniform current on a horizontal cylinder the wave current induced forces on the cylinder are compared with wave force current force and the linear sum of wave force and current force results showed that the combined flow induced forces are different from the simple summation although these analytical and numerical literature make great efforts to understand the mechanics of solitary wave current interaction and solitary wave current structure interaction experimental studies are indispensable to further understand the nonlinear interaction in the present paper a series of experiments on solitary wave current interaction are conducted to investigate how the wave height and water velocity are affected by the nonlinear interaction then a vertical cylinder widely used as the foundation of coastal structures is mounted into the wave current flume a series of experiments on the combined solitary wave current interaction with the cylinder are carried out to investigate the combined flow induced forces the paper is arranged as follows the first part introduces the experimental setup and the facilities used in the experiments in the second part experimental results of the solitary wave current interaction are presented the effect of wave current interaction on wave heights and water particle velocities are discussed separately then experimental results of solitary wave current cylinder interaction are presented in the third part the interaction process of the cylinder with wave alone wave following current and wave opposing current are compared and discussed in detail finally some conclusions are given based on prior discussions 2 experimental setup 2 1 facilities and instrumentation experiments are conducted in the southwest jiaotong university s deep water long span bridge laboratory in the school of civil engineering the wave current flume is 60 m long 2 0 m wide and 1 8 m high as shown in fig 1 waves are generated by the piston type wavemaker installed at the right side of the flume the wavemaker system consists of a servo controller servo driver servo moto and wave paddle when in use the servo controller receives the motion direction signal and the motion speed signal which is translated from the aimed waves then the signals are sent to the servo driver to drive the reciprocating movement of the servo motor connected to the ball screw which in turn drives the wave paddle to push and pull the water generating aimed waves to generate smooth solitary waves trajectory of the wave paddle follows the equations as below 1 d ξ d t u ξ t c η x ξ d η x ξ 2 η h sec h h 2 k c t ξ 3 k 3 h 4 d 3 4 c g d h where h is the solitary wave height d is the water depth ξ is the position of the wave paddle c is the solitary wave speed t is the time η is the solitary wave surface and g is the acceleration of gravity once the initial position of the wave crest the wave height and the still water depth have been given the motion of the wave paddle ξ can be derived as follows goring 1979 5 ξ t h k d tanh k c t ξ currents are driven by a recirculation system which consists of the bidirectional flow pump frequency transducer flow pipeline and current sharing tanks when in use the control program calculates the control current according to the aimed current velocity and outputs it to the frequency transducer to control the rotation speed and the rotation direction of the pump the wave absorber is placed at the left side of the wave current flume to reduce the wave reflection and eliminate the majority of wave energy it is tested that the absorption capacity of the wave absorber is more than 92 in the main wavelength range in addition there is an instrument test frame at the top of the wave flume which is used to attach the model the instrument test frame can slide in the test section with a length of 7 m in three directions to adjust the model position five wave gauges with a sampling rate of 100 hz and 0 1 mm spatial resolution are used to measure the wave elevations an acoustic doppler velocity meter with a maximum range of 2 0 m s an accuracy of 0 5 and a sampling rate of 200 hz is used to acquire the velocity of water particles a 3 component dynamometer is used to measure wave forces on the cylinder force data are sampled at a rate of 200hz which is sufficient to capture the peak forces 2 2 test setup the experiments include two parts in part ⅰ a series of experiments on wave current interaction are conducted four water depths four wave heights and eight current velocities are considered the parameters of the tested cases are listed in table 1 in which the cases of wave height h 0 m represent current alone and the cases of current velocity u c 0 00 m s represent the wave alone to measure the variation of wave height along the flume five wave gauges wg are arranged along the centerline of the wave flume they are 10 m wg1 18 m wg2 26 m wg3 28 m wg4 and 30 m wg5 downstream of the wave paddle as shown in fig 1 the velocity meter vm1 is positioned 28 m downstream of the wave paddle and 0 5 m besides the wg4 in part ⅱ vm1 wg1 wg2 wg4 and wg5 are removed and a cylinder with a radius of r 0 125 m and a height of l 1 2 m is mounted into the wave current flume to investigate the combined flow induced forces see fig 1 the test parameters of water depths wave heights and current velocities are the same as those in part ⅰ the cylinder model is made of polymathic methacrylate the interior of the model is empty and the exterior is closed it is placed 28 m downstream of the wave paddle the original position of wg4 and fixed by attaching its top surface to the instrument test frame through the 3 component dynamometer as shown in fig 1 2 3 test procedure and data acquisition to examine the accuracy and repeatability in generating solitary waves a series of wave alone cases are tested for each water depth and wave height fig 2 a shows the comparisons of water elevation between the experimental results measured by wg4 and the analytical results calculated by eq 2 for the experimental results a water depression behind the solitary wave is observed that is caused by the instantaneous truncation in the time law of the paddle motion it is a common future in solitary wave generation and has been documented previously in guizien and barthelemy 2002 and goring 1979 and malek mohammadi and testik 2010 the amplitudes of these depressions are reported to be 6 12 goring 1979 and 3 8 guizien and barthelemy 2002 of the heights of the generated waves for all the wave alone cases tested in present experiments the amplitudes are checked to be 4 6 10 2 in spite of the difference of the water surface behind the solitary wave general agreements in terms of the wave height and wave shape of the solitary wave between the experimental results and the analytical results are observed indicating the wavemaker is capable to generate good quality solitary waves each wave alone case is repeated three times the averages of the wave heights measured by wg4 during the three repeated experiments are listed in table 2 for all these cases the relative errors between the generated wave height and aimed wave height are within 3 besides a series of current alone cases are conducted for each water depth and each current velocity the measured mean velocity along the water column is shown in fig 3 for the specific cases of d 0 8 m u c 0 15 m s and 0 45 m s it is observed due to the friction of the bottom surface of the flume the velocity near the bottom surface is smaller than the aimed velocity and the deviation is 10 1 and 7 3 for u c 0 15 m s and u c 0 45 m s respectively at the elevation of z 0 1 m however the influence height is within 0 3 m when the elevation is higher than 0 3 m the deviation is within 3 and the average deviation along water depth 0 3 m 0 75 m is 2 4 and 1 6 respectively for u c 0 15 m s and u c 0 45 m s thus the generated current can be considered uniform over the water depth the current velocities measured at 0 1 m below the still water level for other cases are listed in table 3 in addition the measured velocities indicate the currents can reach steady state within x 10 m ensuring a long distance for wave current interaction for all these current alone cases the relative errors between the generated velocities and aimed velocities are within 3 it should be highlighted that the generated velocities presented in fig 3 and table 3 are the mean velocities recorded by vm1 during 120 s for each wave current case the current flow is generated first to acquire a steady current velocity then the wavemaker system is activated to generate a solitary wave when simulating cases of the waves with the following currents currents are introduced through the bed of the flume in front of the wavemaker see fig 1 a when simulating cases of the waves with opposing currents currents are removed through the bed in front of the wavemaker therefore it s necessary to check the influences of the current inflow and outflow on wave generation to examine these influences on wave generation the wave surface elevation measured under wave current conditions measured by wg1 are compared with the analytical surface of solitary wave alone calculated by eq 2 using the measured wave height as shown in fig 2 b wg1 is 10 m downstream of the wave paddle and 6 m downstream of the current outlet those distances ensure that the generated wave can evolve to the aimed solitary wave and the following opposing current have a relatively smaller effect on the wave the measured wave surface agrees well with the analytical results indicating the current inflow and outflow have little influence on wave generation and good quality of solitary wave can be generated when conducting wave current interaction in addition the water surface variation alone the flume under current alone condition is reported to be very small when compared with the water depth its influence on the experimental results can be neglected to ensure the accuracy of the experimental data each case where water depth wave height and current velocity remain constant is repeated three times the wave heights current velocities and maximum forces presented in the following sections are the averages of the statistical analysis of the three trials 3 solitary wave current interaction 3 1 effect on wave height fig 4 shows time histories of wave elevation for the cases of wave alone u c 0 m s wave with following currents u c 0 15 m s and 0 45 m s and wave with opposing currents u c 0 15 m s and 0 45 m s for these typical cases the water depth is 0 6 m and the wave height is 0 20 m after interacting with the following currents the wave crest moves ahead compared with that of wave alone and it moves back for the cases of the wave with opposing currents it indicates that the presence of following currents accelerates the wave traveling speed and the presence of opposing currents slows down the wave traveling speed however how much the wave traveling speed is increased by the following currents and decreased by the opposing currents could not be reflected from fig 4 accurately because time errors caused by humans inevitably exist in the experimental tests zhang et al 2015 investigated the influence of currents on the wave traveling speed by numerical model the numerical model can accurately monitor the wave traveling speed they concluded that when the solitary wave rides on a low speed current the wave traveling speed could be predicted by the linear superposition of the wave phase velocity and the current velocity however it cannot be applied to predict wave traveling speed when the wave travels on a high speed current fig 4 additionally indicates that the wave height is affected by the wave current interaction when the wave rides on the following currents the wave has a lower wave height than the wave alone whereas it is higher when the wave rides on the opposing currents after interacting with the following current with u c 0 15 m s the wave height reduces to 0 98h 0 and with the current of u c 0 45 m s it reduces to 0 92h 0 the effect of solitary wave current interaction on wave height is enhanced when the velocity of the following current increases after interacting with the opposing current of u c 0 15 m s the wave height increases to 1 04h 0 and it increases to 1 02h 0 after interacting with the current of u c 0 45 m s the effect of solitary wave current on wave height is not enhanced when the velocity of the opposing current increases to further study the effect of solitary wave current interaction on wave height more cases with a broad range of current velocities wave heights and water depths are performed the results for water depth d 0 5 m 0 6 m 0 7 m and 0 8 m are shown in fig 5 a b c and d respectively in which the wave height is normalized by the original wave height h 0 and the current velocity is normalized by the original wave velocity c 0 calculated by using eq 4 the wave heights presented here are measured by wg4 the effect of following currents and opposing currents on the wave height are separately discussed in the following as previously observed when the solitary wave rides on following currents the induced wave height becomes lower than its original wave height and continuously decreases with increasing current velocity that is caused by the stronger energy exchange between the wave and current when the current velocity is increased in addition it is observed that the original wave height and water depth also influences the induced wave height for example see in fig 5 d when the waves with an original wave height of h 0 0 08 m and h 0 0 20 m interact with the current with u c c 0 0 2 the induced wave heights are 0 78h 0 and 0 85h 0 respectively the relative reduction in wave height are more obvious for the waves with smaller original wave height indicating that the effect of the current on the induced wave height is stronger for the smaller waves comparisons between fig 5 a b c and d indicate that the effect of following current on wave height reduction is enhanced when the water depth increases to provide an estimation equation of the wave height for engineering applications the regression analysis is conducted on the experimental data as shown in fig 6 a relationship between the wave height and the current velocity is obtained see eq 5 the equation can be used to roughly estimate the wave height for the practical conditions of h 0 d within 0 1 0 4 and u c gh 0 2 d 0 5 within 0 2 2 for practical ocean engineering 6 h h 0 1 00426 0 14236 u c g h 0 2 d 0 02153 u c g h 0 2 d 2 w i t h r 2 0 85 7 h m e a s u r e d h w g 1 e a x although fig 4 reflects that the presence of opposing current increases wave height this observation is not suitable for all opposing current cases when traveling with opposing currents the wave height does not vary monotonically with current velocity but shows an increase followed by a decrease as shown in fig 5 the increments caused by the opposing current are limited to 0 06h 0 for all the tested cases however the decrements even reach to 0 12h 0 for strong current cases the critical current velocity that the wave height begins to decrease is smaller for shallower water for the tested case with d h 0 2 5 the critical current velocity u c c 0 tails off to 0 063 when the current velocity larger than the critical velocity the wave height begins to decrease with the increase of current velocity it even decreases to a value smaller than its original wave height for stronger current such as in the cases of u c c 0 0 18 0 25 h 0 0 08 m 0 20 m d 0 5 m see in fig 5 a the same phenomenon was observed in the experiments conducted by umeyama 2005 for regular waves their results showed that the regular wave has a smaller wave height for traveling with an opposing current than traveling alone it is anomalous in that wave height is expected to be increased after introducing an opposing current some numerical studies such as zhang et al 2015 did find that the wave height of the solitary wave increases when traveling on an opposing current and continuously increases with current velocity the decreasing trend observed in umeyama 2005 and present experiments is attributed to wave attenuation kemp and simons 1983 concluded that the rate of wave attenuation is greatly increased by the addition of an opposing current this conclusion focusing on regular wave current interaction is also applicable to the solitary wave current interaction to display the influence of wave attenuation the wave heights are measured at five different positions along the flume centerline see in fig 1 a fig 7 a and b present typical examples for wave traveling on a following current u c 0 60 m s and an opposing current u c 0 60 m s respectively the bottom axis of fig 7 represents the distance from the location of wgs to the wave paddle normalized by water depth d and the vertical axis is the wave height measured by wgs normalized by the wave height measured by wg1 h wg1 it is shown that the wave attenuation is not obvious when the solitary wave travels with the following current whereas the wave attenuation is significantly increased when the solitary wave travels with the opposing current fig 8 presents the measured exponential attenuation modulus a for all the tested cases in fig 8 the current velocity is normalized by c 0 and the exponential attenuation modulus is calculated by the least squares fit of eq 6 to the measured profiles in eq 6 h wg1 is the wave height measured by wg1 and x represents the distance of the measuring point to wg1 it can be seen that the interactions between waves and opposing currents significantly increase the attenuation modulus especially for cases with larger current velocity the average wave attenuation modulus for wave opposing current cases is nearly 5 5 times of that for wave alone cases regarding the cases of the waves with the following currents it doesn t conform with the conclusion of kemp and simons 1983 and simons et al 1988 they found that the presences of following currents reduce the attenuation rate of the regular wave however the results presented in fig 7 show that when the solitary wave travels with following currents the wave attenuation modulus is slightly increased nearly being 1 6 times the average wave attenuation modulus for wave alone cases a possible explanation for the slight increase is the shear stress caused by the velocity gradient for the solitary wave alone cases the velocity gradient along the vertical direction du dz is small as seen in fig 9 a the curve of u c 0 m s whereas when a following current is introduced the velocity gradient along the vertical direction du dz is relatively larger as seen in fig 10 a the curve of u c 6 m s the shear force makes additional wave attenuation therefore the attenuation modular is slightly increased by the addition of the following current due to the large wave attenuation the wave height for wave opposing current highly depends on the propagation distance a prediction equation of wave height considering the propagation distance needs further study 3 2 particle velocity of the combined wave current flow fig 9 presents the time histories of water particle velocity for five typical cases wave with a following current u c 0 3 m s wave with an opposing current u c 0 3 m s following current alone opposing current alone and wave alone for these typical cases the water depth the original wave height are 0 7 m and 0 16 m respectively and the velocity meter is located 0 86d 0 6 m above the bottom of the wave flume for the current alone cases the generated currents have a steady velocity in the whole time domain ensuring that the current flow travels with the aimed velocity whenever the wave is generated the time averaging velocities are 0 10c 0 and 0 10c 0 for the following current and opposing current respectively for the wave alone case when the wave crest is arriving the horizontal velocity increases to 0 18c 0 then it decreases to zero again as the wave travels far away for both wave current cases the velocity increases first and then decreases when a solitary wave travels through the measuring point similar to the wave alone case however due to the presence of currents water particles have an initial velocity it is noticed that the peak velocity particle velocity when the wave crest passes through the measuring point of the wave following current case is 0 28c 0 which is equal to the linear sum of the peak velocity of the wave alone case 0 18c 0 and the mean velocity of the current alone case 0 10c 0 one may expect that the horizontal velocity of water particles for the combined wave current flow could be predicted by the linear summation of that for wave alone and current alone it will be discussed in detail later for some selected cases the water depth is d 0 7 m wave height is h 0 0 16 m and the current velocity is ranged from 0 60 m s to 0 60 m s the velocities of the water particle along the water column are measured along the water depth five measuring points z d 0 43 0 57 0 71 0 86 and 0 93 are set due to the limitation of the velocity meter vm1 used in the present experiments which can only measure the particle velocity at one elevation z the elevation of vm1 is adjusted several times according to the measuring point so each selected cases is repeated until the particle velocity at z 0 43d 0 57d 0 71d 0 86d and 0 93d are measured the velocity measured under the wave crest for cases of the wave with following currents and opposing currents are presented in fig 10 a and b respectively shown with the dimensionless axis the peak velocities for the wave alone case are also presented for comparison for the wave alone case u c 0 0 m s the velocity gradient in the vertical direction du dz is small the velocities at middle level z d 0 43 0 57 are slightly smaller than those at top level z d 0 86 0 93 the deviation of the velocity between the middle level and top level is within 7 which can be regarded as uniform distribution after interacting with the following currents the velocity along the water column increases with current velocity additionally it is observed after interacting with the following current the velocity gradient in the vertical direction du dz is increased especially for the cases of u c 0 60 m s the deviation of the velocity between the middle level and top level increases to 11 the linear sums ls of the velocity under wave crest for wave alone flow and the mean velocity for current alone flow are additionally presented to examine the accuracy of this prediction method when the current has a smaller velocity the predicted velocities are close to the measured velocity along the whole water column for example when u c 0 15 m s the ls are very close to the measured velocity and the maximum difference occurred at z d 0 43 is within 2 5 of the measured data with the current velocity increase the ls overestimates the particle velocity at the middle level but still has good accuracy at the top level for the wave with opposing current cases fig 10 b as is expected the peak velocity decrease with the current velocity the ls accurately predicts the particle velocity when the current velocity is small for the current with larger velocity the ls has poor accuracy more experimental results with a broad range of wave heights and water depths are presented in fig 11 the presented velocity results focusing on the peak value are measured 0 1 m below the still water level for example when the water depth is 0 5 m the measuring point is located 0 4 m above the bottom surface of the flume fig 11 a b c and d show that the horizontal velocity of water particles almost linearly increases with current velocity for the wave following current cases and it almost linearly decreases with current velocity for the wave opposing current cases additionally the velocity is higher for the cases with larger wave heights that is attributed to the fact that the velocity of the solitary wave increases with wave height see when u c c 0 0 by comparing fig 11 a b c and d it is observed the velocity of solitary wave current is slightly higher when the water depth is smaller similarly that is due to the velocity of the solitary wave is slightly higher when the water depth is smaller see when u c c 0 0 the ls of the velocity for wave and current alone cases are also presented for all the cases of the wave with the following current the linear sums predict the velocities well with a maximum error of barely 4 90 for the wave with opposing current cases the linear sums agree well with the measured velocities when the current velocity is small however there exists an obvious deviation between the predicted velocity and measured velocity when the opposing current has a large velocity zhang et al 2015 presented the velocity field of the combined solitary wave current motion it is shown that when traveling with following currents the solitary wave retains a similar velocity field with increased intensity whereas the velocity field is significantly modified when the solitary wave travels against a current duan et al 2018 also concluded that the velocity field is significantly modified when the solitary wave travels against a shear current an obvious vortex is observed in the velocity field for the strongly nonlinear interaction between solitary wave and shear currents combining the velocity field presented in these studies and the experimental results presented in this paper it can be concluded that when traveling with a following current the linear sum can accurately predict the velocity near the still water level and it gives a conservative prediction at middle zone when traveling with a weak opposing current it predicts well whereas as the current velocity increase the velocity field is significantly modified and the particle velocity cannot be predicted by the simple linear superimposition 4 experimental results of wave current cylinder interaction 4 1 wave alone condition take the case of d 0 6 m h 0 0 20 m for example the wave elevation measured by wg3 and the history of horizontal force f x and transversal force f y are presented in fig 12 a and b respectively in the following figures the forces are normalized by using ρgr 2 d r is the radius of the cylinder model the marked letters a to d on the horizontal force curve refer to different time moments in the interaction process and the corresponding snapshots are shown in fig 13 a to fig 13 d as seen in fig 13 a before the wave arrives the horizontal force f x on the model is zero see fig 12 b when the wave front strikes the model the water level in the upstream side gradually increases and it is higher than the water level in the downstream side of the model resulting in a positive pressure difference in addition the water particles with positive velocity and positive acceleration act on the model resulting in positive hydrodynamic pressure consequently the horizontal force increases rapidly during the first few seconds of the interaction when the wave crest closes to the model fig 13 b the horizontal force f x gets up to its positive peak fig 13 b also shows that when the wave impacts the model a small part of the wave runs up along the cylinder on the upstream side meanwhile a cavity is observed on the downstream side of the model then with the spread of the wave the cavity expends downstream and on a larger scale fig 13 c in this period the water level in the downstream side gradually increases and the water particles with negative acceleration impact the model thus the horizontal force decreases until reach the negative peak fig 12 b as the water level falls back and the cavity collapses a back flow is formed then the back flow acts on the model fig 13 d resulting in a negative horizontal force as the wave travels far away the horizontal forces finally back to the zero position the positive horizontal peak force f x on the cylinder 68 n is greater than the negative peak force f x 46 n by over 47 8 the transversal force f y on the circle cylinder is almost zero during the whole interaction process 4 2 wave following current condition fig 14 a and b show the time history of wave elevation and wave force for a typical case of the wave with a following current u c 0 60 m s the water depth and wave height are identical to the wave alone case the marked letters a to d on the horizontal force curve refer to different time moments in the interaction process and the corresponding snapshots are shown in fig 15 a to fig 15 d unlike the wave alone case before the solitary wave approaches the cylinder fig 15 a the cylinder subjects a constant and positive horizontal force 0 25ρgr 2 d 23 n exerted by the following current as the wave passes through the model the horizontal force rapidly increases to its peak value and then falls to the balance position and oscillates around the balance position for a while similar to the wave alone case wave run up on the upstream side and a cavity on the downstream side are observed in the wave following current cylinder interaction process fig 15 b and c however it is observed that the wave run up is more obvious and the cavity becomes wider and longer taking an elliptical shape due to the addition of following currents that is mainly attributed to the larger particle velocity of the combined wave following current flow compared with the wave alone case the transversal force induced by the combined wave current flow oscillates more obviously attributing to the current induced vortexes as seen in fig 15 a the current flow is separated into two flows by the model and then the two flows meet again behind the model generating two asymmetric vortexes behind the model fig 16 gives a comparison of the horizontal force induced by the combined wave following current flow and the linear sum of horizontal forces induced by the wave alone and current alone flow the transversal force is not discussed due to its small magnitude the time steps of the wave current results are shifted for matching the linear sum curve it can be seen beside the time difference the shape of the force curve is modified significantly the force induced by the combined flow does not show a negative peak force it is attributed to the addition of the following current on the one hand the continuous action of the following current exerts a stable positive force on the cylinder canceling part of the wave induced negative force out on the other hand due to the presence of the following current the action of back flow on the cylinder is weakened although the cavity downstream of the model is on a larger scale fig 15 c and stronger back flow is formed fig 15 d the back flow interacts with the incident following current before acting on the model fig 15 d the energy of the back flow is consumed due to the interaction in addition due to the presence of the larger cavity the water level in upstream is higher than the water level in downstream fig 15 c resulting in positive pressure in the whole interaction process therefore the negative force does not occur under this condition it should be highlighted that the negative peak force still occurs when the velocity of the following current is lower however the negative peak force is smaller than the positive peak force for all the wave following current cases when it comes to the positive peak forces it is shown that the positive peak force induced by wave following current 1 37ρgr 2 d is larger than the linear sum 0 88ρgr 2 d and it is 1 6 times of the linear sum as previously discussed the water velocity of solitary wave following current is nearly equal to the linear sum of water velocity of wave alone and current alone u wc u w u c u wc velocity of wave current u w water velocity of wave alone and u c water velocity of current alone however the horizontal force on the cylinder is proportional to the velocity square u 2 of the water particles the u wc 2 is larger than the linear sum of u w 2 and u c 2 in addition the wave run up height in the wave current cylinder interaction is higher than that in wave cylinder interaction see in fig 13 b and fig 15 b which further increases the positive peak force therefore the linear sum underestimated the forces induced by the combined wave following current flow xiao et al 2013 studied the solitary wave current induced forces on a horizontal cylinder by numerical simulation in their study the cylinder is placed horizontally and fully submerged into the water their numerical results also showed that both in the horizontal and vertical direction the wave following current induced forces are greater than the linear sum of wave alone and current alone induced forces fig 17 presents the positive peak forces f x on the cylinder model for all the wave following current tests as expected the positive peak force is increased due to the addition of a following current and it continually increases with current velocity that is attributed to the water particle velocity increase with the current velocity in addition it is observed that the positive peak forces have a larger value when the wave height is higher it is also ascribed to the larger particle velocity and the larger action area the linear sum of the peak force induced by wave alone and constant force induced by current alone are additionally presented in fig 17 to make a comparison the linear sum underestimates the combined flow induced force and the differences between the measured force and the estimated force increase with the increase of wave height and current velocity for some conditions the differences is in excess of 36 to provide a simple and accurate prediction method it is assumed that the particle velocity of wave following current is equal to the linear sum of that for wave and current alone flow u wc u w u c and when the wave crest strikes the model the horizontal force gets up to the peak value according to the morison equation it is derived that the solitary wave following current induced positive peak force f wcx can be estimated by the nonlinear superposition of wave induced peak force f wx and current induced force f cx the nonlinear superposition method is shown in eq 7 fig 18 shows the comparison of the peak forces between the measured and the predicted values it is shown that the nonlinear superposition has good agreement with the measured results the relative error shown in eq 8 is used to evaluate the accuracy of the nonlinear superposition method in which f i and f i p are the measured wave force and the predicted wave force respectively and n is the number of tested cases based on eq 8 the related errors between the measured results and the predicted results are 0 0097 it indicates that the nonlinear superposition has good accuracy to predict the solitary wave following current induced peak force for practical engineering application the wave induced force f wx and the current induced force f cx used in eq 7 can be calculated by morison equation and therefore the wave current induced force on vertical cylinders can be obtained by using eq 7 8 f w c x f w x f c x f w x f c x 2 9 e i 1 n f i f i p f i 2 1 n 4 3 wave opposing current condition fig 19 shows the free surface elevation and forces on the cylinder model in the wave opposing current cylinder interaction process the wave height and water depth are identical to the previously discussed two cases but the current has a velocity of u c 0 60 m s the marked letters a to d on the horizontal force curve refer to different time moments in the interaction process and the corresponding snapshots are shown in fig 20 a to fig 20 d before solitary wave arrives the current effect is in dominance and it exerts a stable negative horizontal force as the solitary wave approaches the model the horizontal force first increases to the positive peak and then decreases to the negative peak just as seen in the wave alone case as the wave travels away the horizontal force finally back to its stable value in general the variation trend of the horizontal force is similar to that in the wave alone case however for the wave opposing current cases the negative peak force 0 71ρgr 2 d is larger than the positive peak force 0 48ρgr 2 d by over 48 due to the presence of the opposing current for the transversal force it is similar to the case of a wave with the following current that the transversal force slightly oscillates around zero that is induced by the two vortexes in the upstream side of the model seen in fig 20 a by comparing fig 20 with fig 15 and 13 it is observed that when the combined wave opposing current flow interacts with the cylinder no obvious wave run up occurs and only a small scale cavity in the downstream side occurs fig 20 b the presence of the opposing current impedes the spread of the cavity fig 20 c in addition the generated back flow is very weak compared with the wave following current case fig 20 d fig 21 shows a comparison of horizontal force between the combined wave opposing current flow and the linear sum the time steps of the wave current results are shifted for matching the linear sum curve the curve shapes of the wave current are the same as the linear superposition curve in addition the positive and negative peak forces predicted by the linear superposition are nearly equal to the wave current induced positive and negative peak forces for this specific case fig 22 presents the negative peak forces for the wave opposing currents in general the negative peak force increases with current velocity but for some cases such as for the case of d 0 5 m h 0 0 12 m and 0 16 m when the dimensionless velocity of opposing current increases from 0 05 to 0 20 the negative peak forces show a decreasing trend it is attributed to the decrease of the wave height as shown in fig 5 a for these specific cases the wave height decreases with current velocity due to the larger wave attenuation when the current velocity is constant the negative peak force increases with the original wave height the linear sums of the negative peak force for the wave alone and the negative mean force for the current alone are additionally presented to make a comparison although fig 21 indicates that the negative peak force predicated by the linear sum is close to the negative peak force measured in the combined wave opposing current flow fig 22 indicates that it is not applicable for most cases the linear sum has a poor accuracy to predict the wave opposing current induced negative peak force because the negative peak force is complex and affected by many factors such as the back flow and the cavity in the downstream side of the model it needs further study 5 conclusions the solitary wave current interaction and the solitary wave current interaction with a cylinder are studied by conducting experiments based on the experimental results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 when solitary wave travels with following currents the wave height decreases with increasing current velocity the effect of following current on wave height reduction is more significant for waves with smaller original wave height and in deeper water the reduction in wave height is in excess of 0 2h 0 in the tested cases to predict the wave height when the storm leading wave or tsunami wave travels in the same direction as currents a regression equation is suggested which can serve as a tool to determine the optimal elevation of offshore platforms when traveling with opposing currents the wave height does not vary monotonically with current velocity but shows an increase followed by a decrease the increments caused by the opposing current are limited to 0 06h 0 for all the tested cases however the decrements even reach to 0 12h 0 for strong current cases the critical current velocity that the wave height begins to decrease is smaller for shallower water for the tested case with d h 0 2 5 the critical current velocity uc c 0 tails off to 0 063 when the current velocity larger than the critical velocity the wave height begins to decrease with the increase of current velocity it even decreases to a value smaller than its original wave height for stronger current meanwhile the traveling speed of storm leading wave or tsunami wave slows down due to the presence of the opposing current it suggests that the strong opposing current during tsunami or storm events could attenuate tsunami or storm attacks on the structures in shallow water 2 the attenuation rate of the solitary wave is increased due to the presence of current the average wave attenuation modulus for wave following current cases is nearly 1 6 times of that for wave alone cases for the wave opposing current cases the wave attenuation is greatly increased reaching 5 5 times of that for wave alone cases the large wave attenuation is the main reason for the fact that the wave height presents decrease trend after acting with strong opposing current if the wave attenuation is neglected for the conditions of storm wave or tsunami wave traveling with opposing current the wave height may be overestimated 3 when a solitary wave travels with following currents the water velocity near still water level is nearly equal to the linear superposition of water velocity of wave alone and current alone that means when a storm leading wave tsunami wave and long period wave travel with following currents the water velocity near still water level can be accurately estimated by the linear superposition 4 the wave cylinder interaction process is significantly affected by the addition of currents compared with the wave alone cases the wave induced cavity at downstream side of the cylinder becomes wider and longer taking an elliptical shape and a stronger back flow is generated due to the addition of following currents whereas the presence of the opposing current impedes the spread of the cavity the positive peak forces on the vertical cylinder is amplified due to the combined effect of the wave and the following current reaching 1 2 3 4 times of the corresponding wave induced positive peak force the linear superimposition of wave induced peak force and the current induced force seriously underestimated the actual peak forces by 36 for the strong current condition therefore a nonlinear superimposition method with higher accuracy is suggested for estimating the tsunami wave or storm leading wave and following current induced combined forces on a cylinder structure for practical engineering credit authorship contribution statement

20431,the regular wave attenuation in following and opposing currents due to rigid emergent vegetation has been studied by physical and numerical simulation in this study firstly laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation then to overcome the limitation of the experimental conditions a numerical model based on the boussinesq equations and validated by the experimental results was applied to further investigate the effects of current velocity vegetation density and water depth on wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents with larger α the ratio of current velocity to the amplitude of the horizontal wave orbital velocity range the results show that both following and opposing currents can enhance or suppress wave attenuation due to vegetation depending on α for the studied vegetation densities and water depths the effect of wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents first decreases and then increases with the increase of α moreover wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents is increased with the increase of vegetation density and decreased with the increase of water depth and both of them have no influence on the relationship between relative wave height decay and α keywords current effect on wave wave attenuation coastal vegetation numerical study 1 introduction coastal areas are commonly economically developed and densely populated around the world because of global climate change and sea level rise engineers started to search for sustainable solutions to protect coasts from flooding and erosion temmerman et al 2013 coastal vegetation such as mangroves or salt marshes has been widely recognised to be a good shelter to protect coasts by dissipating wave energy lara et al 2016 and wave attenuation due to vegetation has been studied by some researchers and a lot of progress have also been made e g augustin et al 2009 anderson and smith 2014 tang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 tang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 in coastal zones waves usually propagate in the same direction with tidal currents during high tide and in the opposing direction with tidal currents during ebb tide hence study on wave attenuation in following and opposing currents due to rigid vegetation is crucial for accurately understanding the efficiency of coastal vegetation in protection coastal zones some researchers have also investigated wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents by laboratory experiments or numerical simulation ota et al 2005 conducted a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of vegetation on waves and currents and extended the model proposed by kobayashi et al 1993 by a linear combination of waves and currents li and yan 2007 developed a fully 3 d numerical model to simulate wave current vegetation interaction and found that wave height damping is larger in following currents compared to that in the absence of currents paul et al 2012 studied wave attenuation in the absence and presence of currents and the results showed that currents can significantly reduce the wave damping capacity of vegetation which was contrast with the results of li and yan 2007 hu et al 2014 investigated the effect of following currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation by conducting a series of experiments and found that following currents can either enhance or reduce the wave damping capacity of vegetation which depends on the ratio of current velocity to amplitude of the horizontal wave orbital velocity α however the effect of opposing currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation were not considered in hu et al 2014 and the experiments were short of the cases with small current velocities following the approach proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 losada et al 2016 presented a new formulation for vegetation induced wave damping in both following and opposing currents lara et al 2016 and maza et al 2015 conducted a set of experiments in a wave basin to study wave and current interaction with salt marsh vegetation and only one current velocity was considered they found that following currents lead to a smaller wave damping while opposing currents lead to an increase in wave damping rate chen et al 2018 compared the conventional calibration approach with the new direct measurement approach to derive vegetation drag coefficient c d and proposed a relationship between vegetation drag coefficient c d and keulegan carpenter number kc yin et al 2020 investigated wave attenuation by rigid emergent vegetation in following and opposing currents and found that opposing currents can always enhance wave attenuation due to vegetation while following currents may enhance or suppress it but the smallest velocity ratio α considered in the study was 0 365 the cases with smaller velocity ratio were deficiency these researches have improved our insight into the attenuation effects of vegetation on waves in currents however compared with the existing research progress of wave attenuation due to vegetation in following currents the effects of opposing currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation have been studied rarely and the effects of currents with different velocities especially small velocities on wave attenuation by vegetation are also far from understood the present paper investigates the effects of following and opposing currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the setup of the laboratory experiments and analyses the experimental results in section 3 to overcome the limitation of the experimental conditions a numerical model based on the boussinesq equations and validated by the experimental results is applied to further investigate the effects of current velocity vegetation density and water depth on wave attenuation due to vegetation in following and opposing currents with larger velocity ratio range section 4 presents the conclusions of the present study 2 laboratory experimental set up and results analysis physical laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate wave attenuation in following and opposing currents due to rigid vegetation at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology china the flume was 50 0 m long 1 0 m deep and 3 0 m wide and was divided into two parts 2 2 m wide and 0 8 m wide and the experiments were conducted in the 0 8 m wide part the experimental setup is showed in fig 1 there was a piston type wave maker at the left end of the flume and a sponge layer at the right end a current circulation system was equipped with the flume which can generate uniform following currents flow from left to right or opposing currents flow from right to left it is assumed in the present study that 1 the vegetation is simplified as an array of rigid cylinders and the sway of the cylinders are neglected 2 currents are uniform over the water depth 3 currents and waves are colinear 4 energy dissipation is assumed to be caused by drag force 5 turbulent velocity fluctuations are neglected the emergent rigid vegetation was simulated by wooden cylinders of 0 005 m in diameter 0 6 m in height the vegetation density was 555 m2 and the configuration is showed in fig 2 the vegetation area was 5 m long and fully occupied the 0 8 m wide channel wave gauges and advs were installed to measure wave height and current velocity the wave gauges were sampled at 50 hz for 60 s and the measurement accuracy is 0 001 m the advs were also sampled at 50 hz for 60 s and the measurement accuracy is 0 001 m s to avoid spikes in the velocity record the data recorded by advs were dealt with median filtering method and the filtering neighbourhood size was set to be 5 the locations of vegetation area and measuring instrument are showed in fig 1 and table 1 the adv sensors were set at half of the water depth position experimental tests were carried out with different water depths and various wave current conditions table 2 in which h is the still water depth h i is the incident wave height t is the wave period and u 0 is the imposed current velocity to evaluate the effects of following and opposing currents on wave height attenuation the relationship between the relative wave height decay r w and α is shown in fig 3 where α is the absolute value of u 0 u w and u w is the amplitude of the horizontal wave orbital velocity the relative wave height decay is defined as hu et al 2014 1 r w δ h c w δ h p w where δ h c w is the reduced wave height per unit length of vegetation in currents and δ h p w is that in pure wave thus except the cases at the transition points where r w 1 the wave attenuation due to vegetation in all cases is influenced by currents from fig 3 a and b it can be seen that in different conditions the values of α at the transition points vary from 0 35 to 1 25 when α is larger than the values at the transition points r w 1 it means that wave attenuation due to vegetation is increased in currents when α is less than the values at the transition points r w 1 it means that wave attenuation due to vegetation is decreased in currents in fig 3 the experimental results are also compared with those obtained from an analytical model proposed by hu et al 2014 it can be seen that the experimental results of both following and opposing currents fit well with the model on the whole but there is still some differences between them fig 3 a shows the experimental data for following current conditions it shows that the values of α at the transition points vary from 0 4 to 1 25 and r w is slightly lower than the analytical model on the whole fig 3 b shows the experimental data for opposing current conditions it shows that the values of α at the transition points vary from 0 35 to 0 9 which is less than that of following current conditions moreover in opposing currents when α is less than the values at the transition points r w is lower than the analytical model but when α is larger than the values at the transition points r w is higher than the model it means that when α is less than the values at the transition points r w 1 though both following and opposing currents decrease the wave attenuation effect due to vegetation the wave attenuation due to vegetation in following currents is larger than that in opposing currents when u 0 is relatively small when α exceeds the values at the transition points r w 1 r w of following currents is smaller than that of opposing currents which means that the wave attenuation due to vegetation in following currents is smaller than that in opposing currents when u 0 is relatively big in conclusion both following and opposing currents can enhance or suppress wave attenuation due to vegetation which depends on velocity ratio however this is contrary with the conclusion of yin et al 2020 which declares that following currents can either enhance or suppress wave attenuation due to vegetation while opposing currents always enhance it this is because that the smallest current velocity in the experiments of yin et al 2020 is 0 1 m s and the smallest velocity ratio α is 0 365 which is larger than the smallest value of α at the transition points of opposing currents 0 35 that is to say the experiments with r w 1 in opposing currents are deficiency in yin et al 2020 so their conclusion on opposing currents is limited 3 numerical model and results analysis 3 1 numerical model setup in the experimental study the maximum stable current velocity that can be generated is quite small due to the limitation of the current devices hence the numerical study is applied to expand the range of α to get a more comprehensive conclusion for further study in coastal zones boussinesq equations are efficient model for simulating

be expressed as 13 c d 1 749 422 r e 1 313 the governing equations are solved by using a finite difference method and forecast correction method to perform time integration the details of the numerical solution of the model can be found in the references liu and sun 2005 zou and fang 2008 lagrangian manner can be also used to solved the governing equations sarpkaya 1989 kathir and lucey 2012 kornev and samarbakhsh 2019 bimbato et al 2019 3 2 numerical model validation some of the experimental results in section 2 table 3 were used to validate the accuracy of the present numerical model the numerical model was run on a uniform spatial grid with spatial resolution δ x 0 04 m and time steps δ t 0 02 s the total computing time was 60 s the comparisons between the experimental and numerical results of wave height are showed in fig 5 and the mean square error mse of each case are also showed it can be seen that the simulated wave heights are agreed well with the measured results on the whole for all cases and the model can well predict wave propagation through vegetation in following and opposing currents as well as in the absence of currents 3 3 numerical experiments and analysis 3 3 1 the effect of current direction and velocity on wave attenuation by vegetation because of the limitation of the wave and current making system the range of α in physical experiments is quite small in this part numerical tests with a much larger range of α were conducted to further investigate the effect of currents with different directions and velocities on wave attenuation due to vegetation the numerical wave flume was 57 m long with water depth h 0 5 m and a 6 m long sponge layer at the right end fig 6 shows the profile of the numerical flume the vegetation area with a density of 500 unit m2 was 5 m long and occupied the full width of the flume the vegetation stem was 0 65 m height and the diameter was 0 005 m in the numerical tests regular waves with different heights and periods were generated at boundary the incident wave and current parameters in the numerical simulation are listed in table 4 for the absolute values of velocity ratio α in physical experiments were mainly from 0 4 to 1 5 the range of α in numerical tests was expanded from 0 to 4 the spatial step δ x 0 04 m and time step δ t 0 02 s and the total computing time was 60 s fig 7 shows the numerical results of wave height evolution of case a in vegetation area in following and opposing currents with velocity 0 02 m s 0 10 m s and 0 20 m s as well as in the absence of currents where k v is the relative wave height defined as dalrymple et al 1984 14 k v h h 0 where h is the wave height in vegetation area h 0 is the initial wave height at the beginning of vegetation area it can be seen that currents have an obvious effect on wave height attenuation due to vegetation when current velocity is relatively small k v in both following and opposing currents is higher than that in the absence of currents as current velocity is larger k v is lower than that in the absence of currents and k v is lower in opposing currents than that in following currents with same current velocity moreover k v is decreased with the increase of the absolute value of current velocity in both of following and opposing currents to further evaluate the effect of following and opposing currents on wave height attenuation the relationship between r w and α is shown in fig 8 it can be seen that for different wave conditions the transition point has different value the smaller the amplitude of the horizontal wave orbital velocity is the larger the value of the transition point is furthermore when α is smaller than the value of transition point r w 1 following currents have a better effect on wave attenuation due to vegetation than opposing currents and it can be seen that r w reaches the minimum value in this range when α is larger than the transition point r w 1 wave attenuation due to vegetation gets larger with the increase of current velocity and opposing currents have a larger effect on wave attenuation due to vegetation than following currents this is possibly caused by the doppler effect according to the doppler effect wave height increases in opposing currents and decreases in following currents and vegetation has a better attenuation effect on wave with larger wave height yang et al 2018 3 3 2 the effect of vegetation density on wave attenuation by vegetation in currents the current velocity in vegetation zone can be influenced by vegetation density as vegetation density increases the vegetation frontal area normal to current is increased which leads to the increase of current velocity in vegetation zone thus vegetation density should have an obvious impact on wave attenuation in currents in this part vegetation with 3 different densities are investigated numerically to find out the effect of vegetation density on wave attenuation due to vegetation in following and opposing currents the numerical flume was 57 m long with water depth 0 5 m and a 6 m long sponge layer at the right end incident waves with height 0 05 m and period 1 5 s were generated at the left boundary vegetation with stem diameter 0 005 m height 0 65 m and density n v 168 m2 333 m2 and 500 m2 were used to examine the sensitivity of wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents to vegetation density several following and opposing current velocities were tested for every case and wave propagation through vegetation area in the absence of currents were simulated to be controlled tests the parameter settings in the numerical simulation are shown in table 5 the spatial step δ x 0 04 m and time step δ t 0 02 s and the total computing time was 80 s fig 9 shows the relation of wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h to vegetation solid volume fraction φ in vegetation area in which r h h 0 h 1 h 0 where h 1 is the wave height at the end of vegetation area it can be seen that the wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents increases with the increase of vegetation density in vegetation with all the densities when current velocity is small u 0 0 04 m s α less than the values at the transition points wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h is decreased by currents when current velocity is large u 0 0 15 m s α bigger than the values at the transition points wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h is increased by currents and r h in opposing currents is larger than that in following currents which is consistent with the conclusions in section 2 moreover as vegetation solid volume fraction φ increasing the difference between r h with large current velocity u 0 0 15 m s and r h with no current is increasing while the difference between r h with small current velocity u 0 0 04 m s and r h with no current is decreasing this means that wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h in currents is increased with the increase of vegetation density no matter velocity ratio α is larger or smaller than the values of α at the transition points the variation of relative wave height decay r w with velocity ratio α of different vegetation densities in following and opposing currents are showed in fig 10 it can be seen that all the points can be fitted into one curve on the whole and the values of α at the transition points are not influenced by vegetation density that is to say vegetation density do not impact the relationship of r w and α moreover for all vegetation density relative wave height decay r w first decreases and then increase with the increase of velocity ratio α and with relatively big α r w in opposing currents is larger than that in following currents which is consistent with the conclusions in section 2 so the conclusions are adaptable for different vegetation densities 3 3 3 the effect of water depth on wave attenuation by vegetation in currents because following and opposing currents are usually companied with water level increasing and decreasing in this part the effect of water depth on wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents was investigated numerically the numerical flume was 57 m long with a 6 m long sponge layer at the right end water depth was set as 0 5 m 0 6 m and 0 7 m to examine the sensitivity of wave attenuation due to vegetation to water depth incident waves with height 0 05 m and period 1 5 s were generated at the left boundary vegetation area was 5 m long with stem diameter 0 005 m height 0 65 m and density n v 500 m2 several following and opposing current velocities were tested for every case and wave propagation through vegetation area in the absence of currents were simulated to be controlled tests the parameter settings in the numerical simulation are shown in table 6 the spatial step δ x 0 04 m and time step δ t 0 02 s and the total computing time was 80 s fig 11 shows the relation of wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h to relative water depth h h i with different current conditions it can be seen that in both following and opposing currents wave height attenuation rate due to vegetation is decreased with the increase of water depth moreover in all water depths wave height attenuation rate in currents with small α u 0 0 02 m s is smaller than that in the absence of currents and wave height attenuation rate in currents with large α u 0 0 15 m s is bigger than that in the absence of currents fig 12 shows the variation of relative wave height decay r w with velocity ratio α with different water depths in following and opposing currents it can be seen that all the points can be fitted into one curve in other words the relationship of r w and α are not influenced by water depth moreover for all water depths r w first decreases and then increases with the increase of α and with relatively big α r w in opposing currents is larger than that in following currents which is consistent with the conclusions in section 2 this indicates that the conclusions are adaptable for different water depths 4 conclusions the effects of following and opposing currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation were investigated by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations firstly a series of physical experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of following and opposing currents with different velocities on wave attenuation due to vegetation the results show that both of following and opposing currents can increase or decrease wave attenuation due to vegetation which depends on the absolute value of ratio between the current velocity and the amplitude of horizontal wave orbital velocity α then the numerical model based on boussinesq equations and validated by the experimental results was adopted to expand the range of α to get a more comprehensive conclusion for further study the results show that when α is smaller than the value of transition point both following and opposing currents decrease the effect of wave attenuation due to vegetation but following currents have a more obvious effect when α exceeds the value of transition point the wave attenuation effect due to vegetation is enhanced by currents and opposing currents have a more obvious effect than following currents which can be explained by the doppler effect furthermore wave attenuation due to vegetation first decreases and then increases with the increase of α moreover for the studied vegetation densities wave attenuation due to vegetation is increased with the increase of vegetation density in currents and vegetation density has no influence on the relationship between relative wave height decay r w and α for the studied water depths wave attenuation due to vegetation is decreased with the increase of water depth and the relationship of r w and α is also not influenced by water depth in the present study currents are orthogonal with the propagation direction of waves however in nature oblique currents and waves can always be found in coastal area in the future study experimental and numerical studies may be developed to investigate the interaction of vegetation and oblique currents and waves credit authorship contribution statement chuyan zhao data curation formal analysis writing original draft jun tang conceptualization

20431,the regular wave attenuation in following and opposing currents due to rigid emergent vegetation has been studied by physical and numerical simulation in this study firstly laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation then to overcome the limitation of the experimental conditions a numerical model based on the boussinesq equations and validated by the experimental results was applied to further investigate the effects of current velocity vegetation density and water depth on wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents with larger α the ratio of current velocity to the amplitude of the horizontal wave orbital velocity range the results show that both following and opposing currents can enhance or suppress wave attenuation due to vegetation depending on α for the studied vegetation densities and water depths the effect of wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents first decreases and then increases with the increase of α moreover wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents is increased with the increase of vegetation density and decreased with the increase of water depth and both of them have no influence on the relationship between relative wave height decay and α keywords current effect on wave wave attenuation coastal vegetation numerical study 1 introduction coastal areas are commonly economically developed and densely populated around the world because of global climate change and sea level rise engineers started to search for sustainable solutions to protect coasts from flooding and erosion temmerman et al 2013 coastal vegetation such as mangroves or salt marshes has been widely recognised to be a good shelter to protect coasts by dissipating wave energy lara et al 2016 and wave attenuation due to vegetation has been studied by some researchers and a lot of progress have also been made e g augustin et al 2009 anderson and smith 2014 tang et al 2015 yang et al 2018 tang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 in coastal zones waves usually propagate in the same direction with tidal currents during high tide and in the opposing direction with tidal currents during ebb tide hence study on wave attenuation in following and opposing currents due to rigid vegetation is crucial for accurately understanding the efficiency of coastal vegetation in protection coastal zones some researchers have also investigated wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents by laboratory experiments or numerical simulation ota et al 2005 conducted a series of laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of vegetation on waves and currents and extended the model proposed by kobayashi et al 1993 by a linear combination of waves and currents li and yan 2007 developed a fully 3 d numerical model to simulate wave current vegetation interaction and found that wave height damping is larger in following currents compared to that in the absence of currents paul et al 2012 studied wave attenuation in the absence and presence of currents and the results showed that currents can significantly reduce the wave damping capacity of vegetation which was contrast with the results of li and yan 2007 hu et al 2014 investigated the effect of following currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation by conducting a series of experiments and found that following currents can either enhance or reduce the wave damping capacity of vegetation which depends on the ratio of current velocity to amplitude of the horizontal wave orbital velocity α however the effect of opposing currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation were not considered in hu et al 2014 and the experiments were short of the cases with small current velocities following the approach proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 losada et al 2016 presented a new formulation for vegetation induced wave damping in both following and opposing currents lara et al 2016 and maza et al 2015 conducted a set of experiments in a wave basin to study wave and current interaction with salt marsh vegetation and only one current velocity was considered they found that following currents lead to a smaller wave damping while opposing currents lead to an increase in wave damping rate chen et al 2018 compared the conventional calibration approach with the new direct measurement approach to derive vegetation drag coefficient c d and proposed a relationship between vegetation drag coefficient c d and keulegan carpenter number kc yin et al 2020 investigated wave attenuation by rigid emergent vegetation in following and opposing currents and found that opposing currents can always enhance wave attenuation due to vegetation while following currents may enhance or suppress it but the smallest velocity ratio α considered in the study was 0 365 the cases with smaller velocity ratio were deficiency these researches have improved our insight into the attenuation effects of vegetation on waves in currents however compared with the existing research progress of wave attenuation due to vegetation in following currents the effects of opposing currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation have been studied rarely and the effects of currents with different velocities especially small velocities on wave attenuation by vegetation are also far from understood the present paper investigates the effects of following and opposing currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the setup of the laboratory experiments and analyses the experimental results in section 3 to overcome the limitation of the experimental conditions a numerical model based on the boussinesq equations and validated by the experimental results is applied to further investigate the effects of current velocity vegetation density and water depth on wave attenuation due to vegetation in following and opposing currents with larger velocity ratio range section 4 presents the conclusions of the present study 2 laboratory experimental set up and results analysis physical laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate wave attenuation in following and opposing currents due to rigid vegetation at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology china the flume was 50 0 m long 1 0 m deep and 3 0 m wide and was divided into two parts 2 2 m wide and 0 8 m wide and the experiments were conducted in the 0 8 m wide part the experimental setup is showed in fig 1 there was a piston type wave maker at the left end of the flume and a sponge layer at the right end a current circulation system was equipped with the flume which can generate uniform following currents flow from left to right or opposing currents flow from right to left it is assumed in the present study that 1 the vegetation is simplified as an array of rigid cylinders and the sway of the cylinders are neglected 2 currents are uniform over the water depth 3 currents and waves are colinear 4 energy dissipation is assumed to be caused by drag force 5 turbulent velocity fluctuations are neglected the emergent rigid vegetation was simulated by wooden cylinders of 0 005 m in diameter 0 6 m in height the vegetation density was 555 m2 and the configuration is showed in fig 2 the vegetation area was 5 m long and fully occupied the 0 8 m wide channel wave gauges and advs were installed to measure wave height and current velocity the wave gauges were sampled at 50 hz for 60 s and the measurement accuracy is 0 001 m the advs were also sampled at 50 hz for 60 s and the measurement accuracy is 0 001 m s to avoid spikes in the velocity record the data recorded by advs were dealt with median filtering method and the filtering neighbourhood size was set to be 5 the locations of vegetation area and measuring instrument are showed in fig 1 and table 1 the adv sensors were set at half of the water depth position experimental tests were carried out with different water depths and various wave current conditions table 2 in which h is the still water depth h i is the incident wave height t is the wave period and u 0 is the imposed current velocity to evaluate the effects of following and opposing currents on wave height attenuation the relationship between the relative wave height decay r w and α is shown in fig 3 where α is the absolute value of u 0 u w and u w is the amplitude of the horizontal wave orbital velocity the relative wave height decay is defined as hu et al 2014 1 r w δ h c w δ h p w where δ h c w is the reduced wave height per unit length of vegetation in currents and δ h p w is that in pure wave thus except the cases at the transition points where r w 1 the wave attenuation due to vegetation in all cases is influenced by currents from fig 3 a and b it can be seen that in different conditions the values of α at the transition points vary from 0 35 to 1 25 when α is larger than the values at the transition points r w 1 it means that wave attenuation due to vegetation is increased in currents when α is less than the values at the transition points r w 1 it means that wave attenuation due to vegetation is decreased in currents in fig 3 the experimental results are also compared with those obtained from an analytical model proposed by hu et al 2014 it can be seen that the experimental results of both following and opposing currents fit well with the model on the whole but there is still some differences between them fig 3 a shows the experimental data for following current conditions it shows that the values of α at the transition points vary from 0 4 to 1 25 and r w is slightly lower than the analytical model on the whole fig 3 b shows the experimental data for opposing current conditions it shows that the values of α at the transition points vary from 0 35 to 0 9 which is less than that of following current conditions moreover in opposing currents when α is less than the values at the transition points r w is lower than the analytical model but when α is larger than the values at the transition points r w is higher than the model it means that when α is less than the values at the transition points r w 1 though both following and opposing currents decrease the wave attenuation effect due to vegetation the wave attenuation due to vegetation in following currents is larger than that in opposing currents when u 0 is relatively small when α exceeds the values at the transition points r w 1 r w of following currents is smaller than that of opposing currents which means that the wave attenuation due to vegetation in following currents is smaller than that in opposing currents when u 0 is relatively big in conclusion both following and opposing currents can enhance or suppress wave attenuation due to vegetation which depends on velocity ratio however this is contrary with the conclusion of yin et al 2020 which declares that following currents can either enhance or suppress wave attenuation due to vegetation while opposing currents always enhance it this is because that the smallest current velocity in the experiments of yin et al 2020 is 0 1 m s and the smallest velocity ratio α is 0 365 which is larger than the smallest value of α at the transition points of opposing currents 0 35 that is to say the experiments with r w 1 in opposing currents are deficiency in yin et al 2020 so their conclusion on opposing currents is limited 3

2012 kornev and samarbakhsh 2019 bimbato et al 2019 3 2 numerical model validation some of the experimental results in section 2 table 3 were used to validate the accuracy of the present numerical model the numerical model was run on a uniform spatial grid with spatial resolution δ x 0 04 m and time steps δ t 0 02 s the total computing time was 60 s the comparisons between the experimental and numerical results of wave height are showed in fig 5 and the mean square error mse of each case are also showed it can be seen that the simulated wave heights are agreed well with the measured results on the whole for all cases and the model can well predict wave propagation through vegetation in following and opposing currents as well as in the absence of currents 3 3 numerical experiments and analysis 3 3 1 the effect of current direction and velocity on wave attenuation by vegetation because of the limitation of the wave and current making system the range of α in physical experiments is quite small in this part numerical tests with a much larger range of α were conducted to further investigate the effect of currents with different directions and velocities on wave attenuation due to vegetation the numerical wave flume was 57 m long with water depth h 0 5 m and a 6 m long sponge layer at the right end fig 6 shows the profile of the numerical flume the vegetation area with a density of 500 unit m2 was 5 m long and occupied the full width of the flume the vegetation stem was 0 65 m height and the diameter was 0 005 m in the numerical tests regular waves with different heights and periods were generated at boundary the incident wave and current parameters in the numerical simulation are listed in table 4 for the absolute values of velocity ratio α in physical experiments were mainly from 0 4 to 1 5 the range of α in numerical tests was expanded from 0 to 4 the spatial step δ x 0 04 m and time step δ t 0 02 s and the total computing time was 60 s fig 7 shows the numerical results of wave height evolution of case a in vegetation area in following and opposing currents with velocity 0 02 m s 0 10 m s and 0 20 m s as well as in the absence of currents where k v is the relative wave height defined as dalrymple et al 1984 14 k v h h 0 where h is the wave height in vegetation area h 0 is the initial wave height at the beginning of vegetation area it can be seen that currents have an obvious effect on wave height attenuation due to vegetation when current velocity is relatively small k v in both following and opposing currents is higher than that in the absence of currents as current velocity is larger k v is lower than that in the absence of currents and k v is lower in opposing currents than that in following currents with same current velocity moreover k v is decreased with the increase of the absolute value of current velocity in both of following and opposing currents to further evaluate the effect of following and opposing currents on wave height attenuation the relationship between r w and α is shown in fig 8 it can be seen that for different wave conditions the transition point has different value the smaller the amplitude of the horizontal wave orbital velocity is the larger the value of the transition point is furthermore when α is smaller than the value of transition point r w 1 following currents have a better effect on wave attenuation due to vegetation than opposing currents and it can be seen that r w reaches the minimum value in this range when α is larger than the transition point r w 1 wave attenuation due to vegetation gets larger with the increase of current velocity and opposing currents have a larger effect on wave attenuation due to vegetation than following currents this is possibly caused by the doppler effect according to the doppler effect wave height increases in opposing currents and decreases in following currents and vegetation has a better attenuation effect on wave with larger wave height yang et al 2018 3 3 2 the effect of vegetation density on wave attenuation by vegetation in currents the current velocity in vegetation zone can be influenced by vegetation density as vegetation density increases the vegetation frontal area normal to current is increased which leads to the increase of current velocity in vegetation zone thus vegetation density should have an obvious impact on wave attenuation in currents in this part vegetation with 3 different densities are investigated numerically to find out the effect of vegetation density on wave attenuation due to vegetation in following and opposing currents the numerical flume was 57 m long with water depth 0 5 m and a 6 m long sponge layer at the right end incident waves with height 0 05 m and period 1 5 s were generated at the left boundary vegetation with stem diameter 0 005 m height 0 65 m and density n v 168 m2 333 m2 and 500 m2 were used to examine the sensitivity of wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents to vegetation density several following and opposing current velocities were tested for every case and wave propagation through vegetation area in the absence of currents were simulated to be controlled tests the parameter settings in the numerical simulation are shown in table 5 the spatial step δ x 0 04 m and time step δ t 0 02 s and the total computing time was 80 s fig 9 shows the relation of wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h to vegetation solid volume fraction φ in vegetation area in which r h h 0 h 1 h 0 where h 1 is the wave height at the end of vegetation area it can be seen that the wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents increases with the increase of vegetation density in vegetation with all the densities when current velocity is small u 0 0 04 m s α less than the values at the transition points wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h is decreased by currents when current velocity is large u 0 0 15 m s α bigger than the values at the transition points wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h is increased by currents and r h in opposing currents is larger than that in following currents which is consistent with the conclusions in section 2 moreover as vegetation solid volume fraction φ increasing the difference between r h with large current velocity u 0 0 15 m s and r h with no current is increasing while the difference between r h with small current velocity u 0 0 04 m s and r h with no current is decreasing this means that wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h in currents is increased with the increase of vegetation density no matter velocity ratio α is larger or smaller than the values of α at the transition points the variation of relative wave height decay r w with velocity ratio α of different vegetation densities in following and opposing currents are showed in fig 10 it can be seen that all the points can be fitted into one curve on the whole and the values of α at the transition points are not influenced by vegetation density that is to say vegetation density do not impact the relationship of r w and α moreover for all vegetation density relative wave height decay r w first decreases and then increase with the increase of velocity ratio α and with relatively big α r w in opposing currents is larger than that in following currents which is consistent with the conclusions in section 2 so the conclusions are adaptable for different vegetation densities 3 3 3 the effect of water depth on wave attenuation by vegetation in currents because following and opposing currents are usually companied with water level increasing and decreasing in this part the effect of water depth on wave attenuation due to vegetation in currents was investigated numerically the numerical flume was 57 m long with a 6 m long sponge layer at the right end water depth was set as 0 5 m 0 6 m and 0 7 m to examine the sensitivity of wave attenuation due to vegetation to water depth incident waves with height 0 05 m and period 1 5 s were generated at the left boundary vegetation area was 5 m long with stem diameter 0 005 m height 0 65 m and density n v 500 m2 several following and opposing current velocities were tested for every case and wave propagation through vegetation area in the absence of currents were simulated to be controlled tests the parameter settings in the numerical simulation are shown in table 6 the spatial step δ x 0 04 m and time step δ t 0 02 s and the total computing time was 80 s fig 11 shows the relation of wave attenuation rate due to vegetation r h to relative water depth h h i with different current conditions it can be seen that in both following and opposing currents wave height attenuation rate due to vegetation is decreased with the increase of water depth moreover in all water depths wave height attenuation rate in currents with small α u 0 0 02 m s is smaller than that in the absence of currents and wave height attenuation rate in currents with large α u 0 0 15 m s is bigger than that in the absence of currents fig 12 shows the variation of relative wave height decay r w with velocity ratio α with different water depths in following and opposing currents it can be seen that all the points can be fitted into one curve in other words the relationship of r w and α are not influenced by water depth moreover for all water depths r w first decreases and then increases with the increase of α and with relatively big α r w in opposing currents is larger than that in following currents which is consistent with the conclusions in section 2 this indicates that the conclusions are adaptable for different water depths 4 conclusions the effects of following and opposing currents on wave attenuation due to vegetation were investigated by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations firstly a series of physical experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of following and opposing currents with different velocities on wave attenuation due to vegetation the results show that both of following and opposing currents can increase or decrease wave attenuation due to vegetation which depends on the absolute value of ratio between the current velocity and the amplitude of horizontal wave orbital velocity α then the numerical model based on boussinesq equations and validated by the experimental results was adopted to expand the range of α to get a more comprehensive conclusion for further study the results show that when α is smaller than the value of transition point both following and opposing currents decrease the effect of wave attenuation due to vegetation but following currents have a more obvious effect when α exceeds the value of transition point the wave attenuation effect due to vegetation is enhanced by currents and opposing currents have a more obvious effect than following currents which can be explained by the doppler effect furthermore wave attenuation due to vegetation first decreases and then increases with the increase of α moreover for the studied vegetation densities wave attenuation due to vegetation is increased with the increase of vegetation density in currents and vegetation density has no influence on the relationship between relative wave height decay r w and α for the studied water depths wave attenuation due to vegetation is decreased with the increase of water depth and the relationship of r w and α is also not influenced by water depth in the present study currents are orthogonal with the propagation direction of waves however in nature oblique currents and waves can always be found in coastal area in the future study experimental and numerical studies may be developed to investigate the interaction of vegetation and oblique currents and waves credit authorship contribution statement chuyan zhao data curation formal analysis writing original draft jun tang conceptualization

20432,a submersible multi state vehicle smv has been designed as an unmanned surface vehicle with global deployment capability it can switch between several states including underwater semi submerged and surface states free running tests on the self propelled model are performed to validate the multi state transition principle of the smv with kinematic and hydrodynamic parameters recorded during the tests three dimensional force sensors are designed to measure the wing forces which provide insights into the mechanism of the state transition process a series of tests conducted using program control methods verify the feasibility of the multi state sailing and continuous state transition of the smv appropriate threshold values for the wings to control depth and trim angle of the vehicle are determined through case studies on the dynamic performance the wing forces measured show extraordinarily different characteristics and functions in different states which provides useful information for further improvements to the design keywords unmanned surface vehicle usv multi state self propelled model free running test wing force sensors 1 introduction unmanned surface vehicles usvs have gradually shown their potential capabilities in scientific research and military applications many advanced marine usv have been proposed achieving significant progress in terms of the path optimization intelligent control dynamics modeling and special operations mou et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 faramin et al 2019 peng et al 2020 with the development of joint unmanned maritime systems the global deployment capability has gradually become one of the key considerations in the usv design which means that a usv should be able to endure any rough sea conditions it encounters traditional methods to improve seakeeping level of the ship mainly focus on designing advanced hull forms such as swath multi hull hydrofoils and stabilization system however usvs that carried by the mother ship are typically no more than 10 tons due to the limitation of launching and retrieval system scott et al 2013 thus the seakeeping capability of the hull is significantly restricted by the limited main dimensions of the hull the usv will go with the tide sometimes even swallowed or turned over in high sea states as the wave size is much larger than the hull size hybrid unmanned platform that combines usvs and uuvs enhances the seakeeping capability along with long endurance and continuous communication greatly liu et al 2018 developed a wave driven unmanned surface vehicle wusv which has advantages of a long operating period for long voyages the wusv is composed of a surface float and an underwater tandem foil propulsor tfp connected by an umbilical cable numerical simulations and experiments were performed to estimate its efficiency for utilizing wave energy jin et al 2020 also proposed a hybrid surface and underwater vehicle hsuv which demonstrated its unmanned underwater exploration capabilities in sea trials however there is still sea state limitation to the service of the hybrid unmanned platform another way to improve the seakeeping level of ship board usvs is designing the capability of diving to sufficient depths underwater instead of swaying in the wind and waves ueno 2010 studied the feasibility of using wings to generate downward lift for a submersible surface ship sss the hydrodynamic characteristics of the sss in the vertical and lateral motions were clarified and a simulation was also conducted based on the estimated hydrodynamic derivatives ueno et al 2011 zheng and dong 2012 performed numerical simulation and experiments on the resistance performance of a submersible multi state vehicle smv that can transition between different states according to the conceptual design the smv can sail on surfaces at high speeds surface planning state cruise stealthily in moderate sea conditions semi submerged state dive and move underwater when encountering rough seas fully submerged state huo and dong 2014 2016 conducted numerical investigation on the feasibility of diving and surfacing state transition the critical conditions for surface to underwater state transition are determined theoretically the transition process is greatly influenced by the motion parameters including velocity attitude and the depth chen et al 2019 developed an unmanned semi submersible as a long term rugged and high endurance vessel for the collection of long term continuous and real time marine meteorological measurements including atmospheric sounding in the lower troposphere sergio et al 2019 analyzed the submarine take off and subsequent submarine flight of an unmanned vehicle with two operational modes on sea surface as a catamaran usv and submarine mode as a winged uuv experiments showed that lift generated by the wings is enough to submerge the vehicle at the predicted speeds and an amplifying effect of the lift of the vehicle is verified when sailing on the surface this paper focus on the verification of the feasibility of a submersible multi state vehicle based on ship model experiments the smv can be seen as a combination of planning boat semi submersible and submersible functionally which means that the vehicle need to accommodate with high speed surface planning state medium speed semi submerged state and low speed submerged state respectively the smv is different from conventional planning boat as it is equipped with ballast tanks on both sides the water in the ballast tank will pull out as the vehicle speeds up reducing the total weight of the vehicle in return thus the vehicle will gradually become lighter in the semi submerged to surface planning state transition process which makes the state transition a mass variable process the smv also differs from traditional cylindrical submersible as it has a planning hull bottom and tumblehome hull sides which makes the hull asymmetric in vertical plane apart from the unique hull design the near surface effect the interference between the wings and hull and the control methods all add to the complexity of the multi state transition process these factors make it difficult to conduct accurate numerical simulation or computational fluid dynamics simulation therefore an experimental validation will help to confirm the practicality of the novel hull design before further investigation into technical details essentially the nonlinearity of motion is determined by the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull the wings are the key to the state transition as they will alter the motion tendency given constant propulsion input the wings affect the state transition through the hydrodynamic forces acting on the wings thus measurement of the wing forces will help to better understand the mechanism of the multi state transition process in this paper a 5 6 m long self propelled model is built as a prototype of smv well designed three dimensional force sensors are equipped on the wings shafts to measure the hydrodynamic forces of the wings during the state transition free running tests of the self propelled model are then conducted to find possible ways to realize multi state sailing 2 configuration of a submersible multi state vehicle smv 2 1 main hull design fig 1 shows the 3d design of an smv featuring a tumblehome and a wave piercing head to improve the seakeeping and resistance performance in moderate sea conditions a deep v hull bottom with a varying deadrise angle is adopted to generate a strong hydrodynamic lift at high speed a triangle like cross section ballast tank with open ends is used to provide the main hydrostatic diving forces the tank is placed along the side of the vehicle to fully utilize the inner space the left and right parts of the ballast tank are connected and are largely filled with water in the semi submerged state so that most parts of the vehicle are underwater leaving only a very small radar reflection area above the water the ballast water will run out automatically under the effects of gravity and inertia force when the smv enters the high speed surface planning state two pairs of asymmetric wings naca4412 are fixed amidships and astern to provide the control forces required to achieve state transition and underwater sailing the wings are folded in the semi submerged and surface planning states but stretched out in the underwater state two waterjets are implemented symmetrically on the transom stern 2 2 self propelled model table 1 lists the main characteristic parameters of the smv where δ hull represents the displacement of the hull and the ballast water under a loading condition when most part of the hull is beneath the waterline whereas δ uw is the displacement of the entire hull underwater while the smv has a positive buoyancy the ballast provides hydrostatic loads that take approximately 70 of the total diving forces required for underwater sailing the remaining 30 come from the hydrodynamic components by the wings the hydrodynamic characteristic is vital to the state transition a self propelled model is built to verify the principle of the multi state transition of the smv particularly the feasibility of the mass variable ballast tank combined with the wings the self propelled model of the smv built has 1 5 tons δ uw equipped with fundamental sensors for multi state transition and motion measurements a slight modification was made to the deck including the addition of two gps watertight covers and a wireless antenna as shown in fig 2 the wings are originally designed to be foldable in the full scale vehicle but made into detachable modular in the self propelled model in the tests the model needs to sail with the wings stretched out in the continuous multi state transition process which is disadvantageous for high speed surface planning 2 3 measurement system for kinematic and mechanical parameters the kinematic measurement system is composed of an onboard unit and a continental base as shown in fig 3 the internal connections of the sensors are shown in fig 4 instructions are sent from the upper industrial personal computer ipc of the continental base to the lower ipc onboard either through manual operation or through a program controller a differential antenna da is used to improve the precision of the trajectory measured by the gps the measurement system onboard can collect the real time kinematics and mechanical parameters of the vehicle in the surface planning and semi submerged states the translational location and velocity are provided by the gps antenna whereas the trim and heel angles are obtained from a bi axis tilt angle sensor the heading angle is calculated based on data obtained from both the gps antenna and fiber optic gyroscope two pressure sensors are mounted on the ballast tank to detect the water level in the ballast tank in the underwater state the horizontal motion data are unavailable due to the loss of gps signals nevertheless the rotational motion can be acquired including the trim heel and head angles the depth can be obtained from the pressure sensors mounted on the ballast tank four stepping motors are used to control the wings with the time varying rotation angle recorded and two additional stepping motors are used to control the direction of waterjets the rotation angles of the four wings and two waterjets are also recorded four wing force sensors are mounted respectively on the wing shafts to measure the resistance lift and torque in the wing fixed coordinates a detailed description of the force sensors is given in section 3 the torques acting on the propulsion shafts are measured using dynamic torque sensors which provide inputs for estimating the shaft power all the measured data are collected and transferred to the continental base through a wifi network 3 characteristics of wing force sensors 3 1 three dimensional wing force sensor the wings are the key active control units designed to achieve the multi state transition the hydrodynamic forces including the resistance lift and torque acting on the wings are collected by the force sensors mounted directly on the wing shafts as shown in fig 5 a providing important references for the diving and surfacing maneuvering design moreover the hydrodynamic characteristics reflected by the force sensors give new insights into the mechanism of the multi state motion the three dimensional 3d wing force sensor is a strain gauge sensor with an accuracy of 0 1 f s full scale and a maximum range of 750 n in terms of the lift f z 250 n in terms of the resistance f x and 50 n m in terms of the torque m y the construction of the wing force sensor is shown in fig 5 b 3 2 calibration of the wing force sensor there exist dimension couplings between the three orthogonal dimensions of the wing force sensors due to matching errors a static calibration device is designed to measure the dimensional coupling effects for the sensors whereby the 3d loads of f z f x and m y can be added to the wing shaft individually or collectively the full calibration process is composed of forward and reverse step up and step down loading processes at equal intervals fig 6 shows the static calibration results for the left front wing sensor with solo dimensional loads the c in the subscript indicates calibration and m indicates measurement the prime in the superscript indicates the force divided by the full scale of the relevant measurement ranges the test and calibration results match well in the loading direction with a maximum error less than 0 3 f s however there exist dimensional coupling errors the calibration of the resistance induces a maximum coupling error of 6 f s in the lift and 3 4 f s in the torque the calibration of the lift induces a maximum coupling error of 11 5 f s in the resistance and 0 44 f s in the torque the calibration of the torque induces a maximum coupling error of 2 2 f s in the resistance and 2 1 f s in the lift the coupling effect of the torque on the resistance and lift shows nonlinear characteristics as shown in fig 6 c it is necessary to decouple the measured 3d forces before analyzing the results otherwise the stress measured by the force sensors will not reflect the true forces on the wings 3 3 decoupling of the wing force sensor the radial basis function rbf neural network is introduced to establish the nonlinear relationship between the measurement and the forces for the sensors the rbf neural network adopted has a three layer feedforward architecture the first layer is the calibration load input the second layer is the hidden layer which maps the input based on the gaussian variance and euclidean norms as expressed in equation mou et al 2020 the third layer is the output layer that counts the weights as expressed in equation zhao et al 2020 where x p c i represents the euclidean norms x p x 1 p x 2 p x m p is the p th input signal c i is the center of a node in the hidden layer w i j represents the weights of the i th node in the hidden layer and j th node in the output σ is the gaussian variance and d j is the expectation of the j th output 1 r x p c i exp 1 2 σ 2 x p c i 2 i 1 2 m 2 y j i 1 h w i j exp 1 2 σ 2 x p c i 2 j 1 2 n 3 σ 1 p j m d j y j c i 2 some of the calibration results are used as the training samples and the remaining are used as testing data fig 7 shows the decoupling training results of the left front wing force sensor where the x axis represents the spread number and the y axis represents the calibration error of the dimensionless forces the calibration error tends to be stable when the spread number is above eight 4 free running test the free running tests were separated into three steps semi submerged to surface state transition semi submerged to underwater state transition and continuous state transition the tests were intended to verify the feasibility of the multi state transition and determine the kinetic and dynamic characteristics of the state transition maneuvering providing useful references for the further development of the autonomous control system and hull design optimization a series of tests were carried out in a lake before finding appropriate control parameters that allow smooth state transition the reproducibility of the state transition tests listed in table 2 have been proven by repeatability tests 4 1 semi submerged to surface planning state transition according to the original design the smv can sail on surfaces without wings in the semi submerged to surface state transition state huo and dong 2016 clarified the mechanism of the state transition in terms of the discharge of the ballast water however the wings on the self propelled model is not designed to be foldable due to the limited space of the model size it means that the smv needs to perform the semi submerged to surface state transition with the wings stretched out in the state transition process the vehicle should always be kept trim by the stern during this transition as the front wings can generate upward lift that may help to reduce the weight and the back wings can provide after trimming moment that may help to pull the water out of the ballast tank a series of experiments with different wing angles combination were conducted to find whether the wings will help to facilitate the state transition the accomplishment of the state transition can be estimated by the water level in the ballast tank as shown in fig 8 if the water pressure sensors 2 returns to zero it means that the water in the ballast tank is entirely pulled out and the transition is accomplished it turns out that the state transition is accomplished under all the tested wing angles the wing angles will not change the state transition tendency in general but they have influences on the kinematic performance and hydrodynamic characteristics the state transition can mainly be separated into four stages according to the kinematic and hydrodynamic parameters measured typically shown in fig 9 with back wing angle δ b set to 6 and the front wing angle δ f set to 9 the shaft power per displacement is p s δ the volume froude number is defined as f u g uw 1 3 where u is the speed of the vehicle and uw is the volume of the smv underwater the relative height of the water level h i to the total height in the ballast h i is h i h i the trim angle of the vehicle is θ and a positive trim angle indicates trim by the stern the measured hydrodynamic forces f x f z m y are deprived of the hydrostatic forces as the force sensors are reset to zeros when the vehicle is at rest in calm water the hydrodynamic forces are non dimensionalized by 0 5 ρ u uw 2 l oa 2 whereas the torques are non dimensionalized by 0 5 ρ u sub 2 l oa 3 according to the right hand rule positive f x f z m y respectively indicate the thrust forward parallel to the wing chord line the lift upward vertical to the wing chord line and the anticlockwise moment around the wing shaft the continuous change of the kinetic and hydrodynamic parameters recorded are shown in fig 9 as the vehicle s engine rotational speed vehicle increases at a constant speed the first stage starts from t 0 to t t 1 the froude number f increases with the time while there is no obvious change in the shaft power and the trim angle the drop of water level in the ballast tank can be noticed the second stage ranges from t t 1 to t t 2 distinguished by an obvious raise of trim angle and drop of water level at the tank center from t t 1 it can be inferred that the trim angle is closely related with the water in the tank during this stage as the backward movement of the water in the ballast tank will cause trim moment that contributes to the trim angle the hydrodynamic forces of the wings rise significantly during this stage although f x is positive the component of f z in the advancing direction is larger which means that the front wing is subjected to resistance and upward lift in total the third stage from t t 2 to t t 3 is distinguished by the water level at the ballast tank end when h i h i drops to zero at t t 3 which indicates the accomplishment of state transition it can be seen that f increases continuously but there is little change in the trim angle θ the critical condition corresponding to the state transition is around f 1 0 which is the same as the results of the transition without wings obtained by huo and dong 2016 the hydrodynamic forces on the back wings change continuously while that of the front wings encounter an abrupt drop during this stage the direction of the front wing change from lift upward to lift downward it is caused by the fact that the front wing is raised out of the water surface the vehicle is elevated by the hydrodynamic forces on the planning hull bottom in high speed whereas the direction of the torque remain unchanged as the sign of m y is positive it means that the action point of the resultant force on the front wing moves from the side of the leading edge to the side of the trailing edge as shown in fig 10 then all the kinetic and hydrodynamic parameters come to a new stable equilibrium when t exceed t 3 during the whole transition process both the front and back wings endure an increment in the clockwise torque about the wing axis m y which indicates that the location of wing shaft axis can be further optimized to reduce the torque 4 2 semi submerged to underwater state transition the transition between the semi submerged and the underwater states should be completed within a depth of 1 5 m near the surface given the limited length of the wifi antenna as shown in fig 2 which provides continuous status monitoring for safety considerations the target depth is close to the surface in a region that will result in a non negligible lift upward on the vehicle generated by flow suction as the influence of the venturi effect which adds to the difficulty of diving and depth keeping as the front wings locate near the gravity center of the vehicle the hydrodynamic forces on the front wings will generate little trim moment the back wings are smaller than the front wings but they provide a much larger arm of forces relative to the center of gravity small deflection of the back wings will generate large enough trim moment for attitude adjustment thus the front wings are used to control depth and the back wings are used to control trim angle experiments were carried out using a scripted control program with constant engine rotational speed given target depth and control threshold values for the wings as shown in table 3 the semi submerged to underwater state transition is mainly divided into diving stage and depth keeping stage the diving stage starts from the time when the wings maneuver in diving to the time when the vehicle firstly reaches the target depth threshold for diving in the diving stage both the front and back wings are set to maximum angle of 25 to accelerate the diving process the depth keeping process is terminated when the vehicle cross both the diving and rising depth threshold three times or the executive time of the control program is finished then the vehicle is controlled manually and rise to the surface in the depth keeping stage the front wings will rotate to provide lift downward if the depth is less than the diving threshold value and provide lift upward if the depth exceed the rising threshold value the back wings will generate forward trimming moment if the trim angle is larger than the diving threshold and generate after trimming moment if the trim angle is smaller than the rising threshold the rotation speed of the back wings will change to 8 s during the depth keeping and rising stages whereas that of the front wings are maintained at 8 s during the entire transition process 4 f z r e s f f z f b z f z f cos θ δ f f z b cos θ δ b f x f sin θ δ f f x b cos θ δ b the presentation of the experiment results follow the right hand rule including the depth h the trim angle θ the rotation angle of the wing angles δ the resistant force f x paralleled to the wing chord line the lift force f z vertical to the wing chord line the moment of rotation m y around the wing shaft the direction of the wing forces in body coordinates are demonstrated in fig 12 a while the components of wing forces in geodetic coordinates are shown in fig 12 b the resultant forces f z r e s in f z curves shown in fig 11 are calculated by equation peng et al 2017 in which f x f f z f f x b f x b are the components of wing forces in the body coordinates while f f x f f z f b x f b z are the components of wing forces in the geodetic coordinates sub2 differs from sub1 in that it has a higher engine rotational speed stronger propulsive force and a larger depth threshold for the front wings control in terms of the diving stage although the diving depth threshold value of sub1 is lower than that of sub2 the diving time t dive marked in the δ curve of fig 11 of sub2 is much shorter than that of sub1 it reflects the fact that increase in engine rotational speed help to accelerate the diving process according to the measured hydrodynamic forces of the wings f z curve of fig 11 the resultant forces f z r e s of boththe front and back wings are almost positive in the diving process which means that the direction of the lift generated by the wings is upward which is contrary to the diving direction thus it can be inferred that the main diving forces are not provided by the wings they come from the hull body in forward trim attitude moreover increase in the back wing diving rotational speed will not help to prompt the diving process because the t dive of sub3 is not shorter than that of sub2 while sub3 has a shallower desired depth this is probably because the back wings will partially cancel out the diving force generated by the front wings a lower rotational rate of the back wings will extend the action time of the net downward lift provided by the wings thus accelerating the diving process besides rapid rotation rate also has influence on the wing efficiency due to the fluid memory effects sub3 differs from sub2 in that it has a wider trim angle threshold range and larger rotational speed of the back wings in diving process in terms of the depth keeping stage both sub2 and sub1 exhibit a satisfactory state transition the vehicle manages to remain underwater during the entire process while sub3 fails in depth keeping as the h curve crosses the surface level frequently the front wings in sub1 and sub2 hardly rotate during the entire process until the end while that of sub3 maneuvers more frequently the trim angle θ of both sub1 and sub2 are well controlled within 8 whereas that of sub3 shows sharp peaks exceeding 12 during the rising movement in the θ curve it can be concluded that the threshold value for the trim angle control is vital to depth keeping there exists a compromise between the diving speed and depth keeping maneuverability according to the f x in fig 11 the influence of the trim angle θ on f x of the front wing is relatively small in lower speed especially when the variation of θ is within 5 as shown in the case of sub1 however it becomes evident that f x changes in pace with θ at higher advancing speeds such as the cases of sub2 and sub3 the amplitude of f z on the front and back wings almost cancel each other out which is apparently insufficient for the diving and surfacing motions considering the 1 5 ton weight of the entire model thus it can be inferred that the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull also play an important role in the depth keeping process 4 3 continuous state transition the continuous state transition represents a combination of the semi submerged to surface and semi submerged to underwater state transitions in one continuous test the continuous state transition test was conducted using a program control method and the control threshold values were the same as those in sub2 as listed in table 2 except that the depth threshold value of diving and rising is changed to 0 75 m a typical continuous state transition can be divided into two state transition stages in sequence as shown in fig 13 considering the restricted waters of the lake the engine rotational speed in the initial diving conditions of stage 1 is increased to 1600 rpm to accelerate the diving process which is different from the initial value of 1400 rpm in section 4 2 the diving interval is reduced from 40 s to 25 s as indicated by the rotation angle curve of the front wings the trim angle of the vehicle varies between 6 and 8 during the depth keeping process in stage 1 diving with a negative trim angle bow down and rising with a positive trim angle bow up as the self propelled model cannot receive gps signals underwater the semi submerged to surface state transition procedure will not be triggered until stage 1 is finished and the gps signal restores stability as the vehicle rise to the surface two speed thresholds are set in stage 2 the front and back wings are fixed at 2 and 0 5 respectively which will generate a smallest resistance at high speed surface planning state similar characteristics of the wing forces are found in fig 13 b compared with the two transition process stated above as shown in fig 14 the variation of hydrodynamic forces of the wings are not simultaneous with the rotation angle of the wings there exist phase differences between the wing angles and wing forces during the underwater state it seems that the trim angle of the vehicle has obvious nonlinear influence on the hydrodynamic forces of the front wings comparing the δ and f z in fig 13 all these factors add to the complexity in the control of the wings conventional control methods based on linear hydrodynamic models can hardly be applied to this type of motion control considering the complicated kinematic and dynamic properties the abrupt increase in the wing forces can still be found in the surface planning state even the wing angles are well chosen nevertheless the amplitudes of the forces have been dramatically reduced owing to the smaller wing angles 5 conclusion this paper presents free running tests on a self propelled model of submersible multi state vehicle smv in order to verify the feasibility of multi state transition factors including the nonlinearity of motion nonlinear hydrodynamic forces and the residual buoyancy adds to the difficulty of state transition the accomplishment of state transition is controlled by the wings and advancing speed measurement of the hydrodynamic forces on the wings help to better understand the mechanism of the multi state transition process according to the test results the semi submersible to surface state transition is achieved when the ship speed exceed the critical condition of f 1 0 the wings will generate upward lift and after trimming moment in the first stages while increase resistance a lot later which suggests the wings should be folded in surface planning state in the semi submerged to underwater state transition the hull itself is the main source for hydrodynamic force generation rather than the wings the wings mainly help to facilitate and maintain the hydrodynamic forces generated by the hull within a controllable range separate control of the wings in terms of the depth and trim angle is a feasible method for achieving continuous depth keeping underwater and the threshold values of target depth and trim angle for the wings are critical for realizing a smooth state transition a balance should be achieved between the depth keeping and attitude adjustment considering the hydrodynamic characteristics of the unique hull design in the further improvements will be made to the design of the hull and wings by improving the hydrodynamic performance considering the applications such as bathymetric surveys communication relays oceanic scientific explorations and

20432,a submersible multi state vehicle smv has been designed as an unmanned surface vehicle with global deployment capability it can switch between several states including underwater semi submerged and surface states free running tests on the self propelled model are performed to validate the multi state transition principle of the smv with kinematic and hydrodynamic parameters recorded during the tests three dimensional force sensors are designed to measure the wing forces which provide insights into the mechanism of the state transition process a series of tests conducted using program control methods verify the feasibility of the multi state sailing and continuous state transition of the smv appropriate threshold values for the wings to control depth and trim angle of the vehicle are determined through case studies on the dynamic performance the wing forces measured show extraordinarily different characteristics and functions in different states which provides useful information for further improvements to the design keywords unmanned surface vehicle usv multi state self propelled model free running test wing force sensors 1 introduction unmanned surface vehicles usvs have gradually shown their potential capabilities in scientific research and military applications many advanced marine usv have been proposed achieving significant progress in terms of the path optimization intelligent control dynamics modeling and special operations mou et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 faramin et al 2019 peng et al 2020 with the development of joint unmanned maritime systems the global deployment capability has gradually become one of the key considerations in the usv design which means that a usv should be able to endure any rough sea conditions it encounters traditional methods to improve seakeeping level of the ship mainly focus on designing advanced hull forms such as swath multi hull hydrofoils and stabilization system however usvs that carried by the mother ship are typically no more than 10 tons due to the limitation of launching and retrieval system scott et al 2013 thus the seakeeping capability of the hull is significantly restricted by the limited main dimensions of the hull the usv will go with the tide sometimes even swallowed or turned over in high sea states as the wave size is much larger than the hull size hybrid unmanned platform that combines usvs and uuvs enhances the seakeeping capability along with long endurance and continuous communication greatly liu et al 2018 developed a wave driven unmanned surface vehicle wusv which has advantages of a long operating period for long voyages the wusv is composed of a surface float and an underwater tandem foil propulsor tfp connected by an umbilical cable numerical simulations and experiments were performed to estimate its efficiency for utilizing wave energy jin et al 2020 also proposed a hybrid surface and underwater vehicle hsuv which demonstrated its unmanned underwater exploration capabilities in sea trials however there is still sea state limitation to the service of the hybrid unmanned platform another way to improve the seakeeping level of ship board usvs is designing the capability of diving to sufficient depths underwater instead of swaying in the wind and waves ueno 2010 studied the feasibility of using wings to generate downward lift for a submersible surface ship sss the hydrodynamic characteristics of the sss in the vertical and lateral motions were clarified and a simulation was also conducted based on the estimated hydrodynamic derivatives ueno et al 2011 zheng and dong 2012 performed numerical simulation and experiments on the resistance performance of a submersible multi state vehicle smv that can transition between different states according to the conceptual design the smv can sail on surfaces at high speeds surface planning state cruise stealthily in moderate sea conditions semi submerged state dive and move underwater when encountering rough seas fully submerged state huo and dong 2014 2016 conducted numerical investigation on the feasibility of diving and surfacing state transition the critical conditions for surface to underwater state transition are determined theoretically the transition process is greatly influenced by the motion parameters including velocity attitude and the depth chen et al 2019 developed an unmanned semi submersible as a long term rugged and high endurance vessel for the collection of long term continuous and real time marine meteorological measurements including atmospheric sounding in the lower troposphere sergio et al 2019 analyzed the submarine take off and subsequent submarine flight of an unmanned vehicle with two operational modes on sea surface as a catamaran usv and submarine mode as a winged uuv experiments showed that lift generated by the wings is enough to submerge the vehicle at the predicted speeds and an amplifying effect of the lift of the vehicle is verified when sailing on the surface this paper focus on the verification of the feasibility of a submersible multi state vehicle based on ship model experiments the smv can be seen as a combination of planning boat semi submersible and submersible functionally which means that the vehicle need to accommodate with high speed surface planning state medium speed semi submerged state and low speed submerged state respectively the smv is different from conventional planning boat as it is equipped with ballast tanks on both sides the water in the ballast tank will pull out as the vehicle speeds up reducing the total weight of the vehicle in return thus the vehicle will gradually become lighter in the semi submerged to surface planning state transition process which makes the state transition a mass variable process the smv also differs from traditional cylindrical submersible as it has a planning hull bottom and tumblehome hull sides which makes the hull asymmetric in vertical plane apart from the unique hull design the near surface effect the interference between the wings and hull and the control methods all add to the complexity of the multi state transition process these factors make it difficult to conduct accurate numerical simulation or computational fluid dynamics simulation therefore an experimental validation will help to confirm the practicality of the novel hull design before further investigation into technical details essentially the nonlinearity of motion is determined by the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull the wings are the key to the state transition as they will alter the motion tendency given constant propulsion input the wings affect the state transition through the hydrodynamic forces acting on the wings thus measurement of the wing forces will help to better understand the mechanism of the multi state transition process in this paper a 5 6 m long self propelled model is built as a prototype of smv well designed three dimensional force sensors are equipped on the wings shafts to measure the hydrodynamic forces of the wings during the state transition free running tests of the self propelled model are then conducted to find possible ways to realize multi state sailing 2 configuration of a submersible multi state vehicle smv 2 1 main hull design fig 1 shows the 3d design of an smv featuring a tumblehome and a wave piercing head to improve the seakeeping and resistance performance in moderate sea conditions a deep v hull bottom with a varying deadrise angle is adopted to generate a strong hydrodynamic lift at high speed a triangle like cross section ballast tank with open ends is used to provide the main hydrostatic diving forces the tank is placed along the side of the vehicle to fully utilize the inner space the left and right parts of the ballast tank are connected and are largely filled with water in the semi submerged state so that most parts of the vehicle are underwater leaving only a very small radar reflection area above the water the ballast water will run out automatically under the effects of gravity and inertia force when the smv enters the high speed surface planning state two pairs of asymmetric wings naca4412 are fixed amidships and astern to provide the control forces required to achieve state transition and underwater sailing the wings are folded in the semi submerged and surface planning states but stretched out in the underwater state two waterjets are implemented symmetrically on the transom stern 2 2 self propelled model table 1 lists the main characteristic parameters of the smv where δ hull represents the displacement of the hull and the ballast water under a loading condition when most part of the hull is beneath the waterline whereas δ uw is the displacement of the entire hull underwater while the smv has a positive buoyancy the ballast provides hydrostatic loads that take approximately 70 of the total diving forces required for underwater sailing the remaining 30 come from the hydrodynamic components by the wings the hydrodynamic characteristic is vital to the state transition a self propelled model is built to verify the principle of the multi state transition of the smv particularly the feasibility of the mass variable ballast tank combined with the wings the self propelled model of the smv built has 1 5 tons δ uw equipped with fundamental sensors for multi state transition and motion measurements a slight modification was made to the deck including the addition of two gps watertight covers and a wireless antenna as shown in fig 2 the wings are originally designed to be foldable in the full scale vehicle but made into detachable modular in the self propelled model in the tests the model needs to sail with the wings stretched out in the continuous multi state transition process which is disadvantageous for high speed surface planning 2 3 measurement system for kinematic and mechanical parameters the kinematic measurement system is composed of an onboard unit and a continental base as shown in fig 3 the internal connections of the sensors are shown in fig 4 instructions are sent from the upper industrial personal computer ipc of the continental base to the lower ipc onboard either through manual operation or through a program controller a differential antenna da is used to improve the precision of the trajectory measured by the gps the measurement system onboard can collect the real time kinematics and mechanical parameters of the vehicle in the surface planning and semi submerged states the translational location and velocity are provided by the gps antenna whereas the trim and heel angles are obtained from a bi axis tilt angle sensor the heading angle is calculated based on data obtained from both the gps antenna and fiber optic gyroscope two pressure sensors are mounted on the ballast tank to detect the water level in the ballast tank in the underwater state the horizontal motion data are unavailable due to the loss of gps signals nevertheless the rotational motion can be acquired including the trim heel and head angles the depth can be obtained from the pressure sensors mounted on the ballast tank four stepping motors are used to control the wings with the time varying rotation angle recorded and two additional stepping motors are used to control the direction of waterjets the rotation angles of the four wings and two waterjets are also recorded four wing force sensors are mounted respectively on the wing shafts to measure the resistance lift and torque in the wing fixed coordinates a detailed description of the force sensors is given in section 3 the torques acting on the propulsion shafts are measured using dynamic torque sensors which provide inputs for estimating the shaft power all the measured data are collected and transferred to the continental base through a wifi network 3 characteristics of wing force sensors 3 1 three dimensional wing force sensor the wings are the key active control units designed to achieve the multi state transition the hydrodynamic forces including the resistance lift and torque acting on the wings are collected by the force sensors mounted directly on the wing shafts as shown in fig 5 a providing important references for the diving and surfacing maneuvering design moreover the hydrodynamic characteristics reflected by the force sensors give new insights into the mechanism of the multi state motion the three dimensional 3d wing force sensor is a strain gauge sensor with an accuracy of 0 1 f s full scale and a maximum range of 750 n in terms of the lift f z 250 n in terms of the resistance f x and 50 n m in terms of the torque m y the construction of the wing force sensor is shown in fig 5 b 3 2 calibration of the wing force sensor there exist dimension couplings between the three orthogonal dimensions of the wing force sensors due to matching errors a static calibration device is designed to measure the dimensional coupling effects for the sensors whereby the 3d loads of f z f x and m y can be added to the wing shaft individually or collectively the full calibration process is composed of forward and reverse step up and step down loading processes at equal intervals fig 6 shows the static calibration results for the left front wing sensor with solo dimensional loads the c in the subscript indicates calibration and m indicates measurement the prime in the superscript indicates the force divided by the full scale of the relevant measurement ranges the test and calibration results match well in the loading direction with a maximum error less than 0 3 f s however there exist dimensional coupling errors the calibration of the resistance induces a maximum coupling error of 6 f s in the lift and 3 4 f s in the torque the calibration of the lift induces a maximum coupling error of 11 5 f s in the resistance and 0 44 f s in the torque the calibration of the torque induces a maximum coupling error of 2 2 f s in the resistance and 2 1 f s in the lift the coupling effect of the torque on the resistance and lift shows nonlinear characteristics as shown in fig 6 c it is necessary to decouple the measured 3d forces before analyzing the results otherwise the stress measured by the force sensors will not reflect the true forces on the wings 3 3 decoupling of the wing force sensor the radial basis function rbf neural network is introduced to establish the nonlinear relationship between the measurement and the forces for the sensors the rbf neural network adopted has a three layer feedforward architecture the first layer is the calibration load input the second layer is the hidden layer which maps the input based on the gaussian variance and euclidean norms as expressed in equation mou et al 2020 the third layer is the output layer that counts the weights as expressed in equation zhao et al 2020 where x p c i represents the euclidean norms x p x 1 p x 2 p x m p is the p th input signal c i is the center of a node in the hidden layer w i j represents the weights of the i th node in the hidden layer and j th node in the output σ is the gaussian variance and d j is the expectation of the j th output 1 r x p c i exp 1 2 σ 2 x p c i 2 i 1 2 m 2 y j i 1 h w i j exp 1 2 σ 2 x p c i 2 j 1 2 n 3 σ 1 p j m d j y j c i 2 some of the calibration results are used as the training samples and the remaining are used as testing data fig 7 shows the decoupling training results of the left front wing force sensor where the x axis represents the spread number and the y axis represents the calibration error of the dimensionless forces the calibration error tends to be stable when the spread number is above eight 4 free running test the free running tests were separated into three steps semi submerged to surface state transition semi submerged to underwater state transition and continuous state transition the tests were intended to verify the feasibility of the multi state transition and determine the kinetic and dynamic characteristics of the state transition maneuvering providing useful references for the further development of the autonomous control system and hull design optimization a series of tests were carried out in a lake before finding appropriate control parameters that allow smooth state transition the reproducibility of the state transition tests listed in table 2 have been proven by repeatability tests 4 1 semi submerged to surface planning state transition according to the original design the smv can sail on surfaces without wings in the semi submerged to surface state transition state huo and dong 2016 clarified the mechanism of the state transition in terms of the discharge of the ballast water however the wings on the self propelled model is not designed to be foldable due to the limited space of the model size it means that the smv needs to perform the semi submerged to surface state transition with the wings stretched out in the state transition process the vehicle should always be kept trim by the stern during this transition as the front wings can generate upward lift that may help to reduce the weight and the back wings can provide after trimming moment that may help to pull the water out of the ballast tank a series of experiments with different wing angles combination were conducted to find whether the wings will help to facilitate the state transition the accomplishment of the state transition can be estimated by the water level in the ballast tank as shown in fig 8 if the water pressure sensors 2 returns to zero it means that the water in the ballast tank is entirely pulled out and the transition is accomplished it turns out that the state transition is accomplished under all the tested wing angles the wing angles will not change the state transition tendency in general but they have influences on the kinematic performance and hydrodynamic characteristics the state transition can mainly be separated into four stages according to the kinematic and hydrodynamic parameters measured typically shown in fig 9 with back wing angle δ b set to 6 and the front wing angle δ f set to 9 the shaft power per displacement is p s δ the volume froude number is defined as f u g uw 1 3 where u is the speed of the vehicle and uw is the volume of the smv underwater the relative height of the water level h i to the total height in the ballast h i is h i h i the trim angle of the vehicle is θ and a positive trim angle indicates trim by the stern the measured hydrodynamic forces f x f z m y are deprived of the hydrostatic forces as the force sensors are reset to zeros when the vehicle is at rest in calm water the hydrodynamic forces are non dimensionalized by 0 5 ρ u uw 2 l oa 2 whereas the torques are non dimensionalized by 0 5 ρ u sub 2 l oa 3 according to the right hand rule positive f x f z m y respectively indicate the thrust forward parallel to the wing chord line the lift upward vertical to the wing chord line and the anticlockwise moment around the wing shaft the continuous change of the kinetic and hydrodynamic parameters recorded are shown in fig 9 as the vehicle s engine rotational speed vehicle increases at a constant speed the first stage starts from t 0 to t t 1 the froude number f increases with the time while there is no obvious change in the shaft power and the trim angle the drop of water level in the ballast tank can be noticed the second stage ranges from t t 1 to t t 2 distinguished by an obvious raise of trim angle and drop of water level at the tank center from t t 1 it can be inferred that the trim angle is closely related with the water in the tank during this stage as the backward movement of the water in the ballast tank will cause trim moment that contributes to the trim angle the hydrodynamic forces of the wings rise significantly during this stage although f x is positive the component of f z in the advancing direction is larger which means that the front wing is subjected to resistance and upward lift in total the third stage from t t 2 to t t 3 is distinguished by the water level at the ballast tank end when h i h i drops to zero at t t 3 which indicates the accomplishment of state transition it can be seen that f increases continuously but there is little change in the trim angle θ the critical condition corresponding to the state transition is around f 1 0 which is the same as the results of the transition without wings obtained by huo and dong 2016 the hydrodynamic forces on the back wings change continuously while that of the front wings encounter an abrupt drop during this stage the direction of the front wing change from lift upward to lift downward it is caused by the fact that the front wing is raised out of the water surface the vehicle is elevated by the hydrodynamic forces on the planning hull bottom in high speed whereas the direction of the torque remain unchanged as the sign of m y is positive it means that the action point of the resultant force on the front wing moves from the side of the leading edge to the side of the trailing edge as shown in fig 10 then all the kinetic and hydrodynamic parameters come to a new stable equilibrium when t exceed t 3 during the whole transition process both the front and back wings endure an increment in the clockwise torque about the wing axis m y which indicates that the location of wing shaft axis can be further optimized to reduce the torque 4 2 semi submerged to underwater state transition the transition between the semi submerged and the underwater states should be completed within a depth of 1 5 m near the surface given the limited length of the wifi antenna as shown in fig 2 which provides continuous status monitoring for safety considerations the target depth is close to the surface in a region that will result in a non negligible lift upward on the vehicle generated by flow suction as the influence of the venturi effect which adds to the difficulty of diving and depth keeping as the front wings locate near the gravity center of the vehicle the hydrodynamic forces on the front wings will generate little trim moment the back wings are smaller than the front wings but they provide a much larger arm of forces relative to the center of gravity small deflection of the back wings will generate large enough trim moment for attitude adjustment thus the front wings are used to control depth and the back wings are used to control trim angle experiments were carried out using a scripted control program with constant engine rotational speed given target depth and control threshold values for the wings as shown in table 3 the semi submerged to underwater state transition is mainly divided into diving stage and depth keeping stage the diving stage starts from the time when the wings maneuver in diving to the time when the vehicle firstly reaches the target depth threshold for diving in the diving stage both the front and back wings are set to maximum angle of 25 to accelerate the diving process the depth keeping process is terminated when the vehicle cross both the diving and rising depth threshold three times or the executive time of the control program is finished then the vehicle is controlled manually and rise to the surface in the depth keeping stage the front wings will rotate to provide lift downward if the depth is less than the diving threshold value and provide lift upward if the depth exceed the rising threshold value the back wings will generate forward trimming moment if the trim angle is larger than the diving threshold and generate after trimming moment if the trim angle is smaller than the rising threshold the rotation speed of the back wings will change to 8 s during the depth keeping and rising stages whereas that of the front wings are maintained at 8 s during the entire transition process 4 f z r e s f f z f b z f z f cos θ δ f f z b cos θ δ b f x f sin θ δ f f x b cos θ δ b the presentation of the experiment results follow the right hand rule including the depth h the trim angle θ the rotation angle of the wing angles δ the resistant force f x paralleled to the wing chord line the lift force f z vertical to the wing chord line the moment of rotation m y around the wing shaft the direction of the wing forces in body coordinates are demonstrated in fig 12 a while the components of wing forces in geodetic coordinates are shown in fig 12 b the resultant forces f z r e s in f z curves shown in fig 11 are calculated by equation peng et al 2017 in which f x f f z f f x b f x b are the components of wing forces in the body coordinates while f f x f f z f b x f b z are the components of wing forces in the geodetic coordinates sub2 differs from sub1 in that it has a higher engine rotational speed stronger propulsive force and a larger depth threshold for the front wings control in terms of the diving stage although the diving depth threshold value of sub1 is lower than that of sub2 the diving time t dive marked in the δ curve of fig 11 of sub2 is much shorter than that of sub1 it reflects the fact that increase in engine rotational speed help to accelerate the diving process according to the measured hydrodynamic forces of the wings f z curve of fig 11 the resultant forces f z r e s of boththe front and back wings are almost positive in the diving process which means that the direction of the lift generated by the wings is upward which is contrary to the diving direction thus it can be inferred that the main diving forces are not provided by the wings they come from the hull body in forward trim attitude moreover increase in the back wing diving rotational speed will not help to prompt the diving process because the t dive of sub3 is not shorter than that of sub2 while sub3 has a shallower desired depth this is probably because the back wings will partially cancel out the diving force generated by the front wings a lower rotational rate of the back wings will extend the action time of the net downward lift provided by the wings thus accelerating the diving process besides rapid rotation rate also has influence on the wing efficiency due to the fluid memory effects sub3 differs from sub2 in that it has a wider trim angle threshold range and larger rotational speed of the back wings in diving process in terms of the depth keeping stage both sub2 and sub1 exhibit a satisfactory state transition the vehicle manages to remain underwater during the entire process while sub3 fails in depth keeping as the h curve crosses the surface level frequently the front wings in sub1 and sub2 hardly rotate during the entire process until the end while that of sub3 maneuvers more frequently the trim angle θ of both sub1 and sub2 are well controlled within 8 whereas that of sub3 shows sharp peaks exceeding 12 during the rising movement in the θ curve it can be concluded that the threshold value for the trim angle control is vital to depth keeping there exists a compromise between the diving speed and depth keeping maneuverability according to the f x in fig 11 the influence of the trim angle θ on f x of the front wing is relatively small in lower speed especially when the variation of θ is within 5 as shown in the case of sub1 however it becomes evident that f x changes in pace with θ at higher advancing speeds such as the cases of sub2 and sub3 the amplitude of f z on the front and back wings almost cancel each other out which is apparently insufficient for the diving and surfacing motions considering the 1 5 ton weight of the entire model thus it can be inferred that the hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull also play an important role in the depth keeping process 4 3 continuous state transition the continuous state transition represents a combination of the semi submerged to surface and semi submerged to underwater state transitions in one continuous test the continuous state transition test was conducted using a program control method and the control threshold values were the same as those in sub2 as listed in table 2 except that the depth threshold value of diving and rising is changed to 0 75 m a typical continuous state transition can be divided into two state transition stages in sequence as shown in fig 13 considering the restricted waters of the lake the engine rotational speed in the initial diving conditions of stage 1 is increased to 1600 rpm to accelerate the diving process which is different from the initial value of 1400 rpm in section 4 2 the diving interval is reduced from 40 s to 25 s as indicated by the rotation angle curve of the front wings the trim angle of the vehicle varies between 6 and 8 during the depth keeping process in stage 1 diving with a negative trim angle bow down and rising with a positive trim angle bow up as the self propelled model cannot receive gps signals underwater the semi submerged to surface state transition procedure will not be triggered until stage 1 is finished and the gps signal restores stability as the vehicle rise to the surface two speed thresholds are set in stage 2 the front and back wings are fixed at 2 and 0 5 respectively which will generate a smallest resistance at high speed surface planning state similar characteristics of the wing forces are found in fig 13 b compared with the two transition process stated above as shown in fig 14 the variation of hydrodynamic forces of the wings are not simultaneous with the rotation angle of the wings there exist phase differences between the wing angles and wing forces during the underwater state it seems that the trim angle of the vehicle has obvious nonlinear influence on the hydrodynamic forces of the front wings comparing the δ and f z in fig 13 all these factors add to the complexity in the control of the wings conventional control methods based on linear hydrodynamic models can hardly be applied to this type of motion control considering the complicated kinematic and dynamic properties the abrupt increase in the wing forces can still be found in the surface planning state even the wing angles are well chosen nevertheless the amplitudes of the forces have been dramatically reduced owing to the smaller wing angles 5 conclusion this paper presents free running tests on a self propelled model of submersible multi state vehicle smv in order to verify the feasibility of multi state transition factors including the nonlinearity of motion nonlinear hydrodynamic forces and the residual buoyancy adds to the difficulty of state transition the accomplishment of state transition is controlled by the wings and advancing speed measurement of the hydrodynamic forces on the wings help to better understand the mechanism of the multi state transition process according to the test results the semi submersible to surface state

20433,based on the potential flow theory a second order higher order boundary element method model is developed to simulate hydrodynamic loads and pressure on a stationary cylindrical type oscillating water column owc wave energy converter quadratic pneumatic damping and additional viscous damping are introduced to simulate the effects of the power take off and the viscous dissipation inside the chamber respectively the proposed model is verified against a carefully instrumented scaled experiment the effects of the chamber geometry and the wave environment on the hydrodynamic loads of the owc device are then explored using the validated model the resonance excited by the second order wave component is observed with the fundamental frequency being half of the natural frequency this resembles a sloshing mode and leads to a significant increase in hydrodynamic pressure and surge force as well as pitch moment the effects of the second order waves cannot be ignored under the action of the low frequency long waves in addition the surge force and the pitch moment are not sensitive to the variation in the orifice opening ratios while the heave force increases with the opening ratio at a resonant heave frequency keywords resonant wave loads nonlinear wave model testing hobem 1 introduction many coastal and offshore structures are subject to harsh wave conditions including a large range of wave energy converters wecs whose development to capture renewable energy from the ocean has recently been booming cheng et al 2020 such as oscillating buoy zhao et al 2021 and oscillating water column owc wecs zheng et al 2020 wave loads in either operational or harsh sea conditions are a major consideration in the design and construction of these devices their structural lifetimes can be shortened by accumulated fatigue damage and or large deformations induced by nonlinear waves thus an accurate prediction of nonlinear wave loads on offshore wecs is important for their commercialization and application particularly with respect to floating type devices benitz et al 2015 the nonlinear loads associated with the second order waves have drawn significant attention romolo and arena 2008 kim and yue 1989 solved the second order diffraction problem and calculated the values for the second order wave forces and pressure on a vertical cylinder and a truncated cone rainey 1989 extended morison s equation to calculate the wave loads on a lattice offshore structure with second order accuracy shao and faltinsen 2014 examined the springing excitation of monochromatic and bichromatic waves on a modified hull by solving a second order potential flow problem cong et al 2018 established a frequency domain model to discuss the second order hydrodynamic

investigations on the effects of wave dynamics on owc devices have also received extensive exploration in the literature konispoliatis et al 2016 presented an analytical model to evaluate the hydrodynamics of a three unit array on an owc platform including the first and mean second order wave forces due to the effects of the seiching resonance mode between the internal and external cylinders the horizontal force and moment reached the maximum pawitan et al 2019 conducted both experimental and numerical simulations to predict the effects of wave forces on an owc caisson under the influence of regular and irregular waves the maximum vertical force of the owc caisson occurs during the closing stages of the chamber orifice wang et al 2020 systemically investigated wave loads on a land fixed dual chamber owc device the locations of the largest surge force and bending moment were predicted by a fully nonlinear numerical model huang et al 2019 developed a 3d cfd model to study the effects of the wave environment on the wave loads of a pile type owc device they found that the wave loads were not sensitive to the wave period viviano et al 2018 carried out large scale wave tank testing to analyze the effects of the model scale on the hydrodynamics of an owc device the wave forces obtained in a small scale experiment agree well with those found for large scale owc devices if the small scale model is designed with a higher chamber elhanafi 2016 utilized a cfd model to predict wave loads on a stationary offshore owc device the peak heave force always occurs at the natural frequency of the owc device elhanafi et al 2017 further utilized experimental and numerical methods to discuss the effects of tank sidewalls on the wave loads of the owc device the effects of tank sidewalls can be ignored where the tank width is at least five times the width of the owc model the nonlinear wave loads are important but the contributions from each harmonic wave and their interactions with the device remain unclear another hydrodynamic problem is that of the water motion that takes place in the chamber of an owc device it is widely acknowledged that water motion may occur violently in the natural modes of the chamber within the piston where the water column that is captured inside the chamber heaves up and down more or less in the manner of a rigid body and the sloshing where the maximum water motion occurs back and forth between the vertical walls of a rectangular chamber modes zhou et al 2018 a similar phenomenon is observed for water motions inside the storage tanks of a container caron et al 2018 núñez aedo et al 2020 in moonpools guo et al 2017 and between the narrow gaps created by arranging two vessels in close vicinity lu et al 2020 tan et al 2019 all of these applications involve a liquid oil or water with a free surface and possess a certain level of similarity in an owc device these motions are usually associated with energy conversion efficiency for example piston type water motions are found to lead to the largest hydrodynamic efficiency zheng et al 2019b while the sloshing mode plays the opposite role zero efficiency may even occur in this condition the air volume flux captured inside the chamber the changing rate of which is directly associated with device efficiency barely changes in the sloshing modes xu and huang 2019 the relationship between the resonant water motion inside the chamber particularly the sloshing type motion and the wave loads on the device remains unclear and this forms the focus of this study it is worth mentioning that this relationship may be the main concern for a liquid storage tank but not for an owc and the underlying mechanisms associated with them may be rather different in the present study a 3d nonlinear time domain higher order boundary element method hobem model was applied to evaluate hydrodynamic loads and pressure on a stationary cylindrical type owc device the effects of the chamber geometry and the wave environment on hydrodynamic performance are considered the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the second order time domain hobem

finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical model based on the potential flow theory a second order hobem model was adopted to describe the wave dynamics on a 3d cylindrical owc

analysis for capturing full scale wave energy with periods between 5s and 10s a series of wave flume tests on an offshore owc device were carried out in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering at dalian university of technology china the experimental setup and the owc model at a 1 20 scale are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively a cartesian coordinate system is defined in fig 3 a the main geometric parameters of the owc device were selected as d 0 8 m b w 0 1 m and d 0 3 m the static water depth h was 1 0 m a circular orifice with a diameter of d o at position to 0 m 0 m 0 2 m was introduced to represent the pto damping ning et al 2016a four opening ratios ε ε s 0 s f where s 0 and s f are the cross sectional areas of the circular orifice and the circular chamber respectively were considered the details are summarized in table 1 the front and rear walls of the inner and outer chambers were labelled wif wof wib and wob twelve cy200 type pressure sensors s1 s12 were installed to measure the pressure distribution on the chamber walls their positions are presented in table 2 pressure sensors sa1 and sa2 were installed to measure the differential air pressure in the chamber as shown in the lower plot in fig 3 a and the average pressure reading of the two sensors is used to represent the air pressure in the chamber two lg1 type wave gauges g3 and g4 were situated inside the owc chamber to measure instantaneous free surface elevations another two wave gauges g1 and g2 were installed outside the chamber to measure the local wave field around the device the locations of these wave gauges are shown in table 2 to test the effects of wave condition twelve monochromatic waves that have a relative water depth in the range of 1 kh 3 33 were generated as shown in table 3 wave steepness ka was fixed to 0 05 ning et al 2020 with the wave amplitude a varying with the wave number k a constant water depth of 1 m was used in these tests 4 model validation experimental measurements were utilized to validate the hobem model details of the numerical scheme and setup can be found in section 2 it is noted that the air compressibility inside the owc chamber is negligible for small scale modelling so it is not represented in the following numerical simulations medina lopez et al 2016 a circular sponge layer fig 2 is set with the radii r 1 r 0 λ to absorb the reflected waves from the owc device fig 4 shows the meshing scheme used for the offshore owc device determined by convergence tests that are not presented here for brevity including the meshes for the body surface 192 elements and the free surface 492 elements after the convergent tests the time histories for the pressures at the 12 measurement points s1 s12 on the vertical walls are compared between the numerical and experimental results as shown in figs 5 and 6 for the cases with t 1 45 s i e kh 1 99 two opening ratios ε ε 2 0 in figs 5 and 3 0 in fig 6 are considered based on the trial and error procedure the following viscous and pneumatic damping coefficients are chosen μ 1 0 015 μ 2 1 450 for ε 2 0 and μ 1 0 03 μ 2 1 443 for ε 3 0 respectively satisfactory agreements are obtained for the two opening ratios the relative error analysis between the measured and predicted pressure amplitudes on the vertical walls are carried out overall the relative errors of these test points are less than 10 except for the case of s6 over 25 an apparent discrepancy is observed at the location of s6 i e the inner bottom corner of the chamber as shown in figs 5 b and fig 6 b this may be due to the fact that the strong vortex shedding is induced by the device corner and this cannot be captured by the potential flow theory in this study nevertheless the proposed hobem model is accurate for modelling the wave interaction with the owc device as the bulk wave and air dynamics rather than the local effects inside the chamber are of interest in this study 5 results and discussion in this section the validated numerical model is now extended to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the owc device in terms of the pressure and the total wave loads the effects of the opening ratio associated with the pto system for electricity generation and the chamber draft are explored 5 1 pressure distribution on the chamber wall in this section four opening ratios of the air orifice are investigated to establish their effect on the pressure p p t max p t min 2 distribution on the chamber wall s the main parameters of the owc device are d 0 3 m b w 0 1 m and d 0 8 m the viscous and the pneumatic damping coefficients μ 1 and μ 2 used for each opening ratio which are summarized in table 4 are found to increase and decrease respectively with the opening ratio ε from 1 0 to 3 0 a similar trend was reported based on the experimental and numerical studies of an owc device integrated into an offshore wind turbine monopile zhou et al 2020 a larger free surface elevation in the chamber induced by a smaller pto damping μ 2 is expected to lead to a stronger viscous dissipation inside the owc chamber hence a larger viscous damping coefficient μ 1 fig 7 illustrates the variation in pressure distributions along the owc chamber walls wof wif wib and wob for the four opening ratios the incident wave period is t 1 45 s i e kh 1 99 with an incident wave amplitude a 0 0256 m recall that wave steepness ka is constant i e ka 0 05 in this study the maximum hydrodynamic pressure occurs at the still water level for both the inner and outer walls i e the pressure increases monotonically with the water depth a similar phenomenon was also found for a 2d land based owc device with a rectangular shape wang and ning 2020 the effects of the opening ratio on the pressure distributions on the inner wall right column are more significant than those on the outer wall left column as expected the inner wall is affected by the strong coupled effects of the water and air motions while the effects of the motion of air are small outside the chamber the hydrodynamic pressure of the inner wall decreases with the decrease in the opening ratio particularly for the locations near the free surface top of the plots the opening ratio shows less significant effects at the bottom of the inner walls larger wave energy is concentrated on the fluid domain near the free surface hence the pressure there is affected more by the opening ratio zhou et al 2020 in addition fig 7 a and c shows that the hydrodynamic pressures of the outer wall wof and wob increases and decreases with the opening ratio respectively this relates to the fact that larger pto damping i e smaller opening ratio blocks more incident wave energy to propagate into the owc chamber hence this leads to a higher free surface elevation in front of the device owc devices with a larger pto damping are expected to be able to operate safely in extreme sea conditions viviano et al 2019 5 2 effects of the opening ratio on hydrodynamic pressure the numerical simulation is further extended to determine the effects of the opening ratio on hydrodynamic pressure amplitude p for a wider range of wave conditions fig 8 depicts variation in the non dimensional pressure amplitude p ρga with kh on the locations s1 s4 s7 and s10 these are the most vulnerable locations on the walls wof wif wib and wob respectively the hydrodynamic pressures on these locations are the largest among all of the locations on the corresponding walls as discussed in section 3 and section 4 1 in fig 8 a and c the hydrodynamic pressures on the front wof and the rear wob walls are found to increase by 40 and decrease by 30 as kh increases from 1 0 to 3 0 this could be attributed to the lower penetrability of a shorter wave more energy of shorter waves may be reflected by the front wall which in turn leads to smaller energy concentration on the rear wall the opening ratio has smaller effects on the walls wof and wob as shown in fig 8 a and c however the opening ratio ε has a more significant influence on the hydrodynamic pressure on the inner chamber walls wif and wib as shown in fig 8 b and d as the opening ratio ε increases the hydrodynamic pressures on s4 and s7 increase as mentioned before the elevation of the water surface in the chamber varies with the opening ratio leading to an increase in the hydrodynamic pressure on the inner wall in addition larger increases are observed for the intermedium frequency waves 1 25 kh 2 75 indicating that the waves with the length 2 3 m λ 5 02 m can be captured more easily by the present owc chamber in fig 8 b and d larger pressure is observed to occur at a frequency kh 1 68 for all orifices the underlying physics associated with this observed peak frequency kh 1 68 is presented in figs 9 11 fig 9 gives a time series of the experimental and predicted total free surface elevation at g3 and g4 for the case of kh 1 68 ε 2 0 and 3 0 the short red dotted line denotes the mean chamber surface elevation at g3 and g4 the mean free surface elevations at both g3 and g4 significantly deviate from the mean still water level although the shifting direction is opposite at these two locations the troughs in absolute value at g3 and the crests at g4 are observed to increase with time in addition good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is observed which further confirm the validity of the proposed hobem model fig 10 presents the calculated first and second order free surface elevations inside the chamber from the hobem model the second order component occurs at a frequency that is double the fundamental frequency it is interesting to note that the surface elevations at both g3 and g4 present in phase at the first order but anti phase i e the phase difference is 180 in the second order this indicates that the pattern of water motion pattern may be rather different in terms of linear and second order solutions it is clear from fig 10 that the instability of the free surface elevation observed in fig 9 actually results from the behaviors of the second order free surface elevations at g3 and g4 which are also observed to increase with time t t this instability would lead to a second order resonant mode at frequency kh 1 68 fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the free surface elevation at t 20 43 t in the area around the owc chamber with kh 1 68 the total first order and second order free surface elevations are shown the total free surface elevation is composed of the first and second order free surface elevations as expected the amplitude of the water surface in front of the device is larger than that at the back of the device as shown in fig 11 a this difference is because of the superposition of the incident and strong diffracted waves in front of the owc device it is clear from fig 11 c that the second order free surface elevation inside the owc chamber is antisymmetric about the origin o indicating that the sloshing mode is occurring the sloshing model is only observed to occur in terms of the second order solution while the first order solution is still periodic as shown in fig 10 it is the second order wave component rather than the linear component that leads to the sloshing mode resonance hence the peak hydrodynamic pressure is at kh 1 68 i e ω 3 9 following kotrasová et al 2017 the first resonant frequency of the sloshing mode for cylindrical tank can be calculated as ω 1 g λ 1 tanh h λ 1 r 1 r 1 7 76 where λ 1 1 842 is the root of the first order bessel function of the first kind therefore the sloshing mode occurs as the incident wave frequency is half of the first sloshing mode nature frequency ω 0 5ω 1 and the capability of capturing second order wave energy is the lowest here due to the sloshing resonant mode 5 3 effects of the opening ratio on wave loads fig 12 gives the variation in the surge force f x f x t max f x t min 2 the heave force f z f z t max f z t min 2 and the pitch moment m d m d t max m d t min 2 with kh the center of rotation is located at the origin o 0 m 0 m 0 m corresponding analytical solutions developed without considering the pneumatic and viscous damping inside the owc chamber are also plotted for direct comparison from fig 12 a and c the non dimensional surge force f x ρgad 2 and the pitch moment m d ρgah d 2 are not sensitive to the opening ratio ε this is reasonable as the non dimensional surge force and pitch moment are associated with inhomogeneous disturbance around the chamber wall i e differences between the inner and outer walls the opening ratio ε leads to a uniform change for free surface elevation both in front of and back of the owc chamber and hence play a negligible role in the surge force and the pitch moment in addition the numerically calculated surge force and pitch moment almost coincide with the results of the analytical solution in the high frequency domain kh 1 85 however they are at least 4 1 larger than those of the analytical model in the low frequency domain kh 1 5 one explanation for this phenomenon is that the nonlinear coupling effects from long waves contribute more to wave loads more importantly the second order resonant effects on the surge and pitch wave loads cannot be predicted by the linear analytical solution in fig 12 the phenomenon of second order resonance kh 1 68 occurs in the surge force and the pitch moment leading to a significant increase in the peak wave loads the sloshing mode either in linear components or second order wave harmonics should be avoided as this would lead to a larger wave load and a smaller wave energy conversion as indicated in ning et al 2016b therefore the owc device should be designed with consideration taken for the action of the nonlinear waves compared to the surge force and pitch moment the opening ratio ε has a more significant influence on the heave force of the owc device in the low and intermedium frequency domain kh 2 29 the heave force decreases with the decrease of the opening ratio however the heave force follows an opposite trend with the opening ratio in the high frequency domain kh 2 29 by comparison with the analytical solution the introduction of the pneumatic damping can reduce the heave force significantly particularly around the resonant frequency kh 2 1 a smaller opening ratio appears to be a good choice to reduce the wave load from extreme sea conditions viviano et al 2019 5 4 effects of the chamber draft on wave loads in this section the wave loads are analyzed by considering the variation in the chamber draft d h 0 20 0 25 0 30 the effects of the chamber draft on the non dimensional surge force heave force and pitch moment on the owc device are shown in fig 13 it can be seen in fig 13 a and c that both the non dimensional surge force and pitch moment dramatically increase with the chamber draft for all of the incident waves considered this is due to the fact that the increase in the wet body surface due to a larger draft leads to more wave energy striking the device the aforementioned second order resonant frequency shifts toward a high frequency with the decrease of the chamber draft this is associated with the reduction of water column inertia inside the chamber which resonates more easily with short incident waves in fig 13 b a shallower chamber draft results in a larger heave force on the owc device particularly in the high frequency domain this is due to the characteristics of the wave energy distribution in that more wave energy is concentrated on the free surface in the low frequency domain kh 1 75 the non dimensional heave force is close to the same value which further illustrates the strong penetrability of the long incident waves 6 conclusions nonlinear wave loads on a stationary cylindrical type owc device are explored using a hobem model up to the second order complemented by scaled model testing pneumatic and viscous dampings are introduced inside the owc chamber to model the effects of the pto system and viscous loss respectively a scaled experimental model was carried out to validate the developed hobem model a good agreement can be seen between the experimental and numerical results in terms of the hydrodynamic pressure on the chamber walls this supports its use to explore the hydrodynamic performance of the device beyond the range that is considered experimentally the hydrodynamic loads were studied systematically taking into account the effects of the wave conditions the opening ratio and the owc chamber draft etc four opening ratios of the air orifices are considered to represent the effects of the pto damping pneumatic and viscous damping performs an opposite trend generally as the opening ratio ε varies from 1 0 to 3 0 the hydrodynamic pressure of the inner wall decreases with the decrease of the opening ratio especially for locations near the free surface the maximum hydrodynamic pressure occurs at the still water level for both the inner and outer walls as the wave energy is concentrated in this area it is found that the surge force and the pitch moment are not sensitive to the opening ratio a resonance resulting from behaviors of the second order wave component was found at a certain frequency inside the chamber the sloshing mode is observed at the second order at this particular frequency the second order free surface elevation increases with time at this frequency e g kh 1 68 for the setup considered in this study consequently the hydrodynamic pressure amplitude the surge force and the pitch moment have significant peak values at this frequency the second order waves can induce at least a 4 1 increment in the surge force and the pitch moment in the low frequency domain kh 1 5 the second order resonant frequency shifts to a lower frequency domain with the increase in the chamber draft it is noted that the owc device in this study was assumed to be stationary future work will be focused on the geometrical optimization and survivability of the floating moored owc device under conditions of irregular and extreme sea states and the different scaled experimental investigations will be carried out on the empirical ranges of the viscus and pneumatic damping coefficients data availability the data that support the

20433,based on the potential flow theory a second order higher order boundary element method model is developed to simulate hydrodynamic loads and pressure on a stationary cylindrical type oscillating water column owc wave energy converter quadratic pneumatic damping and additional viscous damping are introduced to simulate the effects of the power take off and the viscous dissipation inside the chamber respectively the proposed model is verified against a carefully instrumented scaled experiment the effects of the chamber geometry and the wave environment on the hydrodynamic loads of the owc device are then explored using the validated model the resonance excited by the second order wave component is observed with the fundamental frequency being half of the natural frequency this resembles a sloshing mode and leads to a significant increase in hydrodynamic pressure and surge force as well as pitch moment the effects of the second order waves cannot be ignored under the action of the low frequency long waves in addition the surge force and the pitch moment are not sensitive to the variation in the orifice opening ratios while the heave force increases with the opening ratio at a resonant heave frequency keywords resonant wave loads nonlinear wave model testing hobem 1 introduction many coastal and offshore structures are subject to harsh wave conditions including a large range of wave energy converters wecs whose development to capture renewable energy from the ocean has recently been booming cheng et al 2020 such as oscillating buoy zhao et al 2021 and oscillating water column owc wecs zheng et al 2020 wave loads in either operational or harsh sea conditions are a major consideration in the design and construction of these devices their structural lifetimes can be shortened by accumulated fatigue damage and or large deformations induced by nonlinear waves thus an accurate prediction of nonlinear wave loads on offshore wecs is important for their commercialization and application particularly with respect to floating type devices benitz et al 2015 the nonlinear loads associated with the second order waves have drawn significant attention romolo and arena 2008 kim and yue 1989 solved the second order diffraction problem and calculated the values for the second order wave forces and pressure on a vertical cylinder and a truncated cone rainey 1989 extended morison s equation to calculate the wave loads on a lattice offshore structure with second order accuracy shao and faltinsen 2014 examined the springing excitation of monochromatic and bichromatic waves on a modified hull by solving a second order potential flow problem cong et al 2018 established a frequency domain model to discuss the second order hydrodynamic loads from bi chromatic bi directional waves the sum frequency surge force increases significantly with the action of waves with opposite headings it is clear that second harmonic wave loads are important for cylindrical offshore structures but the conclusions are not directly applicable to an owc device consisting of a semi submerged hollow chamber and a power take off pto system hayati et al 2020 the cylindrical type owc devices which can be easily integrated into coastal and offshore structures have a promising commercial prospect for capturing wave energy zheng et al 2019a investigations on the effects of wave dynamics on owc devices have also received extensive exploration in the literature konispoliatis et al 2016 presented an analytical model to evaluate the hydrodynamics of a three unit array on an owc platform including the first and mean second order wave forces due to the effects of the seiching resonance mode between the internal and external cylinders the horizontal force and moment reached the maximum pawitan et al 2019 conducted both experimental and numerical simulations to predict the effects of wave forces on an owc caisson under the influence of regular and irregular waves the maximum vertical force of the owc caisson occurs during the closing stages of the chamber orifice wang et al 2020 systemically investigated wave loads on a land fixed dual chamber owc device the locations of the largest surge force and bending moment were predicted by a fully nonlinear numerical model huang et al 2019 developed a 3d cfd model to study the effects of the wave environment on the wave loads of a pile type owc device they found that the wave loads were not sensitive to the wave period viviano et al 2018 carried out large scale wave tank testing to analyze the effects of the model scale on the hydrodynamics of an owc device the wave forces obtained in a small scale experiment agree well with those found for large scale owc devices if the small scale model is designed with a higher chamber elhanafi 2016 utilized a cfd model to predict wave loads on a stationary offshore owc device the peak heave force always occurs at the natural frequency of the owc device elhanafi et al 2017 further utilized experimental and numerical methods to discuss the effects of tank sidewalls on the wave loads of the owc device the effects of tank sidewalls can be ignored where the tank width is at least five times the width of the owc model the nonlinear wave loads are important but the contributions from each harmonic wave and their interactions with the device remain unclear another hydrodynamic problem is that of the water motion that takes place in the chamber of an owc device it is widely acknowledged that water motion may occur violently in the natural modes of the chamber within the piston where the water column that is captured inside the chamber heaves up and down more or less in the manner of a rigid body and the sloshing where the maximum water motion occurs back and forth between the vertical walls of a rectangular chamber modes zhou et al 2018 a similar phenomenon is observed for water motions inside the storage tanks of a container caron et al 2018 núñez aedo et al 2020 in moonpools guo et al 2017 and between the narrow gaps created by arranging two vessels in close vicinity lu et al 2020 tan et al 2019 all of these applications involve a liquid oil or water with a free surface and possess a certain level of similarity in an owc device these motions are usually associated with energy conversion efficiency for example piston type water motions are found to lead to the largest hydrodynamic efficiency zheng et al 2019b while the sloshing mode plays the opposite role zero efficiency may even occur in this condition the air volume flux captured inside the chamber the changing rate of which is directly associated with device efficiency barely changes in the sloshing modes xu and huang 2019 the relationship between the resonant water motion inside the chamber particularly the sloshing type motion and the wave loads on the device remains unclear and this forms the focus of this study it is worth mentioning that this relationship may be the main concern for a liquid storage tank but not for an owc and the underlying mechanisms associated with them may be rather different in the present study a 3d nonlinear time domain higher order boundary element method hobem model was applied to evaluate hydrodynamic loads and pressure on a stationary cylindrical type owc device the effects of the chamber geometry and the wave environment on hydrodynamic performance are considered the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the second order time domain hobem model quadratic pneumatic damping and additional viscous damping are introduced in the dynamic free surface boundary condition inside the chamber to simulate the effects of the pto system and viscous loss inside the chamber the experiment utilized to validate the proposed numerical model is described in section 3 section 4 discusses the effects of the orifice opening ratio and the chamber draft finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical model based on the potential flow theory a second order hobem model was adopted to describe the wave dynamics on a 3d cylindrical owc device in the time domain bai and teng 2013 a sketch of the problem is given in fig 1 the owc device is characterized by external diameter d chamber draft d and chamber wall thickness b w h denotes the static water depth a cartesian coordinate system is defined with origin o at the center of the owc device the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational hence the wave field can be described by complex velocity potential φ consisting of incident potential φ i and scattered potential φ s taylor and hung 1987 based on the second order perturbation expansion

analysis for capturing full scale wave energy with periods between 5s and 10s a series of wave flume tests on an offshore owc device were carried out in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering at dalian university of technology china the experimental setup and the owc model at a 1 20 scale are shown in fig 3 a and b respectively a cartesian coordinate system is defined in fig 3 a the main geometric parameters of the owc device were selected as d 0 8 m b w 0 1 m and d 0 3 m the static water depth h was 1 0 m a circular orifice with a diameter of d o at position to 0 m 0 m 0 2 m was introduced to represent the pto damping ning et al 2016a four opening ratios ε ε s 0 s f where s 0 and s f are the cross sectional areas of the circular orifice and the circular chamber respectively were considered the details are summarized in table 1 the front and rear walls of the inner and outer chambers were labelled wif wof wib and wob twelve cy200 type pressure sensors s1 s12 were installed to measure the pressure distribution on the chamber walls their positions are presented in table 2 pressure sensors sa1 and sa2 were installed to measure the differential air pressure in the chamber as shown in the lower plot in fig 3 a and the average pressure reading of the two sensors is used to represent the air pressure in the chamber two lg1 type wave gauges g3 and g4 were situated inside the owc chamber to measure instantaneous free surface elevations another two wave gauges g1 and g2 were installed outside the chamber to measure the local wave field around the device the locations of these wave gauges are shown in table 2 to test the effects of wave condition twelve monochromatic waves that have a relative water depth in the range of 1 kh 3 33 were generated as shown in table 3 wave steepness ka was fixed to 0 05 ning et al 2020 with the wave amplitude a varying with the wave number k a constant water depth of 1 m was used in these tests 4 model validation experimental measurements were utilized to validate the hobem model details of the numerical scheme and setup can be found in section 2 it is noted that the air compressibility inside the owc chamber is negligible for small scale modelling so it is not represented in the following numerical simulations medina lopez et al 2016 a circular sponge layer fig 2 is set with the radii r 1 r 0 λ to absorb the reflected waves from the owc device fig 4 shows the meshing scheme used for the offshore owc device determined by convergence tests that are not presented here for brevity including the meshes for the body surface 192 elements and the free surface 492 elements after the convergent tests the time histories for the pressures at the 12 measurement points s1 s12 on the vertical walls are compared between the numerical and experimental results as shown in figs 5 and 6 for the cases with t 1 45 s i e kh 1 99 two opening ratios ε ε 2 0 in figs 5 and 3 0 in fig 6 are considered based on the trial and error procedure the following viscous and pneumatic damping coefficients are chosen μ 1 0 015 μ 2 1 450 for ε 2 0 and μ 1 0 03 μ 2 1 443 for ε 3 0 respectively satisfactory agreements are obtained for the two opening ratios the relative error analysis between the measured and predicted pressure amplitudes on the vertical walls are carried out overall the relative errors of these test points are less than 10 except for the case of s6 over 25 an apparent discrepancy is observed at the location of s6 i e the inner bottom corner of the chamber as shown in figs 5 b and fig 6 b this may be due to the fact that the strong vortex shedding is induced by the device corner and this cannot be captured by the potential flow theory in this study nevertheless the proposed hobem model is accurate for modelling the wave interaction with the owc device as the bulk wave and air dynamics rather than the local effects inside the chamber are of interest in this study 5 results and discussion in this section the validated numerical model is now extended to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the owc device in terms of the pressure and the total wave loads the effects of the opening ratio associated with the pto system for electricity generation and the chamber draft are explored 5 1 pressure distribution on the chamber wall in this section four opening ratios of the air orifice are investigated to establish their effect on the pressure p p t max p t min 2 distribution on the chamber wall s the main parameters of the owc device are d 0 3 m b w 0 1 m and d 0 8 m the viscous and the pneumatic damping coefficients μ 1 and μ 2 used for each opening ratio which are summarized in table 4 are found to increase and decrease respectively with the opening ratio ε from 1 0 to 3 0 a similar trend was reported based on the experimental and numerical studies of an owc device integrated into an offshore wind turbine monopile zhou et al 2020 a larger free surface elevation in the chamber induced by a smaller pto damping μ 2 is expected to lead to a stronger viscous dissipation inside the owc chamber hence a larger viscous damping coefficient μ 1 fig 7 illustrates the variation in pressure distributions along the owc chamber walls wof wif wib and wob for the four opening ratios the incident wave period is t 1 45 s i e kh 1 99 with an incident wave amplitude a 0 0256 m recall that wave steepness ka is constant i e ka 0 05 in this study the maximum hydrodynamic pressure occurs at the still water level for both the inner and outer walls i e the pressure increases monotonically with the water depth a similar phenomenon was also found for a 2d land based owc device with a rectangular shape wang and ning 2020 the effects of the opening ratio on the pressure distributions on the inner wall right column are more significant than those on the outer wall left column as expected the inner wall is affected by the strong coupled effects of the water and air motions while the effects of the motion of air are small outside the chamber the hydrodynamic pressure of the inner wall decreases with the decrease in the opening ratio particularly for the locations near the free surface top of the plots the opening ratio shows less significant effects at the bottom of the inner walls larger wave energy is concentrated on the fluid domain near the free surface hence the pressure there is affected more by the opening ratio zhou et al 2020 in addition fig 7 a and c shows that the hydrodynamic pressures of the outer wall wof and wob increases and decreases with the opening ratio respectively this relates to the fact that larger pto damping i e smaller opening ratio blocks more incident wave energy to propagate into the owc chamber hence this leads to a higher free surface elevation in front of the device owc devices with a larger pto damping are expected to be able to operate safely in extreme sea conditions viviano et al 2019 5 2 effects of the opening ratio on hydrodynamic pressure the numerical simulation is further extended to determine the effects of the opening ratio on hydrodynamic pressure amplitude p for a wider range of wave conditions fig 8 depicts variation in the non dimensional pressure amplitude p ρga with kh on the locations s1 s4 s7 and s10 these are the most vulnerable locations on the walls wof wif wib and wob respectively the hydrodynamic pressures on these locations are the largest among all of the locations on the corresponding walls as discussed in section 3 and section 4 1 in fig 8 a and c the hydrodynamic pressures on the front wof and the rear wob walls are found to increase by 40 and decrease by 30 as kh increases from 1 0 to 3 0 this could be attributed to the lower penetrability of a shorter wave more energy of shorter waves may be reflected by the front wall which in turn leads to smaller energy concentration on the rear wall the opening ratio has smaller effects on the walls wof and wob as shown in fig 8 a and c however the opening ratio ε has a more significant influence on the hydrodynamic pressure on the inner chamber walls wif and wib as shown in fig 8 b and d as the opening ratio ε increases the hydrodynamic pressures on s4 and s7 increase as mentioned before the elevation of the water surface in the chamber varies with the opening ratio leading to an increase in the hydrodynamic pressure on the inner wall in addition larger increases are observed for the intermedium frequency waves 1 25 kh 2 75 indicating that the waves with the length 2 3 m λ 5 02 m can be captured more easily by the present owc chamber in fig 8 b and d larger pressure is observed to occur at a frequency kh 1 68 for all orifices the underlying physics associated with this observed peak frequency kh 1 68 is presented in figs 9 11 fig 9 gives a time series of the experimental and predicted total free surface elevation at g3 and g4 for the case of kh 1 68 ε 2 0 and 3 0 the short red dotted line denotes the mean chamber surface elevation at g3 and g4 the mean free surface elevations at both g3 and g4 significantly deviate from the mean still water level although the shifting direction is opposite at these two locations the troughs in absolute value at g3 and the crests at g4 are observed to increase with time in addition good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is observed which further confirm the validity of the proposed hobem model fig 10 presents the calculated first and second order free surface elevations inside the chamber from the hobem model the second order component occurs at a frequency that is double the fundamental frequency it is interesting to note that the surface elevations at both g3 and g4 present in phase at the first order but anti phase i e the phase difference is 180 in the second order this indicates that the pattern of water motion pattern may be rather different in terms of linear and second order solutions it is clear from fig 10 that the instability of the free surface elevation observed in fig 9 actually results from the behaviors of the second order free surface elevations at g3 and g4 which are also observed to increase with time t t this instability would lead to a second order resonant mode at frequency kh 1 68 fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the free surface elevation at t 20 43 t in the area around the owc chamber with kh 1 68 the total first order and second order free surface elevations are shown the total free surface elevation is composed of the first and second order free surface elevations as expected the amplitude of the water surface in front of the device is larger than that at the back of the device as shown in fig 11 a this difference is because of the superposition of the incident and strong diffracted waves in front of the owc device it is clear from fig 11 c that the second order free surface elevation inside the owc chamber is antisymmetric about the origin o indicating that the sloshing mode is occurring the sloshing model is only observed to occur in terms of the second order solution while the first order solution is still periodic as shown in fig 10 it is the second order wave component rather than the linear component that leads to the sloshing mode resonance hence the peak hydrodynamic pressure is at kh 1 68 i e ω 3 9 following kotrasová et al 2017 the first resonant frequency of the sloshing mode for cylindrical tank can be calculated as ω 1 g λ 1 tanh h λ 1 r 1 r 1 7 76 where λ 1 1 842 is the root of the first order bessel function of the first kind therefore the sloshing mode occurs as the incident wave frequency is half of the first sloshing mode nature frequency ω 0 5ω 1 and the capability of capturing second order wave energy is the lowest here due to the sloshing resonant mode 5 3 effects of the opening ratio on wave loads fig 12 gives the variation in the surge force f x f x t max f x t min 2 the heave force f z f z t max f z t min 2 and the pitch moment m d m d t max m d t min 2 with kh the center of rotation is located at the origin o 0 m 0 m 0 m corresponding analytical solutions developed without considering the pneumatic and viscous damping inside the owc chamber are also plotted for direct comparison from fig 12 a and c the non dimensional surge force f x ρgad 2 and the pitch moment m d ρgah d 2 are not sensitive to the opening ratio ε this is reasonable as the non dimensional surge force and pitch moment are associated with inhomogeneous disturbance around the chamber wall i e differences between the inner and outer walls the opening ratio ε leads to a uniform change for free surface elevation both in front of and back of the owc chamber and hence play a negligible role in the surge force and the pitch moment in addition the numerically calculated surge force and pitch moment almost coincide with the results of the analytical solution in the high frequency domain kh 1 85 however they are at least 4 1 larger than those of the analytical model in the low frequency domain kh 1 5 one explanation for this phenomenon is that the nonlinear coupling effects from long waves contribute more to wave loads more importantly the second order resonant effects on the surge and pitch wave loads cannot be predicted by the linear analytical solution in fig 12 the phenomenon of second order resonance kh 1 68 occurs in the surge force and the pitch moment leading to a significant increase in the peak wave loads the sloshing mode either in linear components or second order wave harmonics should be avoided as this would lead to a larger wave load and a smaller wave energy conversion as indicated in ning et al 2016b therefore the owc device should be designed with consideration taken for the action of the nonlinear waves compared to the surge force and pitch moment the opening ratio ε has a more significant influence on the heave force of the owc device in the low and intermedium frequency domain kh 2 29 the heave force decreases with the decrease of the opening ratio however the heave force follows an opposite trend with the opening ratio in the high frequency domain kh 2 29 by comparison with the analytical solution the introduction of the pneumatic damping can reduce the heave force significantly particularly around the resonant frequency kh 2 1 a smaller opening ratio appears to be a good choice to reduce the wave load from extreme sea conditions viviano et al 2019 5 4 effects of the chamber draft on wave loads in this section the wave loads are analyzed by considering the variation in the chamber draft d h 0 20 0 25 0 30 the effects of the chamber draft on the non dimensional surge force heave force and pitch moment on the owc device are shown in fig 13 it can be seen in fig 13 a and c that both the non dimensional surge force and pitch moment dramatically increase with the chamber draft for all of the incident waves considered this is due to the fact that the increase in the wet body surface due to a larger draft leads to more wave energy striking the device the aforementioned second order resonant frequency shifts toward a high frequency with the decrease of the chamber draft this is associated with the reduction of water column inertia inside the chamber which resonates more easily with short incident waves in fig 13 b a shallower chamber draft results in a larger heave force on the owc device particularly in the high frequency domain this is due to the characteristics of the wave energy distribution in that more wave energy is concentrated on the free surface in the low frequency domain kh 1 75 the non dimensional heave force is close to the same value which further illustrates the strong penetrability of the long incident waves 6 conclusions nonlinear wave loads on a stationary cylindrical type owc device are explored using a hobem model up to the second order complemented by scaled model testing pneumatic and viscous dampings are introduced inside the owc chamber to model the effects of the pto system and viscous loss respectively a scaled experimental model was carried out to validate the developed hobem model a good agreement can be seen between the experimental and numerical results in terms of the hydrodynamic pressure on the chamber walls this supports its use to explore the hydrodynamic performance of the device beyond the range that is considered experimentally the hydrodynamic loads were studied systematically taking into account the effects of the wave conditions the opening ratio and the owc chamber draft etc four opening ratios of the air orifices are considered to represent the effects of the pto damping pneumatic and viscous damping performs an opposite trend generally as the opening ratio ε varies from 1 0 to 3 0 the hydrodynamic pressure of the inner wall decreases with the decrease of the opening ratio especially for locations near the free surface the maximum hydrodynamic pressure occurs at the still water level for both the inner and outer walls as the wave energy is concentrated in this area it is found that the surge force and the pitch moment are not sensitive to the opening ratio a resonance resulting from behaviors of the second order wave component was found at a certain frequency inside the chamber the sloshing mode is observed at the second order at this particular frequency the second order free surface elevation increases with time at this frequency e g kh 1 68 for the setup considered in this study consequently the hydrodynamic pressure amplitude the surge force and the pitch moment have significant peak values at this frequency the second order waves can induce at least a 4 1 increment in the surge force and the pitch moment in the low frequency domain kh 1 5 the second order resonant frequency shifts to a lower frequency domain with the increase in the chamber draft it is noted that the owc device in this study was assumed to be stationary future work will be focused on the geometrical optimization and survivability of the floating moored owc device under conditions of irregular and extreme sea states and the different scaled experimental investigations will be carried out on the empirical ranges of the viscus and pneumatic damping coefficients data availability the data that support the

20434,this paper describes a model developed to predict the general behavior of large vessels under energetic tsunami conditions using established regional scale tsunami models the methodology is based on a two way coupled approach to account for the interaction between vessels and flow which becomes increasingly important in restricted waters a shallow water hydrodynamic solver is modified to include vessels as horizontal pressure distributions and friction coefficients are adjusted accordingly at the locations of vessels to account for the effects of skin friction adequacy of these modifications are then tested against a benchmark case designed in openfoam and comparisons demonstrate the modified shallow water solver s ability to provide a reasonable realization for energetic flow passing a floating object a vessel transport model coupled with the hydrodynamic solver is based on the linear equations of ship motion with three degrees of freedom surge sway and the yaw finally the model is equipped with a collision solver founded on the concept of the conservation of momentum and impulse results from two large scale applications of the developed tool are presented these analyses revealed that the flow in and around the ports is indeed strongly affected by the presence of vessels also it is observed that the model can approximate the ship s behavior but at the same time the model results are very sensitive to the initial choice of the input parameters due to the chaotic nature of the process keywords tsunami currents cfd shallow water equations transport coupling ports 1 introduction with the growth of the maritime industry the sizes of the container ships and the amount of cargo transported with them have greatly increased over the last 60 years borrero et al 2015a b as the latest tele tsunamis have demonstrated maritime communities are particularly vulnerable to the effects of tsunami induced currents we have seen that even when there is no or little inundation the currents generated by tsunami surges can potentially cause significant damage to maritime facilities lynett et al 2012 2014 2014 these observations have led to new questions regarding the adverse effects of tsunamis these unwanted and often un avoidable effects can range from small damage to vessels and infrastructure to the complete destruction of harbors wilson et al 2012 2013 dengler et al 2008 over the past few years unfavorable nearshore effects of tsunami induced currents from far field sources have been reported from many locations around the world several incidents occurred during the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and were documented in detail by okal et al 2006a 2006b 2006c the most astounding of these events took place in port of salalah oman where an approximately 300 m long container ship broke all its twelve mooring lines due to strong currents generated near the loading berth the vessel drifted on the currents spinning uncontrollably for hours both in and around the harbor until the vessel beached on a sandbar outside of the port there was not any overland flooding or inundation in the port of salalah as the maximum tsunami amplitude during the event was about 1 5 m however the currents generated locally by the relatively small tsunami were strong enough to pull the large container ship off the dock the currents near the vessel were estimated to be around 4 5 m s by numerical simulations of the event lynett et al 2012 in the wake of the indian ocean tsunami a similar instance was also reported in leport réunion island a 196 m container ship the msc uruguay broke all its mooring lines and drifted inside the harbor striking and damaging gantry cranes on a nearby dock okal et al 2006b likewise in the port of toamasina madagascar a 50 m freighter wandered through the harbor for nearly 3 h after breaking its moorings okal et al 2006c all these incidents occurred well after the arrival of the tsunami that was described as not flooding the port facilities this is important to consider because practitioners without specific experience in tsunami hydrodynamics may stop computations shortly after the maximum runup of the first or second wave is reached eddies can persist for days and this makes computations more unreliable as numerical errors can accumulate the tohoku tsunami that was triggered by the great tohoku oki earthquake mw 9 0 was documented quite well through comprehensive observations and instrumental measurements although current speed measurements were not widespread along the pacific rim there are a few data sets available in the extreme near field fritz et al 2012 analyzed the videos recorded by two eyewitnesses in kesennuma japan to determine tsunami current speeds their analysis revealed that the current speeds in kesennuma bay reached up to 11 m s making navigation impossible however in the far field harbors and bays in the hawaii islands cheung et al 2013 several harbors in new zealand borrero et al 2013 lynett et al 2012 and some harbors in the galapagos islands including the largest port of the country puerto ayora lynett et al 2013 also experienced strong currents and damage related to these currents even though the incoming tsunami heights were relatively small the assessment of seakeeping and maneuverability of large vessels has always been of high interest to researchers whether they are in unrestricted water depth draft of the ship waters or in ports and canals where they are restricted in both depth and breadth however recent incidents in ports as described above show that the maneuvering capabilities of vessels can become very limited when they are captured by strong currents and within eddies in particular the vessels that break free and drift off in and around the port during tsunamis generally exhibit apparently random behavior and thus poses a great risk of impact hazard to the port therefore we concern ourselves in this work with reports of large vessels that go out of control in and around ports under hazardous conditions caused by tsunamis to develop mitigation plans for these situations we can rely on numerical modeling yet the first order approaches where the flow and object transport are decoupled would not be sufficient in these cases the reason being is that in shallow and or restricted waters e g narrow waterways ports harbors bays the ratio of vessel draft to water depth approaches 1 this in essence leads to reduced effective flow depth and accelerated current speeds near vessels which consequently increases the current force acting on the hull nonetheless this interaction should be accounted for while developing models for this matter although it was ignored in most of the earlier published efforts e g tomita and honda 2011 sakakibara et al 2010 kobayashi et al 2011 that study large vessel motion during tsunamis to address this issue here we present a large vessel transport model that is two way coupled with a hydrodynamic numerical model allowing the interaction between the flow and vessel the hydrodynamic parameters come from a shallow water solver the application of the method of splitting tsunami most numerical model titov and synolakis 1998 although the sophistication of most initially may not seem sufficient for this problem its computational efficiency in geophysical scale

al 2014 kalligeris et al 2015 alludes it as the ideal tool aside from eulerian based methods models solving incompressible or weakly compressible versions of navier stokes equations in a lagrangian framework like smoothed particles hydrodynamics sph are becoming popular in an attempt to deal with fluid structure interaction various studies e g wu et al 2016 rakhska et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 sun et al 2021 and references therein employ sph in 3d to model flows interacting with different objects of varying sizes although all these models demonstrate that they can capture the flow structure interaction accurately with a great level of detail they mainly concern with very small length scales o m additionally the accuracy of sph models depends heavily on the resolution which increases the number of particles to be included in the calculations drastically and eventually it gets impractical to utilize sph for larger scale objectives due to high computational demand unlike numerically expensive 3d models when modeling the wood transport during flash floods ruiz villanueva et al 2014a 2014b also utilized a 2d hydraulic solver and included the feedback from the wood logs into hydrodynamic calculations by adding the drag force acting on woods as a source term to the momentum equations more recently xiong et al 2020 presented a coupled transport model in 1d where they employed discrete element modeling dem method to calculate forces on debris particles they also achieved fluid particle coupling by adding forces exerted on the debris back into momentum equation in this study instead of adding the reactive forces to momentum equations we introduce vessels as pressure disturbances into the hydrodynamic calculations to attain flow vessel interactions which accounts for the form drag produced by their presence in the flow furthermore we manipulate manning s coefficient locally to include the impact of skin friction which becomes important when dealing with large vessels finally a collision model integrated into the coupled model to resolve collisions between vessels or vessels and port structures e g berths quays etc the motivation for this study comes from the observations discussed above and the hope to be able to provide quantitative guidance to authorities on potential vessel motions during tsunamis we however remark here that the objective of this study is to capture the general behavior of large vessels under energetic tsunami conditions using established regional scale tsunami models we explain our approach to the problem specifically the modifications made to most and how these modifications enabled most to attain the interaction between the flow and large vessels as well as its limitations along with the large vessel transport and collision models in chapter 2 small scale model validation exercises are discussed in chapter 3 and the application of the model in geophysical scale is given in chapter 4 2 methods 2 1

provided in titov and synolakis 1998 and burwell et al 2007 using the long wave assumption most approximates 3d processes with two horizontal dimension 2hd equations as a final note about the verification of the most lynett et al 2014 conducted a sensitivity analysis to understand the accuracy of most in resolving complex nearshore hydrodynamics where they have compared the most results with a high order fully nonlinear boussinesq type model coulwave and with available field data they found out that most matches the tsunami amplitude phase patterns for the first several hours and the amplitude envelope for at least 24 h after the first arrival of the tsunami likewise most can also match the current velocities extracted from eyewitness videos on average current velocities predicted by most are 10 20 higher than coulwave results which leaves most on the conservative side as a result of these observations they concluded that most was sufficiently capable of modeling tsunami induced currents using a 1 3 arcsec 10 m grid size during the 2015 chilean tsunami kalligeris et al 2016 made in situ measurements of current speeds in ventura harbor california in their comparison of most output to measured data they found that most matched the phase of the measurement well and the velocity estimates by most remain in the envelope of the measurements 2 2 inclusion of ships as pressure distributions there are several established techniques to model fluid structure interaction the immersed boundary ib method probably the most popular is discussed in peskin 2002 and has been used extensively in studies dealing with fluid structure interaction an example application of ib method is presented in ma et al 2016 where they apply this method to include fluid structure interaction in their nonhydrostatic σ coordinate model earlier last decade kamrin et al 2012 established a method called the reference map technique rmt in which both the fluid and the solid are defined in the eulerian reference frame recently bellotti and theillard 2019 integrated rmt to an incompressible navier stokes solver to model two phase flows which allows for the interaction of either two different fluids or one type of fluid with solid objects however both ib method and rmt approximate the fluid structure interaction by enforcing a no slip condition over the boundary of the solids yet this aspect of ib and rmt methods becomes a limitation in 2hd e g most models when attempting to model the interaction between the fluid and the floating objects an object with a no slip boundary condition in a 2hd model will block the flow that is supposed to pass underneath the floating object hence the essence of the problem will change in general 2hd models employ free slip conditions on solid boundaries due to their inherent inability to resolve detailed boundary layer processes due to this fact the fluid structure interaction in this study is attained through modeling vessels as free surface pressure disturbances it is a common approach to define vessels as horizontal pressure disturbances when studying waves generated by moving ships e g akylas 1984 ertekin et al 1986 liu and wu 2004 bayraktar ersan and beji 2013 david et al 2017 following approaches found in the literature we modify the momentum equations in the x and y directions in most by adding free surface pressure terms defined in the horizontal plane 5 u t u u x v u y g h x g d x d u 1 ρ p 0 x 6 v t u v x v v y g h y g d y d v 1 ρ p 0 y where p 0 x y is the free surface pressure disturbance with this pressure disturbance the initial vessel profile condition becomes u 0 v 0 η p 0 ρ g of particular interest to this study as stated earlier is to develop a model that can reasonably resolve the flow around vessels interaction of the crossflow with the vessels results in acceleration in the flow passing underneath or the wakes generated behind the vessel the interactions are primarily driven by the total drag acting on the vessel which has 2 major components i friction drag due to viscous resistance of the water ii form drag due to shape of the ship hull sorensen 1973 the effect of the form drag is accomplished by including the pressure gradient terms p x p y in the momentum equations here we further argue that the friction drag can also be approximated by increasing the shear stress locally at the grid points at which pressure gradients are non zero in the most model this local increase in stress is captured through a local increase in the manning s n parameter which attempts to account for the vessel skin friction though the amount of this local increase cannot be arbitrarily decided therefore a benchmark test designed in openfoam for calibration and model validation purposes presented in section 3 2 2 3 collision model the three main modeling challenges in a collision model are 1 the detection of the collisions 2 calculating the required post collision velocities to break the contact and 3 computing the necessary contact forces that will lead to proper changes in velocities the details of the collision detection algorithm and the collision solver that tackle these problems in a physically correct manner will be explained in this section 2 3 1 collision detection the literature in collision detection is quite rich due to significant contributions of computer graphics and robotics researchers one of the generally accepted and applied methods is called the separation axis theorem baraff 1989 gottschalk et al 1996 this technique is generic for rigid bodies defined as convex polyhedral and particularly useful if collisions between objects with arbitrary shapes are expected in a given model however in this study particularly in large scale simulations the vessels are approximated as ellipses for certain practical reasons that are described in chapter 4 this approximation in vessel shapes allowed the development of a simpler and faster but non generic algorithm for identifying collisions the collision detection algorithm starts with keeping track of the minimum distance between the objects at every time step during the simulation the minimum distance between two ellipses which are defined by n points along their boundaries such as e 1 k 1 k 2 k 3 k n and e 2 l 1 l 2 l 3 l n and can be defined as d m i n e 1 e 2 min d k i l j i j 1 2 n where d k i l j is the euclidean distance between k i and l j each point on the boundary of the ellipses is defined in cartesian coordinates as k i x i y i and l j x j y j also it must be noted that the cardinality between two ellipses is not a requirement yet it is assumed here such that to simplify the notation the collision detection algorithm works in the following steps the minimum distances between all objects are tracked at all time steps if the minimum distance between any two bodies d m i n e 1 e 2 is less than a given tolerance ε then the bodies are in colliding contact if bodies interpenetrate at time t 0 δ t fig 1 b then the time of collision t c is approximated by evaluating v r e l t 0 d m i n t 0 ε thus the time of collision t c should satisfy t o t c t o δ t once all the collisions are detected they are solved in the order of occurrence and the post collision velocities are calculated as will be discussed in the next section 2 3 2 collision solver once all the collisions are detected at a given time step and the contact point on each body is identified the resulting impact force torque and velocities of the bodies after the collision are determined one common approach for calculating the impact forces is the so called penalty method and is based on the introduction of arbitrary forces e g spring forces to separate the colliding bodies terzopolous et al 1987 although this method can generate realistic animations it is acceptable when the accuracy of the physics is relatively unimportant baraff 1989 the impact force determination can be tackled analytically using the conservation of momentum principle as will be adopted here this method has been employed in computer graphics problems widely and is proven to provide physically correct contact forces hahn 1988 moore and wilhelms 1988 baraff 1989 if the two bodies body a and body b are in contact at point p then a given point on body a denoted by p a t should satisfy p a t 0 p at the time of the contact t 0 similarly point p b t on body b will coincide p b t 0 p at time t 0 while at time t 0 p a t and p b t will overlap the velocities of these two points might be very different by evaluating the velocities of these points which will be denoted by p a t 0 and p b t 0 respectively we can determine whether these two bodies are approaching separating or in contact with each other the point velocities are given as 7 p a t 0 v a t 0 ω a t 0 p a t 0 x a t 0 8 p b t 0 v b t 0 ω b t 0 p b t 0 x b t 0 where v a v b ω a and ω b are the linear and angular velocities and x a t 0 and x b t 0 are the coordinates of the center of masses of the bodies at the time of the contact subsequently the relative velocity v r e l of the contact points with respect to each other in the direction of contact can be defined by eqn 9 9 v r e l p a t 0 p b t 0 n t 0 in the above equation n t 0 denotes the normal surface vector which provides the direction of v r e l at the contact point if v r e l is positive it means that v r e l and n t 0 are in the same direction and the bodies are moving away from each other then the contact will diminish at time t 0 δ t yet we are concerned about the case when v r e l 0 which means that the directions of the v r e l and n t 0 are opposite and the two bodies are in contact at point p to avoid an interpenetration the velocities of body a and body b should change rapidly to create such a near discontinuity in body velocities a contact force of f is exerted on the bodies for a very short instant of time δ t which leads to a new quantity called the impulse j 10 j f δ t the impulse is a vector quantity with the units of mass times acceleration applying an impulse will generate the required near instantaneous adjustment in the velocity of a body then the effect of j on the linear velocity v of a given rigid body with the mass m can be driven simply by using the relation δ v j m the impulse acting at contact point p also creates an impulsive torque of τ j computed using eqn 11 11 τ j p c x 0 t 0 j where p c is the point of contact and x 0 is the location of the center of gravity of the object at the time of the contact likewise the change in the angular velocity δ ω of the body with the yaw moment of inertia of i z z due to the impulsive torque is given by δ ω τ j i z z therefore if a collision takes place between two bodies an impulse and a resulting impulse torque will be applied to prevent them from interpenetrating since the tangential or friction forces are neglected here the direction of the impulse will be in the normal direction n t 0 fig 2 a thus the impulse j can be written as 12 j j n t 0 where j is a scalar to be calculated and gives the magnitude of the impulse the sign convention adopted here lets the impulse j act positively on body a that is a is subject to an impulse of j n t 0 while an equal but opposite impulse j n t 0 is exerted on body b fig 2b to derive the j by using an empirical law for collisions the following relations need to be provided first 13 p a 2 t 0 v a 2 t 0 ω a 2 t 0 r a along with 14 v a 2 t 0 v a 1 t 0 j n t 0 m a 15 ω a 2 t 0 ω a 1 t 0 r a j n t 0 i z z a where p a 1 t 0 and p a 2 t 0 denote the velocity of the body a before and after the impulse j is applied respectively and r a p c x a t 0 is the displacement distance also the pre collision velocities of body a are denoted with v a 1 t 0 and ω a 1 t 0 and the post collision velocities are shown by v a 2 t 0 and ω a 2 t 0 combining eqns 13 15 yields the following 16 p a 2 t 0 v a 1 t 0 j n t 0 m a ω a 1 t 0 r a j n t 0 i z z a r a 17 p a 2 t 0 v a 1 t 0 ω a 1 t 0 r a j n t 0 m a r a j n t 0 i z z a r a if we substitute eqns 10 and 11 into the above expression we have 18 p a 2 t 0 p a 1 t 0 j n t 0 m a r a n t 0 i z z a r a 19 p b 2 t 0 p b 1 t 0 j n t 0 m b r b n t 0 i z z b r b 20 p a 2 t 0 p b 2 t 0 p a 1 t 0 p b 1 t 0 j n t 0 m a n t 0 m b r a j n t 0 i z z a r a r b j n t 0 i z z b r b following eqn 9 we can also introduce v r e l 1 and v r e l 2 the pre and post impact relative velocities in the normal direction 21 v r e l 1 p a 1 t 0 p b 1 t 0 n t 0 22 v r e l 2 p a 2 t 0 p b 2 t 0 n t 0 23 v r e l 2 ε v r e l 1 where ε is the coefficient of restitution and ranges from 0 to 1 the upper limit ε 1 yields v r e l 2 v r e l 1 which means the entire kinetic energy of the system has been preserved and the collision is perfectly elastic if ε 0 then v r e l 2 0 indicating a fully inelastic collision in which bodies will stick to each other after the collision if we rewrite eqn 23 in terms of v r e l 1 v r e l 2 and j and rearrange then the expression to compute the impulse j becomes 24 j 1 ε v r e l 1 1 m a 1 m b n t 0 r a n t 0 i z z a r a n t 0 r b n t 0 i z z b r b in which m a m b are the masses and i z z a and i z z b are the yaw moment of inertias of the two colliding bodies in the case where the body collides into a non movable body like a berth wharf or another port infrastructure the terms with subscript b will vanish in eqn 24 since the mass and the inertia of an object that cannot be moved is infinitely large relative to the colliding body therefore for this type of collision eqn 24 simplifies into eqn 25 25 j 1 ε v r e l 1 1 m a n t 0 r a n t 0 i z z a r a once the impact force j is determined the post collision velocities u v and ω for each body involved in the collision can be calculated using eqns 14 and 15 to validate the ability of the collision model various benchmark experiments were produced and example snapshots of a selected case is shown in fig 3 during this test it was assumed that the collisions were perfectly elastic the case given in fig 3 was an eccentric collision that included two bodies with equal masses approaching to each other with velocities of equal magnitude of 0 1 m s post collision velocities are calculated as u 1 0 0317 m s e c v 1 0 0279 m s e c ω 1 4 512 r a d s e c for the body approaching from left and u 2 0 0316 m s e c v 2 0 0282 m s e c ω 2 4 546 r a d s e c for the one the right which are consistent with the results obtained from theoretical equations of conservation of momentum the second test was based on the work of gondret et al 2002 where they experimentally investigated the bouncing motion of spheres in different fluids in one of their tests they threw a teflon sphere with a radius of 3 m m and a density of 2 15 x 10 3 k g m 3 into a 10 c m x 10 c m x 30 c m glass tank filled with air and record its trajectory along with its velocity in time they use a micropump to release the sphere which induces an initial velocity of 0 58 m s e c during their tests they had not observed significant rotation with this device when releasing the spheres they also reported that the air friction has negligible impact and the measured coefficient of restitution i e e in equations 24 and 25 was 0 80 0 02 and almost remained the same after every bounce we simulated their experiment with our model and comparisons of the sphere trajectory and velocity in time are presented in fig 4 a and b as indicated by these figures the developed collision model can reproduce the recorded trajectory as well as the post collision velocities perfectly for the entire duration of the experiment both spatially and temporally overall the model s performance in this experiment along with our own tests based on the idealized collisions was exceptional and verified the validity of the collision model 2 4 equations of ship motion the traditional approach to express ship motion is with two reference frames to define the equations of motion one is the fixed to earth frame o x y z that may coincide with the origin of the computational grid and the other is a body fixed frame o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 which moves and rotates with the ship for surface vessels the most commonly adopted position for the body fixed frame is on the center of gravity cg of the ship which gives hull symmetry about the x0 z0 plane and approximate symmetry about the y0 z0 plane while the origin of the z0 axis is relative to the still water surface price and bishop 1974 in the standard notation given in sname society of naval and maritime engineers 1950 and ittc international towing tank conference 1975 the variables describing the position and orientation of a ship are defined relative to the inertial earth fixed frame and the coordinates are noted as x y z t and φ θ ψ t on the other hand the linear u v w t and angular p q r t velocities forces x y z t and moments k m n t are expressed in body fixed coordinate system here we can define two vectors one of which represents the position orientation eqn 26 with respect to earth fixed coordinate system whilst the other expresses the linear angular velocities of eqn 30 according to the body fixed frame consequently the rate of change of the position orientation vector can be obtained using the relation given in eqn 31 26 n x y z φ θ ψ t 27 ν u v w p q r t 28 n r n ν where r n is a transformation matrix based on the euler angles φ θ ψ given as in fossen 1994 29 r n r 1 φ θ ψ 0 3 x 3 0 3 x 3 r 2 φ θ ψ 30 r 1 φ θ ψ cos ψ cos θ sin ψ cos φ cos ψ sin θ sin φ sin ψ sin φ cos ψ cos φ sin θ sin ψ cos θ cos ψ cos φ sin φ sin θ sin ψ cos ψ sin φ sin θ sin ψ cos φ sin θ cos θ sin φ cos θ cos φ 31 r 2 φ θ ψ 1 sin φ tan θ cos φ tan θ 0 cos φ sin θ 0 sin φ cos θ cos φ cos θ then following newton s second law the equations of motion of the vessel with respect to the body fixed coordinate system can be written in the vector form as 32 m ν f ν ν n where m represents the mass and inertia matrix due to the rigid body dynamics and f is all the forces arising due to flow or the motion of the hull in water generally in comparison to the other motions pitch and heave are neglected for conventional ships which leaves us with 4 degrees of freedom dof surge sway yaw and roll e g perez and blanke 2002 skejic and faltinsen 2008 as an initial assumption the ship motion is restricted in the horizontal plane thus the roll motion is also ignored in this study subsequently the equations of motion in 3 dof surge sway and yaw are expressed as 33 m u v r x h u l l f x c m v u r y h u l l f y c i z z r n h u l l n w a v e where m is the mass and i z z is the moment of inertia of the vessel the external forces acting on the hull due to movement of the vessel and the flow passing through will be described in more detail below the hull forces are the sum of all the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the hull they are also called the hydrodynamic derivatives and appear in the series expansion of the hull forces 34 x h u l l x u u x u u u 2 x r u r u where x u f x u x u u 2 f x u 2 x r u 2 f x r u the above coefficients represent a different component of the inertia forces for instance x u means the force in x o direction due to the acceleration u in x o direction and so forth but due to blind expansion of the series higher order non linear derivatives do also appear and the basic difficulty in this type of analysis is to determine the values of these nonlinear coefficients for each hull shape and vessel type morgan 1978 following newton s second law which states that the hull forces depend linearly on the acceleration only we retain the first order acceleration terms and neglect the cross derivatives including both velocities and accelerations fossen 1994 consequently in this study only the linear inertia terms are kept the first terms are the added mass and inertia terms arising due to the motion of the fluid associated with the accelerations produced by the ship which also reflects the build up of the kinetic energy of the fluid as the hull moves furthermore the first order viscous damping terms are also important especially in the case of free motions where the vessel drifts bandyk and beck 2009 the resulting equations of motion are 35 x h u l l x u u y v v r x v r v r y h u l l y v v x u u r n h u l l n r r in the above equation the terms with coefficients x u y v and n r are the forces due to added mass and inertia some common methods in estimating these hydrodynamic parameters include cfd modeling or running controlled laboratory experiments and deriving the coefficients by the analysis of the acquired data blanke and jansen 1997 if equations 33 and 35 are merged and arranged they can be expressed in the matrix form as a u b where the matrix and the vectors are 36 m x u 0 0 0 m y v 0 0 0 i z z n r u v r m y v x v r v r f x c m x u u r f y c n w a v e f x c and f y c are the external forces due to flow and they are calculated using empirical relations and n w a v e is the torque generated by f x c and f y c the governing equations to determine the transverse and longitudinal forces arising from the tsunami currents on vessels are acquired from u s army corps of engineers report 2005 on mooring line design guidelines the approach is intended to be first order and thus differential loads are not treated in this phase of the analysis these equations have also been employed by keen et al 2017 and found to be sufficient tsunami load estimates the static transverse drag force f y c acting on the vessel is calculated using 37 f y c 0 5 ρ w l w l t c y c v c v c sin θ c where f y c transverse current force n ρ w mass density of water k g m 3 v c current velocity m s l w l vessel waterline length m t average vessel draft m c y c transverse current force drag coefficient and θ c incident current angle degrees the drag coefficient c y c which includes the effects of water depth and vessel s underkeel is given by 38 c y c c 0 c 1 c 0 t d 2 in eqn 38 d is the water depth c 1 is shallow water current force drag coefficient with the recommended value of 3 2 c 1 3 2 the deep water drag coefficient c 0 can be obtained by 39 c 0 0 22 x 40 x l w l 2 a m b v where x dimensionless ship parameter a m immersed cross sectional area of the ship midsection m 2 b beam of the vessel v submerged volume of the ship m 3 unlike transverse loads the order of magnitude of the skin friction competes with the longitudinal form drag for streamlined vessels therefore both types of drag forces have to be considered while calculating the total static longitudinal current forces neglecting the propeller forces the longitudinal drag is given by 41 f x c f x f o r m f x f r i c where 42 f x f o r m 0 5 ρ w b t c x c b v c v c c o s θ c 43 f x f r i c 0 5 ρ w s c x c a v c v c c o s θ c in eqns 42 and 43 c x c b is longitudinal current form drag coefficient and equals to 1 c x c b 1 and c x c a and s are the longitudinal skin friction coefficient and wetted surface area m 2 respectively here these parameters are estimated using 44 s 1 7 t l w l d t γ w 45 c x c a 0 075 log 10 r n 2 2 where γ w is specific weight of water and r n is the reynolds number and for vessels it is computed using eqn 46 46 r n v c l w l cos θ c ν finally the yaw moment n w a v e can be calculated as the sum of the torque created due to eccentricity x y of the lateral and longitudinal drag forces 47 n w a v e f x c y f y c x 2 4 1 time integration method equation of ship motion eq 36 is discretized using first

outlined below and summarized in the flowchart shown in fig 5 assuming that all the dependent variables u v η p o u j v j x j y j in the hydrodynamic model and ship transport model are known at t t n 1 calculate the free surface elevation η and depth averaged flow velocities u v at t t n 1 in the hydrodynamic model 2 pass u v η to ship transport model to calculate hydrodynamic forces and moments and surge u j sway v j velocities along with the rate of yaw r j for each ship subsequently then update position of each ship x j y j temporarily for t t n 1 3 pass u j v j r j x j y j to the collision model and search for any collisions that occurred either between ships or ships and land 4 if there are not any collisions detected then skip to step 6 5 if collisions are detected sort them in order of occurrence and calculate impact forces calculate variables for each ship using impact forces from step 3 at t t n 1 6 update the pressure field p o at t t n 1 7 update all the dependent variables in hydrodynamic and ship transport models 8 return step 1 and repeat the procedure for the next time step 3 validation of most 3 1 advancing moving pressure disturbance the wave train created by a traveling ship consists of a long leading bow wave and a trailing long hull wave and a series of diverging waves in between physically these diverging waves are short and dispersive note that the nonlinear shallow water equations with their lack of the relevant dispersion terms cannot produce the free surface generated by the ship where dispersion is important hence only the leading bow wave in front and the stern wave behind the vessel can be produced adequately by an nsw model like the one employed in this study however the main purpose of this study as mentioned earlier is to capture features such as the acceleration deceleration eddies generated due to flow interaction with the ship hull rather than focusing on the waves generated by vessels nonetheless to assess the model s performance in producing the leading bow wave and thus the general process of flow vessel interaction our model results are compared to numerical results published in ertekin et al 1986 er86 hereafter er86 presents a numerical method to solve dispersive rotational inviscid green naghdi equations green and naghdi 1976 in three dimensions to model the solitons preceding moving disturbances e g ships in long basins er86 presents results from tests conducted for froude numbers of 0 7 0 9 1 and 1 2 they observed that solitons were generated in cases when f r 1 2 traveling upstream faster than the moving pressure distribution a quantitative evaluation of the present model performance with respect to er86 model is given in fig 6 in which free surface elevations generated by most are compared to er86 data for a disturbance moving upstream at critical velocity i e f r 1 from fig 6a it can be seen that the leading crest produced by most provides good agreement with er86 results both the wave amplitude and the phase are captured reasonably well however most results with the first trough start to show phase errors and diverge from er86 data this difference is particularly clear after the second wave and can be attributed to the lack of dispersion and numerical breaking in most free surface elevations are further compared at a later time for the same case in fig 6b although it can be argued that the crest elevations of the leading waves look similar the wave profiles are significantly different in er86 data it is apparent that the solitons are formed and separated from the pressure disturbance whereas in most the leading crest gets longer and with a steep breaking front there is waviness in the depression region in both models but the profiles do not match this difference is somewhat expected due to the high nonlinearity of the leading wave in er86 model as the ratio of wave amplitude a to water depth h 0 is around 0 5 dean and dalrymple 1991 which can be handled numerically by a fully nonlinear dispersive model whereas the leading solitary wave is transformed into a breaking bore in the non dispersive most simulation on the other hand lee et al 1989 state that during their laboratory experiments they also have observed breaking of the leading waves when the peak pressure variable p max according to the formulation of er86 of the disturbance was greater than 0 15 although the numerical results in er86 do not indicate that here we must note that the main purpose of this exercise is to assess whether the pressure gradient terms are implemented correctly within the numerical stencil of most therefore we are not concerned about the discrepancy between er86 and our model that appears at the later stages of the simulation fig 6b as the aim of this study is not to model ship generated waves 3 2 benchmark case in openfoam a benchmark test was set up using an open source cfd software openfoam to assess the proposed model s ability to generate the wake field behind a floating object for an idealized and simplified case as openfoam retains numerous solvers that can address a wide variety of cfd problems ihfoam was selected to be used for this benchmark problem ihfoam is a two phase incompressible fluid solver based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations using the volume of fluid vof method and offers realistic wave generation and absorption boundary conditions higuera et al 2014 the governing equations of ihfoam are given by 49 u i x i 0 50 ρ u i x i u j ρ u i x i g i x j ρ x j μ e f f x j u i x j p x i where u i is the velocity vector i e u i u v w g is the gravitation acceleration and p is the dynamic excess pressure additionally μ e f f is the effective coefficient of viscosity which combines the effects of dynamic molecular viscosity and viscous diffusion and or dissipation due to turbulence in the flow μ e f f μ ρ ν t u r b the dynamic viscosity of water is μ 1 e 3 k g m s while the additional viscosity due to turbulence ν t u r b is estimated based on the selected turbulence model in openfoam here we use a k ω sst model menter 1994 this second order diffusion dissipation term is one of the key differences between openfoam and most when it comes to physics included in the underlying theory of the models in simulations where turbulence controlled features such as large eddies and wakes are generated in the flow the significance of these terms gets large kim et al 2009 therefore openfoam is expected to provide results closer to reality and sets a practical benchmark to assess the performance of most following the modifications made to include vessels into calculations the test was conducted in a 10 m long and 2 m wide shallow tank where a floating block is placed in the center of the channel fig 7 the block does not move from its initial location a steady upstream flow discharged into the tank where the water is initially at rest with a depth averaged velocity u of 0 1 m s the water depth h 0 in the tank was 0 05 m which translates into r e 50000 r e u l ν where l is the distance from edge of the block to tank wall 0 5 m and f r 0 15 f r u g h 0 the floating block was 2 m in length and 1 m wide with a draft of 0 04 m the draft to water depth ratio d h o of the block is 0 8 since the block remains immersed during the entire simulation the generated wake in most was generated through gradients in the pressure and stress to account for the skin friction shear of the block a manning s n value of 0 12 was used at the block compared to a value of 0 03 away from the block last but not least the velocities predicted by openfoam is also depth averaged across the vertical layers to be consistent with most outputs uniform inflow condition along with the geometry used are intentionally specified rather simplistic to better assess the influence of modifications made to most even with this simple setup flow gets quite complex due to rapidly varying flow speed as it passes the object additionally the wake region generated behind the object is driven by the flow passing from both sides as well as under the block these conditions do also lead to a vertical mixing layer which further contributes to the complexity of the flow state in the lee side of the object the vorticity ω z u field maps and swirl strength λ c i of the vortices are compared in fig 9 and fig 9 respectively swirl strength conveys the local frequency of the rotation t 2 π λ c i and can be calculated for the vortices that experience swirling motion by using the local velocity gradient tensor given in 9 51 d 2 d u x u y v x v y the tensor given in eqn 9 has either two real eigenvalues or pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues adrian et al 2000 the swirl strength λ c i is zero unless the vortex undergoes swirling motion otherwise λ c i is equal to the imaginary part of the complex conjugate pair the difference between vorticity and the swirl strength is that the shear layers are excluded in the latter so the boundaries defined by the λ c i 0 contain only the core of the vortex adrian et al 2000 from figs 8 and 9 it can be seen that at early times models show similar behavior the flow starts to separate from the right and left tips of the block at around t 10 s the separation regions grow as the flow supplies momentum through the gaps at the sides of the block two symmetric eddies with positive and negative vorticities are generated on the right and the left corners respectively of the block most captures the generation of the eddies well at this initial stage when compared to openfoam as the flow progresses the eddies are carried away from the block until they detach by t 20 s as vortices are advected downstream after t 20 s the energy becomes more concentrated near the channel center in most whereas the energy is more diffused in openfoam this becomes more apparent as time evolves and the vortices in openfoam spread in space faster than their counterparts in most also smaller eddies appear starting from t 30 s in most which don t merge with the main vortices and spread towards the downstream in an erratic fashion these differences are most readily attributed to lesser eddy diffusion away from the block in most as compared to openfoam in openfoam the structure of the eddies is more consistent less high wavenumber energy while their energy consistently decays due to viscous dissipation until the end of the simulation this major and main difference among the two models is expressed distinctly in fig 10 where maximum vorticity fields from most and openfoam simulations as well as the absolute a b s ω m o s t ω o p e n f o a m and relative ω m o s t ω o p e n f o a m ω o p e n f o a m x 100 differences of two are plotted in most the maximum vorticity is mainly confined in the area marked by the red dashed lines in fig 10a the boundaries of this region defined by the smaller eddies traveling downstream in fact their streaks are conspicuous in fig 10a on the other hand the maximum vorticity field from openfoam postulates a more homogenous behavior fig 10b and vortices eventually expand into the entire downstream region beyond the red dashed lines that is why the relative difference in maximum vorticities fig 10d is always negative and goes up 100 outside of the red lines contrary to inside when we evaluate the difference in vorticity field between two in absolute terms it ranges from 0 2 1 s to 1 0 1 s locally fig 10c but the range of the relative difference is more significant and goes up to 100 at some locations as can be seen in fig 10d inside the area enclosed by the black polygons where the wake region behind the object mainly develops there is a hotspot at x 6 5 m fig 10d this hotspot occurs where the cores of the main vortices in most settle and it is completely expected considering the fact that the energy is concentrated mainly in the center of these as opposed to their counterparts in openfoam fig 8 and leading to the substantial difference in maximum vorticities being observed here yet the rest of the area inside the black polygons experiences a relative difference 25 some other local high discrepancy regions arise after x 7 m due to smaller eddies converging into the centerline lastly we use the circulation growth of the vortices as a metric to compare the two models fig 11 the circulation corresponds to the sum of the vorticity in an enclosed surface s and can be approximated as the discrete sum of the vorticity of each cell inside the surface mimeau and mortavazi 2021 krueger 2005 52 γ v o r t e x ω z d s d x d y i 1 n j 1 m ω i j x j y i i 1 n j 1 m the total circulation is evaluated only inside the domain enclosed by the blue polygon shown in fig 11a due to axisymmetric flow and the circulation growth in both models is compared in fig 11b the rate of circulation growth in both models is consistent until t 30 s indicating that most can produce the same amount of vorticity as in openfoam which is also evident in fig 8 despite spatial differences however the circulation growth starts to slow down after this time in most particularly due to smaller eddies leaving the blue polygon conversely in openfoam total circulation keeps growing steadily until t 50 s until the circulation supply ends by then the vortices already cover a broad area than the ones in most beyond the red dashed lines shown in fig 10b lastly if we take a look at the amount maximum total circulation reached during the simulation in each model is compared it is about 20 less in most than openfoam 0 150 m 2 s and 0 185 m 2 s respectively the difference in the coherence and the growth of the vortices observed between the two models can be explained by the lack of a viscous turbulence model in most that provides horizontal and vertical mixing therefore most cannot generate a stable wake region in this scale after about the midpoint of the simulations however despite these differences given the limitations of most due to its relatively simple shallow water wave theory these comparisons show its ability to provide reasonable realization for energetic flow passing a floating object in a computationally cheaper way additionally it is found that the impact of these differences is subtle in the geophysical scale lynett et al 2014 4 results and discussion of large scale applications the developed model was tested in two locations for two different tsunamis in the first test the effects of a hypothetical tsunami arising from alaska aleutians subduction zone was investigated for the ships moored in port of long beach the purpose of this analysis was to see if the presence of vessels within the port changes the flow field created by the tsunami and if so does the variation intensify as the number of the ships in and around the terminal increases then another experiment was conducted based on the post tsunami data collected after the 2011 tohoku tsunami in port of ishinomaki japan based on a personal communication with japanese researchers in april 2018 it has been found out that a container ship broke free off its moorings and was pulled out of the terminal by the currents during the event a realization of this event was made using the developed transport model based on the best estimates of the vessel s draft location and release time at the time of the incident however the values of these parameters cannot be known precisely before the incident therefore a sensitivity analysis was also performed based on this case to see the effects of the initial choice of these parameters on the predicted behavior of the vessel in these experiments the ships were approximated as ellipses and the pressure disturbances therefore were defined as elliptic gaussian functions given by eqn 53 the coefficients c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the shape parameters that define the width and the length of the gaussian as well as the ship s alignment with respect

regions for california in recent history there had been three remarkable tsunamigenic earthquakes the 8 2 mw 1946 aleutian islands johnson and satake 1997 8 6 mw 1957 andreanof islands johnson et al 1994 and 9 2 mw 1964 prince william sound kanamori 1970 earthquakes each of these earthquakes were followed by tsunamis in the pacific which all impacted california more recently tsunami hazard assessment study of kalligeris et al 2017 showed that aasz poses the greatest tsunami hazard potential for california among all the subduction zones along the pacific rim the source characteristics of the hypothetical tsunami scenario considered in this study are based on the 1964 earthquake but it is located to the west of the 1964 rupture to increase the energy beamed towards california the estimated rupture area is 700 km long and 100 km wide with an average slip of 25 m overall the source corresponds to a magnitude 9 2 earthquake the details of the earthquake source parameters of this event were given by barberopoulou et al 2011 based on this tsunami scenario two different simulations are set up focusing on the port of long beach in the first test only one ship was placed within the port while the second case had eight identical ships located in and around the port the parameters of the ships considered in this part of the analysis is given in table 1 additionally the results from these two simulations were compared with a baseline simulation where no ships were present to see the extent of the variations in the flow field induced by the vessels a nested grid was established for these cases to propagate the tsunami waves from aleutians alaska subduction zone to the port of long beach here the grid size δ x of the innermost computation grid was set to 5 m resolve the vessels sufficiently in this final level of the nested grids the simulations were run for 10 h of tsunami action the results of these two sets of simulations were compared in fig 12 with the plots showing the current speeds estimated 100 min after the first arrival of the tsunami to the port when only one ship was included the difference in the flow fields compared to the baseline simulation were local and relatively weak whilst the larger eddy generated at the center of the terminal in the baseline simulation also appeared in the one ship case with a slight shift in south the variations outside the terminal are negligible on the other hand in the multi ship case the disparities in the predicted flow fields became more profound both in and out of the terminal the flow patterns were altered drastically as it has been put forward earlier the presence of the vessels has a considerable impact on the flow fields not only near the vicinity of vessels but also at a broader area in and out of the terminal as can be seen from the plots given in the left panel of fig 12 which intensifies with the number of ships included in the analysis 4 2 incident of c s victory in ishinomaki harbor during 2011 tohoku tsunami like the rest of the tohoku coast the ishinomaki region in miyagi prefecture was hit hard by the 2011 tohoku tsunami in ishinomaki city only 4000 casualties were reported 20 000 houses were completely destroyed and entire port facilities were flooded takagi and bricker 2014 the c s viceroy a 177 m long bulk carrier was moored inside the ishinomaki harbor at the time of the tsunami a personal communication with dr tatsuya asai revealed that approximately 66 min after the earthquake around 16 00 jst the ship broke all its moorings and started to drift freely inside the terminal until it was carried out of the port by the tsunami a realization of this incident is depicted here using the dimensions and the physical properties of the vessel that are listed in table 2 since the precise draft of the ship at the time of the incident is unknown in this analysis it was taken as 7 5 m the midpoint of the minimum and maximum possible draft the tsunami waves were brought to ishinomaki port through a nested grid system where the final grid has the horizontal resolution of 5 m the duration of the simulations in this innermost grid was 5 h initially the c s viceroy was placed to the mooring spot in the terminal where it was thought to be moored when the tsunami had arrived since the mooring lines were not included in this study the vessel s motion had been restricted in the model for the first 66 min of the simulation then it was released and let drift freely with the tsunami currents until the end of the run snapshots of the simulation showing the motion of the vessel as well as the tsunami current fields taken at the different times of the simulation after the ship was released are illustrated in fig 13 the figure shows that the speed of the tsunami currents entering to the terminal where the ship was residing about 3 m s around t 60 mins this was approximately the time when the ship broke its mooring lines a large eddy formed near the ship shortly after which pulled it away from the berth and carried it south near the terminal entrance at around t 90 mins the next tsunami surge has arrived and pushed the ship back in after drifting and spinning with the flow in the port until t 150 mins finally it was taken out of the harbor and brought to the southern boundary of the computational domain however as briefly discussed earlier these parameters were in fact unknown a priori also during the preliminary analysis it has been noticed that if these parameters are changed in the beginning of the simulation then the ship can follow a different path therefore based on this observation a sensitivity analysis was performed to better understand the role of the initial choice of these free parameters in model outputs the release time draft and the initial location of the vessel in addition to the drag coefficient for the lateral current loading c y c were selected for the sensitivity analysis while in general the release time depends on the resultant forces on the hull along with the capacity of the vessel s mooring lines the draft is determined by the total load cargo fuel similarly the exact location of the vessel is an unknown and moving the center of mass even by 1 2 grid points corresponds to 5 10 m of physical distance in the model which can also lead to significant changes in exerted current forces the drag coefficient c y c is calculated empirically by eqn 38 which was derived by curve fitting to experimental date and aimed to be used by engineers the coefficient can vary depending on the hull shape and the flow conditions and therefore was included into this sensitivity analysis the release time varied between 55 min and 95 min with 1 min increments while the draft was increased by 0 1 m at each trial from 6 1 to 9 m the initial center of mass moved 20 m laterally and longitudinally which adds up to 16 trials and the drag coefficient ranged from 1 to 2 5 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in fig 14 where all the paths calculated by the model for different initial values of different parameters after 5 h long simulations are shown the figure tells that the model s outputs are very sensitive to the initial choice of parameters and even small changes in the release time draft initial location and the drag coefficient lead to remarkably different trajectories these results indicate that the process is indeed random as no apparent trends or patterns can be identified from the figure although the model is capable of predicting the path of vessels for a given set of input parameter unfortunately the randomness associated with the selection of the initial conditions implies that a single simulation deterministic approach for large vessel motion should be used qualitatively nonetheless the new insights offered by this study can aid the efforts to design ports that are resilient to tsunamis and provide guidance particularly to stakeholders in coastal communities during their disaster mitigation planning as the hypothetical case from polb suggests the presence of ships can change the flow conditions significantly within a port and they should be included in the simulations during tsunami hazard studies especially deep draft vessels interfere with the flow and neglecting them in analyses can lead to underestimation of tsunami hazard in mooring locations hence a first order hazard assessment by utilizing the model presented here safe mooring spots within a port can be identified more accurately to plan to reduce the exposure to hazardous conditions as well as maintaining upgrading the structures infrastructure to help so which overall can expand the harbor s ability to resist damage 5 conclusions in this paper a collision and transport model were developed to predict the motion of large vessels within a port under the influence of strong currents generated by a tsunami the transport module and the hydrodynamic solver are fully coupled which allows flow and vessels to interact with each other this aspect was ignored in earlier attempts and indeed is the key feature of this study considering the ratio of the draft of the large vessels 8 10 m to the typical depths in ports 10 15 m the interaction between the flow and the vessels is important therefore for accurate representation of the flow field in the presence of the vessels consideration of their interaction is crucial the vessels were included into the hydrodynamic computations as free surface pressure distributions which also accounted for the form drag that the flow experiences due to vessels additionally the bottom stress term was modified locally at the grid points where the pressure gradient was non zero to include effect of the skin friction then the capability of the modified hydrodynamic model was assessed first using the data provided in er86 where the waves generated by the moving pressure disturbances had been investigated it has been found that the model can sufficiently capture the amplitude and the phase of the leading wave for the pressure disturbances moving at the critical speed furthermore the model was tested for the case when the flow passes a floating object and the results were compared to a numerical benchmark test created in openfoam with the modifications made most captured the generation separation and the advection of the eddies generated in the lee of the floating block deftly when compared to the results obtained in openfoam the transport model was based on the linear equations of motion and only three degrees of freedom are considered surge sway and the yaw added mass and the first order damping terms were included as the restoring hull forces but the forces imposed by the ship s controls thrusters and rudders were not the reasoning behind this is the reports from past incidents emphasizing that once the vessel is picked up by the flow the ship s controls are of limited assistance in taking back the ship under control thus the forces due to currents were the only sources of the external loading moreover the present model was also equipped with a built in collision solver founded on the concept of the conservation of momentum and impulse it can detect and evaluate the collisions between two or more vessels as well as the collisions that take place between the vessels and the port structures in the first test the effects of a hypothetical tsunami arising from alaska aleutians subduction zone was investigated for ships moored in the port of long beach two different setups have been investigated here one with a single ship moored within the port and another with eight ships placed in and around the port then the results from these two simulations were compared with the baseline simulation where no vessels were included this analysis revealed that the flow in and around the vessels is indeed affected by the vessels and this gets intensified as the number of the vessels increases and this should be considered in analysis for disaster mitigation planning the last large scale test was based on an incident reported in ishinomaki port japan that happened during the 2011 tohoku tsunami in this incident a 180 m long bulk carrier broke its mooring approximately 65 min after the first arrival of the tsunami and was taken out of the port after spinning and drifting freely inside the port first a realization of this event was simulated using the developed transport model and then a sensitivity analysis has been performed to see the effects of the parameters that cannot be known precisely before the incident the results from these analyses showed that the model is capable of estimating the ship s path for certain combinations of input parameters but at the same time the model results are very sensitive to the initial choice of the input parameters credit authorship

20434,this paper describes a model developed to predict the general behavior of large vessels under energetic tsunami conditions using established regional scale tsunami models the methodology is based on a two way coupled approach to account for the interaction between vessels and flow which becomes increasingly important in restricted waters a shallow water hydrodynamic solver is modified to include vessels as horizontal pressure distributions and friction coefficients are adjusted accordingly at the locations of vessels to account for the effects of skin friction adequacy of these modifications are then tested against a benchmark case designed in openfoam and comparisons demonstrate the modified shallow water solver s ability to provide a reasonable realization for energetic flow passing a floating object a vessel transport model coupled with the hydrodynamic solver is based on the linear equations of ship motion with three degrees of freedom surge sway and the yaw finally the model is equipped with a collision solver founded on the concept of the conservation of momentum and impulse results from two large scale applications of the developed tool are presented these analyses revealed that the flow in and around the ports is indeed strongly affected by the presence of vessels also it is observed that the model can approximate the ship s behavior but at the same time the model results are very sensitive to the initial choice of the input parameters due to the chaotic nature of the process keywords tsunami currents cfd shallow water equations transport coupling ports 1 introduction with the growth of the maritime industry the sizes of the container ships and the amount of cargo transported with them have greatly increased over the last 60 years borrero et al 2015a b as the latest tele tsunamis have demonstrated maritime communities are particularly vulnerable to the effects of tsunami induced currents we have seen that even when there is no or little inundation the currents generated by tsunami surges can potentially cause significant damage to maritime facilities lynett et al 2012 2014 2014 these observations have led to new questions regarding the adverse effects of tsunamis these unwanted and often un avoidable effects can range from small damage to vessels and infrastructure to the complete destruction of harbors wilson et al 2012 2013 dengler et al 2008 over the past few years unfavorable nearshore effects of tsunami induced currents from far field sources have been reported from many locations around the world several incidents occurred during the 2004 indian ocean tsunami and were documented in detail by okal et al 2006a 2006b 2006c the most astounding of these events took place in port of salalah oman where an approximately 300 m long container ship broke all its twelve mooring lines due to strong currents generated near the loading berth the vessel drifted on the currents spinning uncontrollably for hours both in and around the harbor until the vessel beached on a sandbar outside of the port there was not any overland flooding or inundation in the port of salalah as the maximum tsunami amplitude during the event was about 1 5 m however the currents generated locally by the relatively small tsunami were strong enough to pull the large container ship off the dock the currents near the vessel were estimated to be around 4 5 m s by numerical simulations of the event lynett et al 2012 in the wake of the indian ocean tsunami a similar instance was also reported in leport réunion island a 196 m container ship the msc uruguay broke all its mooring lines and drifted inside the harbor striking and damaging gantry cranes on a nearby dock okal et al 2006b likewise in the port of toamasina madagascar a 50 m freighter wandered through the harbor for nearly 3 h after breaking its moorings okal et al 2006c all these incidents occurred well after the arrival of the tsunami that was described as not flooding the port facilities this is important to consider because practitioners without specific experience in tsunami hydrodynamics may stop computations shortly after the maximum runup of the first or second wave is reached eddies can persist for days and this makes computations more unreliable as numerical errors can accumulate the tohoku tsunami that was triggered by the great tohoku oki earthquake mw 9 0 was documented quite well through comprehensive observations and instrumental measurements although current speed measurements were not widespread along the pacific rim there are a few data sets available in the extreme near field fritz et al 2012 analyzed the videos recorded by two eyewitnesses in kesennuma japan to determine tsunami current speeds their analysis revealed that the current speeds in kesennuma bay reached up to 11 m s making navigation impossible however in the far field harbors and bays in the hawaii islands cheung et al 2013 several harbors in new zealand borrero et al 2013 lynett et al 2012 and some harbors in the galapagos islands including the largest port of the country puerto ayora lynett et al 2013 also experienced strong currents and damage related to these currents even though the incoming tsunami heights were relatively small the assessment of seakeeping and maneuverability of large vessels has always been of high interest to researchers whether they are in unrestricted water depth draft of the ship waters or in ports and canals where they are restricted in both depth and breadth however recent incidents in ports as described above show that the maneuvering capabilities of vessels can become very limited when they are captured by strong currents and within eddies in particular the vessels that break free and drift off in and around the port during tsunamis generally exhibit apparently random behavior and thus poses a great risk of impact hazard to the port therefore we concern ourselves in this work with reports of large vessels that go out of control in and around ports under hazardous conditions caused by tsunamis to develop mitigation plans for these situations we can rely on numerical modeling yet the first order approaches where the flow and object transport are decoupled would not be sufficient in these cases the reason being is that in shallow and or restricted waters e g narrow waterways ports harbors bays the ratio of vessel draft to water depth approaches 1 this in essence leads to reduced effective flow depth and accelerated current speeds near vessels which consequently increases the current force acting on the hull nonetheless this interaction should be accounted for while developing models for this matter although it was ignored in most of the earlier published efforts e g tomita and honda 2011 sakakibara et al 2010 kobayashi et al 2011 that study large vessel motion during tsunamis to address this issue here we present a large vessel transport model that is two way coupled with a hydrodynamic numerical model allowing the interaction between the flow and vessel the hydrodynamic parameters come from a shallow water solver the application of the method of splitting tsunami most numerical model titov and synolakis 1998 although the sophistication of most initially may not seem sufficient for this problem its computational efficiency in geophysical scale o k m over higher order boussinesq type e g kim et al 2009 shi et al 2012 or non hydrostatic solvers e g ma et al 2012 and as well as its proven accuracy in modeling tsunami induced currents lynett et al 2014 kalligeris et al 2015 alludes it as the ideal tool aside from eulerian based methods models solving incompressible or weakly compressible versions of navier stokes equations in a lagrangian framework like smoothed particles hydrodynamics sph are becoming popular in an attempt to deal with fluid structure interaction various studies e g wu et al 2016 rakhska et al 2019 zhan et al 2019 sun et al 2021 and references therein employ sph in 3d to model flows interacting with different objects of varying sizes although all these models demonstrate that they can capture the flow structure interaction accurately with a great level of detail they mainly concern with very small length scales o m additionally the accuracy of sph models depends heavily on the resolution which increases the number of particles to be included in the calculations drastically and eventually it gets impractical to utilize sph for larger scale objectives due to high computational demand unlike numerically expensive 3d models when modeling the wood transport during flash floods ruiz villanueva et al 2014a 2014b also utilized a 2d hydraulic solver and included the feedback from the wood logs into hydrodynamic calculations by adding the drag force acting on woods as a source term to the momentum equations more recently xiong et al 2020 presented a coupled transport model in 1d where they employed discrete element modeling dem method to calculate forces on debris particles they also achieved fluid particle coupling by adding forces exerted on the debris back into momentum equation in this study instead of adding the reactive forces to momentum equations we introduce vessels as pressure disturbances into the hydrodynamic calculations to attain flow vessel interactions which accounts for the form drag produced by their presence in the flow furthermore we manipulate manning s coefficient locally to include the impact of skin friction which becomes important when dealing with large vessels finally a collision model integrated into the coupled model to resolve collisions between vessels or vessels and port structures e g berths quays etc the motivation for this study comes from the observations discussed above and the hope to be able to provide quantitative guidance to authorities on potential vessel motions during tsunamis we however remark here that the objective of this study is to capture the general behavior of large vessels under energetic tsunami conditions using established regional scale tsunami models we explain our approach to the problem specifically the modifications made to most and how these modifications enabled most to attain the interaction between the flow and large vessels as well as its limitations along with the large vessel transport and collision models in chapter 2 small scale model validation exercises are discussed in chapter 3 and the application of the model in geophysical scale is given in chapter 4 2 methods 2 1 hydrodynamic numerical tool the most model has been used extensively for tsunami hazard assessments in the united states and is currently used for operational tsunami forecasting at the noaa pacific marine environmental laboratory pmel variants of the most model have been in constant use for tsunami hazard assessments in california since the mid 1990s titov et al 2016 most solves the classical 2

nondimensional friction coefficient related to manning s roughness coefficient n as f n 2 g h 1 3 satake 1995 more thorough information about the theoretical background and the validation of most is provided in titov and synolakis 1998 and burwell et al 2007 using the long wave assumption most approximates 3d processes with two horizontal dimension 2hd equations as a final note about the verification of the most lynett et al 2014 conducted a sensitivity analysis to understand the accuracy of most in resolving complex nearshore hydrodynamics where they have compared the most results with a high order fully nonlinear boussinesq type model coulwave and with available field data they found out that most matches the tsunami amplitude phase patterns for the first several hours and the amplitude envelope for at least 24 h after the first arrival of the tsunami likewise most can also match the current velocities extracted from eyewitness videos on average current velocities predicted by most are 10 20 higher than coulwave results which leaves most on the conservative side as a result of these observations they concluded that most was sufficiently capable of modeling tsunami induced currents using a 1 3 arcsec 10 m grid size during the 2015 chilean tsunami kalligeris et al 2016 made in situ measurements of current speeds in ventura harbor california in their comparison of most output to measured data they found that most matched the phase of the measurement well and the velocity estimates by most remain in the envelope of the measurements 2 2 inclusion of ships as pressure distributions there are several established techniques to model fluid structure interaction the immersed boundary ib method probably the most popular is discussed in peskin 2002 and has been used extensively in studies dealing with fluid structure interaction an example application of ib method is presented in ma et al 2016 where they apply this method to include fluid structure interaction in their nonhydrostatic σ coordinate model earlier last decade kamrin et al 2012 established a method called the reference map technique rmt in which both the fluid and the solid are defined in the eulerian reference frame recently bellotti and theillard 2019 integrated rmt to an incompressible navier stokes solver to model two phase flows which allows for the interaction of either two different fluids or one type of fluid with solid objects however both ib method and rmt approximate the fluid structure interaction by enforcing a no slip condition over the boundary of the solids yet this aspect of ib and rmt methods becomes a limitation in 2hd e g most models when attempting to model the interaction between the fluid and the floating objects an object with a no slip boundary condition in a 2hd model will block the flow that is supposed to pass underneath the floating object hence the essence of the problem will change in general 2hd models employ free slip conditions on solid boundaries due to their inherent inability to resolve detailed boundary layer processes due to this fact the fluid structure interaction in this study is attained through modeling vessels as free surface pressure disturbances it is a common approach to define vessels as horizontal pressure disturbances when studying waves generated by moving ships e g akylas 1984 ertekin et al 1986 liu and wu 2004 bayraktar ersan and beji 2013 david et al 2017 following approaches found in the literature we modify the momentum equations in the x and y directions in most by adding free surface pressure terms defined in the horizontal plane 5 u t u u x v u y g h x g d x d u 1 ρ p 0 x 6 v t u v x v v y g h y g d y d v 1 ρ p 0 y where p 0 x y is the free surface pressure disturbance with this pressure disturbance the initial vessel profile condition becomes u 0 v 0 η p 0 ρ g of particular interest to this study as stated earlier is to develop a model that can reasonably resolve the flow around vessels interaction of the crossflow with the vessels results in acceleration in the flow passing underneath or the wakes generated behind the vessel the interactions are primarily driven by the total drag acting on the vessel which has 2 major components i friction drag due to viscous resistance of the water ii form drag due to shape of the ship hull sorensen 1973 the effect of the form drag is accomplished by including the pressure gradient terms p x p y in the momentum equations here we further argue that the friction drag can also be approximated by increasing the shear stress locally at the grid points at which pressure gradients are non zero in the most model this local increase in stress is captured through a local increase in the manning s n parameter which attempts to account for the vessel skin friction though the amount of this local increase cannot be arbitrarily decided therefore a benchmark test designed in openfoam for calibration and model validation purposes presented in section 3 2 2 3 collision model the three main modeling challenges in a collision model are 1 the detection of the collisions 2 calculating the required post collision velocities to break the contact and 3 computing the necessary contact forces that will lead to proper changes in velocities the details of the collision detection algorithm and the collision solver that tackle these problems in a physically correct manner will be explained in this section 2 3 1 collision detection the literature in collision detection is quite rich due to significant contributions of computer graphics and robotics researchers one of the generally accepted and applied methods is called the separation axis theorem baraff 1989 gottschalk et al 1996 this technique is generic for rigid bodies defined as convex polyhedral and particularly useful if collisions between objects with arbitrary shapes are expected in a given model however in this study particularly in large scale simulations the vessels are approximated as ellipses for certain practical reasons that are described in chapter 4 this approximation in vessel shapes allowed the development of a simpler and faster but non generic algorithm for identifying collisions the collision detection algorithm starts with keeping track of the minimum distance between the objects at every time step during the simulation the minimum distance between two ellipses which are defined by n points along their boundaries such as e 1 k 1 k 2 k 3 k n and e 2 l 1 l 2 l 3 l n and can be defined as d m i n e 1 e 2 min d k i l j i j 1 2 n where d k i l j is the euclidean distance between k i and l j each point on the boundary of the ellipses is defined in cartesian coordinates as k i x i y i and l j x j y j also it must be noted that the cardinality between two ellipses is not a requirement yet it is assumed here such that to simplify the notation the collision detection algorithm works in the following steps the minimum distances between all objects are tracked at all time steps if the minimum distance between any two bodies d m i n e 1 e 2 is less than a given tolerance ε then the bodies are in colliding contact if bodies interpenetrate at time t 0 δ t fig 1 b then the time of collision t c is approximated by evaluating v r e l t 0 d m i n t 0 ε thus the time of collision t c should satisfy t o t c t o δ t once all the collisions are detected they are solved in the order of occurrence and the post collision velocities are calculated as will be discussed in the next section 2 3 2 collision solver once all the collisions are detected at a given time step and the contact point on each body is identified the resulting impact force torque and velocities of the bodies after the collision are determined one common approach for calculating the impact forces is the so called penalty method and is based on the introduction of arbitrary forces e g spring forces to separate the colliding bodies terzopolous et al 1987 although this method can generate realistic animations it is acceptable when the accuracy of the physics is relatively unimportant baraff 1989 the impact force determination can be tackled analytically using the conservation of momentum principle as will be adopted here this method has been employed in computer graphics problems widely and is proven to provide physically correct contact forces hahn 1988 moore and wilhelms 1988 baraff 1989 if the two bodies body a and body b are in contact at point p then a given point on body a denoted by p a t should satisfy p a t 0 p at the time of the contact t 0 similarly point p b t on body b will coincide p b t 0 p at time t 0 while at time t 0 p a t and p b t will overlap the velocities of these two points might be very different by evaluating the velocities of these points which will be denoted by p a t 0 and p b t 0 respectively we can determine whether these two bodies are approaching separating or in contact with each other the point velocities are given as 7 p a t 0 v a t 0 ω a t 0 p a t 0 x a t 0 8 p b t 0 v b t 0 ω b t 0 p b t 0 x b t 0 where v a v b ω a and ω b are the linear and angular velocities and x a t 0 and x b t 0 are the coordinates of the center of masses of the bodies at the time of the contact subsequently the relative velocity v r e l of the contact points with respect to each other in the direction of contact can be defined by eqn 9 9 v r e l p a t 0 p b t 0 n t 0 in the above equation n t 0 denotes the normal surface vector which provides the direction of v r e l at the contact point if v r e l is positive it means that v r e l and n t 0 are in the same direction and the bodies are moving away from each other then the contact will diminish at time t 0 δ t yet we are concerned about the case when v r e l 0 which means that the directions of the v r e l and n t 0 are opposite and the two bodies are in contact at point p to avoid an interpenetration the velocities of body a and body b should change rapidly to create such a near discontinuity in body velocities a contact force of f is exerted on the bodies for a very short instant of time δ t which leads to a new quantity called the impulse j 10 j f δ t the impulse is a vector quantity with the units of mass times acceleration applying an impulse will generate the required near instantaneous adjustment in the velocity of a body then the effect of j on the linear velocity v of a given rigid body with the mass m can be driven simply by using the relation δ v j m the impulse acting at contact point p also creates an impulsive torque of τ j computed using eqn 11 11 τ j p c x 0 t 0 j where p c is the point of contact and x 0 is the location of the center of gravity of the object at the time of the contact likewise the change in the angular velocity δ ω of the body with the yaw moment of inertia of i z z due to the impulsive torque is given by δ ω τ j i z z therefore if a collision takes place between two bodies an impulse and a resulting impulse torque will be applied to prevent them from interpenetrating since the tangential or friction forces are neglected here the direction of the impulse will be in the normal direction n t 0 fig 2 a thus the impulse j can be written as 12 j j n t 0 where j is a scalar to be calculated and gives the magnitude of the impulse the sign convention adopted here lets the impulse j act positively on body a that is a is subject to an impulse of j n t 0 while an equal but opposite impulse j n t 0 is exerted on body b fig 2b to derive the j by using an empirical law for collisions the following relations need to be provided first 13 p a 2 t 0 v a 2 t 0 ω a 2 t 0 r a along with 14 v a 2 t 0 v a 1 t 0 j n t 0 m a 15 ω a 2 t 0 ω a 1 t 0 r a j n t 0 i z z a where p a 1 t 0 and p a 2 t 0 denote the velocity of the body a before and after the impulse j is applied respectively and r a p c x a t 0 is the displacement distance also the pre collision velocities of body a are denoted with v a 1 t 0 and ω a 1 t 0 and the post collision velocities are shown by v a 2 t 0 and ω a 2 t 0 combining eqns 13 15 yields the following 16 p a 2 t 0 v a 1 t 0 j n t 0 m a ω a 1 t 0 r a j n t 0 i z z a r a 17 p a 2 t 0 v a 1 t 0 ω a 1 t 0 r a j n t 0 m a r a j n t 0 i z z a r a if we substitute eqns 10 and 11 into the above expression we have 18 p a 2 t 0 p a 1 t 0 j n t 0 m a r a n t 0 i z z a r a 19 p b 2 t 0 p b 1 t 0 j n t 0 m b r b n t 0 i z z b r b 20 p a 2 t 0 p b 2 t 0 p a 1 t 0 p b 1 t 0 j n t 0 m a n t 0 m b r a j n t 0 i z z a r a r b j n t 0 i z z b r b following eqn 9 we can also introduce v r e l 1 and v r e l 2 the pre and post impact relative velocities in the normal direction 21 v r e l 1 p a 1 t 0 p b 1 t 0 n t 0 22 v r e l 2 p a 2 t 0 p b 2 t 0 n t 0 23 v r e l 2 ε v r e l 1 where ε is the coefficient of restitution and ranges from 0 to 1 the upper limit ε 1 yields v r e l 2 v r e l 1 which means the entire kinetic energy of the system has been preserved and the collision is perfectly elastic if ε 0 then v r e l 2 0 indicating a fully inelastic collision in which bodies will stick to each other after the collision if we rewrite eqn 23 in terms of v r e l 1 v r e l 2 and j and rearrange then the expression to compute the impulse j becomes 24 j 1 ε v r e l 1 1 m a 1 m b n t 0 r a n t 0 i z z a r a n t 0 r b n t 0 i z z b r b in which m a m b are the masses and i z z a and i z z b are the yaw moment of inertias of the two colliding bodies in the case where the body collides into a non movable body like a berth wharf or another port infrastructure the terms with subscript b will vanish in eqn 24 since the mass and the inertia of an object that cannot be moved is infinitely large relative to the colliding body therefore for this type of collision eqn 24 simplifies into eqn 25 25 j 1 ε v r e l 1 1 m a n t 0 r a n t 0 i z z a r a once the impact force j is determined the post collision velocities u v and ω for each body involved in the collision can be calculated using eqns 14 and 15 to validate the ability of the collision model various benchmark experiments were produced and example snapshots of a selected case is shown in fig 3 during this test it was assumed that the collisions were perfectly elastic the case given in fig 3 was an eccentric collision that included two bodies with equal masses approaching to each other with velocities of equal magnitude of 0 1 m s post collision velocities are calculated as u 1 0 0317 m s e c v 1 0 0279 m s e c ω 1 4 512 r a d s e c for the body approaching from left and u 2 0 0316 m s e c v 2 0 0282 m s e c ω 2 4 546 r a d s e c for the one the right which are consistent with the results obtained from theoretical equations of conservation of momentum the second test was based on the work of gondret et al 2002 where they experimentally investigated the bouncing motion of spheres in different fluids in one of their tests they threw a teflon sphere with a radius of 3 m m and a density of 2 15 x 10 3 k g m 3 into a 10 c m x 10 c m x 30 c m glass tank filled with air and record its trajectory along with its velocity in time they use a micropump to release the sphere which induces an initial velocity of 0 58 m s e c during their tests they had not observed significant rotation with this device when releasing the spheres they also reported that the air friction has negligible impact and the measured coefficient of restitution i e e in equations 24 and 25 was 0 80 0 02 and almost remained the same after every bounce we simulated their experiment with our model and comparisons of the sphere trajectory and velocity in time are presented in fig 4 a and b as indicated by these figures the developed collision model can reproduce the recorded trajectory as well as the post collision velocities perfectly for the entire duration of the experiment both spatially and temporally overall the model s performance in this experiment along with our own tests based on the idealized collisions was exceptional and verified the validity of the collision model 2 4 equations of ship motion the traditional approach to express ship motion is with two reference frames to define the equations of motion one is the fixed to earth frame o x y z that may coincide with the origin of the computational grid and the other is a body fixed frame o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 which moves and rotates with the ship for surface vessels the most commonly adopted position for the body fixed frame is on the center of gravity cg of the ship which gives hull symmetry about the x0 z0 plane and approximate symmetry about the y0 z0 plane while the origin of the z0 axis is relative to the still water surface price and bishop 1974 in the standard notation given in sname society of naval and maritime engineers 1950 and ittc international towing tank conference 1975 the variables describing the position and orientation of a ship are defined relative to the inertial earth fixed frame and the coordinates are noted as x y z t and φ θ ψ t on the other hand the linear u v w t and angular p q r t velocities forces x y z t and moments k m n t are expressed in body fixed coordinate system here we can define two vectors one of which represents the position orientation eqn 26 with respect to earth fixed coordinate system whilst the other expresses the linear angular velocities of eqn 30 according to the body fixed frame consequently the rate of change of the position orientation vector can be obtained using the relation given in eqn 31 26 n x y z φ θ ψ t 27 ν u v w p q r t 28 n r n ν where r n is a transformation matrix based on the euler angles φ θ ψ given as in fossen 1994 29 r n r 1 φ θ ψ 0 3 x 3 0 3 x 3 r 2 φ θ ψ 30 r 1 φ θ ψ cos ψ cos θ sin ψ cos φ cos ψ sin θ sin φ sin ψ sin φ cos ψ cos φ sin θ sin ψ cos θ cos ψ cos φ sin φ sin θ sin ψ cos ψ sin φ sin θ sin ψ cos φ sin θ cos θ sin φ cos θ cos φ 31 r 2 φ θ ψ 1 sin φ tan θ cos φ tan θ 0 cos φ sin θ 0 sin φ cos θ cos φ cos θ then following newton s second law the equations of motion of the vessel with respect to the body fixed coordinate system can be written in the vector form as 32 m ν f ν ν n where m represents the mass and inertia matrix due to the rigid body dynamics and f is all the forces arising due to flow or the motion of the hull in water generally in comparison to the other motions pitch and heave are neglected for conventional ships which leaves us with 4 degrees of freedom dof surge sway yaw and roll e g perez and blanke 2002 skejic and faltinsen 2008 as an initial assumption the ship motion is restricted in the horizontal plane thus the roll motion is also ignored in this study subsequently the equations of motion in 3 dof surge sway and yaw are expressed as 33 m u v r x h u l l f x c m v u r y h u l l f y c i z z r n h u l l n w a v e where m is the mass and i z z is the moment of inertia of the vessel the external forces acting on the hull due to movement of the vessel and the flow passing through will be described in more detail below the hull forces are the sum of all the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the hull they are also called the hydrodynamic derivatives and appear in the series expansion of the hull forces 34 x h u l l x u u x u u u 2 x r u r u where x u f x u x u u 2 f x u 2 x r u 2 f x r u the above coefficients represent a different component of the inertia forces for instance x u means the force in x o direction due to the acceleration u in x o direction and so forth but due to blind expansion of the series higher order non linear derivatives do also appear and the basic difficulty in this type of analysis is to determine the values of these nonlinear coefficients for each hull shape and vessel type morgan 1978 following newton s second law which states that the hull forces depend linearly on the acceleration only we retain the first order acceleration terms and neglect the cross derivatives including both velocities and accelerations fossen 1994 consequently in this study only the linear inertia terms are kept the first terms are the added mass and inertia terms arising due to the motion of the fluid associated with the accelerations produced by the ship which also reflects the build up of the kinetic energy of the fluid as the hull moves furthermore the first order viscous damping terms are also important especially in the case of free motions where the vessel drifts bandyk and beck 2009 the resulting equations of motion are 35 x h u l l x u u y v v r x v r v r y h u l l y v v x u u r n h u l l n r r in the above equation the terms with coefficients x u y v and n r are the forces due to added mass and inertia some common methods in estimating these hydrodynamic parameters include cfd modeling or running controlled laboratory experiments and deriving the coefficients by the analysis of the acquired data blanke and jansen 1997 if equations 33 and 35 are merged and arranged they can be expressed in the matrix form as a u b where the matrix and the vectors are 36 m x u 0 0 0 m y v 0 0 0 i z z n r u v r m y v x v r v r f x c m x u u r f y c n w a v e f x c and f y c are the external forces due to flow and they are calculated using empirical relations and n w a v e is the torque generated by f x c and f y c the governing equations to determine the transverse and longitudinal forces arising from the tsunami currents on vessels are acquired from u s army corps of engineers report 2005 on mooring line design guidelines the approach is intended to be first order and thus differential loads are not treated in this phase of the analysis these equations have also been employed by keen et al 2017 and found to be sufficient tsunami load estimates the static transverse drag force f y c acting on the vessel is calculated using 37 f y c 0 5 ρ w l w l t c y c v c v c sin θ c where f y c transverse current force n ρ w mass density of water k g m 3 v c current velocity m s l w l vessel waterline length m t average vessel draft m c y c transverse current force drag coefficient and θ c incident current angle degrees the drag coefficient c y c which includes the effects of water depth and vessel s underkeel is given by 38 c y c c 0 c 1 c 0 t d 2 in eqn 38 d is the water depth c 1 is shallow water current force drag coefficient with the recommended value of 3 2 c 1 3 2 the deep water drag coefficient c 0 can be obtained by 39 c 0 0 22 x 40 x l w l 2 a m b v where x dimensionless ship parameter a m immersed cross sectional area of the ship midsection m 2 b beam of the vessel v submerged volume of the ship m 3 unlike transverse loads the order of magnitude of the skin friction competes with the longitudinal form drag for streamlined vessels therefore both types of drag forces have to be considered while calculating the total static longitudinal current forces neglecting the propeller forces the longitudinal drag is given by 41 f x c f x f o r m f x f r i c where 42 f x f o r m 0 5 ρ w b t c x c b v c v c c o s θ c 43 f x f r i c 0 5 ρ w s c x c a v c v c c o s θ c in eqns 42 and 43 c x c b is longitudinal current form drag coefficient and equals to 1 c x c b 1 and c x c a and s are the longitudinal skin friction coefficient and wetted surface area m 2 respectively here these parameters are estimated using 44 s 1 7 t l w l d t γ w 45 c x c a 0 075 log 10 r n 2 2 where γ w is specific weight of water and r n is the reynolds number and for vessels it is computed using eqn 46 46 r n v c l w l cos θ c ν finally the yaw moment n w a v e can be calculated as the sum of the torque created due to eccentricity x y of the lateral and longitudinal drag forces 47 n w a v e f x c y f y c x 2 4 1 time integration method equation of ship motion eq 36 is discretized using first

outlined below and summarized in the flowchart shown in fig 5 assuming that all the dependent variables u v η p o u j v j x j y j in the hydrodynamic model and ship transport model are known at t t n 1 calculate the free surface elevation η and depth averaged flow velocities u v at t t n 1 in the hydrodynamic model 2 pass u v η to ship transport model to calculate hydrodynamic forces and moments and surge u j sway v j velocities along with the rate of yaw r j for each ship subsequently then update position of each ship x j y j temporarily for t t n 1 3 pass u j v j r j x j y j to the collision model and search for any collisions that occurred either between ships or ships and land 4 if there are not any collisions detected then skip to step 6 5 if collisions are detected sort them in order of occurrence and calculate impact forces calculate variables for each ship using impact forces from step 3 at t t n 1 6 update the pressure field p o at t t n 1 7 update all the dependent variables in hydrodynamic and ship transport models 8 return step 1 and repeat the procedure for the next time step 3 validation of most 3 1 advancing moving pressure disturbance the wave train created by a traveling ship consists of a long leading bow wave and a trailing long hull wave and a series of diverging waves in between physically these diverging waves are short and dispersive note that the nonlinear shallow water equations with their lack of the relevant dispersion terms cannot produce the free surface generated by the ship where dispersion is important hence only the leading bow wave in front and the stern wave behind the vessel can be produced adequately by an nsw model like the one employed in this study however the main purpose of this study as mentioned earlier is to capture features such as the acceleration deceleration eddies generated due to flow interaction with the ship hull rather than focusing on the waves generated by vessels nonetheless to assess the model s performance in producing the leading bow wave and thus the general process of flow vessel interaction our model results are compared to numerical results published in ertekin et al 1986 er86 hereafter er86 presents a numerical method to solve dispersive rotational inviscid green naghdi equations green and naghdi 1976 in three dimensions to model the solitons preceding moving disturbances e g ships in long basins er86 presents results from tests conducted for froude numbers of 0 7 0 9 1 and 1 2 they observed that solitons were generated in cases when f r 1 2 traveling upstream faster than the moving pressure distribution a quantitative evaluation of the present model performance with respect to er86 model is given in fig 6 in which free surface elevations generated by most are compared to er86 data for a disturbance moving upstream at critical velocity i e f r 1 from fig 6a it can be seen that the leading crest produced by most provides good agreement with er86 results both the wave amplitude and the phase are captured reasonably well however most results with the first trough start to show phase errors and diverge from er86 data this difference is particularly clear after the second wave and can be attributed to the lack of dispersion and numerical breaking in most free surface elevations are further compared at a later time for the same case in fig 6b although it can be argued that the crest elevations of the leading waves look similar the wave profiles are significantly different in er86 data it is apparent that the solitons are formed and separated from the pressure disturbance whereas in most the leading crest gets longer and with a steep breaking front there is waviness in the depression region in both models but the profiles do not match this difference is somewhat expected due to the high nonlinearity of the leading wave in er86 model as the ratio of wave amplitude a to water depth h 0 is around 0 5 dean and dalrymple 1991 which can be handled numerically by a fully nonlinear dispersive model whereas the leading solitary wave is transformed into a breaking bore in the non dispersive most simulation on the other hand lee et al 1989 state that during their laboratory experiments they also have observed breaking of the leading waves when the peak pressure variable p max according to the formulation of er86 of the disturbance was greater than 0 15 although the numerical results in er86 do not indicate that here we must note that the main purpose of this exercise is to assess whether the pressure gradient terms are implemented correctly within the numerical stencil of most therefore we are not concerned about the discrepancy between er86 and our model that appears at the later stages of the simulation fig 6b as the aim of this study is not to model ship generated waves 3 2 benchmark case in openfoam a benchmark test was set up using an open source cfd software openfoam to assess the proposed model s ability to generate the wake field behind a floating object for an idealized and simplified case as openfoam retains numerous solvers that can address a wide variety of cfd problems ihfoam was selected to be used for this benchmark problem ihfoam is a two phase incompressible fluid solver based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations using the volume of fluid vof method and offers realistic wave generation and absorption boundary conditions higuera et al 2014 the governing equations of ihfoam are given by 49 u i x i 0 50 ρ u i x i u j ρ u i x i g i x j ρ x j μ e f f x j u i x j p x i where u i is the velocity vector i e u i u v w g is the gravitation acceleration and p is the dynamic excess pressure additionally μ e f f is the effective coefficient of viscosity which combines the effects of dynamic molecular viscosity and viscous diffusion and or dissipation due to turbulence in the flow μ e f f μ ρ ν t u r b the dynamic viscosity of water is μ 1 e 3 k g m s while the additional viscosity due to turbulence ν t u r b is estimated based on the selected turbulence model in openfoam here we use a k ω sst model menter 1994 this second order diffusion dissipation term is one of the key differences between openfoam and most when it comes to physics included in the underlying theory of the models in simulations where turbulence controlled features such as large eddies and wakes are generated in the flow the significance of these terms gets large kim et al 2009 therefore openfoam is expected to provide results closer to reality and sets a practical benchmark to assess the performance of most following the modifications made to include vessels into calculations the test was conducted in a 10 m long and 2 m wide shallow tank where a floating block is placed in the center of the channel fig 7 the block does not move from its initial location a steady upstream flow discharged into the tank where the water is initially at rest with a depth averaged velocity u of 0 1 m s the water depth h 0 in the tank was 0 05 m which translates into r e 50000 r e u l ν where l is the distance from edge of the block to tank wall 0 5 m and f r 0 15 f r u g h 0 the floating block was 2 m in length and 1 m wide with a draft of 0 04 m the draft to water depth ratio d h o of the block is 0 8 since the block remains immersed during the entire simulation the generated wake in most was generated through gradients in the pressure and stress to account for the skin friction shear of the block a manning s n value of 0 12 was used at the block compared to a value of 0 03 away from the block last but not least the velocities predicted by openfoam is also depth averaged across the vertical layers to be consistent with most outputs uniform inflow condition along with the geometry used are intentionally specified rather simplistic to better assess the influence of modifications made to most even with this simple setup flow gets quite complex due to rapidly varying flow speed as it passes the object additionally the wake region generated behind the object is driven by the flow passing from both sides as well as under the block these conditions do also lead to a vertical mixing layer which further contributes to the complexity of the flow state in the lee side of the object the vorticity ω z u field maps and swirl strength λ c i of the vortices are compared in fig 9 and fig 9 respectively swirl strength conveys the local frequency of the rotation t 2 π λ c i and can be calculated for the vortices that experience swirling motion by using the local velocity gradient tensor given in 9 51 d 2 d u x u y v x v y the tensor given in eqn 9 has either two real eigenvalues or pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues adrian et al 2000 the swirl strength λ c i is zero unless the vortex undergoes swirling motion otherwise λ c i is equal to the imaginary part of the complex conjugate pair the difference between vorticity and the swirl strength is that the shear layers are excluded in the latter so the boundaries defined by the λ c i 0 contain only the core of the vortex adrian et al 2000 from figs 8 and 9 it can be seen that at early times models show similar behavior the flow starts to separate from the right and left tips of the block at around t 10 s the separation regions grow as the flow supplies momentum through the gaps at the sides of the block two symmetric eddies with positive and negative vorticities are generated on the right and the left corners respectively of the block most captures the generation of the eddies well at this initial stage when compared to openfoam as the flow progresses the eddies are carried away from the block until they detach by t 20 s as vortices are advected downstream after t 20 s the energy becomes more concentrated near the channel center in most whereas the energy is more diffused in openfoam this becomes more apparent as time evolves and the vortices in openfoam spread in space faster than their counterparts in most also smaller eddies appear starting from t 30 s in most which don t merge with the main vortices and spread towards the downstream in an erratic fashion these differences are most readily attributed to lesser eddy diffusion away from the block in most as compared to openfoam in openfoam the structure of the eddies is more consistent less high wavenumber energy while their energy consistently decays due to viscous dissipation until the end of the simulation this major and main difference among the two models is expressed distinctly in fig 10 where maximum vorticity fields from most and openfoam simulations as well as the absolute a b s ω m o s t ω o p e n f o a m and relative ω m o s t ω o p e n f o a m ω o p e n f o a m x 100 differences of two are plotted in most the maximum vorticity is mainly confined in the area marked by the red dashed lines in fig 10a the boundaries of this region defined by the smaller eddies traveling downstream in fact their streaks are conspicuous in fig 10a on the other hand the maximum vorticity field from openfoam postulates a more homogenous behavior fig 10b and vortices eventually expand into the entire downstream region beyond the red dashed lines that is why the relative difference in maximum vorticities fig 10d is always negative and goes up 100 outside of the red lines contrary to inside when we evaluate the difference in vorticity field between two in absolute terms it ranges from 0 2 1 s to 1 0 1 s locally fig 10c but the range of the relative difference is more significant and goes up to 100 at some locations as can be seen in fig 10d inside the area enclosed by the black polygons where the wake region behind the object mainly develops there is a hotspot at x 6 5 m fig 10d this hotspot occurs where the cores of the main vortices in most settle and it is completely expected considering the fact that the energy is concentrated mainly in the center of these as opposed to their counterparts in openfoam fig 8 and leading to the substantial difference in maximum vorticities being observed here yet the rest of the area inside the black polygons experiences a relative difference 25 some other local high discrepancy regions arise after x 7 m due to smaller eddies converging into the centerline lastly we use the circulation growth of the vortices as a metric to compare the two models fig 11 the circulation corresponds to the sum of the vorticity in an enclosed surface s and can be approximated as the discrete sum of the vorticity of each cell inside the surface mimeau and mortavazi 2021 krueger 2005 52 γ v o r t e x ω z d s d x d y i 1 n j 1 m ω i j x j y i i 1 n j 1 m the total circulation is evaluated only inside the domain enclosed by the blue polygon shown in fig 11a due to axisymmetric flow and the circulation growth in both models is compared in fig 11b the rate of circulation growth in both models is consistent until t 30 s indicating that most can produce the same amount of vorticity as in openfoam which is also evident in fig 8 despite spatial differences however the circulation growth starts to slow down after this time in most particularly due to smaller eddies leaving the blue polygon conversely in openfoam total circulation keeps growing steadily until t 50 s until the circulation supply ends by then the vortices already cover a broad area than the ones in most beyond the red dashed lines shown in fig 10b lastly if we take a look at the amount maximum total circulation reached during the simulation in each model is compared it is about 20 less in most than openfoam 0 150 m 2 s and 0 185 m 2 s respectively the difference in the coherence and the growth of the vortices observed between the two models can be explained by the lack of a viscous turbulence model in most that provides horizontal and vertical mixing therefore most cannot generate a stable wake region in this scale after about the midpoint of the simulations however despite these differences given the limitations of most due to its relatively simple shallow water wave theory these comparisons show its ability to provide reasonable realization for energetic flow passing a floating object in a computationally cheaper way additionally it is found that the impact of these differences is subtle in the geophysical scale lynett et al 2014 4 results and discussion of large scale applications the developed model was tested in two locations for two different tsunamis in the first test the effects of a hypothetical tsunami arising from alaska aleutians subduction zone was investigated for the ships moored in port of long beach the purpose of this analysis was to see if the presence of vessels within the port changes the flow field created by the tsunami and if so does the variation intensify as the number of the ships in and around the terminal increases then another experiment was conducted based on the post tsunami data collected after the 2011 tohoku tsunami in port of ishinomaki japan based on a personal communication with japanese researchers in april 2018 it has been found out that a container ship broke free off its moorings and was pulled out of the terminal by the currents during the event a realization of this event was made using the developed transport model based on the best estimates of the vessel s draft location and release time at the time of the incident however the values of these parameters cannot be known precisely before the incident therefore a sensitivity analysis was also performed based on this case to see the effects of the initial choice of these parameters on the predicted behavior of the vessel in these experiments the ships were approximated as ellipses and the pressure disturbances therefore were defined as elliptic gaussian functions given by eqn 53 the coefficients c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the shape parameters that define the width and the length of the gaussian as well as the ship s alignment with respect to earth fixed coordinate system based on the angle of rotation θ 53 z x y a exp c 1 x x 0 2 2 c 2 x x 0 y y 0 c 3 y y 0 2 where c 1 c o s θ 2 2 σ x 2 s i n θ 2 2 σ y 2 c 2 sin 2 θ 4 σ x 2 sin 2 θ 4 σ

regions for california in recent history there had been three remarkable tsunamigenic earthquakes the 8 2 mw 1946 aleutian islands johnson and satake 1997 8 6 mw 1957 andreanof islands johnson et al 1994 and 9 2 mw 1964 prince william sound kanamori 1970 earthquakes each of these earthquakes were followed by tsunamis in the pacific which all impacted california more recently tsunami hazard assessment study of kalligeris et al 2017 showed that aasz poses the greatest tsunami hazard potential for california among all the subduction zones along the pacific rim the source characteristics of the hypothetical tsunami scenario considered in this study are based on the 1964 earthquake but it is located to the west of the 1964 rupture to increase the energy beamed towards california the estimated rupture area is 700 km long and 100 km wide with an average slip of 25 m overall the source corresponds to a magnitude 9 2 earthquake the details of the earthquake source parameters of this event were given by barberopoulou et al 2011 based on this tsunami scenario two different simulations are set up focusing on the port of long beach in the first test only one ship was placed within the port while the second case had eight identical ships located in and around the port the parameters of the ships considered in this part of the analysis is given in table 1 additionally the results from these two simulations were compared with a baseline simulation where no ships were present to see the extent of the variations in the flow field induced by the vessels a nested grid was established for these cases to propagate the tsunami waves from aleutians alaska subduction zone to the port of long beach here the grid size δ x of the innermost computation grid was set to 5 m resolve the vessels sufficiently in this final level of the nested grids the simulations were run for 10 h of tsunami action the results of these two sets of simulations were compared in fig 12 with the plots showing the current speeds estimated 100 min after the first arrival of the tsunami to the port when only one ship was included the difference in the flow fields compared to the baseline simulation were local and relatively weak whilst the larger eddy generated at the center of the terminal in the baseline simulation also appeared in the one ship case with a slight shift in south the variations outside the terminal are negligible on the other hand in the multi ship case the disparities in the predicted flow fields became more profound both in and out of the terminal the flow patterns were altered drastically as it has been put forward earlier the presence of the vessels has a considerable impact on the flow fields not only near the vicinity of vessels but also at a broader area in and out of the terminal as can be seen from the plots given in the left panel of fig 12 which intensifies with the number of ships included in the analysis 4 2 incident of c s victory in ishinomaki harbor during 2011 tohoku tsunami like the rest of the tohoku coast the ishinomaki region in miyagi prefecture was hit hard by the 2011 tohoku tsunami in ishinomaki city only 4000 casualties were reported 20 000 houses were completely destroyed and entire port facilities were flooded takagi and bricker 2014 the c s viceroy a 177 m long bulk carrier was moored inside the ishinomaki harbor at the time of the tsunami a personal communication with dr tatsuya asai revealed that approximately 66 min after the earthquake around 16 00 jst the ship broke all its moorings and started to drift freely inside the terminal until it was carried out of the port by the tsunami a realization of this incident is depicted here using the dimensions and the physical properties of the vessel that are listed in table 2 since the precise draft of the ship at the time of the incident is unknown in this analysis it was taken as 7 5 m the midpoint of the minimum and maximum possible draft the tsunami waves were brought to ishinomaki port through a nested grid system where the final grid has the horizontal resolution of 5 m the duration of the simulations in this innermost grid was 5 h initially the c s viceroy was placed to the mooring spot in the terminal where it was thought to be moored when the tsunami had arrived since the mooring lines were not included in this study the vessel s motion had been restricted in the model for the first 66 min of the simulation then it was released and let drift freely with the tsunami currents until the end of the run snapshots of the simulation showing the motion of the vessel as well as the tsunami current fields taken at the different times of the simulation after the ship was released are illustrated in fig 13 the figure shows that the speed of the tsunami currents entering to the terminal where the ship was residing about 3 m s around t 60 mins this was approximately the time when the ship broke its mooring lines a large eddy formed near the ship shortly after which pulled it away from the berth and carried it south near the terminal entrance at around t 90 mins the next tsunami surge has arrived and pushed the ship back in after drifting and spinning with the flow in the port until t 150 mins finally it was taken out of the harbor and brought to the southern boundary of the computational domain however as briefly discussed earlier these parameters were in fact unknown a priori also during the preliminary analysis it has been noticed that if these parameters are changed in the beginning of the simulation then the ship can follow a different path therefore based on this observation a sensitivity analysis was performed to better understand the role of the initial choice of these free parameters in model outputs the release time draft and the initial location of the vessel in addition to the drag coefficient for the lateral current loading c y c were selected for the sensitivity analysis while in general the release time depends on the resultant forces on the hull along with the capacity of the vessel s mooring lines the draft is determined by the total load cargo fuel similarly the exact location of the vessel is an unknown and moving the center of mass even by 1 2 grid points corresponds to 5 10 m of physical distance in the model which can also lead to significant changes in exerted current forces the drag coefficient c y c is calculated empirically by eqn 38 which was derived by curve fitting to experimental date and aimed to be used by engineers the coefficient can vary depending on the hull shape and the flow conditions and therefore was included into this sensitivity analysis the release time varied between 55 min and 95 min with 1 min increments while the draft was increased by 0 1 m at each trial from 6 1 to 9 m the initial center of mass moved 20 m laterally and longitudinally which adds up to 16 trials and the drag coefficient ranged from 1 to 2 5 the results of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in fig 14 where all the paths calculated by the model for different initial values of different parameters after 5 h long simulations are shown the figure tells that the model s outputs are very sensitive to the initial choice of parameters and even small changes in the release time draft initial location and the drag coefficient lead to remarkably different trajectories these results indicate that the process is indeed random as no apparent trends or patterns can be identified from the figure although the model is capable of predicting the path of vessels for a given set of input parameter unfortunately the randomness associated with the selection of the initial conditions implies that a single simulation deterministic approach for large vessel motion should be used qualitatively nonetheless the new insights offered by this study can aid the efforts to design ports that are resilient to tsunamis and provide guidance particularly to stakeholders in coastal communities during their disaster mitigation planning as the hypothetical case from polb suggests the presence of ships can change the flow conditions significantly within a port and they should be included in the simulations during tsunami hazard studies especially deep draft vessels interfere with the flow and neglecting them in analyses can lead to underestimation of tsunami hazard in mooring locations hence a first order hazard assessment by utilizing the model presented here safe mooring spots within a port can be identified more accurately to plan to reduce the exposure to hazardous conditions as well as maintaining upgrading the structures infrastructure to help so which overall can expand the harbor s ability to resist damage 5 conclusions in this paper a collision and transport model were developed to predict the motion of large vessels within a port under the influence of strong currents generated by a tsunami the transport module and the hydrodynamic solver are fully coupled which allows flow and vessels to interact with each other this aspect was ignored in earlier attempts and indeed is the key feature of this study considering the ratio of the draft of the large vessels 8 10 m to the typical depths in ports 10 15 m the interaction between the flow and the vessels is important therefore for accurate representation of the flow field in the presence of the vessels consideration of their interaction is crucial the vessels were included into the hydrodynamic computations as free surface pressure distributions which also accounted for the form drag that the flow experiences due to vessels additionally the bottom stress term was modified locally at the grid points where the pressure gradient was non zero to include effect of the skin friction then the capability of the modified hydrodynamic model was assessed first using the data provided in er86 where the waves generated by the moving pressure disturbances had been investigated it has been found that the model can sufficiently capture the amplitude and the phase of the leading wave for the pressure disturbances moving at the critical speed furthermore the model was tested for the case when the flow passes a floating object and the results were compared to a numerical benchmark test created in openfoam with the modifications made most captured the generation separation and the advection of the eddies generated in the lee of the floating block deftly when compared to the results obtained in openfoam the transport model was based on the linear equations of motion and only three degrees of freedom are considered surge sway and the yaw added mass and the first order damping terms were included as the restoring hull forces but the forces imposed by the ship s controls thrusters and rudders were not the reasoning behind this is the reports from past incidents emphasizing that once the vessel is picked up by the flow the ship s controls are of limited assistance in taking back the ship under control thus the forces due to currents were the only sources of the external loading moreover the present model was also equipped with a built in collision solver founded on the concept of the conservation of momentum and impulse it can detect and evaluate the collisions between two or more vessels as well as the collisions that take place between the vessels and the port structures in the first test the effects of a hypothetical tsunami arising from alaska aleutians subduction zone was investigated for ships moored in the port of long beach two different setups have been investigated here one with a single ship moored within the port and another with eight ships placed in and around the port then the results from these two simulations were compared with the baseline simulation where no vessels were included this analysis revealed that the flow in and around the vessels is indeed affected by the vessels and this gets intensified as the number of the vessels increases and this should be considered in analysis for disaster mitigation planning the last large scale test was based on an incident reported in ishinomaki port japan that happened during the 2011 tohoku tsunami in this incident a 180 m long bulk carrier broke its mooring approximately 65 min after the first arrival of the tsunami and was taken out of the port after spinning and drifting freely inside the port first a realization of this event was simulated using the developed transport model and then a sensitivity analysis has been performed to see the effects of the parameters that cannot be known precisely before the incident the results from these analyses showed that the model is capable of estimating the ship s path for certain combinations of input parameters but at the same time the model results are very sensitive to the initial choice of the input parameters credit authorship
