18335,biohythane production from wastewater via anaerobic fermentation currently relies on two stage physically separated biohydrogen and biomethane reactors which requires closed monitoring the implementation of a control system and cost intensive complex operation herein an innovative multistage anaerobic hythane reactor mahr was reported via integrating two stage fermentation into one reactor mahr was constructed using an internal down flow packed bed reactor and an external up flow sludge blanket to enhance microbial enrichment and thermodynamic feasibility of the associated bioreactions the performance of mahr was investigated for 160 d based on biogas production metabolic flux and microbial structure in comparison to a typical anaerobic high rate reactor up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb a biohythane production with an optimized hydrogen volume ratio 10 20 and a high methane content 75 80 was achieved in the hythane zone mh and methane zone mm in mahr respectively in addition mahr showed a stronger capability to accommodate a high organic loading rate 120 g cod l d and it enhanced the conversion of organics leading to a methane production rate 66 higher than uasb thermodynamic analysis suggested that hydrogen extraction in mh significantly decreased the hydrogen partial pressure 0 1 vol which favored acetogenesis in mm metabolic flux and microbial function analysis further supported the superior performance of mahr over uasb which was primarily attributed to enhanced acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis graphical abstract image 1 keywords biohythane methane multistage anaerobic hythane reactor metabolic flux thermodynamics analysis microbial structure 1 introduction hythane which is known as hydrogen enriched compressed natural gas has been mandated as a forthcoming energy carrier for the internal combustion engine thermal efficiency of the hythane engine has proven to be much better than compressed natural gas engines while also emitting a lower level of harmful emissions benemann 1996 mehra et al 2017 compared with hythane produced from fossil fuels biohythane produced from bio waste feedstocks via two stage anaerobic fermentation has been proposed as a promising and sustainable alternative approach liu et al 2018 recent studies have shown that flexible and controllable biohythane production can be achieved and the primary product can be readily utilized for direct application after the removal of carbon dioxide krishnan et al 2019 various wastewater streams have been successfully used for biohythane production including coffee manufacturing wastewater jung et al 2012 cassava wastewater intanoo et al 2016 palm oil mill effluent seengenyoung et al 2019 and tequila vinasses buitrón et al 2014 two stage fermentation for biohythane production has been considered superior to traditional single stage fermentation for biogas production not only because of its production of cleaner products but also due to its enhanced fermentation efficiency chatterjee and mazumder 2019 schievano et al 2014 reported that biohythane production from biomass through two stage fermentation resulted in a significantly higher 8 43 energy recovery under different conditions we previously set up a two stage fermentation system based on typical anaerobic high rate reactors which confirmed an enhanced energy recovery and organics conversion compared with single stage fermentation si et al 2016 the improvement of the two stage fermentation system could be attributed to the enhancement and optimized control of the microbial metabolism fontana et al 2018 further confirmed the superiority of two stage in comparison to single stage anaerobic fermentation and revealed the mechanism behind this trend based on metagenomic analysis however two stage fermentation for biohythane production usually involves two physically separated reactors for biohydrogen and biomethane production for example previous studies have combined a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb montiel corona and razo flores 2018 two uasb intanoo et al 2016 an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr with uasb seengenyoung et al 2019 and two packed bed reactors pbr si et al 2016 in addition complicated monitoring online ph sensing control systems control valves and pumps and chemical reagents are usually required for these types of systems ravi et al 2018 seengenyoung et al 2019 thus the implementation of these systems and inputs may lead to intensive operating and maintenance costs integrating two stage fermentation into a bioreactor is an attractive concept theoretically the new reactor design could be based on two typical and widely used anaerobic high rate reactors such as the pbr bertin et al 2010 and the uasb lettinga and pol 1991 however choosing proper separation approaches for hydrogen hythane and methane production into one system leads to design challenges for this type of reactor the previously reported main approaches table a1 for fermentation separation included 1 pretreatment of the inoculum for biohydrogen production such as heat treatment acid and base shock etc to enrich spore forming hydrogen producers wang and yin 2017 however these methods could not suppress hydrogen consuming reactions for long term operation especially for high rate anaerobic reactors which had a long sludge retention time si et al 2015 2 ph control has been proven to be effective si et al 2016 the optimal ph for most hydrogen bacteria ranged from 4 to 6 sivagurunathan et al 2016 whereas the optimal ph value was neutral for biomethane production however maintaining this ph gradient would significantly increase the economic input due to the need for an online monitoring and control system moreover the addition of extra chemicals for ph adjustment may lead to a digestate with a high concentration of salts which cannot be used as bio fertilizer krishnan et al 2019 3 hydraulic retention time hrt control has been proposed as a possible method to separate hydrogen and methane production the hrt for hydrogen production is much shorter than that of methane production table a1 in particular the ratio of the hrt for methane production to that of hydrogen production ranged from 1 to 10 pakarinen et al 2011 proved that the methanogenic process can be shifted towards hydrogen production by decreasing the hrt si et al 2015 investigated the effect of hrt on biohydrogen production in high rate reactors and the results showed that the decrease of the hrt increased the biohydrogen yield and decreased the methane production the hrt difference during two stage fermentation could be easily achieved via two separate reactors however further design changes are needed to achieve the successful implementation of an integrated bioreactor considering all of this as a whole a multistage anaerobic hythane reactor mahr was proposed in this study fig 1 a mahr consisted of two zones an inside reaction zone for biohydrogen biohythane production mh and an outside reaction zone for biomethane production mm mahr was designed based on four hypotheses preconditions 1 mahr could be separated into two reaction zones mh and mm by hrt differences mh could be maintained at a much lower hrt than mm 2 the flow pattern of the wastewater stream in the mahr was similar to a plug flow reactor with axial dispersion which has been considered to have hydrodynamic behaviors similar to typical high rate anaerobic rectors ren et al 2008 the wastewater flow through mh and mm could be conducted in sequence red arrows fig 1a 3 mh could be packed with microbial carriers and it could enrich robust hydrogen producers in the form of biofilms the packed bed biofilm reactor has been proven for continuous hydrogen production and his type of reactor could suffer from a low hrt reaching up to 2 h si et al 2015 4 mm could consisted of a granular sludge blanket which has been verified to efficiently convert volatile fatty acids vfas and alcohol generated during hydrogen production han et al 2005 si et al 2016 as such a novel mahr bioreactor which integrated two stage fermentation into a bioreactor to continuously produce biohythane was established based on the above hypotheses mahr that separated hydrogen hythane and methane production via hrt differences reduced the economic input in comparison to conventional two stage fermentation in addition an enhanced fermentation efficiency was achieved in mahr compared with that of typical anaerobic high rate reactors this attributed to the advantageous ability of this reactor to include a stage separation process to evaluate the performance of mahr long term operation 160 days of this reactor was conducted using a uasb as the control under identical operating conditions this study specifically emphasized the impacts of this reactor with regard to gas production metabolic flux thermodynamics and microbial structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation the experiments were carried out via two laboratory scale mahr and uasb reactors fig 1 both of the reactors were made of transparent acrylic with an effective volume of 2 l and a height to diameter ratio of 4 1 mahr consisted of an inside section for hydrogen hythane production mh and an outside section for methane production mm the ratio of the volumes of mh to mm was set at 1 3 which led to a hrt ratio of 3 this designed hrt ratio was within the range of 1 10 based on the literature table a1 poly ethylene rings were packed in mh to serve as a microbial carrier mahr and uasb were maintained at mesophilic condition 37 c using a water jacket gas volumes of the two reactors were measured daily using gas meters at room temperature 25 3 c and corrected under standard conditions 273 15 k 101 325 kpa the produced gas was collected in air tight bags for composition analysis the effluents from the reactors were first centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter before total organic carbon toc inorganic carbon ic and volatile fatty acids vfas analysis the uasb and mm were inoculated with granular sludge obtained from a continuously operated uasb using synthetic wastewater the same granular sludge was also used for the inoculum of the mh zone after heat pretreatment 100 c 15min the inoculum of uasb mm and mh consisted of a volume inoculation ratio of 20 v v and 60 v v respectively the uasb and mahr were continuously operated using synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater consisted of glucose carbon source and nh4cl nitrogen source with varying concentrations depending on the reactors operational conditions the carbon nitrogen ratio was adjusted to 25 nutrients were added which contained mg l k2hpo4 250 kh2po4 250 mgcl2 300 cocl2 25 zncl2 11 5 cucl2 10 5 cacl2 25 mncl2 15 niso4 16 and fecl3 25 si et al 2016 nahco3 was added into the wastewater as a ph buffer at 1 g g cod the uasb and mahr were started up at an initial feedstock concentration of 2 g cod l 1 and a hrt of 24 h fig 2 phase 1 the feed concentration increased to 5 g cod l 1 phase 2 after the effluent s ph recovered from the initial organic shock fig 2 the hrt decreased to 12 h in phase 3 and further increase of the organic loading rate olr was conducted by increasing the feed concentration from 5 g cod l 1 to 10 g cod l 1 phase 4 the reactors operated in phases 5 11 had an hrt of 8 6 4 12 2 and 6 h respectively and a fixed concentration of the feedstock 10 g cod l 1 was applied in all these phases fig 2 2 2 analytical methods the gas content of hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide was determined daily via gas chromatography sp 6890 lunan technologies china the gas chromatography system was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a stainless steel column packed with tdx 01 the concentration of toc and ic was determined by a toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the vfas in the effluents were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography shimadzu 10a japan equipped with an ultraviolet detector and a synergi 4u hydro rp phenomenex column five mm h2so4 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min and the oven temperature was set at 40 c the microbial samples in uasb mh and mm were collected for morphology observation and microbial diversity analysis the microbial morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200 fei usa as previously described liu et al 2012 the microbial diversity was analyzed via illumina miseq sequencing primers 338f 5 actcctacgggagg cagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtw tctaat 3 for the bacteria were used primers arch524f 5 tgycagccgccgcggtaa 3 and arch958r 5 yccggcgttgavtccaatt 3 for the archaea were used the pcr process was conducted as previously described si et al 2015 amplicons were extracted from 2 agarose gels and purified using an axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences usa and quantified using quantifluor st promega usa purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar amounts and paired end sequenced on an illumina miseq platform the raw reads were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database raw fastq files were demultiplexed and quality filtered using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime the phylogenetic affiliation of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed by a rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu115 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 2 3 calculation the standard gibbs free energy δg 0 of bioreactions during anaerobic fermentation was collected according to the literature table a2 the standard conditions are 25 c a pressure of 1 atm and a ph of 7 the environmental gibbs free energy δg was calculated according to mccarty 1986 δ g δ g 0 rt i 1 m k v i k l n a i where v ik is the stoichiometric coefficient for component i in reaction k with m k components a i is the physiological concentrations of i r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature the effect of ph was not considered for calculation of δg during the fermentation process because the ph of the influent and effluent was around 7 due to the addition of a ph buffer fig 2 the electron flux of mahr and uasb was proposed based on a previous study mccarty 1986 only the most significant pathway in anaerobic fermentation was proposed though there are other pathways contributing to the production of methane the methane production in mh was assumed to be dominated by the hydrogenotrophic pathway based on the results of thermodynamics analysis and microbial distribution in mh the distribution of the electron flux of hydrogen and methane production in mh was calculated based on the experimental data the calculation of the electron flux was based on the method proposed by rittmann and mccarty 2001 and the microbial growth was not included in the analysis since the most of electron in the reaction 92 contributed to methane 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational performance of mahr and uasb in response to different organic loads mahr showed separated gas production in mh and mm fig 3 a mahr and uasb had a similar total gas production rate from phase 1 to 5 note that the unstable performance of mahr at 70 130 days phase 6 8 was mainly caused by the blockage of the gas outlet of mh fig a1 which may have occurred due to the narrow diameter and growth of the biofilms the blockage led to the gas emission from mh through the gas outlet of mm phase 6 8 this was verified by the increased hydrogen production in mm which was amplified due to the gas produced from mh mixing with the gas produced from mm fig 3b in addition the gas misdirection may have disturbed the biochemical reactions and mass transfer in mm generally mahr had a similar or even lower gas production than uasb when mh didn t function properly phase 6 8 after enlarging the gas outlet of mh phase 9 the gas production in mahr recovered to similar values in phase 4 which had the same hrt and olr as phase 9 this indicated the quick recovery of mahr from the organic loading shock phase 5 7 60 g cod l 1d 1 in comparison uasb maintained a much lower gas production rate in phase 8 9 than that in phase 4 even at the same olr this suggested that uasb had not yet recovered from the organic loading shock when the hrt decreased to 2 h phase 10 a significant production of hydrogen in uasb was observed this indicated the shift of metabolites due to the reduction of the hrt si et al 2015 the methane production rate dramatically decreased due to the low hrt the methane production rate in mahr 18 60 1 83 l d 1 was 66 higher than that in uasb 11 21 1 16 l d 1 indicating the higher organic loading capacity of mahr in comparison to uasb a hydrogen production rate of 0 32 0 11 l d 1 in mahr was achieved at phase 11 hrt 6 h meanwhile a methane production rate of 24 24 2 98 l d 1 was achieved in mahr which was 111 8 higher than that of uasb in general mahr exhibited a higher organic loading capacity and more efficient system recovery from organic loading shock than uasb the gas content in mh demonstrated promising biohythane production results fig 3 d a slight increase of the hydrogen content was observed in mh as the hrt decreased in particular the hydrogen content in mh increased to 18 when the hrt decreased to 6 h but it immediately decreased to 2 this could be attributed to the hydrogen consuming reactions such as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis table a2 similar results were observed by the biofilm reactor for biohydrogen production in which reducing the hrt suppressed the hydrogen consuming reactions but could not remove these bacteria si et al 2015 although the hydrogen content was not comparable with that in a separated and ph controlled hydrogen biofilm reactor 25 40 si et al 2015 a promising amount of biohythane could be achieved in mh the ratio of hydrogen in hythane ranged from 0 to 89 and the adjustment of the ratio of hydrogen in hythane was related to the methane content ranging from 15 to 20 in mh which decreased with the reduction of the hrt a stable ratio of hydrogen in hythane 10 20 was achieved in phase 11 fig 3d this hydrogen to hythane ratio was within the suggested range mehra et al 2017 the produced hythane is a competitive and promising fuel for existing combustion engines and it can be used for vehicle fuels after directly removing the carbon dioxide the difference between the gas content in mm and uasb further confirmed the separation of hydrogen hythane and methane production the gas production in mm maintained a high methane content fig 3e in particular the methane content in mahr ranged from 75 to 80 at a hrt of 12 h phase 3 4 9 this methane content was over 20 higher than that in uasb around 50 the higher methane content in second stage fermentation than single stage fermentation has also been verified in our previous study si et al 2016 this could be attributed to the fact that the substrate for the second stage was mainly vfas which could increase the ratio of methane in the produced gas based on their stoichiometric equations pavlostathis 1991 in addition limited hydrogen production volume content below 0 1 was observed in mm during the stable operation phases phase 3 4 9 10 and 11 this indicated efficient conversion of vfas to methane by hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetogenesis bacteria the gas produced from mm could be purified for the production of pure methane products and could be incorporated into a natural gas pipeline and the purification cost would be much less than conventional single stage fermentation due to its high content of methane toc conversion and vfa changes further revealed the difference between the metabolism of organics in mahr and uasb fig 4 both mahr and uasb had a toc removal close to 90 after 30 days operation indicating the successful startup of the reactors the toc removal of mahr and uasb in phase 3 reached up to 95 3 3 1 and 89 7 4 9 respectively fig 4a the higher toc removal of mahr in comparison to uasb was also reflected by the concentration of vfas in the effluents a higher concentration of butyric acid was observed in uasb than mahr fig 4 b c this result suggested the enhanced acetogenesis in mahr which converted butyric acid to acetic acid and hydrogen and these products were further converted into methane due to the blockage of mh phase 6 8 as described above the toc removal efficiency in mahr was similar to or even less than that of uasb which was also confirmed by the changes in the vfas concentration the toc removal in mahr quickly recovered to 90 after the hrt returned back to 12 h phase 9 in comparison a toc removal of 50 was achieved in uasb this difference corresponded to the gas production fig 3 suggesting the quicker recovery of mahr than uasb from the organic shock further the hrt decreased to 2 h phase 10 which led to an olr of 120 g cod l 1d 1 a toc removal of 38 1 10 5 and 20 5 6 0 was achieved in mahr and uasb respectively a significant increase of vfas was observed in mahr and uasb an accumulation of propionic and butyric acid was found in both mahr and uasb mahr had lower concentrations of these acids than uasb which suggested enhanced acetogenesis in phase 11 when the hrt was changed to 6 h a toc removal of 75 1 4 6 was achieved in mahr and this value was 34 7 in uasb however the concentration of butyric acid in mahr dramatically decreased whereas butyric acid in uasb remained at a similar level to that in phase 10 one interesting aspect of these results was the low concentration of acetic acid 4 6 mg toc l 1 in mahr whereas that in uasb reached up to 72 54 mg toc l 1 these results suggested the enhanced presence of acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis in mahr compared with uasb this demonstrated a promising prospective application for mahr since acetogenesis has been reported as one of the rate limiting steps in anaerobic fermentation tommaso et al 2015 3 2 thermodynamics of organics conversion in mahr and uasb the difference between mahr and uasb could be further evaluated in depth based on thermodynamics analysis the hydrogen produced during acidogenesis was taken from the liquid phase in the form of hydrogen gas or it was further used for hydrogenotrophic methane production in mh the involved reactions table a2 had a δg 0 ranging from 279 4 to 164 8 kj mol which indicated the thermodynamic favorability of these reactions in mh note that a microenvironment may be formed in mh among the pe rings which may lead to insufficient mass transfer and an increased hydrogen partial pressure in addition unlike previous studies which maintained acidic conditions for hydrogen production sivagurunathan et al 2016 mahr was operated without ph control in this study the added nahco3 which acted as a ph buffer provided a high concentration of hco3 in the fermented liquid phase all of the above conditions thermodynamically favored the reaction of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in mh 4 h 2 hco 3 h ch 4 3 h 2 o δ g 0 135 kj mol hence it was not thermodynamically feasible to avoid methane production and produce a high content of hydrogen in mh however we proved that biohythane with a proper hydrogen ratio could be achieved by reducing the hrt the reduced hrt would improve the mass transfer in the reactor enhance the release of hydrogen gas and further avoid conversion of produced hydrogen through methanogenesis si et al 2015 the accumulation of vfas in mm and uasb was found to be related to the increased hydrogen content fig 5 hydrogen partial pressure changes could significantly affect the gibbs free energy available from the reactions during anaerobic fermentation in particular acetogenesis would be significantly influenced by the gibbs free energy results mccarty 1986 thauer et al 1977 thermodynamics quantification of acetogenesis was conducted to reveal the significant differences between the organics conversion of mahr and uasb after startup of uasb and mahr from phase 1 to 5 30 days the δg of propionic acid and butyric acid acetogenesis was below zero in mahr suggesting well functioning acetogenesis this was confirmed by the organics conversion and vfas concentration fig 4 both the δg of propionic acid and butyric acid acetogenesis in uasb and mahr was above zero at phases 6 8 corresponding to the decreased toc removal and accumulated vfas in particular the δg of propionic acid and butyric acid acetogenesis in mahr was higher than uasb as discussed above the gas outlet of mh was blocked in phases 6 8 as a result the produced hydrogen in mh was rushed into mm and increased the hydrogen partial pressure which made the process thermodynamically unfavorable for acetogenesis in comparison after fixing the gas outlet of mh the δg of propionic acid acetogenesis in mm decreased to below zero in phase 9 further decreasing the hrt to 2 h phase 10 led to the δg reaching a value above zero and thereby the subsequent accumulation of propionic acid in mahr a similar result reported that conversion of propionic acid was kinetically difficult when a shorter hrt was adopted qiao et al 2016 the degradation of butyric acid was more thermodynamically favored than propionic acid which showed an environmental δg predominantly below zero in phases 9 11 in mahr fig 5 in general acetogenesis in mm was thermodynamically favorable compared with uasb which led to a strengthened organics conversion and methane production in mm this was attributed to the critical role of mh which enhanced acetogenesis in mm via the extraction of hydrogen further this also explains the reason why two stage fermentation was more advantageous than conventional single stage fermentation as the organic loading capacity and organic conversion increased 3 3 microbial community analysis the difference between the gas production and organics conversion performance of uasb and mahr indicated a significant difference in their microbial structure after long term operation sem pictures show that the center of both granules in uasb fig a2 b and mm fig a2 f had coccus shaped microbes as for the biofilm in mh it was dominated by rod shaped bacteria fig a2 2d ternary plot analysis based on illumina miseq sequencing further confirmed the difference between the microbial structure among mh mm and uasb fig 6 according to the analysis uasb and mh showed similar distributions of bacteria on a phylum level both reactors contained an abundance of the enriched phylum firmicutes the phylum firmicutes is usually observed in hydrogen production reactors in two stage fermentation systems which suggested a function of domain acidogenesis and hydrogen production si et al 2016 compared with uasb and mh the phylum proteobacteria synergistetes actinobacteria and chloroflexi were mostly associated with mm as for the archaea only the phylum euryarchaeota was found and it tended to be enriched by uasb and mm a further comparison of the distribution of bacteria and archaea at the family level is illustrated in fig 7 a uasb and mh had a much higher distribution of the family bacteroidaceae peh08 clostridiaceae eubacteriaceae lachnospiraceae erysipelotrichaceae and enterobacteriaceae than the distribution of these families in mm all these bacteria were reported to be related to acidogenesis si et al 2016 some of them such as clostridiaceae and enterobacteriaceae are representative hydrogen producers lee et al 2011 mm enriched the family propionibacteriaceae anaerolineaceae streptococcaceae christensenellaceae syntrophomonadaceae desulfovibrionaceae syntrophobacteraceae and synergistaceae as for the archaea methane producers were found in all reactor zones which was further validated by the composition of the produced gas fig 2 the family methanobacteriaceae was the dominant archaea group in uasb mm and mh and it reached its highest abundance 74 7 in mh in order to further reveal the role of microbes during the metabolic pathways of organics and gas production the relative abundance of functional bacteria and archaea was examined fig 7b functions of dominant families were classified on the family level according to the literature si et al 2016 rosenberg et al 2014 mh had the highest abundance of bacteria up to 82 94 related to acidogenesis in comparison mm had the lowest acidogenesis bacteria content as for the acetogenesis bacteria mm had the highest distribution 21 69 acetogenesis bacteria grow in obligate syntrophy with methanogens and convert substrates that are not or not easily used for methane production such as butyric and propionic acid to acetic acid and hydrogen stams and plugge 2009 these results demonstrated a dominant functional separation of acidogenesis and acetogenesis in mh and mm respectively the content of acetogenesis bacteria in mahr was higher than that in uasb indicating an enhanced vfas conversion which has been confirmed by the vfas distribution fig 4 similar microbial distribution differences between one stage and two stage fermentation were also reported in a previous study when a one stage biomethane system was shifted to a two stage biohythane system si et al 2016 the family peh08 in uasb reached up to 25 44 and its function needs further investigation for the methane producers in uasb and mahr the dominant archaea was related to the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway mh showed a high distribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogens this corresponded to the robust methane production and low hydrogen yield in mh fig 3 in comparison mm contained a higher abundance of acetoclastic methanogens than mh and uasb which could effectively convert the acetate produced from acetogenesis this result corresponded to the lower acetic acid concentration in the effluent of mahr in comparison to uasb fig 4 further the microbial structure metabolites distribution and thermodynamics were combined to reveal the biochemical pathways in uasb and mahr fig 8 acidogenesis was the dominant biochemical reaction in mh which produced hydrogen and vfas the high content of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in mh could be explained by its high hydrogen partial pressure which is beneficial for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from a thermodynamic perspective the low hrt in mh tended to get rid of acetoclastic methanogens rather than hydrogenotrophic methanogens due to their much slower specific growth rate than the latter pavlostathis 1991 generally speaking the enhanced acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis which were promoted enriching specific microbes in mahr strengthened the organics removal and biogas production compared with uasb fig 8b this was also supported by one recent study which found that the lower organics conversion in the single stage configuration in comparison to the two stage fermentation was mainly correlated to the low abundance of acetogenesis bacteria and to the absence of acetoclastic methanogens fontana et al 2018 in conventional uasb fig 8c the hydrogen partial pressure increases as the organic load increases thus acetogenesis is easily to be inhibited from a thermodynamic perspective regarding mahr the hydrogen partial pressure remained at a low level due to the extraction of a substantial amount of hydrogen in mh hence acetogenesis was strengthened and the related microbes were enriched in mm 3 4 outlook in this study mahr produced biohythane and biomethane at the same time demonstrating advantageous aspects over traditional uasb including a stronger tolerance to a high olr an enhanced organics removal and an improved energy recovery however mahr was operated with synthetic wastewater in this study and real waste streams need to be further verified it can be speculated that waste streams with a high content of carbohydrates would be suitable substrates for mahr such as palm oil mill effluent krishnan et al 2017 coffee wastewater jung et al 2012 and household waste liu et al 2006 it s worth noting that mahr also has potential to treat toxic wastewater due to the fact that it demonstrated a strengthened presence of acetogenesis the syntrophic communities consisted of acetogenesis bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens known to be involved in the degradation of substrates that cannot be fermented by individual species alone stams and plugge 2009 furthermore these communities have also demonstrated the ability to cooperatively degrade aromatic polyaromatic and hydrocarbon compounds morris et al 2013 previous studies have also confirmed the active role of acetogenesis bacteria when dealing with post hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater which contains phenols and n heterocyclic compounds si et al 2019 however a waste steam containing a high concentration of metal ions ammonia or sulfur would be a challenge for mahr to convert this is due to the fact that the effluent from the hydrogen hythane production zone directly feeds into the methane production zone which would cause a shock to the sensitive methanogens a possible manner to compensate is adjusting the methane production zone via recycling the effluent or diluting water in the section connecting the hydrogen hythane production zones however these methods need further investigation in addition studies involving the long term 1 2 years operation and implementation of pilot or full scale mahr are required to ascertain if this type of reactor can be replicated in a real anaerobic fermentation system another advantage is that mahr is able of separating the hydrogen hythane and methane production using a gradient hrt based on the reactor configuration hence mahr does not require the incorporation of an online ph detection and control system like conventional two stage fermentation maintaining a ph gradient in conventional two stage fermentation would significantly increase the economic input and is a concern for future application of the digestate in addition the inoculum for the startup of mahr would be easier to implement compared to a separated two stage high rate reactor there may be no requirement for heat chemical shock or acid base pretreatment for the inoculum of mh to screen hydrogen production microbes since the gradient hrt had proven could effectively separate the hydrogen hythane and methane production and adjust the hythane production in mh this would avoid a significant energy and economic cost for the large scale implementation of this type of reactor krishnan et al 2019 however note that the mahr should be designed on a case by case basis according to the characteristics of the feedstock a kinetic analysis based on batch experiments is suggested before designing mahr in addition the configuration for mh and mm should also be taken into account since the configuration would affect the sludge retention time the separated reaction zone in mahr increased the complexity of the configuration compared with typical high rate reactor thus proper design of the parameters is required to avoid malfunctions for example the internal connection of the biohydrogen biohythane zone and biomethane zone which are responsible for the separated functional microbial communities biofilms granular sludge and liquid products has a complicated flow field which may lead to an unstable flow and subsequently hamper the performance of the methane production zone in addition the three phase separator on top of mahr has the potential to malfunction after long term operation e g the blockage of the gas outlet of mh in this study hence the design of operational parameters based on the optimization of hydrodynamic characteristics is necessary the optimization of hydrodynamic conditions would benefit the microbial morphology and community structure saur et al 2016 for example a higher ratio of reactor height to diameter can ensure a lon ger circular flowing trajectory which in turn creates a more effective hydraulic attrition to microbial aggregates liu and tay 2002 in addition the design parameters affect the mass transfer and metabolism of organics enhanced mass transfer can accelerate biochemical reactions by improving the contact of the microbes with the bulk solution and it also avoids the side reactions and inhibition caused by the end products si et al 2015 another concern is that the mh was constructed by a packed bed in this study which may lead to blockage after long term operation speece 1996 hence further improvement of the configuration of mh is necessary 4 conclusion this study demonstrated continuous biohythane production via an innovative mahr including two stage fermentation in one reactor without complicated controls mahr could produce biohythane with a proper ratio for vehicle fuels and high content of methane at the same time moreover mahr showed a stronger capability of tolerating a high olr and demonstrated enhanced organic conversion in comparison to conventional uasb metabolites flux and microbial structure analysis revealed enhanced acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis this enhancement could be attributed to the hydrogen extraction in the hydrogen production zone which decreased the hydrogen partial pressure and

18335,biohythane production from wastewater via anaerobic fermentation currently relies on two stage physically separated biohydrogen and biomethane reactors which requires closed monitoring the implementation of a control system and cost intensive complex operation herein an innovative multistage anaerobic hythane reactor mahr was reported via integrating two stage fermentation into one reactor mahr was constructed using an internal down flow packed bed reactor and an external up flow sludge blanket to enhance microbial enrichment and thermodynamic feasibility of the associated bioreactions the performance of mahr was investigated for 160 d based on biogas production metabolic flux and microbial structure in comparison to a typical anaerobic high rate reactor up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb a biohythane production with an optimized hydrogen volume ratio 10 20 and a high methane content 75 80 was achieved in the hythane zone mh and methane zone mm in mahr respectively in addition mahr showed a stronger capability to accommodate a high organic loading rate 120 g cod l d and it enhanced the conversion of organics leading to a methane production rate 66 higher than uasb thermodynamic analysis suggested that hydrogen extraction in mh significantly decreased the hydrogen partial pressure 0 1 vol which favored acetogenesis in mm metabolic flux and microbial function analysis further supported the superior performance of mahr over uasb which was primarily attributed to enhanced acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis graphical abstract image 1 keywords biohythane methane multistage anaerobic hythane reactor metabolic flux thermodynamics analysis microbial structure 1 introduction hythane which is known as hydrogen enriched compressed natural gas has been mandated as a forthcoming energy carrier for the internal combustion engine thermal efficiency of the hythane engine has proven to be much better than compressed natural gas engines while also emitting a lower level of harmful emissions benemann 1996 mehra et al 2017 compared with hythane produced from fossil fuels biohythane produced from bio waste feedstocks via two stage anaerobic fermentation has been proposed as a promising and sustainable alternative approach liu et al 2018 recent studies have shown that flexible and controllable biohythane production can be achieved and the primary product can be readily utilized for direct application after the removal of carbon dioxide krishnan et al 2019 various wastewater streams have been successfully used for biohythane production including coffee manufacturing wastewater jung et al 2012 cassava wastewater intanoo et al 2016 palm oil mill effluent seengenyoung et al 2019 and tequila vinasses buitrón et al 2014 two stage fermentation for biohythane production has been considered superior to traditional single stage fermentation for biogas production not only because of its production of cleaner products but also due to its enhanced fermentation efficiency chatterjee and mazumder 2019 schievano et al 2014 reported that biohythane production from biomass through two stage fermentation resulted in a significantly higher 8 43 energy recovery under different conditions we previously set up a two stage fermentation system based on typical anaerobic high rate reactors which confirmed an enhanced energy recovery and organics conversion compared with single stage fermentation si et al 2016 the improvement of the two stage fermentation system could be attributed to the enhancement and optimized control of the microbial metabolism fontana et al 2018 further confirmed the superiority of two stage in comparison to single stage anaerobic fermentation and revealed the mechanism behind this trend based on metagenomic analysis however two stage fermentation for biohythane production usually involves two physically separated reactors for biohydrogen and biomethane production for example previous studies have combined a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr with upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb montiel corona and razo flores 2018 two uasb intanoo et al 2016 an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor asbr with uasb seengenyoung et al 2019 and two packed bed reactors pbr si et al 2016 in addition complicated monitoring online ph sensing control systems control valves and pumps and chemical reagents are usually required for these types of systems ravi et al 2018 seengenyoung et al 2019 thus the implementation of these systems and inputs may lead to intensive operating and maintenance costs integrating two stage fermentation into a bioreactor is an attractive concept theoretically the new reactor design could be based on two typical and widely used anaerobic high rate reactors such as the pbr bertin et al 2010 and the uasb lettinga and pol 1991 however choosing proper separation approaches for hydrogen hythane and methane production into one system leads to design challenges for this type of reactor the previously reported main approaches table a1 for fermentation separation included 1 pretreatment of the inoculum for biohydrogen production such as heat treatment acid and base shock etc to enrich spore forming hydrogen producers wang and yin 2017 however these methods could not suppress hydrogen consuming reactions for long term operation especially for high rate anaerobic reactors which had a long sludge retention time si et al 2015 2 ph control has been proven to be effective si et al 2016 the optimal ph for most hydrogen bacteria ranged from 4 to 6 sivagurunathan et al 2016 whereas the optimal ph value was neutral for biomethane production however maintaining this ph gradient would significantly increase the economic input due to the need for an online monitoring and control system moreover the addition of extra chemicals for ph adjustment may lead to a digestate with a high concentration of salts which cannot be used as bio fertilizer krishnan et al 2019 3 hydraulic retention time hrt control has been proposed as a possible method to separate hydrogen and methane production the hrt for hydrogen production is much shorter than that of methane production table a1 in particular the ratio of the hrt for methane production to that of hydrogen production ranged from 1 to 10 pakarinen et al 2011 proved that the methanogenic process can be shifted towards hydrogen production by decreasing the hrt si et al 2015 investigated the effect of hrt on biohydrogen production in high rate reactors and the results showed that the decrease of the hrt increased the biohydrogen yield and decreased the methane production the hrt difference during two stage fermentation could be easily achieved via two separate reactors however further design changes are needed to achieve the successful implementation of an integrated bioreactor considering all of this as a whole a multistage anaerobic hythane reactor mahr was proposed in this study fig 1 a mahr consisted of two zones an inside reaction zone for biohydrogen biohythane production mh and an outside reaction zone for biomethane production mm mahr was designed based on four hypotheses preconditions 1 mahr could be separated into two reaction zones mh and mm by hrt differences mh could be maintained at a much lower hrt than mm 2 the flow pattern of the wastewater stream in the mahr was similar to a plug flow reactor with axial dispersion which has been considered to have hydrodynamic behaviors similar to typical high rate anaerobic rectors ren et al 2008 the wastewater flow through mh and mm could be conducted in sequence red arrows fig 1a 3 mh could be packed with microbial carriers and it could enrich robust hydrogen producers in the form of biofilms the packed bed biofilm reactor has been proven for continuous hydrogen production and his type of reactor could suffer from a low hrt reaching up to 2 h si et al 2015 4 mm could consisted of a granular sludge blanket which has been verified to efficiently convert volatile fatty acids vfas and alcohol generated during hydrogen production han et al 2005 si et al 2016 as such a novel mahr bioreactor which integrated two stage fermentation into a bioreactor to continuously produce biohythane was established based on the above hypotheses mahr that separated hydrogen hythane and methane production via hrt differences reduced the economic input in comparison to conventional two stage fermentation in addition an enhanced fermentation efficiency was achieved in mahr compared with that of typical anaerobic high rate reactors this attributed to the advantageous ability of this reactor to include a stage separation process to evaluate the performance of mahr long term operation 160 days of this reactor was conducted using a uasb as the control under identical operating conditions this study specifically emphasized the impacts of this reactor with regard to gas production metabolic flux thermodynamics and microbial structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation the experiments were carried out via two laboratory scale mahr and uasb reactors fig 1 both of the reactors were made of transparent acrylic with an effective volume of 2 l and a height to diameter ratio of 4 1 mahr consisted of an inside section for hydrogen hythane production mh and an outside section for methane production mm the ratio of the volumes of mh to mm was set at 1 3 which led to a hrt ratio of 3 this designed hrt ratio was within the range of 1 10 based on the literature table a1 poly ethylene rings were packed in mh to serve as a microbial carrier mahr and uasb were maintained at mesophilic condition 37 c using a water jacket gas volumes of the two reactors were measured daily using gas meters at room temperature 25 3 c and corrected under standard conditions 273 15 k 101 325 kpa the produced gas was collected in air tight bags for composition analysis the effluents from the reactors were first centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and then filtered using a 0 45 μm membrane filter before total organic carbon toc inorganic carbon ic and volatile fatty acids vfas analysis the uasb and mm were inoculated with granular sludge obtained from a continuously operated uasb using synthetic wastewater the same granular sludge was also used for the inoculum of the mh zone after heat pretreatment 100 c 15min the inoculum of uasb mm and mh consisted of a volume inoculation ratio of 20 v v and 60 v v respectively the uasb and mahr were continuously operated using synthetic wastewater the synthetic wastewater consisted of glucose carbon source and nh4cl nitrogen source with varying concentrations depending on the reactors operational conditions the carbon nitrogen ratio was adjusted to 25 nutrients were added which contained mg l k2hpo4 250 kh2po4 250 mgcl2 300 cocl2 25 zncl2 11 5 cucl2 10 5 cacl2 25 mncl2 15 niso4 16 and fecl3 25 si et al 2016 nahco3 was added into the wastewater as a ph buffer at 1 g g cod the uasb and mahr were started up at an initial feedstock concentration of 2 g cod l 1 and a hrt of 24 h fig 2 phase 1 the feed concentration increased to 5 g cod l 1 phase 2 after the effluent s ph recovered from the initial organic shock fig 2 the hrt decreased to 12 h in phase 3 and further increase of the organic loading rate olr was conducted by increasing the feed concentration from 5 g cod l 1 to 10 g cod l 1 phase 4 the reactors operated in phases 5 11 had an hrt of 8 6 4 12 2 and 6 h respectively and a fixed concentration of the feedstock 10 g cod l 1 was applied in all these phases fig 2 2 2 analytical methods the gas content of hydrogen methane and carbon dioxide was determined daily via gas chromatography sp 6890 lunan technologies china the gas chromatography system was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a stainless steel column packed with tdx 01 the concentration of toc and ic was determined by a toc analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan the vfas in the effluents were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography shimadzu 10a japan equipped with an ultraviolet detector and a synergi 4u hydro rp phenomenex column five mm h2so4 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml min and the oven temperature was set at 40 c the microbial samples in uasb mh and mm were collected for morphology observation and microbial diversity analysis the microbial morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200 fei usa as previously described liu et al 2012 the microbial diversity was analyzed via illumina miseq sequencing primers 338f 5 actcctacgggagg cagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtw tctaat 3 for the bacteria were used primers arch524f 5 tgycagccgccgcggtaa 3 and arch958r 5 yccggcgttgavtccaatt 3 for the archaea were used the pcr process was conducted as previously described si et al 2015 amplicons were extracted from 2 agarose gels and

an illumina miseq platform the raw reads were deposited into the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database raw fastq files were demultiplexed and quality filtered using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime the phylogenetic affiliation of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed by a rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu against the silva ssu115 16s rrna database using a confidence threshold of 70 2 3 calculation the standard gibbs free energy δg 0 of bioreactions during anaerobic fermentation was collected according to the literature table a2 the standard conditions are 25 c a pressure of 1 atm and a ph of 7 the environmental gibbs free energy δg was calculated according to mccarty 1986 δ g δ g 0 rt i 1 m k v i k l n a i where v ik is the stoichiometric coefficient for component i in reaction k with m k components a i is the physiological concentrations of i r is the universal gas constant and t is the absolute temperature the effect of ph was not considered for calculation of δg during the fermentation process because the ph of the influent and effluent was around 7 due to the addition of a ph buffer fig 2 the electron flux of mahr and uasb was proposed based on a previous study mccarty 1986 only the most significant pathway in anaerobic fermentation was proposed though there are other pathways contributing to the production of methane the methane production in mh was assumed to be dominated by the hydrogenotrophic pathway based on the results of thermodynamics analysis and microbial distribution in mh the distribution of the electron flux of hydrogen and methane production in mh was calculated based on the experimental data the calculation of the electron flux was based on the method proposed by rittmann and mccarty 2001 and the microbial growth was not included in the analysis since the most of electron in the reaction 92 contributed to methane 3 results and discussion 3 1 operational performance of mahr and uasb in response to different organic loads mahr showed separated gas production in mh and mm fig 3 a mahr and uasb had a similar total gas production rate from phase 1 to 5 note that the unstable performance of mahr at 70 130 days phase 6 8 was mainly caused by the blockage of the gas outlet of mh fig a1 which may have occurred due to the narrow diameter and growth of the biofilms the blockage led to the gas emission from mh through the gas outlet of mm phase 6 8 this was verified by the increased hydrogen production in mm which was amplified due to the gas produced from mh mixing with the gas produced from mm fig 3b in addition the gas misdirection may have disturbed the biochemical reactions and mass transfer in mm generally mahr had a similar or even lower gas production than uasb when mh didn t function properly phase 6 8 after enlarging the gas outlet of mh phase 9 the gas production in mahr recovered to similar values in phase 4 which had the same hrt and olr as phase 9 this indicated the quick recovery of mahr from the organic loading shock phase 5 7 60 g cod l 1d 1 in comparison uasb maintained a much lower gas production rate in phase 8 9 than that in phase 4 even at the same olr this suggested that uasb had not yet recovered from the organic loading shock when the hrt decreased to 2 h phase 10 a significant production of hydrogen in uasb was observed this indicated the shift of metabolites due to the reduction of the hrt si et al 2015 the methane production rate dramatically decreased due to the low hrt the methane production rate in mahr 18 60 1 83 l d 1 was 66 higher than that in uasb 11 21 1 16 l d 1 indicating the higher organic loading capacity of mahr in comparison to uasb a hydrogen production rate of 0 32 0 11 l d 1 in mahr was achieved at phase 11 hrt 6 h meanwhile a methane production rate of 24 24 2 98 l d 1 was achieved in mahr which was 111 8 higher than that of uasb in general mahr exhibited a higher organic loading capacity and more efficient system recovery from organic loading shock than uasb the gas content in mh demonstrated promising biohythane production results fig 3 d a slight increase of the hydrogen content was observed in mh as the hrt decreased in particular the hydrogen content in mh increased to 18 when the hrt decreased to 6 h but it immediately decreased to 2 this could be attributed to the hydrogen consuming reactions such as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis table a2 similar results were observed by the biofilm reactor for biohydrogen production in which reducing the hrt suppressed the hydrogen consuming reactions but could not remove these bacteria si et al 2015 although the hydrogen content was not comparable with that in a separated and ph controlled hydrogen biofilm reactor 25 40 si et al 2015 a promising amount of biohythane could be achieved in mh the ratio of hydrogen in hythane ranged from 0 to 89 and the adjustment of the ratio of hydrogen in hythane was related to the methane content ranging from 15 to 20 in mh which decreased with the reduction of the hrt a stable ratio of hydrogen in hythane 10 20 was achieved in phase 11 fig 3d this hydrogen to hythane ratio was within the suggested range mehra et al 2017 the produced hythane is a competitive and promising fuel for existing combustion engines and it can be used for vehicle fuels after directly removing the carbon dioxide the difference between the gas content in mm and uasb further confirmed the separation of hydrogen hythane and methane production the gas production in mm maintained a high methane content fig 3e in particular the methane content in mahr ranged from 75 to 80 at a hrt of 12 h phase 3 4 9 this methane content was over 20 higher than that in uasb around 50 the higher methane content in second stage fermentation than single stage fermentation has also been verified in our previous study si et al 2016 this could be attributed to the fact that the substrate for the second stage was mainly vfas which could increase the ratio of methane in the produced gas based on their stoichiometric equations pavlostathis 1991 in addition limited hydrogen production volume content below 0 1 was observed in mm during the stable operation phases phase 3 4 9 10 and 11 this indicated efficient conversion of vfas to methane by hydrogenotrophic methanogens and acetogenesis bacteria the gas produced from mm could be purified for the production of pure methane products and could be incorporated into a natural gas pipeline and the purification cost would be much less than conventional single stage fermentation due to its high content of methane toc conversion and vfa changes further revealed the difference between the metabolism of organics in mahr and uasb fig 4 both mahr and uasb had a toc removal close to 90 after 30 days operation indicating the successful startup of the reactors the toc removal of mahr and uasb in phase 3 reached up to 95 3 3 1 and 89 7 4 9 respectively fig 4a the higher toc removal of mahr in comparison to uasb was also reflected by the concentration of vfas in the effluents a higher concentration of butyric acid was observed in uasb than mahr fig 4 b c this result suggested the enhanced acetogenesis in mahr which converted butyric acid to acetic acid and hydrogen and these products were further converted into methane due to the blockage of mh phase 6 8 as described above the toc removal efficiency in mahr was similar to or even less than that of uasb which was also confirmed by the changes in the vfas concentration the toc removal in mahr quickly recovered to 90 after the hrt returned back to 12 h phase 9 in comparison a toc removal of 50 was achieved in uasb this difference corresponded to the gas production fig 3 suggesting the quicker recovery of mahr than uasb from the organic shock further the hrt decreased to 2 h phase 10 which led to an olr of 120 g cod l 1d 1 a toc removal of 38 1 10 5 and 20 5 6 0 was achieved in mahr and uasb respectively a significant increase of vfas was observed in mahr and uasb an accumulation of propionic and butyric acid was found in both mahr and uasb mahr had lower concentrations of these acids than uasb which suggested enhanced acetogenesis in phase 11 when the hrt was changed to 6 h a toc removal of 75 1 4 6 was achieved in mahr and this value was 34 7 in uasb however the concentration of butyric acid in mahr dramatically decreased whereas butyric acid in uasb remained at a similar level to that in phase 10 one interesting aspect of these results was the low concentration of acetic acid 4 6 mg toc l 1 in mahr whereas that in uasb reached up to 72 54 mg toc l 1 these results suggested the enhanced presence of acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis in mahr compared with uasb this demonstrated a promising prospective application for mahr since acetogenesis has been reported as one of the rate limiting steps in anaerobic fermentation tommaso et al 2015 3 2 thermodynamics of organics conversion in mahr and uasb the difference between mahr and uasb could be further evaluated in depth based on thermodynamics analysis the hydrogen produced during acidogenesis was taken from the liquid phase in the form of hydrogen gas or it was further used for hydrogenotrophic methane production in mh the involved reactions table a2 had a δg 0 ranging from 279 4 to 164 8 kj mol which indicated the thermodynamic favorability of these reactions in mh note that a microenvironment may be formed in mh among the pe rings which may lead to insufficient mass transfer and an increased hydrogen partial pressure in addition unlike previous studies which maintained acidic conditions for hydrogen production sivagurunathan et al 2016 mahr was operated without ph control in this study the added nahco3 which acted as a ph buffer provided a high concentration of hco3 in the fermented liquid phase all of the above conditions thermodynamically favored the reaction of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in mh 4 h 2 hco 3 h ch 4 3 h 2 o δ g 0 135 kj mol hence it was not thermodynamically feasible to avoid methane production and produce a high content of hydrogen in mh however we proved that biohythane with a proper hydrogen ratio could be achieved by reducing the hrt the reduced hrt would improve the mass transfer in the reactor enhance the release of hydrogen gas and further avoid conversion of produced hydrogen through methanogenesis si et al 2015 the accumulation of vfas in mm and uasb was found to be related to the increased hydrogen content fig 5 hydrogen partial pressure changes could significantly affect the gibbs free energy available from the reactions during anaerobic fermentation in particular acetogenesis would be significantly influenced by the gibbs free energy results mccarty 1986 thauer et al 1977 thermodynamics quantification of acetogenesis was conducted to reveal the significant differences between the organics conversion of mahr and uasb after startup of uasb and mahr from phase 1 to 5 30 days the δg of propionic acid and butyric acid acetogenesis was below zero in mahr suggesting well functioning acetogenesis this was confirmed by the organics conversion and vfas concentration fig 4 both the δg of propionic acid and butyric acid acetogenesis in uasb and mahr was above zero at phases 6 8 corresponding to the decreased toc removal and accumulated vfas in particular the δg of propionic acid and butyric acid acetogenesis in mahr was higher than uasb as discussed above the gas outlet of mh was blocked in phases 6 8 as a result the produced hydrogen in mh was rushed into mm and increased the hydrogen partial pressure which made the process thermodynamically unfavorable for acetogenesis in comparison after fixing the gas outlet of mh the δg of propionic acid acetogenesis in mm decreased to below zero in phase 9 further decreasing the hrt to 2 h phase 10 led to the δg reaching a value above zero and thereby the subsequent accumulation of propionic acid in mahr a similar result reported that conversion of propionic acid was kinetically difficult when a shorter hrt was adopted qiao et al 2016 the degradation of butyric acid was more thermodynamically favored than propionic acid which showed an environmental δg predominantly below zero in phases 9 11 in mahr fig 5 in general acetogenesis in mm was thermodynamically favorable compared with uasb which led to a strengthened organics conversion and methane production in mm this was attributed to the critical role of mh which enhanced acetogenesis in mm via the extraction of hydrogen further this also explains the reason why two stage fermentation was more advantageous than conventional single stage fermentation as the organic loading capacity and organic conversion increased 3 3 microbial community analysis the difference between the gas production and organics conversion performance of uasb and mahr indicated a significant difference in their microbial structure after long term operation sem pictures show that the center of both granules in uasb fig a2 b and mm fig a2 f had coccus shaped microbes as for the biofilm in mh it was dominated by rod shaped bacteria fig a2 2d ternary plot analysis based on illumina miseq sequencing further confirmed the difference between the microbial structure among mh mm and uasb fig 6 according to the analysis uasb and mh showed similar distributions of bacteria on a phylum level both reactors contained an abundance of the enriched phylum firmicutes the phylum firmicutes is usually observed in hydrogen production reactors in two stage fermentation systems which suggested a function of domain acidogenesis and hydrogen production si et al 2016 compared with uasb and mh the phylum proteobacteria synergistetes actinobacteria and chloroflexi were mostly associated with mm as for the archaea only the phylum euryarchaeota was found and it tended to be enriched by uasb and mm a further comparison of the distribution of bacteria and archaea at the family level is illustrated in fig 7 a uasb and mh had a much higher distribution of the family bacteroidaceae peh08 clostridiaceae eubacteriaceae lachnospiraceae erysipelotrichaceae and enterobacteriaceae than the distribution of these families in mm all these bacteria were reported to be related to acidogenesis si et al 2016 some of them such as clostridiaceae and enterobacteriaceae are representative hydrogen producers lee et al 2011 mm enriched the family propionibacteriaceae anaerolineaceae streptococcaceae christensenellaceae syntrophomonadaceae desulfovibrionaceae syntrophobacteraceae and synergistaceae as for the archaea methane producers were found in all reactor zones which was further validated by the composition of the produced gas fig 2 the family methanobacteriaceae was the dominant archaea group in uasb mm and mh and it reached its highest abundance 74 7 in mh in order to further reveal the role of microbes during the metabolic pathways of organics and gas production the relative abundance of functional bacteria and archaea was examined fig 7b functions of dominant families were classified on the family level according to the literature si et al 2016 rosenberg et al 2014 mh had the highest abundance of bacteria up to 82 94 related to acidogenesis in comparison mm had the lowest acidogenesis bacteria content as for the acetogenesis bacteria mm had the highest distribution 21 69 acetogenesis bacteria grow in obligate syntrophy with methanogens and convert substrates that are not or not easily used for methane production such as butyric and propionic acid to acetic acid and hydrogen stams and plugge 2009 these results demonstrated a dominant functional separation of acidogenesis and acetogenesis in mh and mm respectively the content of acetogenesis bacteria in mahr was higher than that in uasb indicating an enhanced vfas conversion which has been confirmed by the vfas distribution fig 4 similar microbial distribution differences between one stage and two stage fermentation were also reported in a previous study when a one stage biomethane system was shifted to a two stage biohythane system si et al 2016 the family peh08 in uasb reached up to 25 44 and its function needs further investigation for the methane producers in uasb and mahr the dominant archaea was related to the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway mh showed a high distribution of hydrogenotrophic methanogens this corresponded to the robust methane production and low hydrogen yield in mh fig 3 in comparison mm contained a higher abundance of acetoclastic methanogens than mh and uasb which could effectively convert the acetate produced from acetogenesis this result corresponded to the lower acetic acid concentration in the effluent of mahr in comparison to uasb fig 4 further the microbial structure metabolites distribution and thermodynamics were combined to reveal the biochemical pathways in uasb and mahr fig 8 acidogenesis was the dominant biochemical reaction in mh which produced hydrogen and vfas the high content of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in mh could be explained by its high hydrogen partial pressure which is beneficial for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis from a thermodynamic perspective the low hrt in mh tended to get rid of acetoclastic methanogens rather than hydrogenotrophic methanogens due to their much slower specific growth rate than the latter pavlostathis 1991 generally speaking the enhanced acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis which were promoted enriching specific microbes in mahr strengthened the organics removal and biogas production compared with uasb fig 8b this was also supported by one recent study which found that the lower organics conversion in the single stage configuration in comparison to the two stage fermentation was mainly correlated to the low abundance of acetogenesis bacteria and to the absence of acetoclastic methanogens fontana et al 2018 in conventional uasb fig 8c the hydrogen partial pressure increases as the organic load increases thus acetogenesis is easily to be inhibited from a thermodynamic perspective regarding mahr the hydrogen partial pressure remained at a low level due to the extraction of a substantial amount of hydrogen in mh hence acetogenesis was strengthened and the related microbes were enriched in mm 3 4 outlook in this study mahr produced biohythane and biomethane at the same time demonstrating advantageous aspects over traditional uasb including a stronger tolerance to a high olr an enhanced organics removal and an improved energy recovery however mahr was operated with synthetic wastewater in this study and real waste streams need to be further verified it can be speculated that waste streams with a high content of carbohydrates would be suitable substrates for mahr such as palm oil mill effluent krishnan et al 2017 coffee wastewater jung et al 2012 and household waste liu et al 2006 it s worth noting that mahr also has potential to treat toxic wastewater due to the fact that it demonstrated a strengthened presence of acetogenesis the syntrophic communities consisted of acetogenesis bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens known to be involved in the degradation of substrates that cannot be fermented by individual species alone stams and plugge 2009 furthermore these communities have also demonstrated the ability to cooperatively degrade aromatic polyaromatic and hydrocarbon compounds morris et al 2013 previous studies have also confirmed the active role of acetogenesis bacteria when dealing with post hydrothermal liquefaction wastewater which contains phenols and n heterocyclic compounds si et al 2019 however a waste steam containing a high concentration of metal ions ammonia or sulfur would be a challenge for mahr to convert this is due to the fact that the effluent from the hydrogen hythane production zone directly feeds into the methane production zone which would cause a shock to the sensitive methanogens a possible manner to compensate is adjusting the methane production zone via recycling the effluent or diluting water in the section connecting the hydrogen hythane production zones however these methods need further investigation in addition studies involving the long term 1 2 years operation and implementation of pilot or full scale mahr are required to ascertain if this type of reactor can be replicated in a real anaerobic fermentation system another advantage is that mahr is able of separating the hydrogen hythane and methane production using a gradient hrt based on the reactor configuration hence mahr does not require the incorporation of an online ph detection and control system like conventional two stage fermentation maintaining a ph gradient in conventional two stage fermentation would significantly increase the economic input and is a concern for future application of the digestate in addition the inoculum for the startup of mahr would be easier to implement compared to a separated two stage high rate reactor there may be no requirement for heat chemical shock or acid base pretreatment for the inoculum of mh to screen hydrogen production microbes since the gradient hrt had proven could effectively separate the hydrogen hythane and methane production and adjust the hythane production in mh this would avoid a significant energy and economic cost for the large scale implementation of this type of reactor krishnan et al 2019 however note that the mahr should be designed on a case by case basis according to the characteristics of the feedstock a kinetic analysis based on batch experiments is suggested before designing mahr in addition the configuration for mh and mm should also be taken into account since the configuration would affect the sludge retention time the separated reaction zone in mahr increased the complexity of the configuration compared with typical high rate reactor thus proper design of the parameters is required to avoid malfunctions for example the internal connection of the biohydrogen biohythane zone and biomethane zone which are responsible for the separated functional microbial communities biofilms granular sludge and liquid products has a complicated flow field which may lead to an unstable flow and subsequently hamper the performance of the methane production zone in addition the three phase separator on top of mahr has the potential to malfunction after long term operation e g the blockage of the gas outlet of mh in this study hence the design of operational parameters based on the optimization of hydrodynamic characteristics is necessary the optimization of hydrodynamic conditions would benefit the microbial morphology and community structure saur et al 2016 for example a higher ratio of reactor height to diameter can ensure a lon ger circular flowing trajectory which in turn creates a more effective hydraulic attrition to microbial aggregates liu and tay 2002 in addition the design parameters affect the mass transfer and metabolism of organics enhanced mass transfer can accelerate biochemical reactions by improving the contact of the microbes with the bulk solution and it also avoids the side reactions and inhibition caused by the end products si et al 2015 another concern is that the mh was constructed by a packed bed in this study which may lead to blockage after long term operation speece 1996 hence further improvement of the configuration of mh is necessary 4 conclusion this study demonstrated continuous biohythane production via an innovative mahr including two stage fermentation in one reactor without complicated controls mahr could produce biohythane with a proper ratio for vehicle fuels and high content of methane at the same time moreover mahr showed a stronger capability of tolerating a high olr and demonstrated enhanced organic conversion in comparison to conventional uasb metabolites flux and microbial structure analysis revealed enhanced acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis this enhancement could be attributed to the hydrogen extraction in the hydrogen production zone which decreased the hydrogen partial pressure and thermodynamically favored acetogenesis further modifications of mahr are expected and necessary in order to accommodate different feedstocks and reaction scenarios declaration of competing interest

fc treated wastewater chloroform concentration increased after treatment uv c fc process resulted in a significant decrease residual concentrations below the loq even after 24 h and 48 h post treatment incubation the formation of radicals due to uv c fc process can reduce thms compared to chlorination process because part of fc reacts with uv c radiation to form radicals and it is no longer available to form thms these results are encouraging in terms of possible use of uv c fc process as advanced treatment of urban wastewater even for possible effluent reuse graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes contaminants of emerging concern disinfection by products pesticides pharmaceuticals wastewater reuse 1 introduction urban wastewater treatment plants uwtps are hotspots for the release into the environment of organic micro pollutants including chemicals such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides hormones and synthesis products michael et al 2013 schröder et al 2016 and biological elements such as antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes cacace et al 2019 rizzo et al 2013 also known as contaminants of emerging concern cecs although chemical cecs are released into surface water at concentrations in the range of ngl 1 μgl 1 they can accumulate into the aquatic environment resulting in unpredictable chronic toxic effects to humans and ecosystems brooks et al 2009 furthermore higher concern is related to the use of treated wastewater for crop irrigation because plants can uptake such contaminants christou et al 2019 ferro et al 2015 thus resulting in increasing risk for human health kohl et al 2019 malchi et al 2014 conventional uwtps are not designed to remove cecs krzeminski et al 2019 and the lack of specific regulation still under discussion at eu level rizzo et al 2018 refrains managers to upgrade uwtps however some countries such as switzerland due to the implementation of a new water protection act in 2016 and germany have taken this problem seriously and are upgrading uwtps with advanced treatments methods including ozonation o3 and activated carbon adsorption ac and specifically designed to remove cecs rizzo et al 2019b although recognized among the best available technologies such consolidated methods present some disadvantages including formation of oxidation by products o3 and poor disinfection efficiency ac respectively and can require for an additional post treatment step which will increase the cost rizzo et al 2019b other conventional tertiary treatment methods such as chlorination hua et al 2019 peracetic acid and uv c radiation rizzo et al 2019a are poorly effective in the removal of cecs and additionally chlorination results in the formation of toxic by products such as trihalomethanes thms richardson et al 2007 advanced oxidation processes aops produce radicals species among which hydroxyl radicals ho that can effectively remove a wide range of cecs and inactivate pathogens so they represent a possible alternative to o3 and ac as tertiary treatment method of urban wastewater among aops homogeneous photo driven processes such as uv h2o2 and photo fenton are a perspective attractive option fiorentino et al 2019 miralles cuevas et al 2017 however taking into account that photo fenton efficiency is affected by ph and chelating agents may be necessary to operate at neutral ph conditions de luca et al 2014 fiorentino et al 2018 and uv h2o2 may be not sufficiently effective in the removal of some cecs ferro et al 2015 the investigation of new photo driven aops such as uv free chlorine fc process is attracting increasing interest in addition to ho radicals uv fc process can produce chlorine radical cl eqs 1 3 d wang et al 2012a and secondary radical species such as clo eqs 4 7 guo et al 2018 hua et al 2019 1 hocl hν ho cl 2 ocl hν o cl 3 o h ho 4 hocl ho clo h2o 5 ocl ho clo oh 6 hocl cl clo h cl 7 ocl cl clo cl radicals formation makes uv c fc process more effective than fc in the inactivation of microorganisms in water systems rattanakul and oguma 2017 li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 however the effect of the uv c fc process on the removal of cecs from real wastewater has been poorly investigated so far as well as possible effects of uv c radiation on the formation of thms this issue is of additional interest taking into account that i the chlorination process is increasingly replaced by alternative disinfection processes in uwtps e g peracetic acid and uv c radiation respectively antonelli et al 2013 di cesare et al 2016 formisano et al 2016 because of its toxicity and ii thms are regulated in treated wastewater to be reused italy accordingly in this study four cecs carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf sulfamethoxazole smx and imidacloprid imd were selected as model pollutants to evaluate the efficiency of uv c fc process as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater the target micro contaminants were selected because they are representative of different groups of cecs anticonvulsant analgesic antibiotic and insecticide respectively as well as because typically detected in water and wastewater klavarioti et al 2009 petrie et al 2014 moreover the effect of uv c radiation on the formation of thms during and after the treatment incubation at 24 and 48 h through the comparison between fc and uv c fc processes was evaluated possible reactions that can take place in real urban wastewater treated by uv c fc process are also proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals cbz dcf and smx of high

bottles and stored at 4 c for a maximum of two days 2 3 uv c free chlorine and control experiments 2 3 1 dark control tests at lab scale possible chlorine effects on the degradation of the target cecs were preliminary evaluated through 60 min tests under dark conditions accordingly 5 l bottles were filled in with the target water matrix and spiked with the cecs aqueous solutions to achieve the desired initial concentration 200 μgl 1 for each contaminant the aqueous matrix was stirred for a few minutes and a control sample was taken to measure the initial concentration of the contaminants just before the proper volume of chlorine solution was added to achieve 10 mg l 1 of initial fc dose this concentration i was selected according to previous experiments cerreta et al 2019 ii it is consistent with chlorine doses used in uwtps and iii it allows to keep a detectable residual fc at the end of the process 2 3 2 uv c and uv c free chlorine tests uv c and photo driven aop tests were

hodgeson et al 1995 and the validated method reported by nikolaou et al 2005 briefly 35 ml of water were put into a 40 ml glass vial which was immediately closed 2 g of na2so4 were added to the vial and gently stirred avoiding the formation of bubbles after this 2 ml of mtbe were put into the vial and it was shaken vigorously and consistently by hand for 1 min the vials were left for 2 min to allow the separation of the water and mtbe phases then approximately 200 μl were transferred with a pasteur pipette into a glass insert placed in a 2 ml glass vial which was closed immediately a calibration set was prepared in 40 ml vials considering a final volume of 35 ml equal to the real sample volume using lc ms water the concentration of the standards was 0 6 1 2 5 5 10 and 25 μg l 1 of

acetone and put into an oven at 70 c for 1 h open and clean glassware was capped with aluminum foil 3 results and discussion 3 1 free chlorine vs uv c free chlorine process effect on free chlorine consumption the effect of fc and uv c fc processes on fc consumption was observed in ww using 10 mgl 1 of chlorine fig 1 after 60 min of treatment residual fc was 5 8 mgl 1 and 1 7 mgl 1 using chlorination alone and uv c fc processes respectively quvc 1 33 kj l 1 as chlorine is added to natural water or wastewater the reactions occurring between chlorine and water constituents can be described by the following general relationship chlorine demand chlorine dose residual chlorine where chlorine dose is the chlorine added to the aqueous matrix residual chlorine is the chlorine concentration measured after a given contact time and chlorine demand is the result of the reactions in which the chlorine dose is consumed by organic toc and inorganic compounds occurring in the aqueous matrix those with metals e g iron and manganese and nitrogen compounds namely no2 and nh3 are relevant among the reactions involving chlorine and inorganic species snoeyink and jenkins 1980 in particular the reaction between hocl and nh3 results in the formation of chloramines combined residual chlorine the higher fc consumption during uv c fc process could be attributed to the generation of radicals from chlorine photolysis according to eqs 1 7 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2018 hua et al 2019 d wang et al 2012a r yin et al 2018b faster chlorine decay with the uv c fc process was observed in a recent study hua et al 2019 wang et al 2019 at an initial chlorine concentration lower than 10 mgl 1 and low uv dose which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2015 watts and linden 2007 3 2 free chlorine vs uv c free chlorine process effect of uv c radiation on the removal of contaminants of emerging concern the effect of uv c fc process on cecs degradation was evaluated using 10 mgl 1 of fc in ww cecs concentration was quite stable under dark conditions residual fc 5 8 mgl 1 fig 2 a while 87 of cecs degradation was reached after 60 min of uv c fc treatment quvc 1 33 kj l 1 residual fc 1 7 mgl 1 uv c fc process resulted in 90 degradation of dcf smx and imd after 12 25 and 30 min treatment fig si1 fig si4 quvc 0 27 0 56 0 67 kj l 1 respectively fig 2b a lower degradation was observed for cbz 49 5 after 60 min and 1 33 kj l 1 control tests using uv c radiation as standalone process were performed in our previous work in natural water during 120 min cerreta et al 2019 uv c radiation significantly affected cecs removal 77 degradation with a quvc of 2 67 kj l 1 in particular imd and smx were completely degraded after 30 min while 45 min needed for dcf on the opposite cbz was poorly degraded only 14 of removal after 120 min the effect of chlorination process on cecs has been investigated in previous studies cbz was poorly degraded 5 5 within 5 min using similar chlorine dosages wang et al 2016 this result is consistent with that one observed in a previous work 6 mg l 1 of chlorine 15 min treatment in tap water spiked with 100 mg l 1 of citric acid to enrich doc where dcf 30 and smx 100 degradations were also investigated sichel et al 2011 imd also showed a low reactivity in ww with 20 mgl 1 of chlorine chen et al 2018 the uv c fc process has been investigated and found to be effective in the degradation of cecs feng et al 2007 jin et al 2011 sichel et al 2011 watts and linden 2007 and ho and reactive chlorine species rcs have been found to contribute to their degradation fang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2016 more specifically cbz was efficiently degraded by uv c fc in wastewater but the occurrence of competing organic e g nom and inorganic substances decreased cbz degradation rates compared to deionized water matrix wang et al 2016 nom can absorb uv light thus reducing the rate of oh and cl production but it can also act as radicals scavenger fang et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 an enhanced degradation of imd by uv c fc process 20 mg l 1 of chlorine and lp hg lamps compared to uv c process alone was also observed in a previous study chen et al 2018 3 2 1 effect of water matrix when ww sample was diluted in 1 1 ratio with deionized water no particular water matrix effect was observed on cecs removal when chlorination process 10 mg l 1 60 min treatment was tested fig 3 however when uv c fc process was investigated in dww a difference in the degradation rates of the target cecs compared to ww matrix was observed fig si1 si4 in particular for cbz 71 degradation in dww vs 49 5 in ww after 60 min of treatment quvc 1 33 fig 3 cecs degradation by uv c fc process was slower in ww compared to dww possibly because of a lower formation of radicals in ww matrix due to both i the faster fc consumption because of the higher oxidant demand and ii the less effective uv c light penetration compared to dww matrix when the effect of uv c fc process on cecs was investigated in ww and deionized aqueous solutions in previous works a water matrix effect was observed consistently with our results uv c fc process could efficiently degrade cbz in ww although the degradation was reduced by about 30 compared with that in deionized water wang et al 2016 smx and dcf were also effectively degraded by uv c fc process in different water matrices with increased organic load and similar fc doses sichel et al 2011 differently but consistently with our results a worsening of imd removal by uv c fc process using complex water matrices 20 mgl 1 of chlorine was observed in a previuos study k yin et al 2018a 3 3 free chlorine vs uv c free chlorine process effect of uv c radiation on trihalomethanes thms are potential carcinogenic organohalogenated compounds the respective cancer descriptors according to united states environmental protection agency epa 2018 are given in table si4 resulting from the reaction among fc bromide and natural organic matter nom which have been detected the first time in chlorinated water in the early 70s bellar et al 1974 rook 1974 the thms include chloroform clf dichlorobromomethane dcbm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform brf the effect of uv c radiation on the formation of chloroform can be observed from fig 4 in chlorinated ww under dark conditions a clf concentration of 2 3 μgl 1 was measured after 60 min while 90 degradation was observed after 30 min of uv c fc treatment quvc 0 66 kj l 1 only clf and dcbm below the loq and just for fc tests were detected the concentration of the other two thms being zero in all samples table si5 the formation of thms in chlorinated ww has received far less attention matamoros et al 2007 sun et al 2009 than chlorination of drinking water gallard and von gunten 2002 gao et al 2019 hua and reckhow 2007 reckhow et al 1990 richardson et al 2007 and the effect uv c radiation on the formation of thms during the removal of cecs from real wastewater by uv c fc process has not yet been investigated to our knowledge the possible reactions occurring in uv c fc treated real ww are summarized in the scheme proposed in fig 5 according to the discussion in the previous paragraphs the reaction between fc organic matter toc and bromide br results in the formation of thms 1 however the formation of radicals due to uv c fc process 2 can decrease thms presence 3 compared to chlorination process alone because part of fc reacts with uv c radiation to form radicals and it is no longer available to form thms and radicals can also degrade thms moreover thms can also be reduced by volatilization mainly chloroform table si4 4 radicals degrade the target cecs 5 but are also scavenged by toc and other substances including carbonates and salts 6 fc is also consumed by the oxidation of metals and nitrogen compounds 7 finally toc can absorb uv c radiation 8 3 3 1 post treatment incubation effect on trihalomethanes formation typically in ww reuse practice treated effluent is stored for some hours days in a tank to be used for crop irrigation as necessary however residual fc will keep reacting with substances in ww during storing and thms are expected to form as well therefore in order to investigate possible formation of thms during treated ww storage thms were measured even after incubation for 24 h and 48 h respectively fig 6 the formation of thms were close to the detection limit but for chloroform which concentration was finally plotted in fig 6 the concentrations of the thms measured in ww tests are given in table si5 after 60 min of fc treatment 1 69 and 1 86 μgl 1 of clf were formed in dww and ww respectively furthermore after the incubation at 24 and 48 h clf concentration increased more specifically 3 73 and 6 24 μgl 1 clf concentrations were observed after 24 h in dww and ww respectively while after 48 h clf concentration was 4 84 μgl 1 in dww and 8 52 μgl 1 in ww the initial concentration of clf just after uv c fc process 60 min treatment was significantly lower below loq for both dww and ww than fc process and it remained below the loq even after 24 and 48 h of incubation in both dww and ww samples it is worthy to note that while the other thms were not detected in uv c fc treated ww samples even after 24 and 48 h of incubation they were detected in fc tests table si5 in particular dcbm which was under the loq after 60 min fc treatment increased up to 1 7 and 2 82 μgl 1 after 24 and 48 h respectively dbcm was not detected during fc tests but 1 07 μgl 1 were measured after 48 h incubation finally brf was also detected after 48 h even if at a concentration below the loq in a previous work the synergistic effect of the sequential use of uv irradiation and chlorine to disinfect reclaimed water was investigated in terms of bacteria inactivation and formation of thms x wang et al 2012b the authors observed results consistent with those achieved in our work as matter of fact the concentration of thms in pre chlorinated wastewater was 16 0 μg l 1 and decreased to 14 9 μg l 1 after uv c irradiation 11 w low pressure lamp 15 mj cm 2 in another study the authors also observed an increase in the thms concentration during chlorination as the contact time increased from 30 min to 210 min el dib and ali 1995 and thms formation continued even in the post treatment consistently with our results 4 conclusions unlike of fc process uv c fc was really effective in the degradation of the target cecs in ww high degradation 90 of dcf smx and imd after 12 25 and 30 min treatment respectively quvc 0 44 0 56 and 0 67 kj l 1 respectively was achieved while a lower degradation rate was observed for cbz 49 5 after 60 min and 1 33 kj l 1 as thms formation is of concern their concentration mainly chloroform remained below the limit set by italian regulation for wastewater reuse for both treatments fc and uv c fc processes even after 24 h and 48 h of post treatment incubation most important while in fc treated ww and dww chloroform concentration increased after treatment uv c fc process resulted in a significant decrease residual concentrations below the loq even after 24 h and 48 h compared to fc these results are encouraging in terms of possible use of uv c fc process as advanced treatment of urban wastewater even

formation makes uv c fc process more effective than fc in the inactivation of microorganisms in water systems rattanakul and oguma 2017 li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 however the effect of the uv c fc process on the removal of cecs from real wastewater has been poorly investigated so far as well as possible effects of uv c radiation on the formation of thms this issue is of additional interest taking into account that i the chlorination process is increasingly replaced by alternative disinfection processes in uwtps e g peracetic acid and uv c radiation respectively antonelli et al 2013 di cesare et al 2016 formisano et al 2016 because of its toxicity and ii thms are regulated in treated wastewater to be reused italy accordingly in this study four cecs carbamazepine cbz diclofenac dcf sulfamethoxazole smx and imidacloprid imd were selected as model pollutants to evaluate the efficiency of uv c fc process as tertiary treatment of urban wastewater the target micro contaminants were selected because they are representative of different groups of cecs anticonvulsant analgesic antibiotic and insecticide respectively as well as because typically detected in water and wastewater klavarioti et al 2009 petrie et al 2014 moreover the effect of uv c radiation on the formation of thms during and after the treatment incubation at 24 and 48 h through the comparison between fc and uv c fc processes was evaluated possible reactions that can take place in real urban wastewater treated by uv c fc process are also proposed 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals cbz dcf and smx of high purity grade 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich while imd purity 97 9 was supplied by bayer hispania s a barcelona spain cecs aqueous solutions were prepared by simultaneously dissolving cbz smx and

bottles and stored at 4 c for a maximum of two days 2 3 uv c free chlorine and control experiments 2 3 1 dark control tests at lab scale possible chlorine effects on the degradation of the target cecs were preliminary evaluated through 60 min tests under dark conditions accordingly 5 l bottles were filled in with the target water matrix and spiked with the cecs aqueous solutions to achieve the desired initial concentration 200 μgl 1 for each contaminant the aqueous matrix was stirred for a few minutes and a control sample was taken to measure the initial concentration of the contaminants just before the proper volume of chlorine solution was added to achieve 10 mg l 1 of initial fc dose this concentration i was selected according to previous experiments cerreta et al 2019 ii it is consistent with chlorine doses used in uwtps and iii it allows to keep a detectable residual fc at the end of the process 2 3 2 uv c and uv c free chlorine tests uv c and photo driven aop tests were

loq limit of detection lod and maximum absorption for the cecs are shown in table si2 in supplementary information file 2 4 3 measurement of trihalomethanes 1 ml of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate 20 mgl 1 was added to 125 ml samples just after sampling to quench residual chlorine an agilent gc system 7890b agilent technologies palo alto ca usa was interfaced to an agilent quadrupole analyzer

hodgeson et al 1995 and the validated method reported by nikolaou et al 2005 briefly 35 ml of water were put into a 40 ml glass vial which was immediately closed 2 g of na2so4 were added to the vial and gently stirred avoiding the formation of bubbles after this 2 ml of mtbe were put into the vial and it was shaken vigorously and consistently by hand for 1 min the vials were left for 2 min to allow the separation of the water and mtbe phases then approximately 200 μl were transferred with a pasteur pipette into a glass insert placed in a 2 ml glass vial which was closed immediately a calibration set was prepared in 40 ml vials considering a final volume of 35 ml equal to the real sample volume using lc ms water the concentration of the standards was 0 6 1 2 5 5 10 and 25 μg l 1 of

acetone and put into an oven at 70 c for 1 h open and clean glassware was capped with aluminum foil 3 results and discussion 3 1 free chlorine vs uv c free chlorine process effect on free chlorine consumption the effect of fc and uv c fc processes on fc consumption was observed in ww using 10 mgl 1 of chlorine fig 1 after 60 min of treatment residual fc was 5 8 mgl 1 and 1 7 mgl 1 using chlorination alone and uv c fc processes respectively quvc 1 33 kj l 1 as chlorine is added to natural water or wastewater the reactions occurring between chlorine and water constituents can be described by the following general relationship chlorine demand chlorine dose residual chlorine where chlorine dose is the chlorine added to the aqueous matrix residual chlorine is the chlorine concentration measured after a given contact time and chlorine demand is the result of the reactions in which the chlorine dose is consumed by organic toc and inorganic compounds occurring in the aqueous matrix those with metals e g iron and manganese and nitrogen compounds namely no2 and nh3 are relevant among the reactions involving chlorine and inorganic species snoeyink and jenkins 1980 in particular the reaction between hocl and nh3 results in the formation of chloramines combined residual chlorine the higher fc consumption during uv c fc process could be attributed to the generation of radicals from chlorine photolysis according to eqs 1 7 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2018 hua et al 2019 d wang et al 2012a r yin et al 2018b faster chlorine decay with the uv c fc process was observed in a recent study hua et al 2019 wang et al 2019 at an initial chlorine concentration lower than 10 mgl 1 and low uv dose which is consistent with previous studies wang et al 2015 watts and linden 2007 3 2 free chlorine vs uv c free chlorine process effect of uv c radiation on the removal of contaminants of emerging concern the effect of uv c fc process on cecs degradation was evaluated using 10 mgl 1 of fc in ww cecs concentration was quite stable under dark conditions residual fc 5 8 mgl 1 fig 2 a while 87 of cecs degradation was reached after 60 min of uv c fc treatment quvc 1 33 kj l 1 residual fc 1 7 mgl 1 uv c fc process resulted in 90 degradation of dcf smx and imd after 12 25 and 30 min treatment fig si1 fig si4 quvc 0 27 0 56 0 67 kj l 1 respectively fig 2b a lower degradation was observed for cbz 49 5 after 60 min and 1 33 kj l 1 control tests using uv c radiation as standalone process were performed in our previous work in natural water during 120 min cerreta et al 2019 uv c radiation significantly affected cecs removal 77 degradation with a quvc of 2 67 kj l 1 in particular imd and smx were completely degraded after 30 min while 45 min needed for dcf on the opposite cbz was poorly degraded only 14 of removal after 120 min the effect of chlorination process on cecs has been investigated in previous studies cbz was poorly degraded 5 5 within 5 min using similar chlorine dosages wang et al 2016 this result is consistent with that one observed in a previous work 6 mg l 1 of chlorine 15 min treatment in tap water spiked with 100 mg l 1 of citric acid to enrich doc where dcf 30 and smx 100 degradations were also investigated sichel et al 2011 imd also showed a low reactivity in ww with 20 mgl 1 of chlorine chen et al 2018 the uv c fc process has been investigated and found to be effective in the degradation of cecs feng et al 2007 jin et al 2011 sichel et al 2011 watts and linden 2007 and ho and reactive chlorine species rcs have been found to contribute to their degradation fang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2016 more specifically cbz was efficiently degraded by uv c fc in wastewater but the occurrence of competing organic e g nom and inorganic substances decreased cbz degradation rates compared to deionized water matrix wang et al 2016 nom can absorb uv light thus reducing the rate of oh and cl production but it can also act as radicals scavenger fang et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 an enhanced degradation of imd by uv c fc process 20 mg l 1 of chlorine and lp hg lamps compared to uv c process alone was also observed in a previous study chen et al 2018 3 2 1 effect of water matrix when ww sample was diluted in 1 1 ratio with deionized water no particular water matrix effect was observed on cecs removal when chlorination process 10 mg l 1 60 min treatment was tested fig 3 however when uv c fc process was investigated in dww a difference in the degradation rates of the target cecs compared to ww matrix was observed fig si1 si4 in particular for cbz 71 degradation in dww vs 49 5 in ww after 60 min of treatment quvc 1 33 fig 3 cecs degradation by uv c fc process was slower in ww compared to dww possibly because of a lower formation of radicals in ww matrix due to both i the faster fc consumption because of the higher oxidant demand and ii the less effective uv c light penetration compared to dww matrix when the effect of uv c fc process on cecs was investigated in ww and deionized aqueous solutions in previous works a water matrix effect was observed consistently with our results uv c fc process could efficiently degrade cbz in ww although the degradation was reduced by about 30 compared with that in deionized water wang et al 2016 smx and dcf were also effectively degraded by uv c fc process in different water matrices with increased organic load and similar fc doses sichel et al 2011 differently but consistently with our results a worsening of imd removal by uv c fc process using complex water matrices 20 mgl 1 of chlorine was observed in a previuos study k yin et al 2018a 3 3 free chlorine vs uv c free chlorine process effect of uv c radiation on trihalomethanes thms are potential carcinogenic organohalogenated compounds the respective cancer descriptors according to united states environmental protection agency epa 2018 are given in table si4 resulting from the reaction among fc bromide and natural organic matter nom which have been detected the first time in chlorinated water in the early 70s bellar et al 1974 rook 1974 the thms include chloroform clf dichlorobromomethane dcbm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromoform brf the effect of uv c radiation on the formation of chloroform can be observed from fig 4 in chlorinated ww under dark conditions a clf concentration of 2 3 μgl 1 was measured after 60 min while 90 degradation was observed after 30 min of uv c fc treatment quvc 0 66 kj l 1 only clf and dcbm below the loq and just for fc tests were detected the concentration of the other two thms being zero in all samples table si5 the formation of thms in chlorinated ww has received far less attention matamoros et al 2007 sun et al 2009 than chlorination of drinking water gallard and von gunten 2002 gao et al 2019 hua and reckhow 2007 reckhow et al 1990 richardson et al 2007 and the effect uv c radiation on the formation of thms during the removal of cecs from real wastewater by uv c fc process has not yet been investigated to our knowledge the possible reactions occurring in uv c fc treated real ww are summarized in the scheme proposed in fig 5 according to the discussion in the previous paragraphs the reaction between fc organic matter toc and bromide br results in the formation of thms 1 however the formation of radicals due to uv c fc process 2 can decrease thms presence 3 compared to chlorination process alone because part of fc reacts with uv c radiation to form radicals and it is no longer available to form thms and radicals can also degrade thms moreover thms can also be reduced by volatilization mainly chloroform table si4 4 radicals degrade the target cecs 5 but are also scavenged by toc and other substances including carbonates and salts 6 fc is also consumed by the oxidation of metals and nitrogen compounds 7 finally toc can absorb uv c radiation 8 3 3 1 post treatment incubation effect on trihalomethanes formation typically in ww reuse practice treated effluent is stored for some hours days in a tank to be used for crop irrigation as necessary however residual fc will keep reacting with substances in ww during storing and thms are expected to form as well therefore in order to investigate possible formation of thms during treated ww storage thms were measured even after incubation for 24 h and 48 h respectively fig 6 the formation of thms were close to the detection limit but for chloroform which concentration was finally plotted in fig 6 the concentrations of the thms measured in ww tests are given in table si5 after 60 min of fc treatment 1 69 and 1 86 μgl 1 of clf were formed in dww and ww respectively furthermore after the incubation at 24 and 48 h clf concentration increased more specifically 3 73 and 6 24 μgl 1 clf concentrations were observed after 24 h in dww and ww respectively while after 48 h clf concentration was 4 84 μgl 1 in dww and 8 52 μgl 1 in ww the initial concentration of clf just after uv c fc process 60 min treatment was significantly lower below loq for both dww and ww than fc process and it remained below the loq even after 24 and 48 h of incubation in both dww and ww samples it is worthy to note that while the other thms were not detected in uv c fc treated ww samples even after 24 and 48 h of incubation they were detected in fc tests table si5 in particular dcbm which was under the loq after 60 min fc treatment increased up to 1 7 and 2 82 μgl 1 after 24 and 48 h respectively dbcm was not detected during fc tests but 1 07 μgl 1 were measured after 48 h incubation finally brf was also detected after 48 h even if at a concentration below the loq in a previous work the synergistic effect of the sequential use of uv irradiation and chlorine to disinfect reclaimed water was investigated in terms of bacteria inactivation and formation of thms x wang et al 2012b the authors observed results consistent with those achieved in our work as matter of fact the concentration of thms in pre chlorinated wastewater was 16 0 μg l 1 and decreased to 14 9 μg l 1 after uv c irradiation 11 w low pressure lamp 15 mj cm 2 in another study the authors also observed an increase in the thms concentration during chlorination as the contact time increased from 30 min to 210 min el dib and ali 1995 and thms formation continued even in the post treatment consistently with our results 4 conclusions unlike of fc process uv c fc was really effective in the degradation of the target cecs in ww high degradation 90 of dcf smx and imd after 12 25 and 30 min treatment respectively quvc 0 44 0 56 and 0 67 kj l 1 respectively was achieved while a lower degradation rate was observed for cbz 49 5 after 60 min and 1 33 kj l 1 as thms formation is of concern their concentration mainly chloroform remained below the limit set by italian regulation for wastewater reuse for both treatments fc and uv c fc processes even after 24 h and 48 h of post treatment incubation most important while in fc treated ww and dww chloroform concentration increased after treatment uv c fc process resulted in a significant decrease residual concentrations below the loq even after 24 h and 48 h compared to fc these results are encouraging in terms of possible use of uv c fc process as advanced treatment of urban wastewater even

18337,phosphorus removal and recovery from waste streams are crucial to prevent eutrophication and sustain fertilizer production as has been shown in our previous papers electrochemical treatment has the potential to achieve this goal however the adoption of electrochemical approach is limited by its high energy consumption here we investigate the possibility of electrochemical phosphorus removal at extremely low current density using graphite felt as the cathode we found a current density as low as 0 04 a m2 can enhance the removal of phosphate in our electrochemical system the removal of phosphate at extremely low current density resulted from electrochemical induced calcium phosphate precipitation and not by electrochemical adsorption electrochemical treatment of real domestic wastewater at 0 2 a m2 almost eliminates the precipitation of mg oh 2 and limits the formation of caco3 the recovered precipitates are dominated by calcium phosphate 59 followed by 35 caco3 and 6 mg oh 2 the specific energy consumption of this newly electrochemical system is between 4 4 and 26 4 kw h kg p which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than our previous system 110 2238 kw h kg p key factors for this improvement prove to be enlarged precipitation area and hydroxide flux retardation by graphite felt practically our study offers a potential way to reduce the energy consumption in electrochemical removal of phosphate by using a graphite felt cathode and at a current density below 0 2 a m2 fundamentally our study contributes to the understanding of adsorption and precipitation in electrochemical removal of phosphate at an extremely low current density and with carbon based electrodes graphical abstract image 1 keywords low current phosphorus recovery local ph calcium phosphate electrochemical 1 introduction phosphorus p is a vital nutrient in the global food production chain typically 35 2 kg of phosphate rock is required to sustain one person per year macintosh et al 2018 unfortunately although uncertainty remains in terms of the size and the projected exhaustion date of p reserves bradford hartke et al 2015 its geographical concerns may cause a potential p crisis for the majority of countries who heavily depend on importing p fertilizer mayer et al 2016 this taken together with the strict legislative target to reduce p concentration to an ultra low level to avoid eutrophication makes it essential to recover and reuse the p in waste streams mayer et al 2016 enhanced biological phosphorus removal adsorption and precipitation are well established methods for p removal morse et al 1998 desmidt et al 2015 in most cases p is removed from wastewaters by forming insoluble or less soluble phosphate minerals yeoman et al 1988 among these minerals calcium phosphate stands out because calcium phosphate precipitation can be achieved without dosing external calcium ions as most natural and engineered aquatic systems have a favorable stoichiometric ratio for calcium phosphate formation lei et al 2018a in addition calcium phosphate is a preferred raw material for the fertilizer industry hao et al 2013 conventionally calcium phosphate precipitation in wastewaters can be achieved at increased ph 9 and or increased concentration of calcium ions yeoman et al 1988 diamadopoulos and benedek 1984 in this approach however calcium and phosphate ions precipitate as sludge and have inadequate settling performance van dijk and braakensiek 1985 hence an extra solid liquid separation process i e centrifugation is required moreover wastewater ph needs to be lowered with dosing acid to satisfy the discharge standard 6 ph 9 lei et al 2018a tchobanoglous et al 2014 to overcome these limitations an electrochemical precipitation approach was proposed and validated by lei and coauthors lei et al 2017 2018a the principle of this electrochemical approach is that a local high ph environment is created by water electrolysis close to the cathode lei et al 2017 as such the precipitation of calcium phosphate occurs solely at the cathode surface efficient precipitation of calcium phosphate was found in alkaline neutral and acidic solutions even in the presence of buffers thanks to the high local ph lei et al 2017 2018b however the real adoption of this approach is limited by the high energy consumption which is due to the applied relatively high current density and the low specific surface area of the used titanium plate cathode lei et al 2018a 2019a we found that in electrochemical recovery of phosphate from domestic wastewater it is not only calcium phosphate that forms calcite caco3 and brucite mg oh 2 also form as byproducts lei et al 2018a 2019a 2019b additionally high current density 20 a m2 results in relatively more precipitation of calcite and brucite than calcium phosphate lei et al 2019a 2019b in contrast a larger cathode area favors the selective precipitation of calcium phosphate lei et al 2018a therefore a possible solution to overcome the low energy efficiency in electrochemical p recovery is to operate the system with a very low current density and a much larger specific surface area in this context carbon based materials i e graphite felt which has a large specific surface area zhang and zhao 2009 seems to be a better alternative than the titanium plate as cathode interestingly the combination of graphite felt and low current density 0 2 a m2 falls in the current density region of capacitive deionization cdi cdi is a process where ions are adsorbed either at the cathode or anode depending on their charge when an electric voltage difference is applied between both electrodes suss et al 2015 nonetheless we do not know yet whether electrochemical p removal can be achieved at a current density below 0 2 a m2 the lowest current density we have tested was 1 4 a m2 lei et al 2018a and if yes what is the mechanism is it precipitation or adsorption or are both processes involved to answer these questions we performed systematic studies on electrochemical p removal at extremely low current density using a graphite felt cathode and in the presence of calcium ions this study aims to identify the possibility of electrochemical p removal at extremely low current density with improved cathode configuration and the associated removal mechanisms the findings in this study may contribute to the development of an energy efficient electrochemical approach for p removal and recovery that uses no chemicals and produce a pure solid product 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals ca no3 2 4h2o as the source of ca2 was acquired from merck germany na2hpo4 as the source of phosphate and na2so4 as electrolyte were received from vwr belgium all solutions were prepared with deionized water merck millipore germany 2 2 setup an overview of the schematic of the setup is shown in fig s1 the electrochemical cell is same as the one we used previously lei et al 2018b the anode is a platinum pt coated titanium ti mesh ø 8 cm 20 g pt m2 disk named as pt ti to which a 12 cm pt ti rod ø 0 3 cm was perpendicularly welded the cathode is a combination of the same material as the anode material with a piece of graphite felt ø 8 cm thickness of 0 3 cm fmi composites ltd galashiels scotland the graphite felt was fixed on the pt ti disk by pt wires the electrochemical cell was operated in a three electrode configuration with the graphite felt combined pt ti disk named as gf pt ti as the working electrode cathode pt ti mesh disk as the counter electrode anode the electrode distance between the anode and the cathode was 3 cm a constant current density was applied by a galvanostat vertex ivium technologies the netherlands the total solution 900 ml in the electrochemical cell was recirculated with a pump masterflex l s digital economy drive germany at a flow rate of 120 ml min all non specified electrodes were provided by magneto special anodes bv the netherlands 2 3 batch experiments in all batch tests the p concentration was fixed at 0 6 mm the concentration of ca changed from 0 5 mm to 2 0 mm and na2so4 concentration varied from 10 mm to 50 mm the applied current density ranged from as low as 0 04 a m2 to maximum 0 2 a m2 to investigate the removal mechanism we performed blank experiments in the absence of ca 0 mm or in the absence of an electric field 0 a m2 in particular to understand the role of graphite felt we also performed experiments with pt ti cathode without graphite felt the cell voltage was measured and recorded on an external data logger depending on the applied current the cell voltage lies between 1 1 and 1 5 v lastly the feasibility of this low current system in real domestic wastewater was evaluated the domestic wastewater was sampled from the local wastewater treatment plant leeuwarden the netherlands typically all batch tests lasted 4 days and aliquots of solutions were sampled every day unless specified before a next experiment the electrochemical cell was flushed with deionized water for two days to ensure that no residual ions remained on the cathode surface all experiments were carried out at least in duplicate the data are given as the mean and corresponding standard deviation of at least two independent tests 2 4 analytical methods we analyzed the concentration of ca and p by icp aes optima 5300 dv perkinelmer and ph seven excellence s470 mettler toledo we examined the morphologies and elements distribution of the fresh and used graphite felt by sem jeol 6480lv jeol ltd japan and eds oxford instruments respectively a small piece 1 cm 1 cm of the fresh and used graphite felt was cut and used for sem eds characterization we obtained the raman spectra of the deposits on the carbon fiber of the used graphite felt using a labram hr raman spectrometer horiba jobin yvon lei et al 2017 we determined the specific surface area of the graphite felt by micromeritics instruments

at low current density is possible fig 1 shows phosphate can be removed in the electrochemical system using gf pt ti cathode by applying a current density as low as 0 04 a m2 fig 1a which is accompanied by simultaneous removal of ca fig 1b in open circuit 0 ma only 15 p and 12 ca were removed from the bulk solution after 4 days treatment the removal of p and ca in open circuit is probably a result of spontaneous precipitation lei et al 2017 the calculation of si indicates the solution is indeed supersaturated in terms of both amorphous calcium phosphate acp siacp 1 1 and hydroxyapatite hap sihap 9 9 the relatively low removal efficiency indicates that precipitation is thermodynamic feasible but kinetically the spontaneous precipitation of acp and hap under our experimental conditions is slow and has a significant induction time house 1999 in a closed electrical circuit the removal of p and ca was enhanced substantially the removal efficiency of p was almost doubled from 15 in open circuit 0 a m2 to 27 at 0 04 a m2 after 4 days of operation at 0 1 a m2 about 53 p was removed at 0 2 a m2 this value increased to 62 the corresponding removal of ca increased from 26 at 0 04 a m2 to 46 3 at 0 1 and 0 2 a m2 fig 1b the enhanced removal of p and ca with current density is because the production of hydroxide ions is related to the current density the higher the current density the higher the local ph moreover the diffusion of positive ions i e ca2 toward the cathode negatively charged may be enhanced at a higher current density as a result the precipitation of ca2 with po4 p was enhanced at a higher current density so as the removal of p and ca in conclusion these results demonstrate that electrochemical p removal at extremely low current density 0 2 a m2 is possible we further checked the sem images of used graphite felt and compared it with fresh unused felt the sem images revealed new morphology and species appeared on the used graphite felt which is likely connected to the formation of calcium phosphate solids on the graphite felt fig 2 a b and 2c this is further confirmed by the eds data which shows the element distribution over the fresh and used graphite felt in the fresh graphite felt the main element composition is carbon 97 fig s2a for the used graphite felt new elements including ca and p were detected fig s2b also the eds mapping of a randomly chosen spot of the used graphite felt shows a proper distribution of the three elements on the used fiber in the graphite felt fig 2d which indicates the strong connection between the presence of ca and po4 the raman characterization confirms that the new solids on the carbon fibers of the used graphite felt to be crystalline hap fig s3 the raman spectrum displaces four distinguishable characteristic internal po4 bonds of hap including the main ν1 po4 peak around 960 cm 1 ensikat et al 2016 also from the point of mass balance the removed ca and p in the molar ratio was calculated to be 1 67 0 08 which is close to the theoretical ca p atomic ratio of hap 1 67 therefore it is confirmed that ca2 and po4 3 form calcium phosphate on the cathode even at such low current density 0 2 a m2 3 2 role of graphite felt adsorption or precipitation initially we ascribed the enhanced removal of p at a current density below 0 2 a m2 in comparison with the behavior at open circuit to electro sorption as the phenomenon of phosphate removal reported here shows similarities with the cdi process for ion removal cdi is a process where ions can be adsorbed to capacitive electrodes while the gf pt ti cathode is not a typical capacitive electrode it could still act somehow as a capacitive electrode the graphite felt is known to have a very large specific surface area with its structure see sem images in fig 2 the specific surface area of the graphite felt before and after using was 438 20 and 771 29 m2 m2 respectively the enhanced surface area is probably resulting from the deposition of calcium phosphate solids on the smooth carbon fibers of the graphite felt however electro enhanced adsorption mechanism was excluded based on the experiments we performed with varied electrolyte na2so4 concentrations fig s4 if the mechanism of cdi played an important role the increase of background electrolyte concentration would lower the adsorption of po4 3 and ca2 as the introduced na and so4 2 ions would compete with ca2 and po4 3 towards the capacitive electrodes huang et al 2017 according to the results showed in fig s4 we excluded the involvement of cdi in our process as the influence of electrolyte concentration on the removal of p and ca was found to be small the slightly decreased removal of ca and p with increased na2so4 concentration is probably connected to the effect of ionic strength on the supersaturation of calcium phosphate as it decreased with increased ionic strength song et al 2002 the exclusion of cdi mechanism is further supported by the control experiments in the absence of calcium ions the change in phosphate concentration is insignificant in the absence of calcium ions at a current density of 0 2 a m2 fig s5 this indicates the presence of calcium ions is essential for the removal of phosphate which is unlikely if ion adsorption as in cdi would be the dominant mechanism for the removal of phosphate in cdi process the counter cation does not need to be calcium ion as sodium ion for example could be possible as well huang et al 2014 2017 therefore electro adsorption of phosphate to the graphite felt is excluded from the mechanism in fact the direction of the electrical field is against the diffusion of phosphate anion to the cathode because they both are negatively charged to understand which mechanism dominates the removal of phosphate in our electrochemical system it is necessary to understand the role of graphite felt in this process to elucidate this we further performed control experiments in the absence of graphite felt the results indicated that the combination of graphite felt with pt ti cathode indeed enhanced the removal of p at 0 2 a m2 the removal efficiency of p with gf pt ti cathode is 15 higher than with pt ti cathode fig 3 a however it is not clear what is behind the enhancement by the introduction of graphite felt 2 4h2o 4e 4oh 2h2 3 2h2o 4h o2 4e 4 h oh h2o looking at the evolution of bulk solution ph we found that the bulk ph with graphite felt is much lower than without graphite felt fig 3b therefore it seems that graphite felt affects the bulk solution ph as the generated hydroxide ions fluxes are retarded in the porous felt at the cathode hydroxide ions oh were produced by water reduction equation 2 and protons h were produced at the anode by water oxidation equation 3 assuming there were no other reactions the ph of the bulk solution will not change significantly as the produced h will recombine with the produced oh forming water again equation 4 in our case the precipitation of calcium phosphate will consume oh as a result the bulk ph decreases over the treatment process due to the accumulation of uncombined h in the bulk solution regardless of the presence or absence of graphite felt however in the presence of graphite felt the diffusion of cathode produced oh towards the bulk solution was limited as a result there was more h accumulation in the bulk solution this explains why the bulk solution ph is much lower in the presence of graphite felt than in the absence of graphite felt also due to the limited recombination between oh and h we can imagine that the local ph at the cathode with graphite felt was much higher than without graphite felt this probably explains the better phosphate removal performance of using gf pt ti cathode than with pt ti cathode giving the fact that negatively charged graphite felt shows no adsorption capacity towards the phosphate anion fig s5 moreover based on the raman and sem eds characterization of used graphite felt fig 2 we confirmed that calcium phosphate precipitates on the carbon fibers of the graphite felt therefore it is likely that a local high ph environment was also created at the graphite felt however it remains unclear if calcium phosphate precipitation occurs on the pt ti part of the gf pt ti cathode to check that we disassembled the used gf pt ti cathode and used acid to dissolve the solids on the pt ti part according to the mass balance calculation text s1 we confirmed that calcium phosphate precipitation occurred both on the graphite felt part and the pt ti part of the gf pt ti cathode however only a small proportion of the removed phosphate precipitated with calcium ions on the pt ti part 15 and most of the calcium phosphate precipitates were found on the graphite felt 85 this suggests that the introduction of graphite felt may extend the local high ph environment from the vicinity of the pt ti part to the graphite felt environment as well to conclude the enhanced removal of phosphate at extremely low current density with gf pt ti cathode is due to the influence of the graphite felt on the local ph as well as the precipitation area 3 3 effect of calcium ions concentration fig s5 shows that the removal of phosphate cannot be achieved in the absence of calcium ions this suggests that the removal of phosphate is linked with calcium ions therefore the removal of p as a function of ca concentration was evaluated as shown in fig 4 a the removal efficiency of p decreased by 19 when the ca concentration was reduced from 1 0 mm to 0 5 mm however the increase of ca concentration from 1 0 mm to 1 5 mm and further to 2 0 mm does not affect the process very much as can be seen from the overlapped removal trend of p with 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm ca the most stable phase of calcium phosphate species is hap which has a ca p atomic ratio of 1 67 wang and nancollas 2008 theoretically 1 0 mm ca is able to precipitate 0 6 mm p therefore if the initial ca p molar ratio is higher than 1 67 the further increase of ca p molar ratio through increasing ca2 concentration will not result in an obvious increase of p removal which is because there is enough ca2 in the bulk solution for calcium phosphate precipitation however if the initial ca p molar ratio is decreased through decreasing ca2 concentration i e at 0 5 mm ca the initial ca p ratio decreased from 1 67 to 0 83 this will not only reduce the driving force for calcium phosphate precipitation but also in terms of stoichiometry 0 5 mm ca is not able to precipitate 0 6 mm po4 p as a result the p removal efficiency decreased significantly from 63 with 1 0 mm ca to 44 with 0 5 mm ca looking at the absolute removal of ca and p expressed in ca p molar ratio fig 4b we found that this ratio is stable around 1 64 0 03 after 4 days treatment regardless of the initial ca concentration this ratio is consistent with the stoichiometric ca p atomic ratio of hap 1 67 which indicates that the removed po4 3 and ca2 may end up in the formation of hap interestingly looking at the evolution of removed ca p molar ratio over the 4 days treatment with various ca concentration we can see that this ratio is relatively high when the initial molar ratio of ca p in the bulk solution is high for instance in the first day the ratio decreased in the order of 2 0 mm ca 1 95 1 5 mm ca 1 81 1 0 mm 1 67 0 5 mm 1 56 a ratio higher than the stoichiometric ratio 1 67 indicates there might be other mechanisms for the removal of ca in addition to its precipitation with phosphate this phenomenon may be explained by the electrostatic interaction of positive charged ca2 with negatively charged graphite felt cathode especially at the beginning of operation when both faradaic and non faradaic reactions occur the non faradic reaction might also contribute to the removal of ca and thus a ratio over stoichiometric required ca p ratio for calcium phosphate precipitation is observed at the initial stage however the end removal of ca is similar when the initial ca concentration was higher than 1 0 mm with 0 63 0 65 and 0 67 mm ca being removed at 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm ca respectively fig s6 the independent removal of ca in the absolute amount on its concentration after 1 0 mm indicates the removal of ca is also connected to the removal of phosphate under a certain amount of phosphate i e 0 6 mm the removal of ca is also limited even the ca concentration is above the stoichiometric requirement from the results presented here and above we concluded that the removal of p and ca is mainly because of calcium phosphate precipitation instead of electro adsorption 3 4 efficiency in real wastewater the feasibility of the low current density system in real wastewater was confirmed the main composition of the wastewater is 7 95 mg l p 81 5 mg l ca and 18 3 mg l mg by applying a low current density of 0 2 a m2 the p concentration decreased by 70 from 7 95 to 2 45 mg l after 4 days treatment fig 5 which is accompanied by the removal of 34 ca and 6 mg the removal efficiency of p in the effluent 70 was even higher than its removal in synthetic solutions 68 see fig 4 in the presence of 2 mm ca 80 mg l these preliminary results indicate that the low current system is also suitable for complicated water matrices based on the previously developed calculation approach lei et al 2019b the recovered precipitates consist of 59 ca5 po4 3oh 35 caco3 and 6 mg oh 2 therefore the use of a low current density is a possible way to reduce the co precipitation of caco3 and especially mg oh 2 in electrochemical phosphorus recovery from real wastewater 3 5 saved energy consumption the motivation of this research is to reduce the high energy consumption in electrochemical p recovery in our previous work therefore we calculated the specific energy consumption of electrochemical p recovery at very low current density 0 2 a m2 with and without graphite felt it was found that the specific energy consumption lies in the range of 4 4 24 2 kw h kg p fig s7 the energy consumption was reduced by almost half from 24 2 2 1 to 12 2 0 88 kw h kg p simply by the combination of graphite felt with pt ti cathode with gf pt ti cathode the specific energy consumption decreased with the increase of applied current density the lowest specific energy consumption was as low as 4 4 kw h kg p and was achieved at 0 04 a m2 with synthetic solutions this specific energy consumption is 2 orders of magnitude lower than in our previous system that was operated at relatively high current density and using titanium plate cathode for treating real domestic wastewater 110 2238 kw h kg p lei et al 2019a in comparison with the cdi process this specific energy consumption is comparable to a previously reported membrane cdi system 1 5 7 0 kw h kg p where a much higher p concentration 16 1 mm was targeted huang et al 2017 and even lower than a commercial cdi system 7 0 kw h kg p huang et al 2014 the specific energy consumption of the low current system in treating real wastewater is calculated to be 26 4 kw h kg p at a current density of 0 2 a m2 compared with conventional chemical precipitation method this energy consumption is even lower 2 37 euro kg p vs 18 9 euro kg p lei et al 2017 assuming the electricity price is 0 09 euro kwh it is worth mentioning that chemical precipitation via the dosing of alkalinity i e naoh produces sludges which need to be further treated before recycling we conclude that a simple yet feasible way to construct an energy efficient electrochemically p recovery system is to use a carbon felt based cathode and operating the system at a very low current density 0 2 a m2 while the performance of such a system in real life and the associated challenges need to be further addressed in future studies the substantially reduced energy consumption in electrochemical p removal is a significant step towards its real application 4 conclusions electrochemical removal of phosphate at a current density 0 2 a m2 is possible the removal of phosphate at low current density is due to electrochemically induced calcium phosphate precipitation the co precipitation of caco3 and mg oh 2 with calcium phosphate in electrochemical phosphate recovery from domestic wastewater is reduced significantly at low current density the specific energy consumption of the low current system is from 4 4 to 26 4 kw h kg p the combination of low current density with a big surface area cathode enables energy efficient electrochemical

18337,phosphorus removal and recovery from waste streams are crucial to prevent eutrophication and sustain fertilizer production as has been shown in our previous papers electrochemical treatment has the potential to achieve this goal however the adoption of electrochemical approach is limited by its high energy consumption here we investigate the possibility of electrochemical phosphorus removal at extremely low current density using graphite felt as the cathode we found a current density as low as 0 04 a m2 can enhance the removal of phosphate in our electrochemical system the removal of phosphate at extremely low current density resulted from electrochemical induced calcium phosphate precipitation and not by electrochemical adsorption electrochemical treatment of real domestic wastewater at 0 2 a m2 almost eliminates the precipitation of mg oh 2 and limits the formation of caco3 the recovered precipitates are dominated by calcium phosphate 59 followed by 35 caco3 and 6 mg oh 2 the specific energy consumption of this newly electrochemical system is between 4 4 and 26 4 kw h kg p which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than our previous system 110 2238 kw h kg p key factors for this improvement prove to be enlarged precipitation area and hydroxide flux retardation by graphite felt practically our study offers a potential way to reduce the energy consumption in electrochemical removal of phosphate by using a graphite felt cathode and at a current density below 0 2 a m2 fundamentally our study contributes to the understanding of adsorption and precipitation in electrochemical removal of phosphate at an extremely low current density and with carbon based electrodes graphical abstract image 1 keywords low current phosphorus recovery local ph calcium phosphate electrochemical 1 introduction phosphorus p is a vital nutrient in the global food production chain typically 35 2 kg of phosphate rock is required to sustain one person per year macintosh et al 2018 unfortunately although uncertainty remains in terms of the size and the projected exhaustion date of p reserves bradford hartke et al 2015 its geographical concerns may cause a potential p crisis for the majority of countries who heavily depend on importing p fertilizer mayer et al 2016 this taken together with the strict legislative target to reduce p concentration to an ultra low level to avoid eutrophication makes it essential to recover and reuse the p in waste streams mayer et al 2016 enhanced biological phosphorus removal adsorption and precipitation are well established methods for p removal morse et al 1998 desmidt et al 2015 in most cases p is removed from wastewaters by forming insoluble or less soluble phosphate minerals yeoman et al 1988 among these minerals calcium phosphate stands out because calcium phosphate precipitation can be achieved without dosing external calcium ions as most natural and engineered aquatic systems have a favorable stoichiometric ratio for calcium phosphate formation lei et al 2018a in addition calcium phosphate is a preferred raw material for the fertilizer industry hao et al 2013 conventionally calcium phosphate precipitation in wastewaters can be achieved at increased ph 9 and or increased concentration of calcium ions yeoman et al 1988 diamadopoulos and benedek 1984 in this approach however calcium and phosphate ions precipitate as sludge and have inadequate settling performance van dijk and braakensiek 1985 hence an extra solid liquid separation process i e centrifugation is required moreover wastewater ph needs to be lowered with dosing acid to satisfy the discharge standard 6 ph 9 lei et al 2018a tchobanoglous et al 2014 to overcome these limitations an electrochemical precipitation approach was proposed and validated by lei and coauthors lei et al 2017 2018a the principle of this electrochemical approach is that a local high ph environment is created by water electrolysis close to the cathode lei et al 2017 as such the precipitation of calcium phosphate occurs solely at the cathode surface efficient precipitation of calcium phosphate was found in alkaline neutral and acidic solutions even in the presence of buffers thanks to the high local ph lei et al 2017 2018b however the real adoption of this approach is limited by the high energy consumption which is due to the applied relatively high current density and the low specific surface area of the used titanium plate cathode lei et al 2018a 2019a we found that in electrochemical recovery of phosphate from domestic wastewater it is not only calcium phosphate that forms calcite caco3 and brucite mg oh 2 also form as byproducts lei et al 2018a 2019a 2019b additionally high current density 20 a m2 results in relatively more precipitation of calcite and brucite than calcium phosphate lei et al 2019a 2019b in contrast a larger cathode area favors the selective precipitation of calcium phosphate lei et al 2018a therefore a possible solution to overcome the low energy efficiency in electrochemical p recovery is to operate the system with a very low current density and a much larger specific surface area in this context carbon based materials i e graphite felt which has a large specific surface area zhang and zhao 2009 seems to be a better alternative than the titanium plate as cathode interestingly the combination of graphite felt and low current density 0 2 a m2 falls in the current density region of capacitive deionization cdi cdi is a process where ions are adsorbed either at the cathode or anode depending on their charge when an electric voltage difference is applied between both electrodes suss et al 2015 nonetheless we do not know yet whether electrochemical p removal can be achieved at a current density below 0 2 a m2 the lowest current density we have tested was 1 4 a m2 lei et al 2018a and if yes what is the mechanism is it precipitation or adsorption or are both processes involved to answer these questions we performed systematic studies on electrochemical p removal at extremely low current density using a graphite felt cathode and in the presence of calcium ions this study aims to identify the possibility of electrochemical p removal at extremely low current density with improved cathode configuration and the associated removal mechanisms the findings in this study may contribute to the development of an energy efficient electrochemical approach for p removal and recovery that uses no chemicals and produce a pure solid product 2 material and methods 2 1

netherlands 2 3 batch experiments in all batch tests the p concentration was fixed at 0 6 mm the concentration of ca changed from 0 5 mm to 2 0 mm and na2so4 concentration varied from 10 mm to 50 mm the applied current density ranged from as low as 0 04 a m2 to maximum 0 2 a m2 to investigate the removal mechanism we performed blank experiments in the absence of ca 0 mm or in the absence of an electric field 0 a m2 in particular to understand the role of graphite felt we also performed experiments with pt ti cathode without graphite felt the cell voltage was measured and recorded on an external data logger depending on the applied current the cell voltage lies between 1 1 and 1 5 v lastly the feasibility of this low current system in real domestic wastewater was evaluated the domestic wastewater was sampled from the local wastewater treatment plant leeuwarden the netherlands typically all batch tests lasted 4 days and aliquots of solutions were sampled every day unless specified before a next experiment the electrochemical cell was flushed with deionized water for two days to ensure that no residual ions remained on the cathode surface all experiments were carried

at low current density is possible fig 1 shows phosphate can be removed in the electrochemical system using gf pt ti cathode by applying a current density as low as 0 04 a m2 fig 1a which is accompanied by simultaneous removal of ca fig 1b in open circuit 0 ma only 15 p and 12 ca were removed from the bulk solution after 4 days treatment the removal of p and ca in open circuit is probably a result of spontaneous precipitation lei et al 2017 the calculation of si indicates the solution is indeed supersaturated in terms of both amorphous calcium phosphate acp siacp 1 1 and hydroxyapatite hap sihap 9 9 the relatively low removal efficiency indicates that precipitation is thermodynamic feasible but kinetically the spontaneous precipitation of acp and hap under our experimental

density the higher the local ph moreover the diffusion of positive ions i e ca2 toward the cathode negatively charged may be enhanced at a higher current density as a result the precipitation of ca2

was calculated to be 1 67 0 08 which is close to the theoretical ca p atomic ratio of hap 1 67 therefore it is confirmed that ca2 and po4 3 form calcium phosphate on the cathode even at such low

enough ca2 in the bulk solution for calcium phosphate precipitation however if the initial ca p molar ratio is decreased through decreasing ca2 concentration i e at 0 5 mm ca the initial ca p ratio decreased from 1 67 to 0 83 this will not only reduce the driving force for calcium phosphate precipitation but also in terms of stoichiometry 0 5 mm ca is not able to precipitate 0 6 mm po4 p as a result the p removal efficiency decreased significantly from 63 with 1 0 mm ca to 44 with 0 5 mm ca looking at the absolute removal of ca and p expressed in ca p molar ratio fig 4b we found that this ratio is stable around 1 64 0 03 after 4 days treatment regardless of the initial ca concentration this ratio is consistent with the stoichiometric ca p atomic ratio of hap 1 67 which indicates that the removed po4 3 and ca2 may end up in the formation of hap interestingly looking at the evolution of removed ca p molar ratio over the 4 days treatment with various ca concentration we can see that this ratio is relatively high when the initial molar ratio of ca p in the bulk solution is high for instance in the first day the ratio decreased in the order of 2 0 mm ca 1 95 1 5 mm ca 1 81 1 0 mm 1 67 0 5 mm 1 56 a ratio higher than the stoichiometric ratio 1 67 indicates there might be other mechanisms for the removal of ca in addition to its precipitation with phosphate this phenomenon may be explained by the electrostatic interaction of positive charged ca2 with negatively charged graphite felt cathode especially at the beginning of operation when both faradaic and non faradaic reactions occur the non faradic reaction might also contribute to the removal of ca and thus a ratio over stoichiometric required ca p ratio for calcium phosphate precipitation is observed at the initial stage however the end removal of ca is similar when the initial ca concentration was higher than 1 0 mm with 0 63 0 65 and 0 67 mm ca being removed at 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm ca respectively fig s6 the independent removal of ca in the absolute amount on its concentration after 1 0 mm indicates the removal of ca is also connected to the removal of phosphate under a certain amount of phosphate i e 0 6 mm the removal of ca is also limited even the ca concentration is above the stoichiometric requirement from the results presented here and above we concluded that the removal of p and ca is mainly because of calcium phosphate precipitation instead of electro adsorption 3 4 efficiency in real wastewater the feasibility of the low current density system in real wastewater was confirmed the main composition of the wastewater is 7 95 mg l p 81 5 mg l ca and 18 3 mg l mg by applying a low current density of 0 2 a m2 the p concentration decreased by 70 from 7 95 to 2 45 mg l after 4 days treatment fig 5 which is accompanied by the removal of 34 ca and 6 mg the removal efficiency of p in the effluent 70 was even higher than its removal in synthetic solutions 68 see fig 4 in the presence of 2 mm ca 80 mg l these preliminary results indicate that the low current system is also suitable for complicated water matrices based on the previously developed calculation approach lei et al 2019b the recovered precipitates consist of 59 ca5 po4 3oh 35 caco3 and 6 mg oh 2 therefore the use of a low current density is a possible way to reduce the co precipitation of caco3 and especially mg oh 2 in electrochemical phosphorus recovery from real wastewater 3 5 saved energy consumption the motivation of this research is to reduce the high energy consumption in electrochemical p recovery in our previous work therefore we calculated the specific energy consumption of electrochemical p recovery at very low current density 0 2 a m2 with and without graphite felt it was found that the specific energy consumption lies in the range of 4 4 24 2 kw h kg p fig s7 the energy consumption was reduced by almost half from 24 2 2 1 to 12 2 0 88 kw h kg p simply by the combination of graphite felt with pt ti cathode with gf pt ti cathode the specific energy consumption decreased with the increase of applied current density the lowest specific energy consumption was as low as 4 4 kw h kg p and was achieved at 0 04 a m2 with synthetic solutions this specific energy consumption is 2 orders of magnitude lower than in our previous system that was operated at relatively high current density and using titanium plate cathode for treating real domestic wastewater 110 2238 kw h kg p lei et al 2019a in comparison with the cdi process this specific energy consumption is comparable to a previously reported membrane cdi system 1 5 7 0 kw h kg p where a much higher p concentration 16 1 mm was targeted huang et al 2017 and even lower than a commercial cdi system 7 0 kw h kg p huang et al 2014 the specific energy consumption of the low current system in treating real wastewater is calculated to be 26 4 kw h kg p at a current density of 0 2 a m2 compared with conventional chemical precipitation method this energy consumption is even lower 2 37 euro kg p vs 18 9 euro kg p lei et al 2017 assuming the electricity price is 0 09 euro kwh it is worth mentioning that chemical precipitation via the dosing of alkalinity i e naoh produces sludges which need to be further treated before recycling we conclude that a simple yet feasible way to construct an energy efficient electrochemically p recovery system is to use a carbon felt based cathode and operating the system at a very low current density 0 2 a m2 while the performance of such a system in real life and the associated challenges need to be further addressed in future studies the substantially reduced energy consumption in electrochemical p removal is a significant step towards its real application 4 conclusions electrochemical removal of phosphate at a current density 0 2 a m2 is possible the removal of phosphate at low current density is due to electrochemically induced calcium phosphate precipitation the co precipitation of caco3 and mg oh 2 with calcium phosphate in electrochemical phosphate recovery from domestic wastewater is reduced significantly at low current density the specific energy consumption of the low current system is from 4 4 to 26 4 kw h kg p the combination of low current density with a big surface area cathode enables energy efficient electrochemical

18338,human induced catchment changes have affected the sedimentary processes in marginal seas which will impact the transport and burial processes of materials and inevitably impact marine biogeochemical cycles organochlorine pesticides ocps and sediment characteristics in surface sediments from the east china sea ecs at two time points 2006 and 2018 were compared to understand the response of ocps to human induced catchment changes a significant coarsening trend occurred after the impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd with the mean grain size increasing from 6 4 1 2 φ to 4 4 2 1 φ suggesting that the sedimentary environment in the ecs changed drastically ocp concentrations in the ecs evidently decreased after the impoundment of the tgd with mean values decreasing from 2 55 1 51 ng g 1 to 1 08 0 84 ng g 1 the deposition flux of ocp also decreased from 2 65 1 67 ng cm 2 yr 1 to 0 89 0 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 the reduction in the riverine input might be the reason that caused variations in the ocp concentration and deposition flux in addition sediment coarsening is likely to be the another primary factor influencing the differences in the distribution and deposition flux of the ocps in the ecs therefore the distribution and burial of ocps in the ecs have been changed drastically which may broadly impact the marine environment and biogeochemical cycles graphical abstract image 1 keywords organochlorine pesticides sediment grain size human activity catchment changes three gorges dam east china sea 1 introduction anthropogenic threats such as pollution that affect the oceans since the beginning of the anthropocene are unprecedented steffen et al 2007 lewis and maslin 2015 these threats are altering the physicochemical properties and health of the world s oceans and influencing the survival of marine organisms alava et al 2017 since the 20th century large amounts of synthetic compounds have been invented and used worldwide including organochlorine pesticides ocps which have been used extensively since the 1940s their concentrations in the environment have increased gradually and peaked during 1970 1990 li and macdonald 2005 although these ocps have been restricted or banned in most countries several decades ago they can still be detected in various environmental compartments such as air water soil sediment and ice lewalle et al 2009 wong et al 2012 li et al 2017 jin et al 2017 bigot et al 2017 these ocps eventually enter marine environments through atmospheric deposition and surface runoff yang et al 2005 hu et al 2011 lin et al 2015 resulting in marginal seas a marginal sea is located at the edge of the continent separated from the ocean by a peninsula island or archipelago and connected to the ocean only by a strait or channel being recognized as important sinks of ocps guan et al 2009 hu et al 2011 ali et al 2014 therefore much attention has been paid to coastal oceans owing to the accumulation of ocps because they are recognized to have adverse effects on marine organisms and even the surrounding residents connor et al 2007 greenfield et al 2015 estuarine inner shelf areas are important components of coastal oceans as they receive large amounts of terrestrial materials discharged via riverine inputs gao and collins 2014 however the transport of terrestrial materials from river catchments to estuaries has decreased substantially owing to intensive human activities in river catchments e g dam construction land use change and water withdrawal syvitski et al 2005 milliman and farnsworth 2013 which have modified the sedimentary environment and ecosystems in the estuarine shelf regions gao 2013 gao et al 2017 2019 yang et al 2018 ocp loads associated with sediment loads are also likely to have decreased significantly resulting in a changed flux to the ocean thus human activities have modified the source to sink transport process of terrestrial materials which in turn has influenced the transmission of ocps in river catchment estuary shelf systems accordingly it is necessary to investigate the impact of human induced catchment changes on the source to sink transport mechanisms of ocps in coastal oceans the east china sea ecs is a typical marginal sea dominated by the changjiang yangtze river which is facing severe pressure from human activities terrestrial input and atmospheric deposition have resulted in large amounts of ocps entering the ecs making this region an important ocp sink hu et al 2011 lin et al 2012 2013 however the official ban on ocp use has been in force for several decades causing a decreasing trend for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt and hexachlorocyclohexane hch levels in the air zhang et al 2002 lin et al 2012 and even leading to the secondary release of ocps from the ecs lin et al 2015 li et al 2017 due to human activities especially dam construction the transport of terrestrial materials from river catchments to the ecs has also substantially changed gao et al 2018 yang et al 2018 more than 50 000 reservoirs have been constructed in the changjiang yangtze river catchment yang et al 2011 which intercept sediments at a rate of 453 mt yr 1 million tons per year gao et al 2018 sediment discharge has decreased steadily from 511 mt yr 1 in 1956 1968 to 450 mt yr 1 in 1969 1985 340 mt yr 1 in 1986 2002 145 mt yr 1 in 2003 2012 following the construction of the three gorges dam tgd and finally 118 mt yr 1 in 2013 2015 following the construction of cascade dams yang et al 2018 sediment loads discharged into the ecs decreased drastically after the impoundment of the tgd even below the threshold value of the sediment loads transported from the changjiang subaqueous delta csd to the zhe min coastal mud belt zmcmb by the southward zhe min coastal current fig 1 the threshold value is 150 mt yr 1 based on the deposition rate of the holocene mud wedge in the ecs inner shelf xu et al 2012 yang et al 2018 therefore sediments deposited into the csd could be eroded and transported southward which would change the sedimentary environment in the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs gao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 these variations will inevitably change the distribution sources and transport of ocps in the estuarine inner shelf regions of the ecs the above review shows that human induced catchment changes are changing the system stability of the ecs which could impact the fate of ocps and further influence ecological safety in the ecs consequently investigating the impacts of human activities on the source to sink transport of ocps in the ecs is necessary and urgent in the early 21st century several ecs related studies focused on the distribution fate and flux of ocps yang et al 2005 hu et al 2011 lin et al 2012 as well as their air seawater exchange lin et al 2015 zhong et al 2014 li et al 2017 hu et al 2011 suggested that the direct riverine inputs and shelf mud depositional process were dominant factors controlling the distribution and fate of the ocps in the ecs however limited attention has been paid to the variations in ocps in surface sediments considering the influence of human activities which is valuable for understanding the regional ocp cycle in this study we examined the sediment grain size total organic carbon toc and ocps in surface sediments from the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs and compared these values before and after the impoundment of the tgd our specific goals were to determine the changes in the levels and spatial patterns of the ocps in the study area after the tgd impoundment in particular we wanted to explore how ocps in the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs respond to human induced catchment changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 149 surficial sediment samples were collected from the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs using a stainless steel box corer during three cruises conducted by r v xiang yang hong 18 and ke xue 3 in may 2018 the sampling sites distributed as highlighted in fig 1b all samples 0 2 cm were wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at 20 c until the analysis 2 2 data acquisition in this study information on sediment grain size n 126 toc content n 126 and ocp concentrations n 114 produced in 2006 was sourced from previous studies hu et al 2011 lin et al 2012 wang et al 2017 all these samples were collected from the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs in the summer of 2006 and 2007 data on sedimentation rate before impoundment of the tgd n 76 were collected from wang et al 2017 and those on the sedimentation rate after impoundment n 76 were sourced from gao et al 2019 two types of ocps were studied in this work hchs α hch β hch γ hch and ddts p p ddt p p dde p p ddd 2 3 laboratory analysis a standard mixed solution containing hch α hch β hch γ hch δ hch and ddt p p ddt o p ddt p p ddd and p p dde was purchased from accustandard all solvents dichloromethane acetone and n hexane used during the processing were of hplc grade analytical grade anhydrous sodium sulfate was activated at 450 c for 5 h to remove impurities before use silica gel 100 200 mesh was extracted using acetone dichloromethane and n hexane for 24 h and activated for approximately 16 h at 130 c ocp was extracted as per lin et al 2012 each freeze dried and homogenized sample ca 5 g was soxhlet extracted using 100 ml of dichloromethane for 24 h and 2 g of activated copper was added for desulfurization a mixture of tcmx and pcb209 was added to each of the samples as surrogate standards prior to extraction the extracted solution was concentrated to 1 2 ml in a rotary evaporator and cleaned using a chromatography column 8 mm i d with neutral alumina 3 cm 3 deactivated neutral silica gel 3 cm 3 deactivated 50 on a weight basis sulfuric acid silica 2 cm and anhydrous sodium sulfate the concentrated solution was added to the column and eluted with 20 ml of n hexane dichloromethane 1 1 v v the eluate containing the ocps was vacuum evaporated and solvent exchanged with n hexane and finally concentrated to 1 ml under a gentle stream of nitrogen a thermo fisher scientific tsq 8000 evo gc ms ms equipped with a fused silica capillary tg5 ms column 30 m 0 25 mm internal diameter 0 25 μm film thickness was used to determine the concentration of the ocps helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the gc temperature model was as follows an initial temperature of 80 c was maintained for 2 min and increased at a rate of 20 c min 1 to 180 c and held for 5 min then it was increased at a rate of 10 c min 1 to 290 c and maintained for 15 min the injection port was set at 290 c subsequently 1 μl of the sample extract was injected in the split less mode the interface and ion source temperatures were maintained at 290 and 230 c respectively the ionization was carried out in the electron impact mode at 70 ev and data were acquired using the selective reaction monitoring mode a procedural blank and matrix spiked samples consisting of all analytes were analyzed with each six sample set duplicates were run for every 12 samples and the samples were reanalyzed if the difference exceeded more than 15 the ocps were quantified using the external standard method calibration curves were drawn based on the sets of six standard concentrations of 1 10 50 100 250 and 500 ng ml 1 the standard curve was checked every day using the reference standard to ensure satisfactory linear regression coefficients r2 0 999 for all the ocps tested the p p ddt was detected in some blank samples and its concentration ranged from 0 to 0 02 ng g 1 with a mean value of 0 004 0 002 ng g 1 n 14 this was 6 7 of the lowest observed concentration in our sediment samples and therefore negligible the average recoveries of the ocps based on matrix spiked samples ranged from 74 5 to 106 2 the average surrogate recoveries were 68 13 and 95 9 for tcmx and pcb209 respectively the grain size was analyzed as described by wang et al 2018 briefly all samples were digested by an h2o2 solution 10 to remove the organic matter and then dispersed in sodium metaphosphate for 24 h the grain size was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malven instruments ltd uk and the measuring error was within 3 each freeze dried and homogenized sediment was immersed in 10 hydrochloric acid for 24 h and washed to neutrality the resulting material was wrapped in a silver boat to measure the toc content using an elemental analyzer flash 2000ht 2 4 kriging interpolation the kriging interpolation method was used to acquire the spatial variability of each dataset using the same gridding density for the same areas in the ecs shelf regions the most widely used geostatistical technology is the ordinary kriging interpolation which uses linear spatial and interpolator estimated data at unsampled locations using a linear weight function of adjacent data points guney et al 2010 1 z x 0 i 1 n λ i z x i where z x 0 is the estimated value of z at point x 0 z x i is the sampled value at point x i and λ i is the weight placed on z x i we used arcgis 10 0 software for the mapping and spatial analysis 2 5 deposition flux the ocp deposition flux in surface sediments was estimated to assess the extent of contamination which was calculated using several sediment properties and ocp concentration as shown in equation 2 2 f d e p o s i t i o n 10 10 a c o c p s ρ ω where a is the area of a given region km2 c o c p s is the measured sedimentary ocp concentrations ng g 1 ρ is the dry density of the sediment samples g cm 3 and ω is the sedimentation rate cm yr 1 mentioned in section 2 2 which was collected from wang et al 2017 the recommended value of 1 2 g cm 3 was selected for ρ liu et al 2007 the kriging interpolation method was used to obtain the spatial distribution of ω based on the accurately collected sedimentation rates for the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in physicochemical parameters of sediments in estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs previous studies have demonstrated that the sediments deposited in the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs are likely to lag behind changes in the changjiang yangtze river catchment by about 3 years hu et al 2012 gao et al 2017 implying that the sedimentary environment in the ecs cannot change immediately when the catchment is changed therefore samples collected from the ecs in 2006 could reflect the sedimentary environment in the ecs around 2003 the tgd was completed in 2003 and these samples could be considered as having just been or even not been affected by the tgd impoundment therefore 2006 can be regarded as the beginning year when the tgd affected the sedimentary environment of the ecs then sediment loads decreased drastically after the tgd impoundment which significantly changed the transport of terrestrial materials from the changjiang yangtze river to the ecs gao et al 2019 to better understand the variations in sediment grain size response to human induced catchment changes we compared the sediment grain size in the ecs for two different time nodes before the tgd sample collected in 2006 and after the tgd sample collected in 2018 fig 2 shows that the sediment grain size changed in the ecs becoming increasingly coarse after the impoundment of the tgd in 2006 the sediment grain size ranged from 2 5 to 7 3 φ φ log 2 d where d is the sediment grain size mm with a mean value of 6 4 1 2 φ mean 6 4 sd 1 2 all further results refer to this previous studies have demonstrated that the sediments in the ecs were relatively fine in 1982 with particle sizes ranging from 6 3 to 7 1 φ mean value is 6 7 0 2 φ gao et al 2019 which is relatively consistent with that in 2006 therefore the impoundment of tgd in 2003 did not impact the sedimentary environment of the ecs immediately in 2018 the grain size of the surface sediments ranged from 0 to 7 4 φ with a mean value of 4 4 2 1 φ which showed a drastic decrease a previous study suggested that a value of 0 5 φ could be chosen as the threshold for significant changes in grain size thereby enabling us to filter out the seasonal and spring neap tidal variations mostly between 0 1 and 0 3 φ in the study area yang et al 2018 a significant coarsening trend occurred after the impoundment of the tgd with the mean grain size increasing from 6 4 to 4 4 φ in addition surface sediment at a depth of 2 cm does not easily reflect seasonal variations because the deposition rate in the study area is lower than 2 cm yr 1 wang et al 2017 therefore the temporal resolution of surface sediment in this study is about 1 2 years from which short term seasonal variation cannot be extracted in addition we also collected sediment load data of changjiang yangtze river before and after the impoundment of the tgd the sediment loads were 305 44 mt yr 1 during 1992 and 2002 ten years before the tgd which decreased to 132 36 mt yr 1 during 2004 and 2014 ten years after the tgd fig s1 the sd value of sediment loads indicated that the interannual variation in sediment loads of changjiang yangtze river before tgd is little which also suggested that the sedimentary environment in the ecs should be relatively stable in this stage after the impoundment of the tgd the interannual variations in the sediment loads of changjiang yangtze river was little but persistent seabed erosion also occurred in the ecs due to the low sediment loads therefore the variations in the sediment grain size of the ecs between 2006 and 2018 were caused by the cumulative effect of persistent erosion the distribution patterns of sediment grain size from north of 29 n where we noted coarsening in the csd after the impoundment of the tgd fig 2a were consistent with the results of yang et al 2018 which stated that the surface sediment in the csd coarsening was evident after the tgd in addition sediment grain size between 29 n and 27 n showed coarsening to a certain extent fig 2a which is consistent with the results of gao et al 2019 sediment components in the ecs in 2006 and 2018 were calculated and compared to explain this coarsening phenomenon the content of the clay component decreased in the whole region especially north of 27 n fig s2 the content of the silt component increased in the zmcmb and the western part of the csd but decreased in the eastern part of the csd fig s2 however the sand content slightly increased in the zmcmb and the western part of the csd but increased drastically in the eastern part of the csd fig s2 therefore the sedimentary environment in the csd might have been disturbed and a large amount of fine grained particles such as clay and fine silt may have been resuspended and transported southward in addition the sedimentary environment in the northern and middle parts of the zmcmb between 29 n and 27 n might have been disturbed albeit at a relatively lesser extent than that of the csd these variations changed the original sediment distribution pattern in the seabed which may have influenced the distribution and fate of ocps in the marine environment in addition to sediment grain size we delineated the distribution of the toc content in the ecs in 2006 and 2018 which was considered an important factor influencing the distribution of the ocps hu et al 2011 jin et al 2017 the toc content in the ecs ranged from 0 17 to 0 84 in 2006 with a mean value of 0 56 0 16 fig 3 a and now the toc content varied from 0 11 to 0 81 in 2018 with a mean value of 0 45 0 18 fig 3b a clear boundary occurred at 29 n with the high toc content mainly occurring in the zmcmb and the western part of the csd the toc content evidently varied in the zmcmb fig 3b the toc content in sediments from the outer shelf of the estuary and the zmcmb decreased drastically which might be due to the reduction in fine grained sediments large amounts of toc associated with fine grained sediments were transported southward to the zmcmb and even to the outer shelf overall the spatial pattern of the toc content in the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs changed after the tgd impoundment which is consistent with the distribution pattern of sediment grain size 3 2 variations in ocps in ecs between 2006 and 2018 the concentrations of the total ocp ddt and hch in 2006 and 2018 are compared in fig 4 the total ocp concentration in 2006 ranged from 0 14 to 6 41 ng g 1 with a mean value of 2 55 1 51 ng g 1 fig 4a however the total ocp concentration in 2018 ranged from 0 06 to 4 38 ng g 1 with a mean value of 1 08 0 84 ng g 1 fig 4d the hch concentration in 2006 ranged from 0 03 to 1 96 ng g 1 with a mean value of 0 42 0 20 ng g 1 and the corresponding value in 2018 ranged from 0 to 0 91 ng g 1 with a mean value of 0 20 0 17 ng g 1 similarly the concentration of ddt in 2006 ranged from 0 08 to 5 66 ng g 1 with an average value of 1 74 1 04 ng g 1 this concentration also decreased drastically in 2018 ranging from 0 to 3 61 ng g 1 with a mean value of 0 89 0 69 ng g 1 similar to sediment grain size the ocp concentrations in surface sediments should be a mixed concentration whose time scale should also be 1 2 years considering spatial distribution the total concentration of ocps in the ecs showed an obvious difference in 2006 and 2018 the study area can be divided into the northern csd and southern zmcmb portions at 29 n which is consistent with the distribution pattern of the toc content fig 3 high total ocp concentrations were found in the western part of the csd and the zmcmb fig 4 which could be attributed to the terrestrial input and regional hydrodynamics hu et al 2011 the changjiang diluted water cdw fig 1a discharges large amounts of sediments and associated ocps into the estuary during the wet season may to october leading to a high total ocp concentration near the estuary then in the dry winter season november to april the east asian monsoon strengthens the southward current named the zhe min coastal current fig 1a leading to the resuspension of the deposited sediments and associated ocps into the estuary they are transported southward and eventually deposited into the zmcmb fig 4 also shows that high concentrations of total ocps mainly occurred in nearshore areas especially in 2006 to better understand the distribution patterns of ocps in the study area we utilized the profilegraph in arcgis 10 2 to extract ocp concentrations in five typical transects from the changjiang estuary to the southern part of the zmcmb fig 1b ocps in the alongshore transect from the estuary to the zmcmb displayed high concentrations in the csd and zmcmb fig 5 a and b ocps in the offshore transects from the land to the ocean showed a consistent downward trend fig 5c j suggesting that the total ocp concentration decreased from the coast to the ocean therefore in addition to the effects of hydrodynamics proximity to ocp sources should be the other main reason for the relatively high concentration of ocps in the zmcmb lin et al 2012 previous surveys have indicated that coastal provinces including zhejiang and fujian were major users of ocps during 1985 1991 and their ocp consumption per unit area ranked first and third among all provinces in the country respectively wang et al 2005 pesticide residues in the soil could therefore be entering the ecs via coastal mountain streams and surface runoff 3 3 response of ocps to changes in the river catchment after the impoundment of the tgd the total ocp concentration in surface sediments from the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs decreased drastically which seems consistent with the timeline of the official ban of ocps in china previous studies have demonstrated that ocps in the air of the arctic and east asia showed a clear declining trend after their ban ma et al 2011 takazawa et al 2016 then is the decrease in the total ocp concentration in the sediments due to the official ban it is known that ocps in the surface sediments of the ecs originated mainly from the continent due to soil erosion after their ban in china data on ocp concentrations in the topsoils of the changjiang river delta crd before and after the tgd impoundment were collected in this study and a clear decreasing trend was not observed in fact an increasing trend was noted after 2007 table 1 sedimentary records of ocps in inland lakes as well as the ecs also did not show a clear decreasing trend after the 2000s suggesting that ocp concentrations in the soils of the river catchment did not decrease overall after the 2000s liu et al 2009 li et al 2015 lin et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 demonstrated that the decline in ddt concentrations in the topsoil at the national scale was not obvious over time from 2001 to 2013 because the degradation of ddt in topsoil can take decades dimond and owen 1996 zhang et al 2018 in addition these studies reported a new input of ddt contained in the pesticide dicofol to the soils of the crd jiang et al 2009 sun et al 2016 the new input and resistance to degradation could be the two main reasons for the absence of clear decrease in ocp concentrations in the soil of the changjiang catchment therefore the ocps input from soil erosion into rivers did not change much which strongly suggests that the drastic decrease in ocp concentrations in sediments from the ecs was not caused by the ocp ban in addition to the ocp concentration in topsoil sediment loads could be another factor impacting the ocp flux discharged into the ecs previous studies have demonstrated that the sediment loads discharged into the ecs decreased gradually since the 1980s and decreased drastically from 340 mt yr 1 in 1986 2002 to 145 mt yr 1 in 2003 2012 after the impoundment of the tgd yang et al 2018 therefore large amounts of ocps adsorbed on the surface of the sediments were also intercepted in the reservoir which led to the drastic decrease in the ocp flux discharged into the ecs as mentioned above there may not be a significant change in the ocps content entering the river system through soil erosion but the sediments load decreased by more than 57 which might have also led to a substantial reduction in the ocp flux discharged into the ecs those ocps discharged into the ecs are more widely dispersed and diluted which might have directly caused the decrease in the ocp concentration in the surface sediments after the impoundment of the tgd it is well known that ddt and hch are highly hydrophobic in nature thus they have low water solubility and are prone to adsorption onto fine grained particles such as clay and silt shen and wania 2005 therefore sediment loads discharged from the changjiang yangtze river into the ecs could play an important role in controlling the distribution patterns of ocps in the ecs pearson correlation analysis was carried out between the ocp concentrations and sediment grain size components and the results showed strong positive correlation between ocp concentration and grain size silt component in 2006 and 2018 table 2 however correlation between the ocp concentration and clay component was weak than that for the grain size or silt component table 2 this phenomenon may be controlled mainly by the composition ratios of clay and silt components because the clay content is limited while that of silt dominates fig 2 a strong negative correlation is evident between the ocp concentration and the sand component table 2 additionally the absolute value of the correlation coefficient after the tgd impoundment increased to a certain extent increasing by approximately 0 2 for each item except the clay component table 2 therefore the influence of sediment grain size on the distribution patterns of the ocps might be more obvious after the impoundment of the tgd large amounts of sediments were intercepted by the reservoir leading to hungry water discharge i e water with a low suspended sediment concentration and further enhancing the current s ability to carry sediment eventually causing seabed erosion in the csd and northern part of the zmcmb fig 2 large amounts of fine particles especially clay and fine silt components could have been eroded and transported southward therefore the clay component decreased and the dominance of the silt component was further enhanced in the ecs which may have been the main cause for the improvement in the r value 3 4 deposition flux of ocps in the ecs in 2006 and 2018 to further understand the variations in the ocps in 2006 and 2018 deposition fluxes of the ocps were calculated for these two stages the ocp deposition flux was calculated following the work by lin et al 2013 as described briefly in section 2 using the map algebra technology of arcgis 10 2 software wang et al 2017 the deposition fluxes of the ocps in the ecs varied from 0 28 to 11 05 ng cm 2 yr 1 with a mean value of 2 65 1 67 ng cm 2 yr 1 in 2006 fig 6 a after the impoundment the sedimentation rate and ocp concentration in the ecs decreased which also led to a reduction in the ocp deposition flux ranging from 0 07 to 2 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 with a mean value of 0 89 0 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 fig 6b our previous study demonstrated that the deposition flux is determined by the deposition rate and compound concentration wang et al 2016 the deposition rate and ocp concentration in the ecs decreased strongly after the tgd impoundment thereby leading to a drastic decrease in the ocp flux in addition the distribution pattern of the ocp flux evidently changed after the tgd impoundment fig 6 in summary the ocps in the sediments of the ecs changed drastically due to intensified human activities in the river catchment which was mainly reflected in the variations in their distributions concentrations and deposition fluxes 4 implications marginal seas especially river dominated estuarine coastal regions are the major repositories of terrestrial materials in the ocean with more than 95 of riverine sediments buried therein syvitski et al 2005 bianchi and allison 2009 these sediments include large buried amounts of hydrophobic organic contaminants such as ocps these regions are active interfaces between the land and ocean and are subject to the effects of human activities fig 7 shows the global distribution patterns of pesticide use in cropland and large reservoirs and their trapping efficiencies for major rivers pesticides are mainly used in the middle and low latitude regions of countries especially in china central europe north africa and south america fig 7a similarly large rivers with high runoffs and sediment loads such as the amazon nile mekong ganges brahmaputra changjiang huanghe and pearl rivers are mainly located in the regions with high pesticide use agricultural activities and soil erosion led to large amounts of ocps being released into rivers and eventually discharged into the adjacent marginal seas therefore marginal seas in the middle and low latitudes have been important sinks of ocps and are characterized by a high ocp burden however dams and reservoirs constructed in river catchments worldwide have led to large amounts of sediments being intercepted by the reservoirs fig 7b and c moreover ocp influxes via rivers have likely reduced owing to their hydrophobicity therefore shifts in the distribution and fate of sedimentary ocps in marginal seas under the influence of human activities is likely to be prevalent globally it is noteworthy that owing to unique human induced catchment changes in each marginal sea the mode and extent of this influence will vary resulting in differences in the fate of the ocps 5 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the ocp distribution patterns and deposition flux in the ecs in 2006 and 2018 human induced catchment change is considered to be the main factor controlling the distribution and fate of ocps in the ecs the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the ocp concentrations in the ecs in 2006 ranged from 0 14 to 6 41 ng g 1 with a mean value of 2 55 1 51 ng g 1 the ocp concentrations clearly decreased in 2018 ranging from 0 01 to 4 38 ng g 1 with a mean value of 1 08 0 84 ng g 1 2 the deposition fluxes of ocps in the ecs varied from 0 28 to 11 05 ng cm 2 yr 1 with a mean value of 2 65 1 67 ng cm 2 yr 1 in 2006 and then the sedimentation rate and ocp concentration in the ecs decreased in 2018 which also led to a reduction in the ocp deposition flux from 0 07 to 2 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 with a mean value of 0 89 0 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 3 the correlation analysis showed a good correlation between the ocp concentrations and the silt component the r value increased by more than 0 2 after the tgd impoundment therefore riverine input might have been the main factor controlling the fate of ocps before the tgd impoundment and seabed erosion owing to reduction in sediment loads might be the primary controlling factor after the impoundment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

18338,human induced catchment changes have affected the sedimentary processes in marginal seas which will impact the transport and burial processes of materials and inevitably impact marine biogeochemical cycles organochlorine pesticides ocps and sediment characteristics in surface sediments from the east china sea ecs at two time points 2006 and 2018 were compared to understand the response of ocps to human induced catchment changes a significant coarsening trend occurred after the impoundment of the three gorges dam tgd with the mean grain size increasing from 6 4 1 2 φ to 4 4 2 1 φ suggesting that the sedimentary environment in the ecs changed drastically ocp concentrations in the ecs evidently decreased after the impoundment of the tgd with mean values decreasing from 2 55 1 51 ng g 1 to 1 08 0 84 ng g 1 the deposition flux of ocp also decreased from 2 65 1 67 ng cm 2 yr 1 to 0 89 0 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 the reduction in the riverine input might be the reason that caused variations in the ocp concentration and deposition flux in addition sediment coarsening is likely to be the another primary factor influencing the differences in the distribution and deposition flux of the ocps in the ecs therefore the distribution and burial of ocps in the ecs have been changed drastically which may broadly impact the marine environment and biogeochemical cycles graphical abstract image 1 keywords organochlorine pesticides sediment grain size human activity catchment changes three gorges dam east china sea 1 introduction anthropogenic threats such as pollution that affect the oceans since the beginning of the anthropocene are unprecedented steffen et al 2007 lewis and maslin 2015 these threats are altering the physicochemical properties and health of the world s oceans and influencing the survival of marine organisms alava et al 2017 since the 20th century large amounts of synthetic compounds have been invented and used worldwide including organochlorine pesticides ocps which have been used extensively since the 1940s their concentrations in the environment have increased gradually and peaked during 1970 1990 li and macdonald 2005 although these ocps have been restricted or banned in most countries several decades ago they can still be detected in various environmental compartments such as air water soil sediment and ice lewalle et al 2009 wong et al 2012 li et al 2017 jin et al 2017 bigot et al 2017 these ocps eventually enter marine environments through atmospheric deposition and surface runoff yang et al 2005 hu et al 2011 lin et al 2015 resulting in marginal seas a marginal sea is located at the edge of the continent separated from the ocean by a peninsula island or archipelago and connected to the ocean only by a strait or channel being recognized as important sinks of ocps guan et al 2009 hu et al 2011 ali et al 2014 therefore much attention has been paid to coastal oceans owing to the accumulation of ocps because they are recognized to have adverse effects on marine organisms and even the surrounding residents connor et al 2007 greenfield et al 2015 estuarine inner shelf areas are important components of coastal oceans as they receive large amounts of terrestrial materials discharged via riverine inputs gao and collins 2014 however the transport of terrestrial materials from river catchments to estuaries has decreased substantially owing to intensive human activities in river catchments e g dam construction land use change and water withdrawal syvitski et al 2005 milliman and farnsworth 2013 which have modified the sedimentary environment and ecosystems in the estuarine shelf regions gao 2013 gao et al 2017 2019 yang et al 2018 ocp loads associated with sediment loads are also likely to have decreased significantly resulting in a changed flux to the ocean thus human activities have modified the source to sink transport process of terrestrial materials which in turn has influenced the transmission of ocps in river catchment estuary shelf systems accordingly it is necessary to investigate the impact of human induced catchment changes on the source to sink transport mechanisms of ocps in coastal oceans the east china sea ecs is a typical marginal sea dominated by the changjiang yangtze river which is facing severe pressure from human activities terrestrial input and atmospheric deposition have resulted in large amounts of ocps entering the ecs making this region an important ocp sink hu et al 2011 lin et al 2012 2013 however the official ban on ocp use has been in force for several decades causing a decreasing trend for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt and hexachlorocyclohexane hch levels in the air zhang et al 2002 lin et al 2012 and even leading to the secondary release of ocps from the ecs lin et al 2015 li et al 2017 due to human activities especially dam construction the transport of terrestrial materials from river catchments to the ecs has also substantially changed gao et al 2018 yang et al 2018 more than 50 000 reservoirs have been constructed in the changjiang yangtze river catchment yang et al 2011 which intercept sediments at a rate of 453 mt yr 1 million tons per year gao et al 2018 sediment discharge has decreased steadily from 511 mt yr 1 in 1956 1968 to 450 mt yr 1 in 1969 1985 340 mt yr 1 in 1986 2002 145 mt yr 1 in 2003 2012 following the construction of the three gorges dam tgd and finally 118 mt yr 1 in 2013 2015 following the construction of cascade dams yang et al 2018 sediment loads discharged into the ecs decreased drastically after the impoundment of the tgd even below the threshold value of the sediment loads transported from the changjiang subaqueous delta csd to the zhe min coastal mud belt zmcmb by the southward zhe min coastal current fig 1 the threshold value is 150 mt yr 1 based on the deposition rate of the holocene mud wedge in the ecs inner shelf xu et al 2012 yang et al 2018 therefore sediments deposited into the csd could be eroded and transported southward which would change the sedimentary environment in the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs gao et al 2017 wang et al 2018 these variations will inevitably change the distribution sources and transport of ocps in the estuarine inner shelf regions of the ecs the above review shows that human induced catchment changes are changing the system stability of the ecs which could impact the fate of ocps and further influence ecological safety in the ecs consequently investigating the impacts of human activities on the source to sink transport of ocps in the ecs is necessary and urgent in the early 21st century several ecs related studies focused on the distribution fate and flux of ocps yang et al 2005 hu et al 2011 lin et al 2012 as well as their air seawater exchange lin et al 2015 zhong et al 2014 li et al 2017 hu et al 2011 suggested that the direct riverine inputs and shelf mud depositional process were dominant factors controlling the distribution and fate of the ocps in the ecs however limited attention has been paid to the variations in ocps in surface sediments considering the influence of human activities which is valuable for understanding the regional ocp cycle in this study we examined the sediment grain size total organic carbon toc and ocps in surface sediments from the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs and compared these values before and after the impoundment of the tgd our specific goals were to determine the changes in the levels and spatial patterns of the ocps in the study area after the tgd impoundment in particular we wanted to explore how ocps in the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs respond to human induced catchment changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection a total of 149 surficial sediment samples were collected from the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs using a stainless steel box corer during three cruises conducted by r v xiang yang hong 18 and ke xue 3 in may 2018 the sampling sites distributed as highlighted in fig 1b all samples 0 2 cm were wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at 20 c until the analysis 2 2 data acquisition in this study information on sediment grain size n 126 toc content n 126 and ocp concentrations n 114 produced in 2006 was sourced from previous studies hu et al 2011 lin et al 2012 wang et al 2017 all these samples were collected from the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs in the summer of 2006 and 2007 data on sedimentation rate before impoundment of the tgd n 76 were collected from wang et al 2017 and those on the sedimentation rate after impoundment n 76 were sourced from gao et al 2019 two types of ocps were studied in this work hchs α hch β hch γ hch and ddts p p ddt p p dde p p ddd 2 3 laboratory analysis a standard mixed solution containing hch α hch β hch γ hch δ hch and ddt p p ddt o p ddt p p ddd and p p dde was purchased from accustandard all solvents dichloromethane acetone and n hexane used during the processing were of hplc grade analytical grade anhydrous sodium sulfate was activated at 450 c for 5 h to remove impurities before use silica gel 100 200 mesh was extracted using acetone dichloromethane and n hexane for 24 h and activated for approximately 16 h at 130 c ocp was extracted as per lin et al 2012 each freeze dried and homogenized sample ca 5 g was soxhlet extracted using 100 ml of dichloromethane for 24 h and 2 g of activated copper was added for desulfurization a mixture of tcmx and pcb209 was added to each of the samples as surrogate standards prior to extraction the extracted solution was concentrated to 1 2 ml in a rotary evaporator and cleaned using a chromatography column 8 mm i d with neutral alumina 3 cm 3 deactivated neutral silica gel 3 cm 3 deactivated 50 on a weight basis sulfuric acid silica 2 cm and anhydrous sodium sulfate the concentrated solution was added to the column and eluted with 20 ml of n hexane dichloromethane 1 1 v v the eluate containing the ocps was vacuum evaporated and solvent exchanged with n hexane and finally concentrated to 1 ml under a gentle stream of nitrogen a thermo fisher scientific tsq 8000 evo gc ms ms equipped with a fused silica capillary tg5 ms column 30 m 0 25 mm internal diameter 0 25 μm film thickness was used to determine the concentration of the ocps helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the gc temperature model was as follows an initial temperature of 80 c was maintained for 2 min and increased at a rate of 20 c min 1 to 180 c and held for 5 min then it was increased at a rate of 10 c min 1 to 290 c and maintained for 15 min the injection port was set at 290 c subsequently 1 μl of the sample extract was injected in the split less mode the interface and ion source temperatures were maintained at 290 and 230 c respectively the ionization was carried out in the electron impact mode at 70 ev and data were acquired using the selective reaction monitoring mode a procedural blank and matrix spiked samples consisting of all analytes were analyzed with each six sample set duplicates were run for every 12 samples and the samples were reanalyzed if the difference exceeded more than 15 the ocps were quantified using the external standard method calibration curves were drawn based on the sets of six standard concentrations of 1 10 50 100 250 and 500 ng ml 1 the standard curve was checked every day using the reference standard to ensure satisfactory linear regression coefficients r2 0 999 for all the ocps tested the p p ddt was detected in some blank samples and its concentration ranged from 0 to 0 02 ng g 1 with a mean value of 0 004 0 002 ng g 1 n 14 this was 6 7 of the lowest observed concentration in our sediment samples and therefore negligible the average recoveries of the ocps based on matrix spiked samples ranged from 74 5 to 106 2 the average surrogate recoveries were 68 13 and 95 9 for tcmx and pcb209 respectively the grain size was analyzed as described by wang et al 2018 briefly all samples were digested by an h2o2 solution 10 to remove the organic matter and then dispersed in sodium metaphosphate for 24 h the grain size was measured using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malven instruments ltd uk and the measuring error was within 3 each freeze dried and homogenized sediment was immersed in 10 hydrochloric acid for 24 h and washed to neutrality the resulting material was wrapped in a silver boat to measure the toc content using an elemental analyzer flash 2000ht 2 4 kriging interpolation the kriging interpolation method was used to acquire the spatial variability of each dataset using the same gridding density for the same areas in the ecs shelf regions the most widely used geostatistical technology is the ordinary kriging interpolation which uses linear spatial and interpolator estimated data at unsampled locations using a linear weight function of adjacent data points guney et al 2010 1 z x 0 i 1 n λ i z x i where z x 0 is the estimated value of z at point x 0 z x i is the sampled value at point x i and λ i is the weight placed on z x i we used arcgis 10 0 software for the mapping and spatial analysis 2 5 deposition flux the ocp deposition flux in surface sediments was estimated to assess the extent of contamination which was calculated using several sediment properties and ocp concentration as shown in equation 2 2 f d e p o s i t i o n 10 10 a c o c p s ρ ω where a is the area of a given region km2 c o c p s is the measured sedimentary ocp concentrations ng g 1 ρ is the dry density of the sediment samples g cm 3 and ω is the sedimentation rate cm yr 1 mentioned in section 2 2 which was collected from wang et al 2017 the recommended value of 1 2 g cm 3 was selected for ρ liu et al 2007 the kriging interpolation method was used to obtain the spatial distribution of ω based on the accurately collected sedimentation rates for the study area 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in physicochemical parameters of sediments in estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs previous studies have demonstrated that the sediments deposited in the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs are likely to lag behind changes in the changjiang yangtze river catchment by about 3 years hu et al 2012 gao et al 2017 implying that the sedimentary environment in the ecs cannot change immediately when the catchment is changed therefore samples collected from the ecs in 2006 could reflect the sedimentary environment in the ecs around 2003 the tgd was completed in 2003 and these samples could be considered as having just been or even not been affected by the tgd impoundment therefore 2006 can be regarded as the beginning year when the tgd affected the sedimentary environment of the ecs then sediment loads decreased drastically after the tgd impoundment which significantly changed the transport of terrestrial materials from the changjiang yangtze river to the ecs gao et al 2019 to better understand the variations in sediment grain size response to human induced catchment changes we compared the sediment grain size in the ecs for two different time nodes before the tgd sample collected in 2006 and after the tgd sample collected in 2018 fig 2 shows that the sediment grain size changed in the ecs becoming increasingly coarse after the impoundment of the tgd in 2006 the sediment grain size ranged from 2 5 to 7 3 φ φ log 2 d where d is the sediment grain size mm with a mean value of 6 4 1 2 φ mean 6 4 sd 1 2 all further results refer to this previous studies have demonstrated that the sediments in the ecs were relatively fine in 1982 with particle sizes ranging from 6 3 to 7 1 φ mean value is 6 7 0 2 φ gao et al 2019 which is relatively consistent with that in 2006 therefore the impoundment of tgd in 2003 did not impact the sedimentary environment of the ecs immediately in 2018 the grain size of the surface sediments ranged from 0 to 7 4 φ with a mean value of 4 4 2 1 φ which showed a drastic decrease a previous study suggested that a value of 0 5 φ could be chosen as the threshold for significant changes in grain size thereby enabling us to filter out the seasonal and spring neap tidal variations mostly between 0 1 and 0 3 φ in the study area yang et al 2018 a significant coarsening trend occurred after the impoundment of the tgd with the mean grain size increasing from 6 4 to 4 4 φ in addition surface sediment at a depth of 2 cm does not easily reflect seasonal variations because the deposition rate in the study area is lower than 2 cm yr 1 wang et al 2017 therefore the temporal resolution of surface sediment in this study is about 1 2 years from which short term seasonal variation cannot be extracted in addition we also collected sediment load data of changjiang yangtze river before and after the impoundment of the tgd the sediment loads were 305 44 mt yr 1 during 1992 and 2002 ten years before the tgd which decreased to 132 36 mt yr 1 during 2004 and 2014 ten years after the tgd fig s1 the sd value of sediment loads indicated that the interannual variation in sediment loads of changjiang yangtze river before tgd is little which also suggested that the sedimentary environment in the ecs should be relatively stable in this stage after the impoundment of the tgd the interannual variations in the sediment loads of changjiang yangtze river was little but persistent seabed erosion also occurred in the ecs due to the low sediment loads therefore the variations in the sediment grain size of the ecs between 2006 and 2018 were caused by the cumulative effect of persistent erosion the distribution patterns of sediment grain size from north of 29 n where we noted coarsening in the csd after the impoundment of the tgd fig 2a were consistent with the results of yang et al 2018 which stated that the surface sediment in the csd coarsening was evident after the tgd in addition sediment grain size between 29 n and 27 n showed coarsening to a certain extent fig 2a which is consistent with the results of gao et al 2019 sediment components in the ecs in 2006 and 2018 were calculated and compared to explain this coarsening phenomenon the content of the clay component decreased in the whole region especially north of 27 n fig s2 the content of the silt component increased in the zmcmb and the western part of the csd but decreased in the eastern part of the csd fig s2 however the sand content slightly increased in the zmcmb and the western part of the csd but increased drastically in the eastern part of the csd fig s2 therefore the sedimentary environment in the csd might have been disturbed and a large amount of fine grained particles such as clay and fine silt may have been resuspended and transported southward in addition the sedimentary environment in the northern and middle parts of the zmcmb between 29 n and 27 n might have been disturbed albeit at a relatively lesser extent than that of the csd these variations changed the original sediment distribution pattern in the seabed which may have influenced the distribution and fate of ocps in the marine environment in addition to sediment grain size we delineated the distribution of the toc content in the ecs in 2006 and 2018 which was considered an important factor influencing the distribution of the ocps hu et al 2011 jin et al 2017 the toc content in the ecs ranged from 0 17 to 0 84 in 2006 with a mean value of 0 56 0 16 fig 3 a and now the toc content varied from 0 11 to 0 81 in 2018 with a mean value of 0 45 0 18 fig 3b a clear boundary occurred at 29 n with the high toc content mainly occurring in the zmcmb and the western part of the csd the toc content evidently varied in the zmcmb fig 3b the toc content in sediments from the outer shelf of the estuary and the zmcmb decreased drastically which might be due to the reduction in fine grained sediments large amounts of toc associated with fine grained sediments were transported southward to the zmcmb and even to the outer shelf overall the spatial pattern of the toc content in the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs changed after the tgd impoundment which is consistent with the distribution pattern of sediment grain size 3 2 variations in ocps in ecs between 2006 and 2018 the concentrations of the total ocp ddt and hch in 2006 and 2018 are compared in fig 4 the total ocp concentration in 2006 ranged from 0 14 to 6 41 ng g 1 with a mean value of 2 55 1 51 ng g 1 fig 4a however the total ocp concentration in 2018 ranged from 0 06 to 4 38 ng g 1 with a mean value of 1 08 0 84 ng g 1 fig 4d the hch concentration in 2006 ranged from 0 03 to 1 96 ng g 1 with a mean value of 0 42 0 20 ng g 1 and the corresponding value in 2018 ranged from 0 to 0 91 ng g 1 with a mean value of 0 20 0 17 ng g 1 similarly the concentration of ddt in 2006 ranged from 0 08 to 5 66 ng g 1 with an average value of 1 74 1 04 ng g 1 this concentration also decreased drastically in 2018 ranging from 0 to 3 61 ng g 1 with a mean value of 0 89 0 69 ng g 1 similar to sediment grain size the ocp concentrations in surface sediments should be a mixed concentration whose time scale should also be 1 2 years considering spatial distribution the total concentration of ocps in the ecs showed an obvious difference in 2006 and 2018 the study area can be divided into the northern csd and southern zmcmb portions at 29 n which is consistent with the distribution pattern of the toc content fig 3 high total ocp concentrations were found in the western part of the csd and the zmcmb fig 4 which could be attributed to the terrestrial input and regional hydrodynamics hu et al 2011 the changjiang diluted water cdw fig 1a discharges large amounts of sediments and associated ocps into the estuary during the wet season may to october leading to a high total ocp concentration near the estuary then in the dry winter season november to april the east asian monsoon strengthens the southward current named the zhe min coastal current fig 1a leading to the resuspension of the deposited sediments and associated ocps into the estuary they are transported southward and eventually deposited into the zmcmb fig 4 also shows that high concentrations of total ocps mainly occurred in nearshore areas especially in 2006 to better understand the distribution patterns of ocps in the study area we utilized the profilegraph in arcgis 10 2 to extract ocp concentrations in five typical transects from the changjiang estuary to the southern part of the zmcmb fig 1b ocps in the alongshore transect from the estuary to the zmcmb displayed high concentrations in the csd and zmcmb fig 5 a and b ocps in the offshore transects from the land to the ocean showed a consistent downward trend fig 5c j suggesting that the total ocp concentration decreased from the coast to the ocean therefore in addition to the effects of hydrodynamics proximity to ocp sources should be the other main reason for the relatively high concentration of ocps in the zmcmb lin et al 2012 previous surveys have indicated that coastal provinces including zhejiang and fujian were major users of ocps during 1985 1991 and their ocp consumption per unit area ranked first and third among all provinces in the country respectively wang et al 2005 pesticide residues in the soil could therefore be entering the ecs via coastal mountain streams and surface runoff 3 3 response of ocps to changes in the river catchment after the impoundment of the tgd the total ocp concentration in surface sediments from the estuarine inner shelf areas of the ecs decreased drastically which seems consistent with the timeline of the official ban of ocps in china previous studies have demonstrated that ocps in the air of the arctic and east asia showed a clear declining trend after their ban ma et al 2011 takazawa et al 2016 then is the decrease in the total ocp concentration in the sediments due to the official ban it is known that ocps in the surface sediments of the ecs originated mainly from the continent due to soil erosion after their ban in china data on ocp concentrations in the topsoils of the changjiang river delta crd before and after the tgd impoundment were collected in this study and a clear decreasing trend was not observed in fact an increasing trend was noted after 2007 table 1 sedimentary records of ocps in inland lakes as well as the ecs also did not show a clear decreasing trend after the 2000s suggesting that ocp concentrations in the soils of the river catchment did not decrease overall after the 2000s liu et al 2009 li et al 2015 lin et al 2016 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 demonstrated that the decline in ddt concentrations in the topsoil at the national scale was not obvious over time from 2001 to 2013 because the degradation of ddt in topsoil can take decades dimond and owen 1996 zhang et al 2018 in addition these studies reported a new input of ddt contained in the pesticide dicofol to the soils of the crd jiang et al 2009 sun et al 2016 the new input and resistance to degradation could be the two main reasons for the absence of clear decrease in ocp concentrations in the soil of the changjiang catchment therefore the ocps input from soil erosion into rivers did not change much which strongly suggests that the drastic decrease in ocp concentrations in sediments from the ecs was not caused by the ocp ban in addition to the ocp concentration in topsoil sediment loads could be another factor impacting the ocp flux discharged into the ecs previous studies have demonstrated that the sediment loads discharged into the ecs decreased gradually since the 1980s and decreased drastically from 340 mt yr 1 in 1986 2002 to 145 mt yr 1 in 2003 2012 after the impoundment of the tgd yang et al 2018 therefore large amounts of ocps adsorbed on the surface of the sediments were also intercepted in the reservoir which led to the drastic decrease in the ocp flux discharged into the ecs as mentioned above there may not be a significant change in the ocps content entering the river system through soil erosion but the sediments load decreased by more than 57 which might have also led to a substantial reduction in the ocp flux discharged into the ecs those ocps discharged into the ecs are more widely dispersed and diluted which might have directly caused the decrease in the ocp concentration in the surface sediments after the impoundment of the tgd it is well known that ddt and hch are highly hydrophobic in nature thus they have low water solubility and are prone to adsorption onto fine grained particles such as clay and silt shen and wania 2005 therefore sediment loads discharged from the changjiang yangtze river into the ecs could play an important role in controlling the distribution patterns of ocps in the ecs pearson correlation analysis was carried out between the ocp concentrations and sediment grain size components and the results showed strong positive correlation between ocp concentration and grain size silt component in 2006 and 2018 table 2 however correlation between the ocp concentration and clay component was weak than that for the grain size or silt component table 2 this phenomenon may be controlled mainly by the composition ratios of clay and silt components because the clay content is limited while that of silt dominates fig 2 a strong negative correlation is evident between the ocp concentration and the sand component table 2 additionally the absolute value of the correlation coefficient after the tgd impoundment increased to a certain extent increasing by approximately 0 2 for each item except the clay component table 2 therefore the influence of sediment grain size on the distribution patterns of the ocps might be more obvious after the impoundment of the tgd large amounts of sediments were intercepted by the reservoir leading to hungry water discharge i e water with a low suspended sediment concentration and further enhancing the current s ability to carry sediment eventually causing seabed erosion in the csd and northern part of the zmcmb fig 2 large amounts of fine particles especially clay and fine silt components could have been eroded and transported southward therefore the clay component decreased and the dominance of the silt component was further enhanced in the ecs which may have been the main cause for the improvement in the r value 3 4 deposition flux of ocps in the ecs in 2006 and 2018 to further understand the variations in the ocps in 2006 and 2018 deposition fluxes of the ocps were calculated for these two stages the ocp deposition flux was calculated following the work by lin et al 2013 as described briefly in section 2 using the map algebra technology of arcgis 10 2 software wang et al 2017 the deposition fluxes of the ocps in the ecs varied from 0 28 to 11 05 ng cm 2 yr 1 with a mean value of 2 65 1 67 ng cm 2 yr 1 in 2006 fig 6 a after the impoundment the sedimentation rate and ocp concentration in the ecs decreased which also led to a reduction in the ocp deposition flux ranging from 0 07 to 2 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 with a mean value of 0 89 0 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 fig 6b our previous study demonstrated that the deposition flux is determined by the deposition rate and compound concentration wang et al 2016 the deposition rate and ocp concentration in the ecs decreased strongly after the tgd impoundment thereby leading to a drastic decrease in the ocp flux in addition the distribution pattern of the ocp flux evidently changed after the tgd impoundment fig 6 in summary the ocps in the sediments of the ecs changed drastically due to intensified human activities in the river catchment which was mainly reflected in the variations in their distributions concentrations and deposition fluxes 4 implications marginal seas especially river dominated estuarine coastal regions are the major repositories of terrestrial materials in the ocean with more than 95 of riverine sediments buried therein syvitski et al 2005 bianchi and allison 2009 these sediments include large buried amounts of hydrophobic organic contaminants such as ocps these regions are active interfaces between the land and ocean and are subject to the effects of human activities fig 7 shows the global distribution patterns of pesticide use in cropland and large reservoirs and their trapping efficiencies for major rivers pesticides are mainly used in the middle and low latitude regions of countries especially in china central europe north africa and south america fig 7a similarly large rivers with high runoffs and sediment loads such as the amazon nile mekong ganges brahmaputra changjiang huanghe and pearl rivers are mainly located in the regions with high pesticide use agricultural activities and soil erosion led to large amounts of ocps being released into rivers and eventually discharged into the adjacent marginal seas therefore marginal seas in the middle and low latitudes have been important sinks of ocps and are characterized by a high ocp burden however dams and reservoirs constructed in river catchments worldwide have led to large amounts of sediments being intercepted by the reservoirs fig 7b and c moreover ocp influxes via rivers have likely reduced owing to their hydrophobicity therefore shifts in the distribution and fate of sedimentary ocps in marginal seas under the influence of human activities is likely to be prevalent globally it is noteworthy that owing to unique human induced catchment changes in each marginal sea the mode and extent of this influence will vary resulting in differences in the fate of the ocps 5 conclusions this study comprehensively investigated the ocp distribution patterns and deposition flux in the ecs in 2006 and 2018 human induced catchment change is considered to be the main factor controlling the distribution and fate of ocps in the ecs the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the ocp concentrations in the ecs in 2006 ranged from 0 14 to 6 41 ng g 1 with a mean value of 2 55 1 51 ng g 1 the ocp concentrations clearly decreased in 2018 ranging from 0 01 to 4 38 ng g 1 with a mean value of 1 08 0 84 ng g 1 2 the deposition fluxes of ocps in the ecs varied from 0 28 to 11 05 ng cm 2 yr 1 with a mean value of 2 65 1 67 ng cm 2 yr 1 in 2006 and then the sedimentation rate and ocp concentration in the ecs decreased in 2018 which also led to a reduction in the ocp deposition flux from 0 07 to 2 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 with a mean value of 0 89 0 60 ng cm 2 yr 1 3 the correlation analysis showed a good correlation between the ocp concentrations and the silt component the r value increased by more than 0 2 after the tgd impoundment therefore riverine input might have been the main factor controlling the fate of ocps before the tgd impoundment and seabed erosion owing to reduction in sediment loads might be the primary controlling factor after the impoundment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

18339,the production of biochemicals from renewables through biorefinery processes is important to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the environment chain elongation processes based on microbiomes have been successfully developed to produce medium chain fatty acids mcfa from organic waste streams yet the sustainability of chain elongation can still be improved by reducing the use of electron donors and additional chemicals this work aimed to couple lactate production and subsequent chain elongation to decrease chemicals input such as electron donors and hydroxide for ph control in repeated batch food waste fermentation food waste with adjusted ph was used as substrate and fermentation proceeded without ph control during fermentation lactate was first formed through the homolactic pathway and then converted to fatty acids fa mainly n butyrate and n caproate the highest n caproate carbon selectivities mmol c mmol cfa and production rates were 38 and 4 2 g cod l d respectively hydroxide input was reduced over time to a minimum of 0 47 mol oh mol mcfa or 0 79 mol oh kg codfa lactate was a key electron donor for chain elongation and its conversion was observed at ph as low as 4 3 the microbiome enriched in this work was dominated by lactobacillus spp and caproiciproducens spp the high abundance of caproiciproducens spp and their co occurrence with lactobacillus spp suggest caproiciproducens spp used lactate as electron donor for chain elongation this work shows the production of n caproate from food waste with decreased use of hydroxide and no use of exogenous electron donors graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial chain elongation medium chain fatty acids n caproate anaerobic digestion caproiciproducens spp 1 introduction sustainable production of biochemicals is a key factor to reduce anthropogenic contributions to climate change and to develop a biobased economy cherubini 2010 the biobased economy is grounded in biorefinery processes that allow effective conversion of renewable materials into a broad spectrum of chemicals materials and fuels numerous microbial chain elongation processes exist that are able to elongate single or short chain molecules into longer chain molecules one recently developed microbial chain elongation process makes use of anaerobic microbiomes to convert organic wastes into medium chain fatty acids mcfa i e fatty acids with 6 12 carbons such as n caproate steinbusch et al 2011 mcfa are preferred products over short chain fatty acids scfa i e fatty acids with 6 carbons due to their higher energy content and their increased hydrophobicity makes mcfa easier to separate from the fermentation broth mcfa are versatile compounds with different applications e g feed additives bioplastics lubricants aviation fuels although chain elongation is a promising technology the sustainability of the process can be improved considerably by reducing the use of electron donors and additional chemicals for ph control chen et al 2017 thus electron donors with a more sustainable nature are needed to improve the environmental performance of the chain elongation technology chain elongating bacteria can use a variety of electron donors as energy and carbon sources in ethanol based chain elongation ethanol is metabolized by clostridium kluyveri into acetyl coa and nadh electrons in nadh are used to drive the reverse β oxidation rbo pathway elongating available acetate c2 to n butyrate n c4 by the condensation of two acetyl coa angenent et al 2016 when enough ethanol is available n butyrate is condensed with another acetyl coa in a second round and elongated to n caproate n c6 angenent et al 2016 in lactate based chain elongation pyruvate and nadh are products of lactate oxidation pyruvate is further oxidized to acetyl coa and co2 with electrons released in form of reduced ferredoxin spirito et al 2014 the derived acetyl coa are used for n butyrate and n caproate formation through rbo zhu et al 2017 in this paper we denote n caproate as undissociated n caproic acid and dissociated n caproate together and we refer to each specific form when appropriate bacteria possessing the rbo pathway have been enriched in mcfa producing microbiomes fed with ethanol lactate and sugars with ethanol as intermediary ding et al 2010 kucek et al 2016a steinbusch et al 2011 recently a few processes have been developed to produce n caproate from organic waste streams which either contain electron donors for chain elongation kucek et al 2016b or were acidified to produce electron donors such as lactate nzeteu et al 2018 xu et al 2018 lactate is produced by lactic acid bacteria lab mainly from carbohydrates gänzle and follador 2012 during lactate production the release of protons eq 1 causes acidification of the medium and eventually stops microbial activity due to metabolism disruption or toxicity of undissociated acids kashket 1987 in contrast a net proton consumption occurs in lactate based chain elongation due to a decrease in the total acids molar concentration eqs 2 and 3 therefore the proton consuming behaviour of lactate based chain elongation could be used to compensate for the protons released during lactate production in the acidification phase besides propionate production from lactate an important competing pathway in lactate based chain elongation kucek et al 2016a could be restricted when coupling these two processes since lab and lactate elongators are able to grow at ph 5 0 kashket 1987 weimer and moen 2013 which can limit the occurrence of propionate producing bacteria hettinga and reinbold 1972 janssen 1991 1 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 c 3 h 5 o 3 2 h 2 2 c 3 h 5 o 3 h c 4 h 7 o 2 2 h 2 2 c o 2 3 3 c 3 h 5 o 3 2 h c 6 h 11 o 2 2

operation which would result in 1 no need of exogenous electron donor addition and 2 reduction of chemicals addition for ph control with repeated batch operation a concentrated food waste was consecutively added over 3 cycles which enabled to increase the n caproate concentration over time food waste fermentation was performed without ph control changes in the microbiome composition were evaluated using 16s rrna gene based metagenomic data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and procedure food waste was used as the only substrate in this study and consisted of outdated food remainders food waste was obtained from a recycling company rotie the netherlands and preserved at 20 c for long term storage this was the same original food waste used in an earlier study in which microbially acidified waste was used to develop an effective ethanol based chain elongation process roghair et al 2018 prior to use the waste was thawed in a 4 c room and kept at this temperature during the experimental work the waste had a total solids content ts of 200 2 2 2 g ts l volatile solids content vs of 179 4 1 1 g vs l and total acidity of 15036 152 mg caco3 l table s1

valerate 0 20 0 02 g l fermentation was carried out in a stirred tank reactor 1l rbf with working volume of 1 l which was inoculated with a microbiome obtained from previous food waste fermentation this was the same reactor used in earlier chain elongation studies roghair et al 2016 for the start up the 1l rbf reactor was fed with a mixture of mineral medium vitamins and food waste to reach a food waste concentration of 10 v v the ph of the mixture was adjusted to an initial value of 6 0 mineral medium and vitamins were added only at the beginning of the experiment with concentrations as reported by roghair et al 2016 except that nh4 h2po4 was reduced to 1 8 g l during 1l rbf operation concentrated food waste was adjusted to ph 6 0 with 4 m koh before addition to the reactor to have comparable ph in the waste fed and fermentation was allowed to proceed without ph control food waste was added on days 0 and 15 at concentrations of 10 v v and on day 32 at 15 v v nitrogen gas was bubbled for 15 min after each substrate addition to ensure anaerobic conditions the reactor was connected to a gas flow meter μflow bioprocess control to quantify gas production and temperature was 35 c duplicate experiments were performed using 500 ml schott bottles with working volume of 300 ml to systematically assess repeated batch fermentation 0 3l rbf procedure in 0 3l rbf experiments was the same as in 1l rbf except that food waste was added at constant concentration of 10 v v once lactate was depleted every 7 8 days in the same way mineral medium and vitamins were added only at the beginning of the experiment together with yeast extract 1 g l for the 0 3l rbf experiment inoculum was taken from the 1 l reactor on day 19 and added at 3 v v the same procedure as in 0 3l rbf was followed in duplicate single batch experiments except that food waste was added only once single batch experiments were performed to evaluate the products distribution of long term hydrolysis and acidification of food waste the 0 3l rbf and single batch experiments were placed in a shaker at 120 rpm and 35 c to evaluate the effect of higher temperature on hydrolysis lactate formation duplicate experiments were operated likewise to 0 3l rbf but at a temperature of 50 c until day 17 the same mesophilic inoculum was mixed with thermophilic anaerobic sludge from a recycling company heerenveen the netherlands and added 3 v v as inoculum for the thermophilic experiments on day 17 temperature was switched to 35 c for subsequent chain elongation a modified cap was used for the schott bottles to allow liquid sampling and gas was collected via connected gas bags liquid and gas samples were taken regularly to measure metabolites ph and gas composition the following parameters were used to evaluate the performance of the process and for comparison with literature substrate hydrolysis estimated as the increase in measured cods between the beginning and end of each cycle divided by the ts

samples for microbiome composition analysis were taken fig s1 from the fermentation broth centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and stored at 20 c for dna extraction and sequencing dna was extracted from the pellets applying a powersoil dna isolation kit according to the manufacturer s instructions the isolated dna was used as template for amplifying the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna via illumina sequencing using the primer sets described by takahashi et al 2014 this allowed simultaneous amplification of bacterial and archaean 16s rrna the sequences were deposited in the ena database under accession number prjeb33791 dna sequences were processed with the dada2 pipeline to identify asvs amplicon sequence variants callahan et al 2016 asvs are alleged to be independent of reference databases reproducible in future data sets and reusable across studies callahan et al 2017 the sequences were submitted to the silva database for taxonomic identification quast et al 2013 the entire asv table was normalized using the cumulative sum scaling css method which helps to avoid biases generated with current sequencing technologies due to uneven sequencing depth paulson et al 2013 a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix was calculated and used to build principal coordinate analyses and constrained principal coordinate analysis both retrieved from phyloseq and vegan packages mcmurdie and holmes 2013 oksanen et al 2019 to compare the differences in taxonomic composition and to assess whether some bacterial taxa were differentially abundant we conducted a statistical analysis in which we assessed separately the read counts at asv level using the metagenome seq package paulson et al 2013 with the coefficients from the model we applied moderated t tests between accessions and the differences in the abundance of taxa between accessions were considered significant when adjusted p values were lower than 0 05 2 4 co occurrence and identity networks network analyses were performed to assess the dynamics of the interactions in the microbiomes non random co occurrence analyses were performed using sparcc a tool capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data friedman and alm 2012 using python we calculated sparcc correlations between microbial taxa at asv level based on the 16s rrna extracted from the reads correlations with a magnitude 0 8 or 0 8 and statistical significance p 0 01 were included in the network analyses for the identity network a multiple alignment sequences of approximately 400 bp was performed using muscle v3 7 edgar 2004 and

microbiome can be steered to produce n caproate as the dominant product fermentation of complex substrates e g food waste may result in a mixture of products fatty acids alcohols diols methane when using microbiomes in this study the main products were fatty acids with increasing overall length over time the operation of the 1l rbf was divided in three cycles hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation were expected to occur in each cycle no methane was observed during 1l rbf operation fig s2 during the first cycle we could not detect any lactate formation from food waste instead the lactate present in food waste was consumed within two days for scfa production mainly acetate c2 and n butyrate n c4 accumulated 2 g l by day 15 and ph decreased from 6 0 to 4 7 fig 1 other fatty acids such as propionate c3 n valerate n c5 and n caproate n c6 were detected at concentrations below 500 mg l after a second addition of food waste in cycle 2 lactate was again consumed within three days and a further increase of n butyrate and n caproate was observed n butyrate and n caproate concentrations increased 1 7 and 3 times respectively whereas acetate and propionate concentrations were stable fig 1 as well as ph which remained between 4 9 and 5 0 in contrast to the first two cycles lactate production was observed when increasing food waste concentration to 15 v v in cycle 3 lactate was detected at a maximum concentration of 4 5 g l and was subsequently consumed within 5 days fig 1 n caproate was the main product during lactate consumption with n caproate concentrations displaying a 5 fold increase from 1 2 0 03 days 29 and 32 to 5 4 0 01 g l days 39 and 41 which equals to 11 9 g codn c6 l the concentrations of scfa increased to a lesser extent 1 3 times for acetate and 1 6 times for n butyrate in cycle 3 n heptanoate n c7 and n caprylate n c8 were detected at a maximum concentration of 89 and 142 mg l respectively during the period of lactate production ph went down from 5 1 to 4 7 and increased back to 5 3 when lactate was consumed overall changes in ph and metabolites profile indicate that two separate phases occurred an acidification phase towards lactate as the main product followed by a chain elongation phase where n caproate production was favoured the most fig s3 the synthesis of n caproate in cycle 3 seemed to be linked to lactate as electron donor hydrolysis was estimated to be 20 265 and 96 7 g cods kg tsadded for cycles 1 2 and 3 respectively these values are comparable to those obtained by bolaji and dionisi 2017 who observed a maximum substrate degradation of 283 g cods kg tsadded when vegetables waste was fermented to a mixture of scfa and mcfa the highest n caproate production rate of 1 89 g l d 4 2 g codn c6 l d days 34 36 was measured in cycle 3 while the overall n caproate production rate in this cycle including hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation days 32 39 was 0 61 g l d 1 35 g codn c6 l d table s2 process efficiency was evaluated in terms of cod and carbon conversion in 1l rbf between 25 and 34 of the codt added as food waste was identified in the measured metabolites fig s4 which equals to 50 80 of cods conversion efficiency of cods into n caproate codn c6 cods was 29 7 0 5 days 39 41 in cycle 3 equivalent to a 5 fold increase during the experiment fig s5 the same increasing trend was observed for n valerate 6 8 fold increase although it remained at low proportions the highest codt conversion efficiency towards n caproate codn c6 codt was 12 4 in cycle 3 carbon specificity product fatty acids ratio for n caproate reached a maximum of 38 2 0 1 in cycle 3 table s2 in a comparable continuous one stage reactor xu et al 2018 obtained a n caproate carbon specificity of 23 using solely yogurt waste as substrate these authors also observed equivalent carbon specificities for propionate which has been reported as a product of the competitive acrylate pathway in lactate based chain elongation with in line extraction kucek et al 2016a here nevertheless propionate was always a minor metabolite and propionate carbon specificities remained at 4 5 probably due to the low ph levels which can limit the growth of propionate producing bacteria hettinga and reinbold 1972 fermentation proceeded without ph control but food waste ph was adjusted before being added to the reactor hydroxide used for ph adjustment equals to 0 77 4 35 mol oh mol mcfa and hydroxide input showed a decreasing trend after every cycle table s2 these values are 0 8 to 2 3 times the amount of hydroxide used by roghair et al 2018 in a chain elongation reactor fed with the same original food waste previously acidified at ph 5 5 and ethanol 3 2 subsequent acidification and chain elongation regulate ph dynamics while repeated food waste addition enhances n caproate selectivity results of 1l rbf suggest that lactate was an important electron donor for fatty acids chain elongation therefore food waste fermentation to lactate and fatty acids was systematically studied in the duplicate 0 3l rbf experiments in these experiments lactate was produced within 1 2 days causing the ph to drop and was subsequently consumed for fa formation fig 2 a the corresponding increase in ph was observed during lactate consumption this same behaviour in lactate and ph profiles was observed after each addition of food waste in cycle 2 and 3 n butyrate n valerate and n caproate were the main fatty acids formed during lactate consumption all being products of the rbo pathway thus reproducible acidification and chain elongation phases could be distinguished in batch and repeated batch food waste fermentation initial environments rich in nutrients and easily fermentable substrate would promote lactate formation as a readily produced atp yielding electron sink after lactate production the medium is acidified and only a few specialists e g m elsdenii can take up lactate at low ph levels to produce fa counotte and prins 1981 hydrolysis was estimated to be 212 5 30 g cods kg tsadded in cycle 1 but high deviations were observed in the following cycles and it is therefore not clear whether hydrolysis occurred in cycles 2 and 3 data not shown during the 0 3l rbf experiments n caproate concentrations increased after every cycle and n caproate was the second main metabolite produced after n butyrate methane was not detected in any of the cycles in 0 3l rbf fig s6 the highest n caproate concentrations and production rates in 0 3l rbf were observed in cycle 3 fig 2a table s2 being 3 4 0 20 g l and 0 3 0 11 g l d respectively similarly to the 0 3l rbf experiments lactate was also produced in single batch fermentation and was further converted to scfa with the respective changes in ph fig 2b metabolites profile and final ph at the moment of lactate depletion day 8 were similar in 0 3l rbf and single batch experiments after lactate depletion however the single batch experiment showed a fairly stable ph 4 9 and product spectrum n caproate concentration remained 1 g l after more than 40 days of reaction time with acetate and n butyrate produced at similar concentrations thus chain elongation is promoted by both the addition of substrate and the availability of electron acceptors addition of substrate results in more lactate which in the presence of electron acceptors i e c2 n c4 can be more efficiently used for mcfa production experiments with pure cultures have shown that the lactate needed to produce one molecule of n caproate was reduced in 11 when acetate was supplemented or in 37 when n butyrate was added to the medium zhu et al 2017 in our experiments electron acceptors were always available and they might have substantially contributed to n caproate formation whether one time addition of 30 v v food waste the total amount added after 3 cycles would allow the occurrence or enhancement of acidification and chain elongation was not assessed in cycle 3 of the 0 3l rbf acidification and chain elongation occurred simultaneously and lactate scfa and n caproate were produced during the acidification phase fig s3 also part of the products formed during chain elongation in cycle 3 could not be accounted for since probably they sorbed onto the organic phase i e solids or oily phase of food waste thermophilic conditions did not improve lactate production after two additions of food waste compared to 0 3l rbf experiments fig s7 the lactate produced accumulated over time 8 5 g l and was not metabolized to fatty acids at 50 c however lactate conversion to n butyrate and traces of n caproate was observed after 24 days when temperature was switched to 35 c suggesting a similar behaviour as in 0 3l rbf experiments regarding process efficiency similar tendencies to previous experiments were observed measured metabolites in 0 3l rbf comprised 36 42 of codt fig s4 cods conversion efficiency and carbon specificity showed an increasing trend for n caproate with values between 8 18 and 9 22 respectively fig s8 the branched chain scfa isobutyrate i c4 and isovalerate b c5 were detected at maximum concentrations of 350 and 500 mg l respectively together with other minor metabolites i e succinate formate butanol propanol hexanol methanol n heptanoate and pentanol fig s9 among them succinate up to 500 mg l and formate up to 1 1 g l were the most dominant and were metabolized during fermentation however all minor metabolites together never reached concentrations higher than 2 5 g cod l in the case of 0 3l rbf the hydroxide input ranged from 0 47 to 1 47 mol oh mol mcfa table s2 the decreasing trend in hydroxide input together with the increasing trend in ph after every cycle suggest that besides hydroxide being used more efficiently after every cycle due to higher mcfa selectivity buffer capacity also accumulated and contributed to neutralize acids 3 3 lactobacillus and caproiciproducens species dominated the microbiome composition despite the complex composition of the food waste only a few microorganisms were enriched during fermentation experiments in both 1l rbf and 0 3l rbf two genera were persistently dominant in all the samples caproiciproducens and lactobacillus which together showed a relative abundance of 57 93 fig 3 caproiciproducens spp were the most dominant 32 72 relative abundance followed by lactobacillus spp 12 56 relative abundance clostridium spp were also persistent during the experiments although at lower relative abundances 15 in total 22 asvs belonging to caproiciproducens 12 asvs belonging to lactobacillus and 13 asvs belonging to clostridium were identified fig s10 lactobacillus sp asv1 was the most abundant lactobacillus 95 fig 4 and was closely related to l johnsonii 100 identity l gasseri 99 5 identity and l taiwanensis 99 5 identity these lactobacillus species are obligately homolactic lab vandamme et al 1996 and their high abundance support that lactate formation occurred through homolactic fermentation it is worth mentioning that even though obligately heterolactic lab were the most abundant 95 of lactobacillus spp in the food waste asv18 100 identity to l sanfransiscensis homolactic bacteria present in the inoculum were enriched in the experiments this could be a result of the specific conditions of the experiments or due to inactivation of indigenous lab during food waste storage since lab are abundant in food waste wu et al 2018 heterolactic and homolactic metabolisms might compete when fresh food waste is used as substrate 3 4 enriched caproiciproducens spp co occurred with lactobacillus spp the microbiomes developed in this study tended to be more alike as fermentation proceeded similarities between 1l rbf and 0 3l rbf microbiomes shown by a reduced beta diversity increased at the end compared to the beginning of the experiments fig s11a preliminary analysis of the 0 3l rbf experiments showed major changes in the microbiomes during fermentation the microbiomes clustered into two groups fig s11b referred to as scfa producing microbiomes end of cycle 1 beginning of cycle 2 group 1 and mcfa producing microbiomes from end of cycle 2 onwards group 2 differential abundance analysis revealed that many caproiciproducens spp including caproiciproducens spp asv4 and asv7 were enriched in mcfa producing microbiomes whereas clostridium spp and ethanoligenens spp were enriched in scfa producing microbiomes fig s12 this suggests that chain elongating microorganisms require longer time or specific conditions e g higher ph or electron acceptors concentration to grow furthermore co occurrence network analysis fig s13 showed a positive interaction between asv1 belonging to lactobacillus spp and asvs 2 3 4 and 5 which were the most abundant asvs belonging to caproiciproducens spp fig 4 lactobacillus sp asv1 was a key lab in the microbiome closely related to microorganisms capable of using starch oligosaccharides disaccharides and monosaccharides as substrate for lactate production gänzle and follador 2012 the produced lactate would then be utilized by lactate elongators to produce mcfa however microorganisms commonly reported to use lactate for mcfa formation such as ruminococcaceae bacterium cpb6 or species belonging to the megasphaera genus were not found in this study instead species of the genus caproiciproducens are likely responsible of mcfa production in our experiments asvs belonging to the caproiciproducens genus showed 91 95 similarity to caproiciproducens galactitolivorans caproiciproducens is a recently defined genus with caproiciproducens galactitolivorans strain bs 1 as the only species described so far caproiciproducens galactitolivorans is reported to utilize hexoses pentoses disaccharides and glycerol to produce acetate n butyrate n caproate and hydrogen kim et al 2015 therefore sugars were most likely used for mcfa production however the remarkable dominance of caproiciproducens in our experiments suggests that organisms belonging to this genus used lactate to produce n caproate at the moment of this research there was no report on the capability of caproiciproducens spp to use lactate for mcfa production the low similarity between caproiciproducens galactitolivorans and the caproiciproducens related asvs found here suggests that new species of caproiciproducens were enriched in our experiments the capability of caproiciproducens organisms to metabolize both lactate and sugars could be foreseen similarly to lactate elongators being capable of metabolizing sugars wang et al 2018 weimer and moen 2013 hence it is reasonable to hypothesize that caproiciproducens spp found in this study used lactate and sugars for chain elongation fig s14 4 discussion 4 1 n caproate production performance in this study n caproate production was linked to lactate as electron donor which is revealed by the increase in n caproate concentrations and the increase in ph during lactate consumption lactate was produced through the homolactic pathway which is an efficient way to improve the production of mcfa scarborough et al 2018 during acidification lactate was the main product formed 79 of acidification products in cod fig s3 and negligible co2 release was accordingly observed fig s2 and fig s6 since various electron donors and acceptors could have been produced consumed to different extents it is difficult to quantify the effectivity of lactate conversion through the rbo pathway relatively small amounts of ethanol were detected that may also contribute as electron donor together with sugars amino acids d galactitol propanol and electron acceptors such as succinate that could be present in the system angenent et al 2016 hydrogen was present in the reactors and glycerol could be present in the food waste both of which can act as indirect electron donors in chain elongation leng et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 besides degradation of lipids and proteins present in the food waste could also result in mcfa formation apart from lactate other compounds electron donors acceptors contributed to n butyrate and n caproate formation fig s3 coupling acidification and chain elongation helped to reduce hydroxide input for ph control however buffer capacity fig s15 also played an important role in determining the degree of acidification of the medium actual ph measured in 0 3l rbf was higher than the expected levels based on the total acids concentration making evident that the alkalinity of the system was important to keep the ph levels high enough to prevent microbial inhibition fig s16 the initial buffer capacity helped to avoid extreme acidic conditions together with fatty acids and probably other buffer agents nh4 hs that were formed during fermentation it is also evident from fig s16 that the stoichiometry of lactate production and consumption partially describes the downward upward ph trends caused by protons production consumption and that the fluctuations in ph were attenuated by the buffer capacity of the system although hydroxide was added to the reactors with the neutralized food waste the main changes in ph seemed to be due to acids production or destruction rather than substrate addition however buffer capacity accumulated in the reactor due to substrate addition and fa formation which explains the increasing trend in ph by the end of the experiments even though the eventual accumulation of buffer capacity might be detrimental for the long term operation this effect could be reduced by tuning operational parameters such as substrate concentration and volume replacement in sequencing batch or fed batch reactors a trade off between buffer capacity accumulation conversion efficiencies and rates could then be achieved even though optimization was out of the scope of this study our results are comparable to other chain elongation processes using carbon rich wastes table 1 overall the n caproate production rates observed in our study 0 3 4 2 g cod l d are in agreement with other works that used solely organic waste streams the highest n caproate production rate in this study is 2 7 to 6 4 times higher than other studies working with solid organic wastes grootscholten et al 2013 reddy et al 2018 and similar to the maximum obtained by xu et al 2018 comparable n caproate carbon specificities to this work 23 38 have been reported from fresh food waste fermentation in batch leach bed reactors 38 nzeteu et al 2018 promising results have been obtained from liquid waste streams as well such as 45 n caproate conversion efficiencies xu et al 2018 from yogurt processing wastewater and 79 n caproate carbon specificities from acid whey duber et al 2018 in a one stage reactor equipped with in line extraction xu et al 2018 observed a lower n caproate carbon specificity compared to our work 23 vs 38 to improve the carbon specificity the authors implemented a thermophilic acidification stage to produce lactate prior to the lactate based chain elongation stage the implementation of this two stage system resulted in a doubled carbon specificity 48 towards n caproate and reached 66 for mcfa unfortunately data on the amount of chemicals used to control ph in the two separate reactors are not available a previous work from our group focused on the efficient use of ethanol and hydroxide in a continuous chain elongation reactor fed with acidified food waste and ethanol the efficient use of ethanol resulted in a higher mcfa conversion efficiency mcfa carbon specificity and a reduced hydroxide input for ph control 0 92 mol oh mol mcfa in the chain elongation stage and 5 5 mol oh kg cod fa for the overall process roghair et al 2018 under these conditions around 24 of the n caproate produced was derived from the acidified food waste cod from acetate and n butyrate consumed in the present study n caproate came entirely from food waste and hydroxide addition was lowered by a 2 times 0 47 mol oh mol mcfa and 7 times 0 79 mol oh kg cod fa factor table 1 these benefits were attained by changing from a two stage ethanol based chain elongation to a one stage lactate based chain elongation process however n caproate concentrations and productivities were much lower in the present study improved n caproate productivities from food waste could be achieved by using a fed batch reactor with higher substrate concentration and shorter cycles in this case residual amounts of electron acceptors should be maintained to promote higher mcfa selectivities substrate conversion was limited by hydrolysis which can be improved by using leach bed reactors nzeteu et al 2018 or in situ extraction grootscholten et al 2013 4 2 outlook and process boundaries 4 2 1 relevance of ph for balanced acidification and chain elongation when no ph control is intended the balance between substrate supplementation alkalinity reactor operation and the microbiome resilience will determine the conditions to avoid bioprocess instability due to outranged ph although lab show hydrolytic activity at ph as low as 4 0 glycolysis is not functional under these conditions and lactate production would be inhibited kashket 1987 ohkouchi and inoue 2006 hence ph 4 0 is essential to allow lactate formation however such acidic conditions could be inhibitory for lactate utilizers growth of m elsdenii has been shown to be substantially affected at ph 4 65 weimer and moen 2013 and a recent work showed that lactate elongation to n butyrate occurred only at ph 4 5 sträuber et al 2018 in the present study lactate utilization for n butyrate production occurred at a lower ph 4 0 4 3 0 3l rbf day 1 thermophilic experiment day 41 moreover the highest n caproate production rate in our study was detected at an initial ph of 4 7 1l rbf day 34 even though ph 5 0 was reported to completely inhibit n caproate production in a similar process nzeteu et al 2018 it is worth mentioning that the undissociated n caproic acid concentration 0 65 g l at this day was below the toxic limit 0 87 g l proposed to inhibit n caproate production in ethanol based chain elongation ge et al 2015 nevertheless undissociated n caproic acid concentration on day 36 when n caproate formation was still observed reached 1 72 g l these observations show that the microbiome developed in our experiments could function at more acidic environments than previous reports and in the presence of higher concentrations of the toxic undissociated n caproic acid the low ph and the presence of undissociated n butyric 35 mm and n caproic 20 mm acids could have prevented the acrylate pathway from being dominant despite the temporary high lactate concentrations propionate could still be formed at low ph levels when in line extraction is applied and lactate accumulation is observed kucek et al 2016a although it seems that lactate elongators can stand higher undissociated n caproic acid concentrations than ethanol elongators or propionate producers more research is needed to systematically determine the toxic limit of undissociated n caproic acid for the three microbial groups 4 2 2 maximum hydroxide use for n caproate production from carbohydrates reduced chemical use for ph control can help to increase the life cycle performance of the technology chen et al 2017 at present however few studies report on either base or acid needed in their processes in our study homolactic fermentation eq 1 and lactate based chain elongation eq 2 eq 3 were the main identified processes considering glucose conversion to lactate through homolactic fermentation and lactate based chain elongation to n caproate a maximum of 2 3 of the protons released can be self neutralized by coupling these two processes to keep a constant ph base addition or intrinsic alkalinity from the substrate would still be needed this equals to a maximum hydroxide need of 1 mol oh mol n c6 or 3 9 mol oh kg cod c6 in this study n caproate was almost the only mcfa produced and the values for hydroxide addition were always below the theoretical maximum except for 1l rbf cycles 1 and 2 were lactate was not produced table s2 even though scfa were always produced together with n caproate hydroxide input was improved as ph started to increase over cycles due to increased n caproate selectivity and accumulation of buffer capacity clearly the production of scfa increases the base need and the opposite is true for longer mcfa production e g n caprylate 5 conclusions repeated batch food waste fermentation without exogenous electron donor was steered to n caproate as the dominant product lactate production and subsequent chain elongation from food waste regulated ph dynamics and buffer capacity of the substrate helped to avoid inhibitory acidic conditions and large ph fluctuations these phenomena together lead to reduced hydroxide input for n caproate production lactate was attributed as key electron donor for chain elongation and its uptake for n caproate formation was observed at conditions suggested as inhibitory in the literature lactobacillus spp and caproiciproducens spp dominated and co occurred in the microbiome which shows the involvement of caproiciproducens spp in the use of lactate as electron donor

18339,the production of biochemicals from renewables through biorefinery processes is important to reduce the anthropogenic impact on the environment chain elongation processes based on microbiomes have been successfully developed to produce medium chain fatty acids mcfa from organic waste streams yet the sustainability of chain elongation can still be improved by reducing the use of electron donors and additional chemicals this work aimed to couple lactate production and subsequent chain elongation to decrease chemicals input such as electron donors and hydroxide for ph control in repeated batch food waste fermentation food waste with adjusted ph was used as substrate and fermentation proceeded without ph control during fermentation lactate was first formed through the homolactic pathway and then converted to fatty acids fa mainly n butyrate and n caproate the highest n caproate carbon selectivities mmol c mmol cfa and production rates were 38 and 4 2 g cod l d respectively hydroxide input was reduced over time to a minimum of 0 47 mol oh mol mcfa or 0 79 mol oh kg codfa lactate was a key electron donor for chain elongation and its conversion was observed at ph as low as 4 3 the microbiome enriched in this work was dominated by lactobacillus spp and caproiciproducens spp the high abundance of caproiciproducens spp and their co occurrence with lactobacillus spp suggest caproiciproducens spp used lactate as electron donor for chain elongation this work shows the production of n caproate from food waste with decreased use of hydroxide and no use of exogenous electron donors graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial chain elongation medium chain fatty acids n caproate anaerobic digestion caproiciproducens spp 1 introduction sustainable production of biochemicals is a key factor to reduce anthropogenic contributions to climate change and to develop a biobased economy cherubini 2010 the biobased economy is grounded in biorefinery processes that allow effective conversion of renewable materials into a broad spectrum of chemicals materials and fuels numerous microbial chain elongation processes exist that are able to elongate single or short chain molecules into longer chain molecules one recently developed microbial chain elongation process makes use of anaerobic microbiomes to convert organic wastes into medium chain fatty acids mcfa i e fatty acids with 6 12 carbons such as n caproate steinbusch et al 2011 mcfa are preferred products over short chain fatty acids scfa i e fatty acids with 6 carbons due to their higher energy content and their increased hydrophobicity makes mcfa easier to separate from the fermentation broth mcfa are versatile compounds with different applications e g feed additives bioplastics lubricants aviation fuels although chain elongation is a promising technology the sustainability of the process can be improved considerably by reducing the use of electron donors and additional chemicals for ph control chen et al 2017 thus electron donors with a more sustainable nature are needed to improve the environmental performance of the chain elongation technology chain elongating bacteria can use a variety of electron donors as energy and carbon sources in ethanol based chain elongation ethanol is metabolized by clostridium kluyveri into acetyl coa and nadh electrons in nadh are used to drive the reverse β oxidation rbo pathway elongating available acetate c2 to n butyrate n c4 by the condensation of two acetyl coa angenent et al 2016 when enough ethanol is available n butyrate is condensed with another acetyl coa in a second round and elongated to n caproate n c6 angenent et al 2016 in lactate based chain elongation pyruvate and nadh are products of lactate oxidation pyruvate is further oxidized to acetyl coa and co2 with electrons released in form of reduced ferredoxin spirito et al 2014 the derived acetyl coa are used for n butyrate and n caproate formation through rbo zhu et al 2017 in this paper we denote n caproate as undissociated n caproic acid and dissociated n caproate together and we refer to each specific form when appropriate bacteria possessing the rbo pathway have been enriched in mcfa producing microbiomes fed with ethanol lactate and sugars with ethanol as intermediary ding et al 2010 kucek et al 2016a steinbusch et al 2011 recently a few processes have been developed to produce n caproate from organic waste streams which either contain electron donors for chain elongation kucek et al 2016b or were acidified to produce electron donors such as lactate nzeteu et al 2018 xu et al 2018 lactate is produced by lactic acid bacteria lab mainly from carbohydrates gänzle and follador 2012 during lactate production the release of protons eq 1 causes acidification of the medium and eventually stops microbial activity due to metabolism disruption or toxicity of undissociated acids kashket 1987 in contrast a net proton consumption occurs in lactate based chain elongation due to a decrease in the total acids molar concentration eqs 2 and 3 therefore the proton consuming behaviour of lactate based chain elongation could be used to compensate for the protons released during lactate production in the acidification phase besides propionate production from lactate an important competing pathway in lactate based chain elongation kucek et al 2016a could be restricted when coupling these two processes since lab and lactate elongators are able to grow at ph 5 0 kashket 1987 weimer and moen 2013 which can limit the occurrence of propionate producing bacteria hettinga and reinbold 1972 janssen 1991 1 c 6 h 12 o 6 2 c 3 h 5 o 3 2 h 2 2 c 3 h 5 o 3 h c 4 h 7 o 2 2 h 2 2 c o 2 3 3 c 3 h 5 o 3 2 h c 6 h 11 o 2 2

operation which would result in 1 no need of exogenous electron donor addition and 2 reduction of chemicals addition for ph control with repeated batch operation a concentrated food waste was consecutively added over 3 cycles which enabled to increase the n caproate concentration over time food waste fermentation was performed without ph control changes in the microbiome composition were evaluated using 16s rrna gene based metagenomic data 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up and procedure food waste was used as the only substrate in this study and consisted of outdated food remainders food waste was obtained from a recycling company rotie the netherlands and preserved at 20 c for long term storage this was the same original food waste used in an earlier study in which microbially acidified waste was used to develop an effective ethanol based chain elongation process roghair et al 2018 prior to use the waste was thawed in a 4 c room and kept at this temperature during the experimental work the waste had a total solids content ts of 200 2 2 2 g ts l volatile solids content vs of 179 4 1 1 g vs l and total acidity of 15036 152 mg caco3 l table s1

valerate 0 20 0 02 g l fermentation was carried out in a stirred tank reactor 1l rbf with working volume of 1 l which was inoculated with a microbiome obtained from previous food waste fermentation this was the same reactor used in earlier chain elongation studies roghair et al 2016 for the start up the 1l rbf reactor was fed with a mixture of mineral medium vitamins and food waste to reach a food waste concentration of 10 v v the ph of the mixture was adjusted to an initial value of 6 0 mineral medium and vitamins were added only at the beginning of the experiment with concentrations as reported by roghair et al 2016 except that nh4 h2po4 was reduced to 1 8 g l during 1l rbf operation concentrated food waste was adjusted to ph 6 0 with 4 m koh before addition to the reactor to have comparable ph in the waste fed and fermentation was allowed to proceed without ph control food waste was added on days 0 and 15 at concentrations of 10 v v and on day 32 at 15 v v nitrogen gas was bubbled for 15 min after each substrate addition to ensure anaerobic conditions the reactor was connected to a gas flow meter μflow bioprocess control to quantify gas production and temperature was 35 c duplicate experiments were performed using 500 ml schott bottles with working volume of 300 ml to systematically assess repeated batch fermentation 0 3l rbf procedure in 0 3l rbf experiments was the same as in 1l rbf except that food waste was added at constant concentration of 10 v v once lactate was depleted every 7 8 days in the same way mineral medium and vitamins were added only at the beginning of the experiment together with yeast extract 1 g l for the 0 3l rbf experiment inoculum was taken from the 1 l reactor on day 19 and added at 3 v v the same procedure as in 0 3l rbf was followed in duplicate single batch experiments except that food waste was added only once single batch experiments were performed to evaluate the products distribution of long term hydrolysis and acidification of food waste the 0 3l rbf and single batch experiments were placed in a shaker at 120 rpm and 35 c to evaluate the effect of higher temperature on hydrolysis lactate formation duplicate experiments were operated likewise to 0 3l rbf but at a temperature of 50 c until day 17 the same mesophilic inoculum was mixed with thermophilic anaerobic sludge from a recycling company heerenveen the netherlands and added 3 v v as inoculum for the thermophilic experiments on day 17 temperature was switched to 35 c for subsequent chain elongation a modified cap was used for the schott bottles to allow liquid sampling and gas was collected via connected gas bags liquid and gas samples were taken regularly to measure metabolites ph and gas composition the following parameters were used to

samples for microbiome composition analysis were taken fig s1 from the fermentation broth centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and stored at 20 c for dna extraction and sequencing dna was extracted from the pellets applying a powersoil dna isolation kit according to the manufacturer s instructions the isolated dna was used as template for amplifying the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna via illumina sequencing using the primer sets described by takahashi et al 2014 this allowed simultaneous amplification of bacterial and archaean 16s rrna the sequences were deposited in the ena database under accession number prjeb33791 dna sequences were processed with the dada2 pipeline to identify asvs amplicon sequence variants callahan et al 2016 asvs are alleged to be independent of reference databases reproducible in future data sets and reusable across studies callahan et al 2017 the sequences were submitted to the silva database for taxonomic identification quast et al 2013 the entire asv table was normalized using the cumulative sum scaling css method which helps to avoid biases generated with current sequencing technologies due to uneven sequencing depth paulson et al 2013 a bray curtis dissimilarity matrix was calculated and used to build principal coordinate analyses and constrained principal coordinate analysis both retrieved from phyloseq and vegan packages mcmurdie and holmes 2013 oksanen et al 2019 to compare the differences in taxonomic composition and to assess whether some bacterial taxa were differentially abundant we conducted a statistical analysis in which we assessed separately the read counts at asv level using the metagenome seq package paulson et al 2013 with the coefficients from the model we applied moderated t tests between accessions and the differences in the abundance of taxa between accessions were considered significant when adjusted p values were lower than 0 05 2 4 co occurrence and identity networks network analyses were performed to assess the dynamics of the interactions in the microbiomes non random co occurrence analyses were performed using sparcc a tool capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data friedman and alm 2012 using python we calculated sparcc correlations between microbial taxa at asv level based on the 16s rrna extracted from the reads correlations with a magnitude 0 8 or 0 8 and

microbiome can be steered to produce n caproate as the dominant product fermentation of complex substrates e g food waste may result in a mixture of products fatty acids alcohols diols methane when using microbiomes in this study the main products were fatty acids with increasing overall length over time the operation of the 1l rbf was divided in three cycles hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation were expected to occur in each cycle no methane was observed during 1l rbf operation fig s2 during the first cycle we could not detect any lactate formation from food waste instead the lactate present in food waste was consumed within two days for scfa production mainly acetate c2 and n butyrate n c4 accumulated 2 g l by day 15 and ph decreased from 6 0 to 4 7 fig 1 other fatty acids such as propionate c3 n valerate n c5 and n caproate n c6 were detected at concentrations below 500 mg l after a second addition of food waste in cycle 2 lactate was again consumed within three days and a further increase of n butyrate and n caproate was observed n butyrate and n caproate concentrations increased 1 7 and 3 times respectively whereas acetate and propionate concentrations were stable fig 1 as well as ph which remained between 4 9 and 5 0 in contrast to the first two cycles lactate production was observed when increasing food waste concentration to 15 v v in cycle 3 lactate was detected at a maximum concentration of 4 5 g l and was subsequently consumed within 5 days fig 1 n caproate was the main product during lactate consumption with n caproate concentrations displaying a 5 fold increase from 1 2 0 03 days 29 and 32 to 5 4 0 01 g l days 39 and 41 which equals to 11 9 g codn c6 l the concentrations of scfa increased to a lesser extent 1 3 times for acetate and 1 6 times for n butyrate in cycle 3 n heptanoate n c7 and n caprylate n c8 were detected at a maximum concentration of 89 and 142 mg l respectively during the period of lactate production ph went down from 5 1 to 4 7 and increased back to 5 3 when lactate was consumed overall changes in ph and metabolites profile indicate that two separate phases occurred an acidification phase towards lactate as the main product followed by a chain elongation phase where n caproate production was favoured the most fig s3 the synthesis of n caproate in cycle 3 seemed to be linked to lactate as electron donor hydrolysis was estimated to be 20 265 and 96 7 g cods kg tsadded for cycles 1 2 and 3 respectively these values are comparable to those obtained by bolaji and dionisi 2017 who observed a maximum substrate degradation of 283 g cods kg tsadded when vegetables waste was fermented to a mixture of scfa and mcfa the highest n caproate production rate of 1 89 g l d 4 2 g codn c6 l d days 34 36 was measured in cycle 3 while the overall n caproate production rate in this cycle including hydrolysis acidification and chain elongation days 32 39 was 0 61 g l d 1 35 g codn c6 l d table s2 process efficiency was evaluated in terms of cod and carbon conversion in 1l rbf between 25 and 34 of the codt added as food waste was identified in the measured metabolites fig s4 which equals to 50 80 of cods conversion efficiency of cods into n caproate codn c6 cods was 29 7 0 5 days 39 41 in cycle 3 equivalent to a 5 fold increase during the experiment fig s5 the same increasing trend was observed for n valerate 6 8 fold increase although it remained at low proportions the highest codt conversion efficiency towards n caproate codn c6 codt was 12 4 in cycle 3 carbon specificity product fatty acids ratio for n caproate reached a maximum of 38 2 0 1 in cycle 3 table s2 in a comparable continuous one stage reactor xu et al 2018 obtained a n caproate carbon specificity of 23 using solely yogurt waste as substrate these authors also observed equivalent carbon specificities for propionate which has been reported as a product of the competitive acrylate pathway in lactate based chain elongation with in line extraction kucek et al 2016a here nevertheless propionate was always a minor metabolite and propionate carbon specificities remained at 4 5 probably due to the low ph levels which can limit the growth of propionate producing bacteria hettinga and reinbold 1972 fermentation proceeded without ph control but food waste ph was adjusted before being added to the reactor hydroxide used for ph adjustment equals to 0 77 4 35 mol oh mol mcfa and hydroxide input showed a decreasing trend after every cycle table s2 these values are 0 8 to 2 3 times the amount of hydroxide used by roghair et al 2018 in a chain elongation reactor fed with the same original food waste previously acidified at ph 5 5 and ethanol 3 2 subsequent acidification and chain elongation regulate ph dynamics while repeated food waste addition enhances n caproate selectivity results of 1l rbf suggest that lactate was an important electron donor for fatty acids chain elongation therefore food waste fermentation to lactate and fatty acids was systematically studied in the duplicate 0 3l rbf experiments in these experiments lactate was produced within 1 2 days causing the ph to drop and was subsequently consumed for fa formation fig 2 a the corresponding increase in ph was observed during lactate consumption this same behaviour in lactate and ph profiles was observed after each addition of food waste in cycle 2 and 3 n butyrate n valerate and n caproate were the main fatty acids formed during lactate consumption all being products of the rbo pathway thus reproducible acidification and chain elongation phases could be distinguished in batch and repeated batch food waste fermentation initial environments rich in nutrients and easily fermentable substrate would promote lactate formation as a readily produced atp yielding electron sink after lactate production the medium is acidified and only a few specialists e g m elsdenii can take up lactate at low ph levels to produce fa counotte and prins 1981 hydrolysis was estimated to be 212 5 30 g cods kg tsadded in cycle 1 but high deviations were observed in the following cycles and it is therefore not clear whether hydrolysis occurred in cycles 2 and 3 data not shown during the 0 3l rbf experiments n caproate concentrations increased after every cycle and n caproate was the second main metabolite produced after n butyrate methane was not detected in any of the cycles in 0 3l rbf fig s6 the highest n caproate concentrations and production rates in 0 3l rbf were observed in cycle 3 fig 2a table s2 being 3 4 0 20 g l and 0 3 0 11 g l d respectively similarly to the 0 3l rbf experiments lactate was also produced in single batch fermentation and was further converted to scfa with the respective changes in ph fig 2b metabolites profile and final ph at the moment of lactate depletion day 8 were similar in 0 3l rbf and single batch experiments after lactate depletion however the single batch experiment showed a fairly stable ph 4 9 and product spectrum n caproate concentration remained 1 g l after more than 40 days of reaction time with acetate and n butyrate produced at similar concentrations thus chain elongation is promoted by both the addition of substrate and the availability of electron acceptors addition of substrate results in more lactate which in the presence of electron acceptors i e c2 n c4 can be more efficiently used for mcfa production experiments with pure cultures have shown that the lactate needed to produce one molecule of n caproate was reduced in 11 when acetate was supplemented or in 37 when n butyrate was added to the medium zhu et al 2017 in our experiments electron acceptors were always available and they might have substantially contributed to n caproate formation whether one time addition of 30 v v food waste the total amount added after 3 cycles would allow the occurrence or enhancement of acidification and chain elongation was not assessed in cycle 3 of the 0 3l rbf acidification and chain elongation occurred simultaneously and lactate scfa and n caproate were produced during the acidification phase fig s3 also part of the products formed during chain elongation in cycle 3 could not be accounted for since probably they sorbed onto the organic phase i e solids or oily phase of food waste thermophilic conditions did not improve lactate production after two additions of food waste compared to 0 3l rbf experiments fig s7 the lactate produced accumulated over time 8 5 g l and was not metabolized to fatty acids at 50 c however lactate conversion to n butyrate and traces of n caproate was observed after 24 days when temperature was switched to 35 c suggesting a similar behaviour as in 0 3l rbf experiments regarding process efficiency similar tendencies to previous experiments were observed measured metabolites in 0 3l rbf comprised 36 42 of codt fig s4 cods conversion efficiency and carbon specificity showed an increasing trend for n caproate with values between 8 18 and 9 22 respectively fig s8 the branched chain scfa isobutyrate i c4 and isovalerate b c5 were detected at maximum concentrations of 350 and 500 mg l respectively together with other minor metabolites i e succinate formate butanol propanol hexanol methanol n heptanoate and pentanol fig s9 among them succinate up to 500 mg l and formate up to 1 1 g l were the most dominant and were metabolized during fermentation however all minor metabolites together never reached concentrations higher than 2 5 g cod l in the case of 0 3l rbf the hydroxide input ranged from 0 47 to 1 47 mol oh mol mcfa table s2 the decreasing trend in hydroxide input together with the increasing trend in ph after every cycle suggest that besides hydroxide being used more efficiently after every cycle due to higher mcfa selectivity buffer capacity also accumulated and contributed to neutralize acids 3 3 lactobacillus and caproiciproducens species dominated the microbiome composition despite the complex composition of the food waste only a few microorganisms were enriched during fermentation experiments in both 1l rbf and 0 3l rbf two genera were persistently dominant in all the samples caproiciproducens and lactobacillus which together showed a relative abundance of 57 93 fig 3 caproiciproducens spp were the most dominant 32 72 relative abundance followed by lactobacillus spp 12 56 relative abundance clostridium spp were also persistent during the experiments although at lower relative abundances 15 in total 22 asvs belonging to caproiciproducens 12 asvs belonging to lactobacillus and 13 asvs belonging to clostridium were identified fig s10 lactobacillus sp asv1 was the most abundant lactobacillus 95 fig 4 and was closely related to l johnsonii 100 identity l gasseri 99 5 identity and l taiwanensis 99 5 identity these lactobacillus species are obligately homolactic lab vandamme et al 1996 and their high abundance support that lactate formation occurred through homolactic fermentation it is worth mentioning that even though obligately heterolactic lab were the most abundant 95 of lactobacillus spp in the food waste asv18 100 identity to l sanfransiscensis homolactic bacteria present in the inoculum were enriched in the experiments this could be a result of the specific conditions of the experiments or due to inactivation of indigenous lab during food waste storage since lab are abundant in food waste wu et al 2018 heterolactic and homolactic metabolisms might compete when fresh food waste is used as substrate 3 4 enriched caproiciproducens spp co occurred with lactobacillus spp the microbiomes developed in this study tended to be more alike as fermentation proceeded similarities between 1l rbf and 0 3l rbf microbiomes shown by a reduced beta diversity increased at the end compared to the beginning of the experiments fig s11a preliminary analysis of the 0 3l rbf experiments showed major changes in the microbiomes during fermentation the microbiomes clustered into two groups fig s11b referred to as scfa producing microbiomes end of cycle 1 beginning of cycle 2 group 1 and mcfa producing microbiomes from end of cycle 2 onwards group 2 differential abundance analysis revealed that many caproiciproducens spp including caproiciproducens spp asv4 and asv7 were enriched in mcfa producing microbiomes whereas clostridium spp and ethanoligenens spp were enriched in scfa producing microbiomes fig s12 this suggests that chain elongating microorganisms require longer time or specific conditions e g higher ph or electron acceptors concentration to grow furthermore co occurrence network analysis fig s13 showed a positive interaction between asv1 belonging to lactobacillus spp and asvs 2 3 4 and 5 which were the most abundant asvs belonging to caproiciproducens spp fig 4 lactobacillus sp asv1 was a key lab in the microbiome closely related to microorganisms capable of using starch oligosaccharides disaccharides and monosaccharides as substrate for lactate production gänzle and follador 2012 the produced lactate would then be utilized by lactate elongators to produce mcfa however microorganisms commonly reported to use lactate for mcfa formation such as ruminococcaceae bacterium cpb6 or species belonging to the megasphaera genus were not found in this study instead species of the genus caproiciproducens are likely responsible of mcfa production in our experiments asvs belonging to the caproiciproducens genus showed 91 95 similarity to caproiciproducens galactitolivorans caproiciproducens is a recently defined genus with caproiciproducens galactitolivorans strain bs 1 as the only species described so far caproiciproducens galactitolivorans is reported to utilize hexoses pentoses disaccharides and glycerol to produce acetate n butyrate n caproate and hydrogen kim et al 2015 therefore sugars were most likely used for mcfa production however the remarkable dominance of caproiciproducens in our experiments suggests that organisms belonging to this genus used lactate to produce n caproate at the moment of this research there was no report on the capability of caproiciproducens spp to use lactate for mcfa production the low similarity between caproiciproducens galactitolivorans and the caproiciproducens related asvs found here suggests that new species of caproiciproducens were enriched in our experiments the capability of caproiciproducens organisms to metabolize both lactate and sugars could be foreseen similarly to lactate elongators being capable of metabolizing sugars wang et al 2018 weimer and moen 2013 hence it is reasonable to hypothesize that caproiciproducens spp found in this study used lactate and sugars for chain elongation fig s14 4 discussion 4 1 n caproate production performance in this study n caproate production was linked to lactate as electron donor which is revealed by the increase in n caproate concentrations and the increase in ph during lactate consumption lactate was produced through the homolactic pathway which is an efficient way to improve the production of mcfa scarborough et al 2018 during acidification lactate was the main product formed 79 of acidification products in cod fig s3 and negligible co2 release was accordingly observed fig s2 and fig s6 since various electron donors and acceptors could have been produced consumed to different extents it is difficult to quantify the effectivity of lactate conversion through the rbo pathway relatively small amounts of ethanol were detected that may also contribute as electron donor together with sugars amino acids d galactitol propanol and electron acceptors such as succinate that could be present in the system angenent et al 2016 hydrogen was present in the reactors and glycerol could be present in the food waste both of which can act as indirect electron donors in chain elongation leng et al 2017 zhang et al 2013 besides degradation of lipids and proteins present in the food waste could also result in mcfa formation apart from lactate other compounds electron donors acceptors contributed to n butyrate and n caproate formation fig s3 coupling acidification and chain elongation helped to reduce hydroxide input for ph control however buffer capacity fig s15 also played an important role in determining the degree of acidification of the medium actual ph measured in 0 3l rbf was higher than the expected levels based on the total acids concentration making evident that the alkalinity of the system was important to keep the ph levels high enough to prevent microbial inhibition fig s16 the initial buffer capacity helped to avoid extreme acidic conditions together with fatty acids and probably other buffer agents nh4 hs that were formed during fermentation it is also evident from fig s16 that the stoichiometry of lactate production and consumption partially describes the downward upward ph trends caused by protons production consumption and that the fluctuations in ph were attenuated by the buffer capacity of the system although hydroxide was added to the reactors with the neutralized food waste the main changes in ph seemed to be due to acids production or destruction rather than substrate addition however buffer capacity accumulated in the reactor due to substrate addition and fa formation which explains the increasing trend in ph by the end of the experiments even though the eventual accumulation of buffer capacity might be detrimental for the long term operation this effect could be reduced by tuning operational parameters such as substrate concentration and volume replacement in sequencing batch or fed batch reactors a trade off between buffer capacity accumulation conversion efficiencies and rates could then be achieved even though optimization was out of the scope of this study our results are comparable to other chain elongation processes using carbon rich wastes table 1 overall the n caproate production rates observed in our study 0 3 4 2 g cod l d are in agreement with other works that used solely organic waste streams the highest n caproate production rate in this study is 2 7 to 6 4 times higher than other studies working with solid organic wastes grootscholten et al 2013 reddy et al 2018 and similar to the maximum obtained by xu et al 2018 comparable n caproate carbon specificities to this work 23 38 have been reported from fresh food waste fermentation in batch leach bed reactors 38 nzeteu et al 2018 promising results have been obtained from liquid waste streams as well such as 45 n caproate conversion efficiencies xu et al 2018 from yogurt processing wastewater and 79 n caproate carbon specificities from acid whey duber et al 2018 in a one stage reactor equipped with in line extraction xu et al 2018 observed a lower n caproate carbon specificity compared to our work 23 vs 38 to improve the carbon specificity the authors implemented a thermophilic acidification stage to produce lactate prior to the lactate based chain elongation stage the implementation of this two stage system resulted in a doubled carbon specificity 48 towards n caproate and reached 66 for mcfa unfortunately data on the amount of chemicals used to control ph in the two separate reactors are not available a previous work from our group focused on the efficient use of ethanol and hydroxide in a continuous chain elongation reactor fed with acidified food waste and ethanol the efficient use of ethanol resulted in a higher mcfa conversion efficiency mcfa carbon specificity and a reduced hydroxide input for ph control 0 92 mol oh mol mcfa in the chain elongation stage and 5 5 mol oh kg cod fa for the overall process roghair et al 2018 under these conditions around 24 of the n caproate produced was derived from the acidified food waste cod from acetate and n butyrate consumed in the present study n caproate came entirely from food waste and hydroxide addition was lowered by a 2 times 0 47 mol oh mol mcfa and 7 times 0 79 mol oh kg cod fa factor table 1 these benefits were attained by changing from a two stage ethanol based chain elongation to a one stage lactate based chain elongation process however n caproate concentrations and productivities were much lower in the present study improved n caproate productivities from food waste could be achieved by using a fed batch reactor with higher substrate concentration and shorter cycles in this case residual amounts of electron acceptors should be maintained to promote higher mcfa selectivities substrate conversion was limited by hydrolysis which can be improved by using leach bed reactors nzeteu et al 2018 or in situ extraction grootscholten et al 2013 4 2 outlook and process boundaries 4 2 1 relevance of ph for balanced acidification and chain elongation when no ph control is intended the balance between substrate supplementation alkalinity reactor operation and the microbiome resilience will determine the conditions to avoid bioprocess instability due to outranged ph although lab show hydrolytic activity at ph as low as 4 0 glycolysis is not functional under these conditions and lactate production would be inhibited kashket 1987 ohkouchi and inoue 2006 hence ph 4 0 is essential to allow lactate formation however such acidic conditions could be inhibitory for lactate utilizers growth of m elsdenii has been shown to be substantially affected at ph 4 65 weimer and moen 2013 and a recent work showed that lactate elongation to n butyrate occurred only at ph 4 5 sträuber et al 2018 in the present study lactate utilization for n butyrate production occurred at a lower ph 4 0 4 3 0 3l rbf day 1 thermophilic experiment day 41 moreover the highest n caproate production rate in our study was detected at an initial ph of 4 7 1l rbf day 34 even though ph 5 0 was reported to completely inhibit n caproate production in a similar process nzeteu et al 2018 it is worth mentioning that the undissociated n caproic acid concentration 0 65 g l at this day was below the toxic limit 0 87 g l proposed to inhibit n caproate production in ethanol based chain elongation ge et al 2015 nevertheless undissociated n caproic acid concentration on day 36 when n caproate formation was still observed reached 1 72 g l these observations show that the microbiome developed in our experiments could function at more acidic environments than previous reports and in the presence of higher concentrations of the toxic undissociated n caproic acid the low ph and the presence of undissociated n butyric 35 mm and n caproic 20 mm acids could have prevented the acrylate pathway from being dominant despite the temporary high lactate concentrations propionate could still be formed at low ph levels when in line extraction is applied and lactate accumulation is observed kucek et al 2016a although it seems that lactate elongators can stand higher undissociated n caproic acid concentrations than ethanol elongators or propionate producers more research is needed to systematically determine the toxic limit of undissociated n caproic acid for the three microbial groups 4 2 2 maximum hydroxide use for n caproate production from carbohydrates reduced chemical use for ph control can help to increase the life cycle performance of the technology chen et al 2017 at present however few studies report on either base or acid needed in their processes in our study homolactic fermentation eq 1 and lactate based chain elongation eq 2 eq 3 were the main identified processes considering glucose conversion to lactate through homolactic fermentation and lactate based chain elongation to n caproate a maximum of 2 3 of the protons released can be self neutralized by coupling these two processes to keep a constant ph base addition or intrinsic alkalinity from the substrate would still be needed this equals to a maximum hydroxide need of 1 mol oh mol n c6 or 3 9 mol oh kg cod c6 in this study n caproate was almost the only mcfa produced and the values for hydroxide addition were always below the theoretical maximum except for 1l rbf cycles 1 and 2 were lactate was not produced table s2 even though scfa were always produced together with n caproate hydroxide input was improved as ph started to increase over cycles due to increased n caproate selectivity and accumulation of buffer capacity clearly the production of scfa increases the base need and the opposite is true for longer mcfa production e g n caprylate 5 conclusions repeated batch food waste fermentation without exogenous electron donor was steered to n caproate as the dominant product lactate production and subsequent chain elongation from food waste regulated ph dynamics and buffer capacity of the substrate helped to avoid inhibitory acidic conditions and large ph fluctuations these phenomena together lead to reduced hydroxide input for n caproate production lactate was attributed as key electron donor for chain elongation and its uptake for n caproate formation was observed at conditions suggested as inhibitory in the literature lactobacillus spp and caproiciproducens spp dominated and co occurred in the microbiome which shows the involvement of caproiciproducens spp in the use of lactate as electron donor
