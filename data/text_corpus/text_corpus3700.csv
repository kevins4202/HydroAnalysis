18500,sensor drift is commonly observed across engineering disciplines particularly in harsh media such as wastewater in this study a novel stabilizing controller for nitrification of high strength ammonia solutions is designed based on online signal derivatives the controller uses the derivative of a drifting nitrite signal to determine if nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are substrate limited or substrate inhibited to ensure a meaningful interpretation of the derivative signal the process is excited in a cyclic manner by repeatedly exposing the nob to substrate limited and substrate inhibited conditions the resulting control system successfully prevented nitrite accumulations for a period of 72 days in a laboratory scale reactor slow disturbances in the form of feed composition changes and temperature changes were successfully handled by the controller while short term temperature disturbances are shown to pose a challenge to the current version of this controller most importantly we demonstrate that drift tolerant control for the purpose of process stabilization can be achieved without sensor redundancy by combining deliberate input excitation qualitative trend analysis and coarse process knowledge graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrite control inflection point shape constrained splines relative measurement online experiment nitrification 1 introduction control loops relying on absolute sensor values often suffer from sensor faults this study presents a novel control concept to stabilise a reactor for nitrification of high strength ammonia solutions in the presence of sensor drift to this end the controller is designed to exploit information from the signal derivatives in a deliberately excited process in wastewater biological chemical and physical factors lead to particularly intense wear and tear of sensors hence even mature sensor hardware such as ph sensors still exhibit drift when exposed to this harsh medium this drift occurs at time scales that are much longer than typical process dynamics challenging a comparison with the sensor data history temporal redundancy ohmura et al submitted furthermore drift tends to occur in all sensors exposed to the same medium challenging its detection based on redundant placement of sensors spatial redundancy lack of spatial and temporal redundancy impedes the application of tools such as active fault tolerant control that correct drift automatically based on redundant information blanke et al 2016 the root causes of sensor drift are typically assumed to be known well e g biofilm formation salt deposition electrode oxidation etc but are generally hard to quantify there are a few attempts to investigate drift of sensors quantitatively by controlled offline experiments ohmura et al submitted or by online experiments samuelsson et al 2018 however drift is typically identified by means of on site manual reference measurements in practice this makes drift expensive to detect and correct particularly when remote or decentralised systems are considered the limited capacity to quantify sensor drift in wastewater processes on the one hand and the need to control these processes on the other hand led to the development of methods that disregard absolute sensor values and extract information that is represented in the derivatives of the sensor signal the most discussed soft sensor signals that reveal relevant information without relying on a classical notions of accuracy are ph oxidation reduction potential orp al ghusain et al 1995 and oxygen uptake rate baeza et al 2002 al ghusain et al 1995 used the derivatives of ph and orp to operate an aerobic anoxic sludge digestion reactor in these cases the sequenced operation creates the dynamics in the recorded sensor signals that enable information extraction in continuously operated processes trend based monitoring and control is possible thanks to naturally occurring periodicity of the unmeasured process input disturbances e g hydraulic load nitrogen load thürlimann et al 2018 schneider et al 2019 the application of trend based control concepts is expected to be more challenging in systems without naturally occurring disturbances the source separated collection and nitrification of anthropogenic urine for the purpose of fertilizer recovery is an example of such a system separated collection of undiluted urine at the building or household level enables to smoothen the hydraulic load with a small buffer tank our experience not shown suggests that short term storage of anthropogenic urine does not affect the total nitrogen concentration meaning that the naturally occurring variations in the nitrogen load to a nitrifying reactor are expected to be small despite the apparent lack of input disturbances the process is sensitive to inadvertent nitrite accumulation events which cause a complete failure of the process in absence of corrective actions fumasoli et al 2016 sun et al 2012 an economically viable method to measure nitrite online is uv vis absorbance spectrophotometry however this measurement principle lacks specificity and therefore needs a model to extract the nitrite concentrations from the absorbance measurements despite the availability of robust hardware extrapolation of such models makes drift of the nitrite signal a very likely phenomenon gruber et al 2006 brito et al 2014 etheridge et al 2014 as is also demonstrated below the lack of natural or operational dynamics the presence of signal drift and the open loop unstable process of urine nitrification motivates the development of a specialized control concept this control concept as explained in detail below extracts the essential information needed to prevent dangerous nitrite accumulation events by means of i deliberate induction of process dynamics excitation and ii trend analysis of a drifting sensor signal in turn this information extraction process enables the construction of single in single out siso controller for stabilization of the urine nitrification process 2 material and methods 2 1 conceptual model of the control problem in this paragraph a conceptual model of the urine nitrification process is presented the concept illustrates the different process states gujer 2008 growth rate of the ammonia oxidizing bacteria μaob growth rate of the nitrite oxidizing bacteria μnob connections indicating the causal relationships between these variables and the sign of the magnitude of each influence positive negative influence in the control literature these signs are known as the signs of gains åström and murray 2008 it is important to note that this conceptual model only includes the effects considered relevant to tackle the identified process stabilization challenge only dynamic effects with a lower time constant than the controller are considered e g biomass concentration stays approximately constant within this time scale in addition direct inhibition of the aob and nob activity by ammonia is considered marginal in the studied operational region ph 5 9 to 7 0 the indicated signs of gains are only valid if all other states and rates remain constant and under constraints given in fig 1 the blue arrows without dot indicate a positive gain the orange arrows with a dot indicate a negative gain of the connected elements for example an increasing loading rate leads to an increased ph i e positive gain and an increasing aob rate μaob leads to a decreased ph i e negative gain the gains can create loops such loops are stable if the product of the gains is negative e g ph nh3 μaob green circle arrows this means these loops are self stabilizing for example an increase of the ph due to a process disturbance e g higher hydraulic load higher ph of influent will increase the free ammonia nh3 or fa concentration in the bulk which in turn raises the μaob in turn this decreases the ph therefore stabilising this part of the process a loop with a positive product of its gains is a positive feedback loop and can lead when not controlled properly to a complete disappearance of elements in the loop i e unstable in the present case nitrite has a negative gain to μnob when the nitrite concentrations are high i e orange arrow a high nitrite concentration reduces the nitrite oxidation rate this increases the net nitrite production rate in turn inducing to an even stronger inhibition of the nob eventually this leads to nob wash out and process failure this part of the process is open loop stable if the nitrite concentration remains low i e blue arrow under such circumstances marginal increases of the nitrite concentration increase the nob activity which decreases the net nitrite production rate practically the process can only be stabilised by reducing the aob activity whenever the nitrite concentration reaches nob inhibiting levels this is possible by making the reactor anoxic in which case nitrite is reduced by denitrification this may induce growth of denitrifiers however in turn leading to a loss of nitrogen to the environment for the purpose of fertilizer production a better approach consists of reducing the nitrite production rate by decreasing the ph setpoint low ph values induce lower fa concentrations so that eventually the nitrite oxidation rate is higher than the nitrite production rate fig 1 right more details concerning the influence of the no 2 concentration on the nob activity μnob are shown in the top right box of fig 1 it shows μnob as a function of the total nitrite concentration tnn full line the growth rate is composed of both the substrate limiting effect and the inhibition effect nitrite has on the nob most studies but not all list nitrite as the substrate and free nitrous acid fna as the inhibiting substance for nob park and bae 2009 this means that the growth rate is ph dependent for simplicity we neglect any effect of the ph and assume that tnn is both the substrate and the inhibitory substance in practice the exact value of the tnn concentration where the effect of substrate inhibition overpowers the effect of substrate affinity is known only coarsely due to a variety of factors these include process related factors such as i the incompleteness of available knowledge describing the influences of biomass composition urine composition and temperature on the observed nitrite affinity and nitrite inhibition effects van hulle et al 2007 and ii insufficient accuracy and precision of laboratory concentration measurements to determine the critical nitrite concentration precisely even under otherwise stable conditions the black dashed arrows indicate the existing ph control loop as well as the newly proposed nitrite control loop for process stabilization the ph control loop is described below and is designed to protect the aob from washout cf 2 2 3 the second dashed arrow indicates the proposed master controller for the ph control loop in the reactor based on the nitrite concentration which is aimed at preventing washout of the nob 2 2 basic reactor set up and operation the reactor used for this study is a cylindrical 12 l continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr nitrifying source separated urine the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor system varied between 7 and 13 days as is discussed below the reactor was operated without biomass retention so that the sludge retention time srt equals the hrt the reactor was in operation since 19 months prior to the start of this study the reactor includes two recirculation loops one brings the reactor medium to the uv vis spectrophotometer with an hrt of 10 s the other brings medium to a ph sensor pack used in another study hrt 20 s ohmura et al submitted the feed composition is described in 2 5 3 the available alkalinity limits the fraction of the total ammonium converted via nitrite to nitrate to roughly 50 detailed results below 2 2 1 analytics samples are taken regularly from the reactor to evaluate if the proposed controller keeps the nitrite concentration low to measure chemical species the following steps are executed per sample at least 2 ml of reactor media are filtered with a 0 45 μm gf pet filter art nr 916 02 macherey nagel oensingen switzerland mounted on a sampling syringe ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations are measured in every sample the influent ammonium and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations are measured each time the influent tank was replaced the exchange dates and concentrations are listed in the electronic supplementary material tables s1 and s2 ammonium concentrations are determined either through a metrohm 930 compact ic flex metrohm herisau switzerland method metrohm metrosep c6 250 4 0 with flow injection analysis fia lachat qc8500 hach company loveland usa or with colorimetric test kits lck303 hach lange berlin as all lck test kits nitrite reference concentrations are determined either colorimetrically with an lck341 test kit or with strip tests mquant merck kgaa darmstadt germany to confirm low nitrite concentrations due to dilution the detection limit with the lck341 kit is approximately 2 mg n l nitrate is measured in the laboratory through a metrohm 881 compact ic pro metrohm herisau switzerland chemical suppression metrosep a supp 7 250 4 0 or with an lck340 kit for the measurement of the cod lck314 kits are used a standard deviation of the measurement including the dilution procedure is estimated with a single triplicate of measurements prior to this study fia ammonium 0 60 at 2340 mg n l lck 341 nitrite 0 60 at 45 7 mg n l and ic nitrate 0 55 at 2226 mg n l 2 2 2 sensors a 2 mm path length spectro lyser v1 s can vienna austria is used to measure the uv vis absorbance spectrum of the reactor content in situ the sensor measures the absorbance from 200 to 750 nm with a resolution of 2 5 nm the ex situ wbm model from thürlimann et al submitted is used to estimate the nitrite concentrations each minute a new absorbance measurement and in turn a new estimation of the nitrite concentration is obtained furthermore two ph and two dissolved oxygen do sensors are installed one of each is used for control do cos61d and ph cps11d endress hauser reinach switzerland 2 2 3 low level control the do concentration is controlled between 5 and 6 mg o12 l by on off control of the airflow through a fine bubble diffusor 6 l min the feed pump is ph controlled cf 2 3 the reactor is equipped with a water based heating cooling system fn 25 julabo seelbach gmbh germany the temperature of the reactor was controlled at 25 c with an accuracy of 0 5 c due to diurnal variations unless stated otherwise 2 3 stabilizing nitrite control the ultimate goal of our controller is to ensure that both aob and nob are retained and remain active in the studied reactor in the presence of typical disturbances the envisioned control system has to ensure that the net nitrite production rate is zero meaning that the ammonia oxidation is the rate limiting step and that no ammonia is accumulating in the system to this end the master controller manages the nitrite oxidation i e nob and the slave controller manages the ammonia oxidation i e aob at the top of fig 2 the proposed cascaded control loops are illustrated the slave control loop using ph to control the inflow was described by udert et al 2003 it controls the aob by manipulating the inflow rate based on the ph setpoint given by the master controller the master controller takes the nitrite concentration estimation as an indicator to decide if the ammonia oxidation rate is higher or lower than the theoretical maximum nitrite oxidation rate and sets the ph set point accordingly the slave controller turns on the inflow pump when the ph drops below the ph setpoint instead of a higher second ph setpoint the pump is turned off again based on a timer 6 s in each pump event 20 5 ml of urine is fed to the reactor the master controller sets the ph setpoint to the high setpoint 6 8 when the nitrite concentration is such that the nob are dominated by substrate limitation i e stable region fig 1 right horizontal dashes in blue this is referred to as controller state 1 if nitrite is so high that the nob are dominated by substrate inhibition i e unstable region fig 1 right vertical dashes in orange the controller sets the ph to the low setpoint 6 1 this is further referred to as controller state 0 the drift in the controller input signal forces to design the controller such that it relies on the information contained in the first and second derivative of the signal to distinguish between nob inhibitory and nob limiting nitrite concentration levels the information that is actually used in the controller is the identified presence of the inflection point in the downward trend i e negative first derivative second derivative sign switches from negative to positive it is assumed that μaob is constant in the period during which the inflection point appears the first reason is that the ph has already reached its low setpoint value and the influent composition is assumed constant thus there are no changes in the fa concentration the second reason is that the temperature is assumed constant furthermore it is assumed that aob activity is almost insensitive to changes in the nitrite concentration at the nitrite concentration level where the μnob starts to be dominated by substrate limitation fig 1 tnnmax wang et al 2014 consequently when the inflection point appears the nitrite dynamics are only driven by the nob when nob are dominated by substrate inhibition and a low ph results in low fa availability for aob fig 1 right pink dotted line the nob activity increases as nitrite concentrations are decreasing fig 1 moving from point b to point c at the landmark value kuipers 1986 tnnmax the μnob and therefore also the net nitrite degradation rate reach their maxima and then start to decrease fig 1 moving from point c to point a consequently the appearance of the infection point in the decreasing signal is linked with the nob achieving their maximum growth rate point c and the start of substrate limitation dominating the nob note that the precise value of tnnmax is considered unknown identifying an inflection point in the downward trend requires first and foremost that the nitrite concentration has been high enough to induce observable inhibition of the nob thus the controller has to be designed in such a way that nob inhibiting conditions are reached in a way that allows reducing the nitrite concentration as soon as inhibiting conditions are detected accordingly the master controller increases the ph setpoint such that the increased fa concentration leads to an ammonia oxidation rate i e nitrite production rate higher than the maximal nitrite consumption rate fig 1 right purple dashed line the nitrite increase is controlled by monitoring the absolute increase of the signal value in our case the last nitrite value prior to the ph increase is taken as a reference for a relative increase of 15 mg n l once this threshold is reached the controller switches from state 1 to state 0 in control state 0 the controller re stabilises the process by decreasing the ph fig 1 right pink dotted line as long as the nitrite concentration in the previous increase never exceeds point b fig 1 right the reduction in the fa concentration to the lower concentration level pink dotted line puts the steady state concentration back to point a and a net nitrite reduction starts the controller gets the confirmation of reaching a stable nitratation by identifying the inflection point in the downward trend this ends one control cycle details concerning the practical implementation of this controller can be found in the electronic supplementary material 2 4 identification of inflection point to identify the inflection point in the downward nitrite signal the signal is analyzed by means of a qualitative trend analysis qta method for this purpose the shape constrained spline function scs method described in earlier works villez et al 2013 villez and habermacher 2016 derlon et al 2017 mašić et al 2017 is selected the detailed modifications necessary for this work particularly to enable online deployment are described in the electronic supplementary material we illustrate the essence of this method next fig 3 illustrates two different time points in the analysis of the same event the top panels show the data black dotted and the three shape constrained spline models fitted to the data these three models are increasingly flexible one model u is constrained to be isotonic monotonically increasing the next model ud is constrained to exhibit a unimodal shape single maximum no minimum with a concave profile after the identified maximum the last model uda has a unimodal shape also but is allowed to have a single inflection point after the identified maximum the bottom panels show the corresponding root mean squared residual rmsr of the three models evaluated with all the data available until this time in the left plot the data already exhibited a maximum and the u model constrained to be continuously increasing starts to fit worse than the two other models this can be seen in the almost flat shape the u model has from hour 6 this leads to an increasing rmsr of the u model rmsru both the ud and uda models approximate the time series well as their shape constraints are flexible enough the right panel shows the time point at which the full data set of the event is available visual inspection reveals that the data exhibits a maximum and an inflection point in the downward trend as expected shortly after hour 9 it becomes clear that a maximum is present in the time series given that rmsru increases dramatically as desired the rmsrud increases once the curve exhibits a convex form hour 14 thus leading to the detection of the downward inflection point shortly after a video illustrating the incremental data acquisition and concurrent data analysis can be found in the electronic supplementary material 2 5 unmeasured process disturbances three unmeasured disturbances are tested or monitored to evaluate the robustness of the controller first the signal drift itself which is expected to occur under any given practical operational condition thus signal drift is not actively induced but allowed to occur in a passive manner instead second the robustness of the controller is tested against temperature dynamics and thirdly against influent composition dynamics 2 5 1 determination of drift rate the nitrite reference measurements are compared with the estimation of the uv vis nitrite signal to monitor if the sensor signal actually drifts the rate at which the difference of these two values change is the drift rate periods of drift are selected visually and then described by a piece wise linear trend line drift is monitored in the whole experimental period 19 03 2018 30 05 2018 72 days including the periods in which the temperature and switch of influent source experiments see below take place 2 5 2 temperature experiments in the ambient temperature range 10 35 c the μaob increases faster with temperature than the μnob hellinga et al 1998 to evaluate whether such disturbances pose a challenge to our control system the reactor is cooled or heated by means of the water based cooling and heating jacket a temperature low experiment was executed twice each time the reactor was cooled down from 25 c to 22 c within 10 12 h and then heated back to 25 c within 10 12 h 16 17 04 2018 and 19 20 04 2018 a temperature high experiment was executed in two versions in a long version 23 04 2018 25 04 2018 the temperature was increased within 8 h from 25 to 28 c kept there for 36 h and then cooled down back to 25 c within 10 h for the two short version experiments 26 04 2018 and 27 04 2018 the temperature was raised from 25 to 28 c within 10 h and then immediately cooled back to 25 c within 10 h note that these temperatures are typical for indoor applications and subtropical regions of the world 2 5 3 switch of influent source changes in the feed composition are another source of unmeasured process disturbances to evaluate whether the controller is robust to this type of disturbances we devised an experiment during which the reactor feed composition is changed deliberately on april 30th 2018 at 09 13 the influent was changed from source separated urine collected from male toilets and urinals to source separated urine collected from female toilets both female and male urine collection system are located in the forum chriesbach building at eawag dübendorf in switzerland the urine from female toilets has a lower concentration of ammonia 31 and cod 37 due to dilution with flushing water in the nomix toilets a more comprehensive overview can be found in fumasoli et al 2016 more details can be found in the electronic supplementary material table s2 1 and s2 2 3 results 3 1 control behaviour the following paragraph describes one control cycle during which the complete control system was in autonomous use fig 4 at about 12 00 the controller state is 1 2nd panel and the ph controller setpoint is 6 8 high ph setpoint 3rd panel this induces an increase in nitrite as expected top panel after reaching the threshold for a maximal difference to the previously defined baseline i e rule 1 the controller state is set to 0 2nd panel the ph setpoint is reduced to 6 1 low ph setpoint 3rd panel from this time on the nitrite signal is recorded for analysis by the scs models after collecting the minimal number of nitrite measurements in this time series the scs models are fit for the first time in the 4th panel one can see the incremental changes of the rmsr of the three different models u ud and uda as new nitrite measurements are added to the analyzed data series one can see that rmsru is always larger than rmsrud and rmsruda the interpretation is that the control algorithm recognises that the peak nitrite concentration has already occurred before this first time of comparative analysis at 02 30 the rmsrud starts to deviate visually from the rmsruda the vertical line in the bottom panel indicates when rule 3 was evaluated as true shortly before 07 00 meaning that the controller now considers the presence of an inflection point in the nitrite signal as a sure thing shortly before 09 00 the 2 h timer rule 4 is also evaluated true and the controller switches back to state 1 high ph setpoint consequently the controller memorises the last nitrite value to reference the next nitrite increase and increases the ph setpoint to 6 8 this completes one autonomous cycle of the proposed controller 3 2 controller performance fig 5 illustrates nitrite end of cycle concentrations ecc measured after the detection of the inflection point but before the ph is increased again t5 see electronic supplementary material the recorded ecc values represent substrate limiting conditions for the nob during the complete experimental period the ecc progressively decreased during the period of autonomous control the solid retention time i e equals the hydraulic retention time never exceeds 13 days fig 6 bottom panel meaning that the experimental period covers more than 5 5 time the hrt and srt thus the controller not only kept the nitrite concentration low in the short term but also successfully prevented washout of the nob population within a significant test period despite the very noisy input signal the visual inspection of the results reveals that the model selection by means of comparing the rmsrs of the three models has never resulted in a false negative or false positive identification of the maximum or the inflection point it has to be noted that most likely there is a certain delay in the identification due to the chosen value for the knot distance to quantify the delay in every cycle the ground truth about tnnmax fig 1 would need to be determined 3 3 unmeasured process disturbances 3 3 1 drift the controller input signal drift is illustrated in the top panel of fig 6 drift occurred during the entire experimental period the estimated drift rates obtained with the fitted piece wise linear trend line range from 0 8 to 1 1 mg no 2 n l d thus one can conclude that the observed signal drift poses a meaningful challenge for process control which has been mitigated successfully by the proposed control system it is noted that the changes in the drift rates can only be explained partially the vertical grey dashed lines indicate sensor cleaning sign changes of the drift rate are unexpected for this kind of intervention i e a signal jump is expected when biofilm and solids are removed from the sensor note that the initial difference between the uv vis based nitrite value and the nitrite reference measurements has been caused by drift in the 9 months in between the calibration period and the start of this study 3 3 2 switch of influent source the change in influent composition fig 6 and 30 04 2018 blue dashed line induces a change in the sign of the drift rate from 1 1 to 0 4 mg n l d the ammonia and nitrate concentration in the reactor decrease from 2000 to 1300 mg n l in the first 15 days following the influent switch fig 6 2nd panel the controller reacted to the new lower concentrated influent and increased the hydraulic loading which is indicated by the decreased hydraulic residence time hrt from about 13 to 7 days fig 6 3rd panel furthermore also the control cycle length decreased from about 1 to 0 5 d fig 5 thus the controller was able to reject this disturbance and keep nitrite levels low at the same time the slave controller was still acting as intended and compensated the decreased specific ammonia load with an increased hydraulic loading 3 3 3 temperature experiment fig 7 shows the results of the temperature high experiment the first complete cycle shown in this figure starts on april 21st and illustrates the operation before the temperature change on april 22nd the controller sets the ph setpoint to 6 8 fig 7 2nd panel before the temperature increase is visible fig 7 3rd panel the nitrite concentration rises for some time fig 7 1st panel while the temperature increases also shortly after the controller decreases the ph setpoint while the temperature continues to increase however the nitrite signal remains at a high level around 15 mg n l relative to the cycle before the temperature change 30 mg n l nitrite reference measurements confirm that elevated nitrite concentrations are the cause for this difference in the signal which remain around 20 mg n l instead of around 5 mg n l as in the previous cycle this very small drop in nitrite compared to the peak concentration also leads to a delay in the identification of the inflection point fig 7 4th panel compared to the visual impression obtained by looking at the figure 1st panel the controller identified an inflection point only in the afternoon of april 24th an increase in ph at this time point would lead to an even higher accumulation of nitrite to ensure successful testing of the controller against other disturbances the controller is deactivated temporally cf grey area 2nd panel and the temperature setpoint is again decreased to 25 c the cooling of the bulk media leads to a decrease in the nitrite starting at midnight on the 25th at noon of the same day the nitrite signal and reference measurements drop to the levels reached in the first cycle figs 7 and 22nd and the controller is restarted shortly after thus the temperature high experiment indicated that fast temperature increases pose a threat to the proposed control system the temperature low experiment did not reveal any relevant finding with respect to the control performance the only notable change compared to the 25 c operation is the reduction in the peak nitrite concentration by about 5 mg n l 4 discussion this study proposes a new concept for a stabilizing control in the presence of signal drift and demonstrates its utility by means of an intensive measurement campaign in a laboratory scale reactor for urine nitrification the proposed control system avoids the effects of signal drift by using information in the first and second derivative to distinguish between stabilizing and destabilizing process conditions the results reveal that the controller successfully stabilised the nitrification process despite using a sensor signal that is drifting permanently importantly this could be achieved without redundant actuators or sensors and without a precise kinetic model of the process 4 1 system performance the end of cycle nitrite concentrations at the end of the control cycles were shown to decrease over time this may indicate an adaption of the nob to the elevated nitrite levels or could also be caused by the influent switch since steady state was not reached during the studied period one cannot determine with absolute certainty whether the reported decrease is caused by a net decay of the aob or a net growth of the nob since the average ph in the reactor is higher than in the conventional operation with a constantly safe but low ph this controller should theoretically also achieve higher nitrification rates udert and wächter 2012 however ph is only one among many factors influencing the nitrification rates bürgmann et al 2011 showed that long term exposure to nitrite could jeopardise the process while van hulle et al 2007 hypothesised that bacteria become more tolerant when exposed long enough to elevated nitrite concentrations consequently future research should be aimed at understanding long term reactor performance indicators in the presence of stabilizing control loops 4 2 unmeasured disturbances our study shows that fast introduction of unmeasured disturbances can threaten the suitability of the proposed trend based control concept to understand why this is the case one must note that the controller is based on the assumption that the appearance of an inflection point in the downward nitrite signal can only be explained by a change of from nob inhibiting to non inhibiting nitrite concentration levels to challenge this assumption as well as the control concept two confounding factors were disturbed on purpose temperature and influent composition the temperature high experiment indicates that unmeasured disturbances can make the proposed control system fail this is explained as an effect on the μaob to μnob ratio which increases with temperature indeed the fast temperature increase in the bulk media introduced the appearance of an inflection point however the assumption that the inflection point is solely caused by nob dynamics does not hold any longer and explains the wrongful control action while nitrite concentration does not yet reach the nob inhibiting region after one cycle the early increase of the ph setpoint induces an additional increase in the nitrite concentration such a higher concentration will likely inhibit the nob and activate a positive feedback loop between the nitrite concentration in turn inducing an increased risk of nob wash out in the long term the temperature high experiment did reveal another important condition for correct functioning of the controller the low amplitude of the signal fig 7 april 24th afternoon delays the identification of the inflection point this shows the need for sufficient excitement of the process and the signal to reach a large enough signal to noise ratio however increased excitation also increases the risk of irreversible process failure i e fig 1 exceed point b the influent switch experiment did not influence the observed signal profiles in a meaningful way as a result the controller was able to execute the right control actions in a timely manner throughout the course of this test there are two explanations for this first the model to derive the nitrite concentrations from the uv vis absorbance measurement is apparently quite robust against changes in the reactor media composition particularly large changes of the nitrate concentration fig 6 second the dynamics caused by the influent switch are driven by the hrt and decreased from 13 to 7 d thus this disturbance is much smoother than the temperature experiments which have a time window of 0 5 d 4 3 extension of controller the modifications applied to enable scs analysis in an online environment worked without any complications the main modification consisted of embedding the scs as a model selection tool in a moving horizon estimation framework with a fixed start point despite concerns about the computational costs by villez et al 2013 the three scs models could be fitted to the data within less than 3 s on an intel core i7 4970k 4 ghz processor thus conventionally available computational resources are expected to be sufficient for most biochemical process monitoring applications faster computations e g for fast processes or when dealing with high frequency data collection systems can be facilitated by increasing the knot distance of the spline functions if computational cost is no concern at all then the knot distance can be reduced to improve the fit of the applied scs models so far the controller makes the nitrite concentration oscillate around the optimal concentration for maximal μnob the upper setpoint has to ensure that nitrite is always accumulating to keep the signal informative the lower setpoint has to ensure net nitrite degradation to stabilise the process choosing the setpoints can be challenging and some disturbances may influence the system such that the chosen ph setpoints cannot push the process into the intended operational regions enabling the controller to decide how the two ph setpoints itself should be set would also facilitate process optimization one way to obtain a good ratio of the aob activity to the nob activity at both ph setpoints was revealed in the high temperature experiment the increased temperature leads to a relatively high aob rate at low ph this in turn resulted in slow net nitrite degradation producing a signal that is fairly flat when compared to the decreasing trend in the previous cycle thus the ph setpoints and consequently also the overall process performance were rather high for the given nob capacity potentially computing the ratio of the increasing and the decreasing slope in one cycle allows optimizing the ph setpoints and in turn the process performance for the next cycle furthermore using this kind of information would also help to reject additional disturbances without the need for additional instrumentation cf high temperature experiment 4 4 links to existing control theory the proposed controller is based largely on a conceptual model of substrate affinity and inhibition in nitrifying bacteria assuming that the nob activity and thus also the nitrite conversion rate has a unimodal shape with respect to the nitrite concentration one can expect to observe an inflection point whenever the process shifts from conditions dominated by nitrite inhibition to conditions dominated by nitrite limitation this information is key to avoid the need for any explicit correction of the signal drift since it is contained in the derivatives importantly the actions taken by the controller can also be interpreted as the execution of an online experiment to determine the nob kinetics microbial populations adapt over time and thus it is highly likely that the inhibition and affinity constants of these population change consequently a sensor signal without relevant drift as input would allow tracking the optimal concentration of nitrite for a maximal μnob this is also important with view on the many nitrification controllers equating nitrification with ammonia removal while nitrite oxidation is assumed to be completed simultaneously consequently single indicators such as ammonia concentration ph valley or our drop have been assumed informative enough to control the process åmand et al 2013 jaramillo et al 2018 thürlimann et al 2018 this is justifiable in some situations e g municipal wwtp however in certain situations analysis of both ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation is key for process stability and optimization partial nitritation anammox lotti et al 2012 or on site wwtp which can be limited by alkalinity are examples of this we speculate that the proposed control concept can be used whenever derivatives are informative about the concentration trend of a relevant substance the benefits of controllers executing online experiments to determine process states in continuously operated reactors are rarely studied in wastewater treatment steyer et al 1999 also deliberately induced process disturbances to gain information about the performance of an anaerobic reactor in contrast to the presented controller they compared the information against a simple model to determine the performance the intentional excitement or perturbation of a system also has a theoretical basis in the form of extremum seeking control esc liu and krstic 2012 both esc and the presented trend based controller are model free feedback controllers that purposely excite the system to gain information however esc requires an excitement frequency that is much lower than the dominant process frequency this is not the case here as the biomass growth dynamics hrt 13 d and the excitement frequency 1 d 1 appear in the same time scale trollberg et al 2014 found that the combination of a slow process and low excitement frequency as found in wastewater treatment make current forms of esc impractical they further stated that knowledge about the system behaviour close to the optimum is crucial to facilitate the use of esc using esc could however facilitate the inclusion of the ideas presented in section 4 3 thus esc may be helpful urine nitrification process optimization in addition to ensuring long term stability of the process 5 conclusion in this study a stabilizing controller for nitrification in high strength wastewater was developed and critically evaluated the controller successfully prevents the occurrence of destabilizing nitrite accumulation events in an alkalinity limited urine nitrification reactor for the entire test period of 72 days these are the main conclusions information contained in the derivatives of a drifting signal combined with qualitative knowledge about kinetics allowed for the control of an open loop unstable system without the need for drift rate estimation or correction systems without any dynamics due to input or operation can be excited deliberately in such a way that the signal derivatives contain the information of interest about the process states in this study the controller was designed to destabilise the nitrification such that the signal derivatives contain the necessary information about the process state in turn enabling stabilizing feedback control somewhat counter intuitively deliberate short term destabilization facilitates the assurance of long term process stability the controller is based on a conceptual model of the process this model currently excludes the effect of unmeasured disturbances other than the signal drift this constitutes the most sensitive component of our proposed controller whereas slow unmeasured disturbances were successfully rejected information in the controller input signal informing about fast unmeasured disturbances were identified and considered for inclusion

18500,sensor drift is commonly observed across engineering disciplines particularly in harsh media such as wastewater in this study a novel stabilizing controller for nitrification of high strength ammonia solutions is designed based on online signal derivatives the controller uses the derivative of a drifting nitrite signal to determine if nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob are substrate limited or substrate inhibited to ensure a meaningful interpretation of the derivative signal the process is excited in a cyclic manner by repeatedly exposing the nob to substrate limited and substrate inhibited conditions the resulting control system successfully prevented nitrite accumulations for a period of 72 days in a laboratory scale reactor slow disturbances in the form of feed composition changes and temperature changes were successfully handled by the controller while short term temperature disturbances are shown to pose a challenge to the current version of this controller most importantly we demonstrate that drift tolerant control for the purpose of process stabilization can be achieved without sensor redundancy by combining deliberate input excitation qualitative trend analysis and coarse process knowledge graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrite control inflection point shape constrained splines relative measurement online experiment nitrification 1 introduction control loops relying on absolute sensor values often suffer from sensor faults this study presents a novel control concept to stabilise a reactor for nitrification of high strength ammonia solutions in the presence of sensor drift to this end the controller is designed to exploit information from the signal derivatives in a deliberately excited process in wastewater biological chemical and physical factors lead to particularly intense wear and tear of sensors hence even mature sensor hardware such as ph sensors still exhibit drift when exposed to this harsh medium this drift occurs at time scales that are much longer than typical process dynamics challenging a comparison with the sensor data history temporal redundancy ohmura et al submitted furthermore drift tends to occur in all sensors exposed to the same medium challenging its detection based on redundant placement of sensors spatial redundancy lack of spatial and temporal redundancy impedes the application of tools such as active fault tolerant control that correct drift automatically based on redundant information blanke et al 2016 the root causes of sensor drift are typically assumed to be known well e g biofilm formation salt deposition electrode oxidation etc but are generally hard to quantify there are a few attempts to investigate drift of sensors quantitatively by controlled offline experiments ohmura et al submitted or by online experiments samuelsson et al 2018 however drift is typically identified by means of on site manual reference measurements in practice this makes drift expensive to detect and correct particularly when remote or decentralised systems are considered the limited capacity to quantify sensor drift in wastewater processes on the one hand and the need to control these processes on the other hand led to the development of methods that disregard absolute sensor values and extract information that is represented in the derivatives of the sensor signal the most discussed soft sensor signals that reveal relevant information without relying on a classical notions of accuracy are ph oxidation reduction potential orp al ghusain et al 1995 and oxygen uptake rate baeza et al 2002 al ghusain et al 1995 used the derivatives of ph and orp to operate an aerobic anoxic sludge digestion reactor in these cases the sequenced operation creates the dynamics in the recorded sensor signals that enable information extraction in continuously operated processes trend based monitoring and control is possible thanks to naturally occurring periodicity of the unmeasured process input disturbances e g hydraulic load nitrogen load thürlimann et al 2018 schneider et al 2019 the application of trend based control concepts is expected to be more challenging in systems without naturally occurring disturbances the source separated collection and nitrification of anthropogenic urine for the purpose of fertilizer recovery is an example of such a system separated collection of undiluted urine at the building or household level enables to smoothen the hydraulic load with a small buffer tank our experience not shown suggests that short term storage of anthropogenic urine does not affect the total nitrogen concentration meaning that the naturally occurring variations in the nitrogen load to a nitrifying reactor are expected to be small despite the apparent lack of input disturbances the process is sensitive to inadvertent nitrite accumulation events which cause a complete failure of the process in absence of corrective actions fumasoli et al 2016 sun et al 2012 an economically viable method to measure nitrite online is uv vis absorbance spectrophotometry however this measurement principle lacks specificity and therefore needs a model to extract the nitrite concentrations from the absorbance measurements despite the availability of robust hardware extrapolation of such models makes drift of the nitrite signal a very likely phenomenon gruber et al 2006 brito et al 2014 etheridge et al 2014 as is also demonstrated below the lack of natural or operational dynamics the presence of signal drift and the open loop unstable process of urine nitrification motivates the development of a specialized control concept this control concept as explained in detail below extracts the essential information needed to prevent dangerous nitrite accumulation events by means of i deliberate induction of process dynamics excitation and ii trend analysis of a drifting sensor signal in turn this information extraction process enables the construction of single in single out siso controller for stabilization of the urine nitrification process 2 material and methods 2 1 conceptual model of the control problem in this paragraph a conceptual model of the urine nitrification process is presented the concept illustrates the different process states gujer 2008 growth rate of the ammonia oxidizing bacteria μaob growth rate of the nitrite oxidizing bacteria μnob connections indicating the causal relationships between these variables and the sign of the magnitude of each influence positive negative influence in the control literature these signs are known as the signs of gains åström and murray 2008 it is important to note that this conceptual model only includes the effects considered relevant to tackle the identified process stabilization challenge only dynamic effects with a lower time constant than the controller are considered e g biomass concentration stays approximately constant within this time scale in addition direct inhibition of the aob and nob activity by ammonia is considered marginal in the studied operational region ph 5 9 to 7 0 the indicated signs of gains are only valid if all other states and rates remain constant and under constraints given in fig 1 the blue arrows without dot indicate a positive gain the orange arrows with a dot indicate a negative gain of the connected elements for example an increasing loading rate leads to an increased ph i e positive gain and an increasing aob rate μaob leads to a decreased ph i e negative gain the gains can create loops such loops are stable if the product of the gains is negative e g ph nh3 μaob green circle arrows this means these loops are self stabilizing for example an increase of the ph due to a process disturbance e g higher hydraulic load higher ph of influent will increase the free ammonia nh3 or fa concentration in the bulk which in turn raises the μaob in turn this decreases the ph therefore stabilising this part of the process a loop with a positive product of its gains is a positive feedback loop and can lead when not controlled properly to a complete disappearance of elements in the loop i e unstable in the present case nitrite has a negative gain to μnob when the nitrite concentrations are high i e orange arrow a high nitrite concentration reduces the nitrite oxidation rate this increases the net nitrite production rate in turn inducing to an even stronger inhibition of the nob eventually this leads to nob wash out and process failure this part of the process is open loop stable if the nitrite concentration remains low i e blue arrow under such circumstances marginal increases of the nitrite concentration increase the nob activity which decreases the net nitrite production rate practically the process can only be stabilised by reducing the aob activity whenever the nitrite concentration reaches nob inhibiting levels this is possible by making the reactor anoxic in which case nitrite is reduced by denitrification this may induce growth of denitrifiers however in turn leading to a loss of nitrogen to the environment for the purpose of fertilizer production a better approach consists of reducing the nitrite production rate by decreasing the ph setpoint low ph values induce lower fa concentrations so that eventually the nitrite oxidation rate is higher than the nitrite production rate fig 1 right more details concerning the influence of the no 2 concentration on the nob activity μnob are shown in the top right box of fig 1 it shows μnob as a function of the total nitrite concentration tnn full line the growth rate is composed of both the substrate limiting effect and the inhibition effect nitrite has on the nob most studies but not all list nitrite as the substrate and free nitrous acid fna as the inhibiting substance for nob park and bae 2009 this means that the growth rate is ph dependent for simplicity we neglect any effect of the ph and assume that tnn is both the substrate and the inhibitory substance in practice the exact value of the tnn concentration where the effect of substrate inhibition overpowers the effect of substrate affinity is known only coarsely due to a variety of factors these include process related factors such as i the incompleteness of available knowledge describing the influences of biomass composition urine composition and temperature on the observed nitrite affinity and nitrite inhibition effects van hulle et al 2007 and ii insufficient accuracy and precision of laboratory concentration measurements to determine the critical nitrite concentration precisely even under otherwise stable conditions the black dashed arrows indicate the existing ph control loop as well as the newly proposed nitrite control loop for process stabilization the ph control loop is described below and is designed to protect the aob from washout cf 2 2 3 the second dashed arrow indicates the proposed master controller for the ph control loop in the reactor based on the nitrite concentration which is aimed at preventing washout of the nob 2 2 basic reactor set up and operation the reactor used for this study is a cylindrical 12 l continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr nitrifying source separated urine the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor system varied between 7 and 13 days as is discussed below the reactor was operated without biomass retention so that the sludge retention time srt equals the hrt the reactor was in operation since 19 months prior to the start of this study the reactor includes two recirculation loops one brings the reactor medium to the uv vis spectrophotometer with an hrt of 10 s the other brings medium to a ph sensor pack used in another study hrt 20 s ohmura et al submitted the feed composition is described in 2 5 3 the available alkalinity limits the fraction of the total ammonium converted via nitrite to nitrate to roughly 50 detailed results below 2 2 1 analytics samples are taken regularly from the reactor to evaluate if the proposed controller keeps the nitrite concentration low to measure chemical species the following steps are executed per sample at least 2 ml of reactor media are filtered with a 0 45 μm gf pet filter art nr 916 02 macherey nagel oensingen switzerland mounted on a sampling syringe ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations are measured in every sample the influent ammonium and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations are measured each time the influent tank was replaced the exchange dates and concentrations are listed in the electronic supplementary material

reactor content in situ the sensor measures the absorbance from 200 to 750 nm with a resolution of 2 5 nm the ex situ wbm model from thürlimann et al submitted is used to estimate the nitrite concentrations each minute a new absorbance measurement and in turn a new estimation of the nitrite concentration is obtained furthermore two ph and two dissolved oxygen do sensors are installed one of each is used for control do cos61d and ph cps11d endress hauser reinach switzerland 2 2 3 low level control the do concentration is controlled between 5 and 6 mg o12 l by on off control of the airflow through a fine bubble diffusor 6 l min the feed pump is ph controlled cf 2 3 the reactor is equipped with a water based heating cooling system fn 25 julabo seelbach gmbh germany the temperature of the reactor was controlled at 25 c with an accuracy of 0 5 c due to diurnal variations unless stated otherwise 2 3 stabilizing nitrite control the ultimate goal of our controller is to ensure that both aob and nob are retained and remain active in the studied reactor in the presence of typical disturbances the envisioned control system has to ensure that the net nitrite production rate is zero meaning that the ammonia oxidation is the rate limiting step and that no ammonia is accumulating in the system to this end the master controller manages the nitrite oxidation i e nob and the slave controller manages the ammonia oxidation i e aob at the top of fig 2 the proposed cascaded control loops are illustrated the slave control loop using ph to control the inflow was described by udert et al 2003 it controls the aob by manipulating the inflow rate based on the ph setpoint given by the master controller the master controller takes the nitrite concentration estimation as an indicator to decide if the ammonia oxidation rate is higher or lower than the theoretical maximum nitrite oxidation rate and sets the ph set point accordingly the slave controller turns on the inflow pump when the ph drops below the ph setpoint instead of a higher second ph setpoint the pump is turned off again based on a timer 6 s in each pump event 20 5 ml of urine is fed to the reactor the master controller sets the ph setpoint to the high setpoint 6 8 when the nitrite concentration is such that the nob are dominated by substrate limitation i e stable region fig 1 right horizontal dashes in blue this is referred to as controller state 1 if nitrite is so high that the nob are dominated by substrate inhibition i e unstable region fig 1 right vertical dashes in orange the controller sets the ph to the low setpoint 6 1 this is further referred to as controller state 0 the drift in the controller input signal forces to design the controller such that it relies on the information contained in the first and second derivative of the signal to distinguish between nob inhibitory and nob limiting nitrite concentration levels the information that is actually used in the controller is the identified presence of the inflection point in the downward trend i e negative first derivative second derivative sign switches from negative to positive it is assumed that μaob is constant in the period during which the inflection point appears the first reason is that the ph has already reached its low setpoint value and the influent composition is assumed constant thus there are no changes in the fa concentration the second reason is that the temperature is assumed constant furthermore it is assumed that aob activity is almost insensitive to changes in the nitrite concentration at the nitrite concentration level where the μnob starts to be dominated by substrate limitation fig 1 tnnmax wang et al 2014 consequently when the inflection point appears the nitrite dynamics are only driven by the nob when nob are dominated by substrate inhibition and a low ph results in low fa availability for aob fig 1 right pink dotted line the nob activity increases as nitrite concentrations are decreasing fig 1 moving from point b to point c at the landmark value kuipers 1986 tnnmax the μnob and therefore also the net nitrite degradation rate reach their maxima and then start to decrease fig 1 moving from point c to point a consequently the appearance of the infection point in the decreasing signal is linked with the nob achieving their maximum growth rate point c and the start of substrate limitation dominating the nob note that the precise value of tnnmax is considered unknown identifying an inflection point in the downward trend requires first and foremost that the nitrite concentration has been high enough to induce observable inhibition of the nob thus the controller has to be designed in such a way that nob inhibiting conditions are reached in a way that allows reducing the nitrite concentration as soon as inhibiting conditions are detected accordingly the master controller increases the ph setpoint such that the increased fa concentration leads to an ammonia oxidation rate i e nitrite production rate higher than the maximal nitrite consumption rate fig 1 right purple dashed line the nitrite increase is controlled by monitoring the absolute increase of the signal value in our case the last nitrite value prior to the ph increase is taken as a reference for a relative increase of 15 mg n l once this threshold is reached the controller switches from state 1 to state 0 in control state 0 the controller re stabilises the process by decreasing the ph fig 1 right pink dotted line as long as the nitrite concentration in the previous increase never exceeds point b fig 1 right the reduction in the fa concentration to the lower concentration level pink dotted line puts the steady state concentration back to point a and a net nitrite reduction starts the controller gets the confirmation of reaching a stable nitratation by identifying the inflection point in the downward trend this ends one control cycle details concerning the practical implementation of this controller can be found in the electronic supplementary material 2 4 identification of inflection point to identify the inflection point in the downward nitrite signal the signal is analyzed by means of a qualitative trend analysis qta method for this purpose the shape constrained spline function scs method described in earlier works villez et al 2013 villez and habermacher 2016 derlon et al 2017 mašić et al 2017 is selected the detailed modifications necessary for this work particularly to enable online deployment are described in the electronic supplementary material we illustrate the essence of this method next fig 3 illustrates two different time points in the analysis of the same event the top panels show the data black dotted and the three shape constrained spline models fitted to the data these three models are increasingly flexible one model u is constrained to be isotonic monotonically increasing the next model ud is constrained to exhibit a unimodal shape single maximum no minimum with a concave profile after the identified maximum the last model uda has a unimodal shape also but is allowed to have a single inflection point after the identified maximum the bottom panels show the corresponding root mean squared residual rmsr of the three models evaluated with all the data available until this time in the left plot the data already exhibited a maximum and the u model constrained to be continuously increasing starts to fit worse than the two other models this can be seen in the almost flat shape the u model has from hour 6 this leads to an increasing rmsr of the u model rmsru both the ud and uda models approximate the time series well as their shape constraints are flexible enough the right panel shows the time point at which the full data set of the event is available visual inspection reveals that the data exhibits a maximum and an inflection point in the downward trend as expected shortly after hour 9 it becomes clear that a maximum is present in the time series given that rmsru increases dramatically as desired the rmsrud increases once the curve exhibits a convex form hour 14 thus leading to the detection of the downward inflection point shortly after a video illustrating the incremental data acquisition and concurrent data analysis can be found in the electronic supplementary material 2 5 unmeasured process disturbances three unmeasured disturbances are tested or monitored to evaluate the robustness of the controller first the signal drift itself which is expected to occur under any given practical operational condition thus signal drift is not actively induced but allowed to occur in a passive manner instead second the robustness of the controller is tested against temperature dynamics and thirdly against influent composition dynamics 2 5 1 determination of drift rate the nitrite reference measurements are compared with the estimation of the uv vis nitrite signal to monitor if the sensor signal actually drifts the rate at which the difference of these two values change is the drift rate periods of drift are selected visually and then described by a piece wise linear trend line drift is monitored in the whole experimental period 19 03 2018 30 05 2018 72 days including the periods in which the temperature and switch of influent source experiments see below take place 2 5 2 temperature experiments in the ambient temperature range 10 35 c the μaob increases faster with temperature than the μnob hellinga et al 1998 to evaluate whether such disturbances pose a challenge to our control system the reactor is cooled or heated by means of the water based cooling and heating jacket a temperature low experiment was executed twice each time the reactor was cooled down from 25 c to 22 c within 10 12 h and then heated back to 25 c within 10 12 h 16 17 04 2018 and 19 20 04 2018 a temperature high experiment was executed in two versions in a long version 23 04 2018 25 04 2018 the temperature was increased within 8 h from 25 to 28 c kept there for 36 h and then cooled down back to 25 c within 10 h for the two short version experiments 26 04 2018 and 27 04 2018 the temperature was raised from 25 to 28 c within 10 h and then immediately cooled back to 25 c within 10 h note that these temperatures are typical for indoor applications and subtropical regions of the world 2 5 3 switch of influent source changes in the feed composition are another source of unmeasured process disturbances to evaluate whether the controller is robust to this type of disturbances we devised an experiment during which the reactor feed composition is changed deliberately on april 30th 2018 at 09 13 the influent was changed from source separated urine collected from male toilets and urinals to source separated urine collected from female toilets both female and male urine collection system are located in the forum chriesbach building at eawag dübendorf in switzerland the urine from female toilets has a lower concentration of ammonia 31 and cod 37 due to dilution with flushing water in the nomix toilets a more comprehensive overview can be found in fumasoli et al 2016 more details can be found in the electronic supplementary material table s2 1 and s2 2 3 results 3 1 control behaviour the following paragraph describes one control cycle during which the complete control system was in autonomous use fig 4 at about 12 00 the controller state is 1 2nd panel and the ph controller setpoint is 6 8 high ph setpoint 3rd panel this induces an increase in nitrite as expected top panel after reaching the threshold for a maximal difference to the previously defined baseline i e rule 1 the controller state is set to 0 2nd panel the ph setpoint is reduced to 6 1 low ph setpoint 3rd panel from this time on the nitrite signal is recorded for analysis by the scs models after collecting the minimal number of nitrite measurements in this time series the scs models are fit for the first time in the 4th panel one can see the incremental changes of the rmsr of the three different models u ud and uda as new nitrite measurements are added to the analyzed data series one can see that rmsru is always larger than rmsrud and rmsruda the interpretation is that the control algorithm recognises that the peak nitrite concentration has already occurred before this first time of comparative analysis at 02 30 the rmsrud starts to deviate visually from the rmsruda the vertical line in the bottom panel indicates when rule 3 was evaluated as true shortly before 07 00 meaning that the controller now considers the presence of an inflection point in the nitrite signal as a sure thing shortly before 09 00 the 2 h timer rule 4 is also evaluated true and the controller switches back to state 1 high ph setpoint consequently the controller memorises the last nitrite value to reference the next nitrite increase and increases the ph setpoint to 6 8 this completes one autonomous cycle of the proposed controller 3 2 controller performance fig 5 illustrates nitrite end of cycle concentrations ecc measured after the detection of the inflection point but before the ph is increased again t5 see electronic supplementary material the recorded ecc values represent substrate limiting conditions for the nob during the complete experimental period the ecc progressively decreased during the period of autonomous control the solid retention time i e equals the hydraulic retention time never exceeds 13 days fig 6 bottom panel meaning that the experimental period covers more than 5 5 time the hrt and srt thus the controller not only kept the nitrite concentration low in the short term but also successfully prevented washout of the nob population within a significant test period despite the very noisy input signal the visual inspection of the results reveals that the model selection by means of comparing the rmsrs of the three models has never resulted in a false negative or false positive identification of the maximum or the inflection point it has to be noted that most likely there is a certain delay in the identification due to the chosen value for the knot distance to quantify the delay in every cycle the ground truth about tnnmax fig 1 would need to be determined 3 3 unmeasured process disturbances 3 3 1 drift the controller input signal drift is illustrated in the top panel of fig 6 drift occurred during the entire experimental period the estimated drift rates obtained with the fitted piece wise linear trend line range from 0 8 to 1 1 mg no 2 n l d thus one can conclude that the observed signal drift poses a meaningful challenge for process control which has been mitigated successfully by the proposed control system it is noted that the changes in the drift rates can only be explained partially the vertical grey dashed lines indicate sensor cleaning sign changes of the drift rate are unexpected for this kind of intervention i e a signal jump is expected when biofilm and solids are removed from the sensor note that the initial difference between the uv vis based nitrite value and the nitrite reference measurements has been caused by drift in the 9 months in between the calibration period and the start of this study 3 3 2 switch of influent source the change in influent composition fig 6 and 30 04 2018 blue dashed line induces a change in the sign of the drift rate from 1 1 to 0 4 mg n l d the ammonia and nitrate concentration in the reactor decrease from 2000 to 1300 mg n l in the first 15 days following the influent switch fig 6 2nd panel the controller reacted to the new lower concentrated influent and increased the hydraulic loading which is indicated by the decreased hydraulic residence time hrt from about 13 to 7 days fig 6 3rd panel furthermore also the control cycle length decreased from about 1 to 0 5 d fig 5 thus the controller was able to reject this disturbance and keep nitrite levels low at the same time the slave controller was still acting as intended and compensated the decreased specific ammonia load with an increased hydraulic loading 3 3 3 temperature experiment fig 7 shows the results of the temperature high experiment the first complete cycle shown in this figure starts on april 21st and illustrates the operation before the temperature change on april 22nd the controller sets the ph setpoint to 6 8 fig 7 2nd panel before the temperature increase is visible fig 7 3rd panel the nitrite concentration rises for some time fig 7 1st panel while the temperature increases also shortly after the controller decreases the ph setpoint while the temperature continues to increase however the nitrite signal remains at a high level around 15 mg n l relative to the cycle before the temperature change 30 mg n l nitrite reference measurements confirm that elevated nitrite concentrations are the cause for this difference in the signal which remain around 20 mg n l instead of around 5 mg n l as in the previous cycle this very small drop in nitrite compared to the peak concentration also leads to a delay in the identification of the inflection point fig 7 4th panel compared to the visual impression obtained by looking at the figure 1st panel the controller identified an inflection point only in the afternoon of april 24th an increase in ph at this time point would lead to an even higher accumulation of nitrite to ensure successful testing of the controller against other disturbances the controller is deactivated temporally cf grey area 2nd panel and the temperature setpoint is again decreased to 25 c the cooling of the bulk media leads to a decrease in the nitrite starting at midnight on the 25th at noon of the same day the nitrite signal and reference measurements drop to the levels reached in the first cycle figs 7 and 22nd and the controller is restarted shortly after thus the temperature high experiment indicated that fast temperature increases pose a threat to the proposed control system the temperature low experiment did not reveal any relevant finding with respect to the control performance the only notable change compared to the 25 c operation is the reduction in the peak nitrite concentration by about 5 mg n l 4 discussion this study proposes a new concept for a stabilizing control in the presence of signal drift and demonstrates its utility by means of an intensive measurement campaign in a laboratory scale reactor for urine nitrification the proposed control system avoids the effects of signal drift by using information in the first and second derivative to distinguish between stabilizing and destabilizing process conditions the results reveal that the controller successfully stabilised the nitrification process despite using a sensor signal that is drifting permanently importantly this could be achieved without redundant actuators or sensors and without a precise kinetic model of the process 4 1 system performance the end of cycle nitrite concentrations at the end of the control cycles were shown to decrease over time this may indicate an adaption of the nob to the elevated nitrite levels or could also be caused by the influent switch since steady state was not reached during the studied period one cannot determine with absolute certainty whether the reported decrease is caused by a net decay of the aob or a net growth of the nob since the average ph in the reactor is higher than in the conventional operation with a constantly safe but low ph this controller should theoretically also achieve higher nitrification rates udert and wächter 2012 however ph is only one among many factors influencing the nitrification rates bürgmann et al 2011 showed that long term exposure to nitrite could jeopardise the process while van hulle et al 2007 hypothesised that bacteria become more tolerant when exposed long enough to elevated nitrite concentrations consequently future research should be aimed at understanding long term reactor performance indicators in the presence of stabilizing control loops 4 2 unmeasured disturbances our study shows that fast introduction of unmeasured disturbances can threaten the suitability of the proposed trend based control concept to understand why this is the case one must note that the controller is based on the assumption that the appearance of an inflection point in the downward nitrite signal can only be explained by a change of from nob inhibiting to non inhibiting nitrite concentration levels to challenge this assumption as well as the control concept two confounding factors were disturbed on purpose temperature and influent composition the temperature high experiment indicates that unmeasured disturbances can make the proposed control system fail this is explained as an effect on the μaob to μnob ratio which increases with temperature indeed the fast temperature increase in the bulk media introduced the appearance of an inflection point however the assumption that the inflection point is solely caused by nob dynamics does not hold any longer and explains the wrongful control action while nitrite concentration does not yet reach the nob inhibiting region after one cycle the early increase of the ph setpoint induces an additional increase in the nitrite concentration such a higher concentration will likely inhibit the nob and activate a positive feedback loop between the nitrite concentration in turn inducing an increased risk of nob wash out in the long term the temperature high experiment did reveal another important condition for correct functioning of the controller the low amplitude of the signal fig 7 april 24th afternoon delays the identification of the inflection point this shows the need for sufficient excitement of the process and the signal to reach a large enough signal to noise ratio however increased excitation also increases the risk of irreversible process failure i e fig 1 exceed point b the influent switch experiment did not influence the observed signal profiles in a meaningful way as a result the controller was able to execute the right control actions in a timely manner throughout the course of this test there are two explanations for this first the model to derive the nitrite concentrations from the uv vis absorbance measurement is apparently quite robust against changes in the reactor media composition particularly large changes of the nitrate concentration fig 6 second the dynamics caused by the influent switch are driven by the hrt and decreased from 13 to 7 d thus this disturbance is much smoother than the temperature experiments which have a time window of 0 5 d 4 3 extension of controller the modifications applied to enable scs analysis in an online environment worked without any complications the main modification consisted of embedding the scs as a model selection tool in a moving horizon estimation framework with a fixed start point despite concerns about the computational costs by villez et al 2013 the three scs models could be fitted to the data within less than 3 s on an intel core i7 4970k 4 ghz processor thus conventionally available computational resources are expected to be sufficient for most biochemical process monitoring applications faster computations e g for fast processes or when dealing with high frequency data collection systems can be facilitated by increasing the knot distance of the spline functions if computational cost is no concern at all then the knot distance can be reduced to improve the fit of the applied scs models so far the controller makes the nitrite concentration oscillate around the optimal concentration for maximal μnob the upper setpoint has to ensure that nitrite is always accumulating to keep the signal informative the lower setpoint has to ensure net nitrite degradation to stabilise the process choosing the setpoints can be challenging and some disturbances may influence the system such that the chosen ph setpoints cannot push the process into the intended operational regions enabling the controller to decide how the two ph setpoints itself should be set would also facilitate process optimization one way to obtain a good ratio of the aob activity to the nob activity at both ph setpoints was revealed in the high temperature experiment the increased temperature leads to a relatively high aob rate at low ph this in turn resulted in slow net nitrite degradation producing a signal that is fairly flat when compared to the decreasing trend in the previous cycle thus the ph setpoints and consequently also the overall process performance were rather high for the given nob capacity potentially computing the ratio of the increasing and the decreasing slope in one cycle allows optimizing the ph setpoints and in turn the process performance for the next cycle furthermore using this kind of information would also help to reject additional disturbances without the need for additional instrumentation cf high temperature experiment 4 4 links to existing control theory the proposed controller is based largely on a conceptual model of substrate affinity and inhibition in nitrifying bacteria assuming that the nob activity and thus also the nitrite conversion rate has a unimodal shape with respect to the nitrite concentration one can expect to observe an inflection point whenever the process shifts from conditions dominated by nitrite inhibition to conditions dominated by nitrite limitation this information is key to avoid the need for any explicit correction of the signal drift since it is contained in the derivatives importantly the actions taken by the controller can also be interpreted as the execution of an online experiment to determine the nob kinetics microbial populations adapt over time and thus it is highly likely that the inhibition and affinity constants of these population change consequently a sensor signal without relevant drift as input would allow tracking the optimal concentration of nitrite for a maximal μnob this is also important with view on the many nitrification controllers equating nitrification with ammonia removal while nitrite oxidation is assumed to be completed simultaneously consequently single indicators such as ammonia concentration ph valley or our drop have been assumed informative enough to control the process åmand et al 2013 jaramillo et al 2018 thürlimann et al 2018 this is justifiable in some situations e g municipal wwtp however in certain situations analysis of both ammonia oxidation and nitrite oxidation is key for process stability and optimization partial nitritation anammox lotti et al 2012 or on site wwtp which can be limited by alkalinity are examples of this we speculate that the proposed control concept can be used whenever derivatives are informative about the concentration trend of a relevant substance the benefits of controllers executing online experiments to determine process states in continuously operated reactors are rarely studied in wastewater treatment steyer et al 1999 also deliberately induced process disturbances to gain information about the performance of an anaerobic reactor in contrast to the presented controller they compared the information against a simple model to determine the performance the intentional excitement or perturbation of a system also has a theoretical basis in the form of extremum seeking control esc liu and krstic 2012 both esc and the presented trend based controller are model free feedback controllers that purposely excite the system to gain information however esc requires an excitement frequency that is much lower than the dominant process frequency this is not the case here as the biomass growth dynamics hrt 13 d and the excitement frequency 1 d 1 appear in the same time scale trollberg et al 2014 found that the combination of a slow process and low excitement frequency as found in wastewater treatment make current forms of esc impractical they further stated that knowledge about the system behaviour close to the optimum is crucial to facilitate the use of esc using esc could however facilitate the inclusion of the ideas presented in section 4 3 thus esc may be helpful urine nitrification process optimization in addition to ensuring long term stability of the process 5 conclusion in this study a stabilizing controller for nitrification in high strength wastewater was developed and critically evaluated the controller successfully prevents the occurrence of destabilizing nitrite accumulation events in an alkalinity limited urine nitrification reactor for the entire test period of 72 days these are the main conclusions information contained in the derivatives of a drifting signal combined with qualitative knowledge about kinetics allowed for the control of an open loop unstable system without the need for drift rate estimation or correction systems without any dynamics due to input or operation can be excited deliberately in such a way that the signal derivatives contain the information of interest about the process states in this study the controller was designed to destabilise the nitrification such that the signal derivatives contain the necessary information about the process state in turn enabling stabilizing feedback control somewhat counter intuitively deliberate short term destabilization facilitates the assurance of long term process stability the controller is based on a conceptual model of the process this model currently excludes the effect of unmeasured disturbances other than the signal drift this constitutes the most sensitive component of our proposed controller whereas slow unmeasured disturbances were successfully rejected information in the controller input signal informing about fast unmeasured disturbances were identified and considered for inclusion

18501,characterization of microbial communities using high throughput amplicon sequencing is an emerging approach for microbial source tracking of fecal pollution this study used sourcetracker software to examine temporal and geographical variability of fecal bacterial community profiles to identify pollutant sources in three freshwater catchments in sub tropical australia fecal bacterial communities from 10 animal species humans and composite wastewater samples from six sewage treatment plants were characterized and compared to freshwater samples using illumina amplicon sequencing of the v5 v6 regions of the 16s rrna gene source contributions were calculated in sourcetracker using new fecal taxon libraries as well as previously generated libraries to determine the effects of geographic and temporal variability on source assignments sourcetracker determined 16s rrna bacterial communites within freshwater samples shared taxonomic similarities to that of wastewater at low levels typically 3 sourcetraker also predicted occasional fecal detection of deer and flying fox sources in the water samples no significant differences in source contributions were observed within sequences from current and previously characterized fecal samples p 0 107 however significant differences were observed between previously characterized and newly characterized source communities anosim p 0 001 which shared 15 community composition results suggest temporal instability of fecal taxon libraries among tested sources and highlight continual evaluation of community based mst using confirmatory qpcr analyses of marker genes graphical abstract image 1 keywords amplicon sequencing 16s rrna microbial source tracking wastewater sourcetracker 1 introduction fecal contamination of surface waters is recognized as one of the leading causes of degradation of water quality worldwide mallin et al 2000 handler et al 2006 huang et al 2015 contaminants may derive from multiple point and nonpoint sources including urban run off wastewater discharge feces of wild and domestic animals and storm water runoff ahmed et al 2017 dubinsky et al 2016 henry et al 2016 kirs et al 2017 whilst chemical contamination of surface waters such as disinfectants pesticides nutrients solvents pharmaceuticals and heavy metals pose a risk to public health and safety exposure to water polluted with feces presents the greatest risk to acute human disease soller et al 2010 schwarzenbach et al 2010 gros et al 2009 burant et al 2018 topaz et al 2018 human fecal contamination of surface waters by direct defecation or via wastewater treatment plants discharge or sewer overflows may contain human specific pathogens although certain animals such as livestock and carnivores also harbor human associated pathogens cleaveland et al 2001 of these potential contaminant sources wastewater contamination poses the greatest risk to human health in large part due to the presence of enteric viruses soller et al 2010 determining the source s of the fecal pollution will not only predict the associated health risks of a water body and track disease it contributes to more targeted remediation strategies for water managers benham et al 2011 staley et al 2018 the efficacy of mst to detect the source of fecal pollution in environmental waters is often related to factors that control the fate and concentration of fecal bacteria bordalo et al 2002 factors such as land based surface runoff following a heavy rainfall especially in tropical and subtropical regions where unexpected weather events are common can affect the outcome of the mst investigation converse et al 2011 neave et al 2014 toledo hernandez et al 2013 investigated the sources of fecal pollution in a tropical watershed using host specific assays developed in temperate regions these researchers concluded that the geographic stability of genetic markers needs to be determined prior to conducting mst studies in tropical settings the use of fecal indicator bacteria as mst tools in such environments have been questioned in some studies for instance in a study designed to capture spatial and temporal variation in e coli concentrations in a coastal waterway within a subtropical region found that use of e coli as a suitable indicator of water quality can be challenging solo gabriele et al 2000 over the past decade molecular methods using host specific bacterial gene markers have been developed assessed and used to detect human and animal fecal contamination in the environments the most current and commonly used method of host specific bacterial gene markers bases on qpcr detection of the 16s rrna gene of human associated bacteroidales hf183 bernhard and field 2000 gómez doñate et al 2016 these methodological approaches are generally limited to screening one host source at a time more recently community based microbial source tracking mst approaches have been introduced that utilize high throughput sequencing technologies hts such as amplicon based 16s rrna ahmed et al 2015 beale et al 2017 using hts together with computational biology software has the potential to characterize the entire microbial composition of a broad range of potential host fecal sources and then evaluate their contribution and proportion within waterways almeida et al 2018 alcon giner et al 2017 sourcetracker applies a bayesian framework to quantify multiple sources present at low abundances in communities in environments receiving fecal contamination henry et al 2016 furthermore the inclusion of an unknown source category using this approach was hypothesized to improve accuracy in overall source assignments brown et al 2017 staley et al 2018 sourcetracker has previously been evaluated in field studies and validated against hydrodynamic modelling of source contamination mccarthy et al 2017 as well as in vitro constructed source mixtures brown et al 2017 henry et al 2016 staley et al 2018 the program performed with high accuracy sensitivity and specificity using default parameters however studies have also noted that source assignments with high relative standard deviations i e greater variability in quantitation across technical replicates had lower confidence staley et al 2018 and these more variable sources were detected at minor abundances 10 inconsistencies have also been noted when results are compared to those obtained using qpcr assays for the well established human associated bacteroides hf183 marker as well as markers for avian and cattle fecal contamination ahmed et al 2015 in this study we examined the potential application of amplicon based next generation dna sequencing and sourcetracker software to determine the sources of fecal pollution and their relative contributions in three catchment areas within the south east queensland seq region of australia to further evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of these libraries on the sink assignments in this context a sink refers to a composite of water samples collected from each site within each catchment we developed a new local source library comprised of 11 host groups and untreated wastewater from six sewage treatment plants stps in the seq region sourcetracker prediction results were compared against a full library comprised of sequence data from this study and our previous studies ahmed et al 2015 staley et al 2018 we hypothesized that the inclusion of additional data from the full library would not significantly impact source predictions but that the inclusion of newly characterized samples would increase predicted input allocations for these sources results of this work expand our understanding of the temporal variability of fecal taxon libraries and provide valuable information to leverage this technology for future mst studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 animal and human fecal sample collection fresh individual animal fecal samples n 300 were collected from ten animal species within the seq region of australia between october 2016 and april 2018 samples were collected within a 100 km radius of three catchments areas the north pine np canungra cc and maleny mc catchments the animal species sampled included sheep ovis aries horse equus caballus dog canis lupus familiaris chicken gallus domesticus eastern grey kangaroo macropus giganteus deer odocoileus virginianus pig sus scrofa cattle bos taurus flying fox pteropus spp and parrot psittacines spp all samples were collected aseptically from the ground as described previously and the sampling procedure was approved by the university of the sunshine coast usc animal ethics committee an a 17 117 all terrestrial animal fecal samples were collected immediately after defecation from the center of the sample where the moisture content was highest ahmed o dea et al 2019 flying fox and parrot fecal samples were collected by placing a large plastic sheet under roosting areas as previously used hernández dávila et al 2015 plastic sheets were laid out at dawn to coincide with the flying foxes return to their roost site individual scats were collected separately at the time of defecation and placed in individual sterile containers in addition 26 healthy human fecal samples were collected between january and april 2018 from male and female participants between 20 and 64 years of age median age 29 years approved by the usc human ethics committee s 17 1122 six untreated wastewater samples were also collected from the influent of six stps within sampled catchments all fecal and wastewater samples were transported on ice to the laboratory and processed within 6 h after collection 2 2 catchment water sampling water samples were also collected from three catchments within seq regions cc mc and npc with an average of 50 km length per catchment within each catchment three sites were selected for sampling fig 1 to ensure the water samples represent each site 10 transect samples per site 500 ml each were collected from a stretch of 200 m upstream and downstream of each of the three sites per catchment in all 90 water samples were collected in sterile bottles from a depth of 30 cm below the water surface transported to the laboratory on ice and filtered through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose membranes millipore tokyo japan the catchments and sampling sites were identified by the regional water authority as sites that required assessment 2 3 dna extraction dna was extracted from most individual animal fecal samples using the qiaamp power fecal dna kit qiagen valencia ca usa according to manufacturer s instructions dna was eluted to a final volume of 150 μl in elution buffer c6 flying fox fecal samples were extracted using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit qiagen according to manufacturer s instructions with an additional bead beating step after addition of asl buffer tubes were incubated at 65 c for 10 min and vortexed using a bio fastprep 24 vortex mp biomedicals santa ana california usa for 45 s hart et al 2015 dna was extracted from raw wastewater and water samples using the qiaamp power soil dna kit qiagen as per the manufacturer s protocol the quality and quantity of each dna sample was determined by nanodrop thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa analysis a 260 280 ratio of 2 0 0 2 together with a minimum of 20 ng μl dna concentration was employed to select samples for further sequence analysis of the 30 fecal samples from each animal species six composite dna samples were prepared for sequencing by mixing equal amounts of dna from five individual animals six composites per animal source without individual overlap between composites human samples were prepared for sequencing as either individual samples n 3 or composites of two samples n 3 three samples n 3 or four samples n 3 12 samples altogether each pooled sample contained an equal concentration of dna from individual fecal samples dna from three sites of each catchment ten samples from each site was extracted from the filters using a lysing buffer of the extraction kit and pooled into three composite samples by mixing equal concentration of dna of ten individual water samples from each site yielding a total of nine composite water samples from three catchments 2 4 pcr amplification and illumina sequencing amplicon sequencing was performed by the university of minnesota genomics center http genomics umn edu using standard workflows and qc program briefly 784f 5 rgg att aga tac cc 3 and 1064r 5 cga crr cca tgc anc acc t 3 primers were used to amplify the v5

conditions 95 c for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 98 c for 20 s 55 c for 15 s and 72 c for 1 min then the illumina adapter and barcode sequences were added with an additional ten cycle pcr using the dual index method gohl et al 2016 amplicons were gel purified pooled and paired end sequenced at a read length of 300 nt on the illumina miseq platform illumnia inc san diego ca usa negative sterile water controls were included for the amplification and sequencing procedures these negative controls did not produce any amplicon products or sequence reads raw sequencing data from newly collected samples were deposited in the sequence read archive sra of ncbi under accession number srp156322 2 5 bioinformatics all sequence data were processed using mothur ver 1 34 0 schloss et al 2009 low quality regions at the 3 ends of sequence reads were removed sequences were paired end joined using fastq join aronesty 2013 and were quality trimmed using the following criteria an average quality scores of 35 over a window of 50 nt homopolymers of 8 nt no ambiguous bases and 2 mismatches to primer sequences ahmed et al 2017 high quality sequence reads were aligned using the silva database ver 132 pruesse et al 2007 and subjected to a 2 pre cluster step to remove likely sequence errors huse et al 2010 uchime software ver 4 2 40 was used to identify and remove chimeric sequence reads edgar et al 2011 for unbiased statistical comparison the numbers of sequences for all samples were rarefied to 10 000 sequences per sample by random sub sampling gihring et al 2012 operational taxonomic units otus were binned at 97 sequence similarity using complete linkage clustering and taxonomic classification was done using the ribosomal database project rdp release version 14 cole et al 2009 2 6 fecal taxon libraries and sourcetracker configuration to evaluate the temporal stability as well as the effect of the library composition on sourcetracker source allocations to freshwater samples two source libraries were used in this study i a new local source library assembled in this study from seq catchments and ii the full library comprised of the new sources as well as previously described sources from australia and usa ahmed et al 2015 staley et al 2018 the previously described source library was comprised of fecal dna samples from dogs horses kangaroos and wastewater collected from seq between 2014 and 2016 sourcetracker ver 0 9 8 was used with default parameters knights et al 2011 and analyses were performed for individual sources to compare results between libraries in addition microbial community compositions from animals including humans were grouped into broader categories based on their typical habitats these included martin laurent et al 2001 1797 agricultural animals chickens horses and pigs domestic dogs humans and wastewater ruminants cattle deer and sheep wildlife flying foxes kangaroos and parrots and freshwater samples when compared against the full library cats were included in the domestic category and beavers birds canadian geese gulls possums rabbits and turkeys were included in the wildlife category 2 7 statistical analyses bacterial alpha and beta diversities and ordination were calculated and analyzed using mothur briefly alpha diversity was calculated as the estimated good s coverage shannon index and chao1 estimate of richness linear discriminant analysis lda of effect size lefse was performed to determine otus that differed significantly among source categories segata et al 2011 and these otus were classified to genera for clarity analysis of similarity anosim was used to evaluate differences among bacterial communities clarke 1993 using bray curtis dissimilarity matrices bray and curtis 1957 ordination of bray curtis distances was done using principal coordinate analysis pcoa anderson and willis 2003 the corr axes command in mothur was used to determine significant correlations e g spearman correlation between relative abundances of genera and ordination position for simplicity in presentation genera are presented as those most abundant for each source category analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s post hoc test was used to compare the differences of alpha diversity among samples and to evaluate differences in source assignments using xlstat ver 19 03 spearman correlations relating source allocations were also calculated in xlstat all statistics were evaluated using α 0 05 with bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons 3 results 3 1 alpha diversity after quality filtering 75 samples from the current dataset could be rarefied to 10 000 reads per sample table 1 yielding a mean estimated good s coverage of 95 7 4 1 significantly greater alpha diversity measured by the shannon index was observed among samples in the broader ruminant category relative to others post hoc p 0 027 agricultural and water samples had intermediate diversity while samples grouped to the wildlife and domestic categories had significantly lower shannon indices than those of the ruminant and agricultural groups p 0 009 similarly ruminant and water samples had significantly greater chao1 richness than domestic samples p 0 0001 and 0 047 respectively with other groups observed to have intermediate richness notably among the specific hosts or sites within the broader categories significant differences in alpha diversity were only observed among water samples where greater chao1 richness was observed in samples from np relative to cc p 0 046 3 2 source community composition the predominant genera among sources and the broader source categories varied considerably fig 2 supplemental figure s1 among agricultural sources bacterial community composition was significantly different for each host animal anosim r 1 00 p 0 011 for pairwise comparisons chicken and pig fecal communities were predominantly comprised of taxa that showed significant differences in abundance among sources with chicken fecal communities composed of greater relative abundances of lactobacillus anaerosporobacter and lysinibacullis and pig communities with greater abundances of alloprevotella prevotella and treponema genera fig 2a several less abundant genera including megamonas and pseudomonas were also significantly correlated with ordination position and were present at greater abundances in horse fecal communities based on similar ordination position fig 3 a bacterial communities among domestic sources also differed by host type anosim r 0 91 p 0 011 dog communities were comprised nearly entirely x 87 7 of taxa that showed significantly different abundances than those found in human feces or wastewater fig 2b and were characterized by greater relative abundances of members of the genera prevotella bacteroides fusobacterium and megamonas figs 2b and 3b in contrast human fecal communities had greater relative abundances of fecalibacterium and parabacteroides while wastewater was characterized by greater abundances of arcobacterium and pseudomonas distinct community compositions were also observed among ruminant fecal sources anosim r 0 89 p 0 004 although similar genera including mucinivorans and lysinibacillus were observed for each host type fig 2c these results indicate that species or strain level differences within these genera differ among host types moreover ordination analysis revealed greater associations of these genera as well as dehalobacter and clostridium clade iv with sheep fecal communities based on similar ordination position fig 3c wildlife sources were poorly differentiated and did not differ significantly by anosim r 0 30 p 0 044 0 121 at bonferroni corrected α 0 017 communities from flying foxes were more distinct than those from kangaroos or parrots and were comprised of greater abundances of taxa within the genus actinobacillus fig 2d greater relative abundance of members of the genus lactobacillus was associated with parrot fecal samples by ordination fig 3d while greater abundances of akkermansia bacteroides and lysinibacillus were associated with kangaroo fecal samples 3 3 sourcetracker freshwater results by use of fecal sources collected in this current study bacterial signatures resembling that akin to wastewater was found to represent low levels of water contamination 2 of sequence reads in the bacterial communities of mc and np samples and low levels 0 5 in cc table 2 deer and flying fox represented more significant amounts of fecal pollution in one composite each from np flying fox and kangaroo were observed in one composite each from cc and parrot fecal contamination was also observed in one composite from cc all other sources were infrequently detected and had very low contributions to overall contamination interestingly when samples were binned to broader categories table 3 a small quantity of wildlife contamination was estimated in cc and mc samples but contributions from the domestic category which included wastewater were estimated to have very low 0 1 contribution to the freshwater bacterial communities in contrast no significant differences in sink predictions were observed among all freshwater samples anova p 0 108 table 2 when sourcetracker was used to analyze the full library including both source communities collected in this study as well as those previously characterized notably one external source in the full library canadian geese was predicted to have a small 5 contribution to communities in the cc samples when sources were grouped into broader categories there were also no significant differences in sink assignments p 0 107 however increased allocation of domestic and wildlife sources was observed to further investigate the potential cause s for these discrepancies correlation analyses relating the percentage of individual sources to the allocation assigned the broader category were performed when using the library created in this study alone no correlations were observed between sink contributions from individual sources or those from their respective broader categories however when the full library was considered the contribution from flying fox was strongly and negatively correlated with that from wildlife in general spearman s ρ 0 888 p 0 005 moreover the contribution from wastewater was strongly positively correlated with that from the broader domestic category ρ 0 930 p 0 002 3 4 temporal stability of fecal taxa libraries four sources including dog horse kangaroo and wastewater were previously characterized as potential sources from seq and were again sampled in this study for each source the bacterial community composition of the newly collected material differed significantly from that collected previously anosim r 1 00 p 0 001 for all sources fig s2 to assess the effect of temporal variability among these sources on sourcetracker sink predictions reciprocal analyses were done treating the new and old communities from these hosts as sources and sinks fig 4 when the new sources were tested as sinks all showed low similarity 85 of community composition to the previously characterized sources dog samples showed significantly greater similarity 11 3 8 30 than other sources a comparable degree of similarity was observed when the new local sources were tested as sources except for horse in which significantly greater similarity was observed anova p 0 002 4 discussion low levels of fecal contamination were detected in each composite water sample evaluated with deer and flying foxes found to represent more prominent sources in several samples we further evaluated sink assignments using our larger library of samples collected from throughout the usa and australia and found that the inclusion of extraneous sources as well as additional sources from varying geographic regions minimally impacted sourcetracker sink predictions similar to our recent report using known source mesocosms brown et al 2018 prior source tracking studies employing next generation sequencing have suggested that many taxa may be host associated rather than host specific mclellan and eren 2014 roguet et al 2018 similarly we previously suggested that categorizing sources to broader categories may improve the transmissibility of next generation fecal taxon libraries staley et al 2018 results of the present study however revealed discrepancies in source assignments using this approach we hypothesized that using the full library would increase predicted source contributions however use of the full library resulted in a greater allocation of communities to flying fox and lower allocation to wastewater as well as a prediction of goose fecal contribution in contrast the broad category assessment showed increased domestic contamination which includes wastewater in samples where greater levels of wastewater contamination using the new i e local library were observed moreover the wildlife contribution using the full library was similar to the contamination allocated to canadian geese which were included in this category greater allocation to flying fox may reflect a better ability to distinguish this individual source using more source types and samples since the community composition did not vary significantly in the new local library furthermore bacterial wastewater signatures in the new local library may have been overshadowed by individual humans in the domestic category but could be more clearly distinguished when additional wastewater samples from the previous study were included however since additional validation e g quantitative pcr assays of genetic markers were not performed an independent accurate characterization of the magnitude of fecal contamination was not possible highlighting the necessity of using toolbox approaches to validate emerging methods ahmed et al 2015 additionally using a uniform number of sources may improve sourcetracker accuracy when the numbers of individuals are low as has been previously shown henry et al 2016 sun et al 2017 in addition a minimum number of individuals within each source type are needed for accurate source assignments brown et al 2017 importantly this is the first study to evaluate the temporal stability of fecal taxon libraries using sourcetracker among the four previously characterized sources for which new samples were collected dog samples showed the greatest temporal stability with approximately 10 15 similarity between new and old sources this may be due to a more cosmopolitan intestinal microbiome among dogs that gives a relatively low specificity to detect seeded dog fecal samples boehm et al 2013 significantly greater similarity was observed when new horse fecal communities were treated as sources rather than sinks these data may reflect an advantage of using composite samples for some animals to better capture microbial diversity with decreased sequencing effort however the degree of disparity between samples is not surprising although the sequencing method was conserved different dna extraction kits were used previously to characterize the fecal communities than those used here ahmed et al 2015 however it was previously reported that dna extraction methods did not significantly impact microbial community composition in freshwater samples staley et al 2015 and some overlap was observed among wastewater samples collected at separate times previous reports of dna extraction techniques on soil bacteria using various extraction methods also displayed little variance when comparing microbial community composition fouhy et al 2016 de lipthay et al 2004 martin laurent et al 2001 yuan et al 2012 several factors impact the microbial community composition of surface waters in subtropical regions of south east queensland it is possible that seasonal variability in the microbiomes of some animals may affect the composition of environmental waters affecting the efficacy of community based mst approaches davenport et al 2014 garcía armisen et al 2014 smits et al 2017 other factors such as food or dietary changes may also be involved however this supposition was beyond the scope of the current investigation we recently evaluated the efficacy of sourcetracker software to attribute contamination from a variety of fecal sources spiked into ambient freshwater samples staley et al 2018 the inclusion of local sources was found to be necessary for accurate source assignments which could not be made using non local sources alone however combining local and non local sources did not significantly affect sink fecal sources contributions p 0 79 similar results were recently reported by brown et al 2018 moreover the sink predictions were positively correlated with the spiked source volumes staley et al 2018 to observe the possible regional differences in microbial composition of the same animal species composite samples were prepared by using equal amounts of dna extracted individually from five animals within the same residing habitat this resulted in six composite samples from the same animal species from six different sites within a 200 km diameter within the south east queensland region the results indicated that whilst certain genera were more abundant in some animal species there were very little differences in fecal microbial composition of composite samples sourcetracker has also been shown to correlate well with hydrologic modelling mccarthy et al 2017 and provide accurate and perhaps relatively quantitative identification of known source seeded samples when local sources are included in the source library henry et al 2016 brown et al 2018 staley et al 2018 however we previously showed that this community based mst method suffers from the same geographic inconsistencies common to many library based mst methods staley et al 2018 here we again report a similar limitation in temporal stability of source libraries moreover standardized practices for dna extraction and sequencing as are being implemented by consortia such as the earth microbiome project gilbert et al 2014 2018 have yet to be applied to the field of mst making inter laboratory sharing of data difficult 5 conclusion sourcetracker is a useful tool to detect low levels bacterial signatures of wastewater in a studied catchment 16s rrna community analysis of any catchments should focus on using composite water samples to obtain a realistic snap shot of fecal pollution by a target species increased allocation of domestic and wildlife sources within a catchment may underpin the importance of agricultural sources of water contamination temporal instability of fecal taxon libraries among tested

18501,characterization of microbial communities using high throughput amplicon sequencing is an emerging approach for microbial source tracking of fecal pollution this study used sourcetracker software to examine temporal and geographical variability of fecal bacterial community profiles to identify pollutant sources in three freshwater catchments in sub tropical australia fecal bacterial communities from 10 animal species humans and composite wastewater samples from six sewage treatment plants were characterized and compared to freshwater samples using illumina amplicon sequencing of the v5 v6 regions of the 16s rrna gene source contributions were calculated in sourcetracker using new fecal taxon libraries as well as previously generated libraries to determine the effects of

surface waters is recognized as one of the leading causes of degradation of water quality worldwide mallin et al 2000 handler et al 2006 huang et al 2015 contaminants may derive from multiple point and nonpoint sources including urban run off wastewater discharge feces of wild and domestic animals and storm water runoff ahmed et al 2017 dubinsky et al 2016 henry et al 2016 kirs et al 2017 whilst chemical contamination of surface waters such as disinfectants pesticides nutrients solvents pharmaceuticals and heavy metals pose a risk to public health and safety exposure to water polluted with feces presents the greatest risk to acute human disease soller et al 2010 schwarzenbach et al 2010 gros et al 2009 burant et al 2018 topaz et al 2018 human fecal contamination of surface waters by direct defecation or via wastewater treatment plants discharge or sewer overflows may contain human specific pathogens although certain animals such as livestock and carnivores also harbor human associated pathogens cleaveland et al 2001 of these potential contaminant sources wastewater contamination poses the greatest risk to human health in large part due to the presence of enteric viruses soller et al 2010 determining the source s of the fecal pollution will not only predict the associated health risks of a water body and track disease it contributes to more targeted remediation strategies for water managers benham et al 2011 staley et al 2018 the efficacy of mst to detect the source of fecal pollution in environmental waters is often related to factors that control the fate and concentration of fecal bacteria bordalo et al 2002 factors such as land based surface runoff following a heavy rainfall especially in tropical and subtropical regions where unexpected weather events are common can affect the outcome of the mst investigation converse et al 2011 neave et al 2014 toledo hernandez et al 2013 investigated the sources of fecal pollution in a tropical watershed using host specific assays developed in temperate regions these researchers concluded that the geographic stability of genetic markers needs to be determined prior to conducting mst studies in tropical settings the use of fecal indicator bacteria as mst tools in such environments have been questioned in some studies for instance in a study designed to capture spatial and temporal variation in e coli concentrations in a coastal waterway within a subtropical region found that use of e coli as a suitable indicator of water quality can be challenging solo gabriele et al 2000 over the past decade molecular methods using host specific bacterial gene markers have been developed assessed and used to detect human and animal fecal contamination in the environments the most current and commonly used method of host specific bacterial gene markers bases on qpcr detection of the 16s rrna gene of human associated bacteroidales hf183 bernhard and field 2000 gómez doñate et al 2016 these methodological approaches are generally limited to screening one host source at a time more recently community based microbial source tracking mst approaches have been introduced that utilize high throughput sequencing technologies hts such as amplicon based 16s rrna ahmed et al 2015 beale et al 2017 using hts together with computational biology software has the potential to characterize the entire microbial composition of a broad range of potential host fecal sources and then evaluate their contribution and proportion within waterways almeida et al 2018 alcon giner et al 2017 sourcetracker applies a bayesian framework to quantify multiple sources present at low abundances in communities in environments receiving fecal contamination henry et al 2016 furthermore the inclusion of an unknown source category using this approach was hypothesized to improve accuracy in overall source assignments brown et al 2017 staley et al 2018 sourcetracker has previously been evaluated in field studies and validated against hydrodynamic modelling of source contamination mccarthy et al 2017 as well as in vitro constructed source mixtures brown et al 2017 henry et al 2016 staley et al 2018 the program performed with high accuracy sensitivity and specificity using default parameters however studies have also noted that source assignments with high relative standard deviations i e greater variability in quantitation across technical replicates had lower confidence staley et al 2018 and these more variable sources were detected at minor abundances 10 inconsistencies have also been noted when results are compared to those obtained using qpcr assays for the well established human associated bacteroides hf183 marker as well as markers for avian and cattle fecal contamination ahmed et al 2015 in this study we examined the potential application of amplicon based next generation dna sequencing and sourcetracker software to determine the sources of fecal pollution and their relative contributions in three catchment areas within the south east queensland seq region of australia to further evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of these libraries on the sink assignments in this context a sink refers to a composite of water samples collected from each site within each catchment we developed a new local source library comprised of 11 host groups and untreated wastewater from six sewage treatment plants stps in the seq region sourcetracker prediction results were compared against a full library comprised of sequence data from this study and our previous studies ahmed et al 2015 staley et al 2018 we hypothesized that the inclusion of additional data from the full library would not significantly impact source predictions but that the inclusion of newly characterized samples would increase predicted input allocations for these sources results of this work expand our understanding of the temporal variability of fecal taxon libraries and provide valuable information to leverage this technology for future mst studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 animal and human fecal sample collection fresh individual animal fecal samples n 300 were collected from ten animal species within the seq region of australia between october 2016 and april 2018 samples were collected within a 100 km radius of three catchments areas the north pine np canungra cc and maleny mc catchments the animal species sampled included sheep ovis aries horse equus caballus dog canis lupus familiaris chicken gallus domesticus eastern grey kangaroo macropus giganteus deer odocoileus virginianus pig sus scrofa cattle bos taurus flying fox pteropus spp and parrot psittacines spp all samples were collected aseptically from the ground as described previously and the sampling procedure was approved by the university of the sunshine coast usc animal ethics committee an a 17 117 all terrestrial animal fecal samples were collected immediately after defecation from the center of the sample where the moisture content was highest ahmed o dea et al 2019 flying fox and parrot fecal samples were collected by placing a large plastic sheet under roosting areas as previously used hernández dávila et al 2015 plastic sheets were laid out at dawn to coincide with the flying foxes return to their roost site individual scats were collected separately at the time of defecation and placed in individual sterile containers in addition 26 healthy human fecal samples were collected between january and april 2018 from male and female participants between 20 and 64 years of age median age 29 years approved by the usc human ethics committee s 17 1122 six untreated wastewater samples were also collected from the influent of six stps within sampled catchments all fecal and wastewater samples were transported on ice to the laboratory and processed within 6 h after collection 2 2 catchment water sampling water samples were also collected from three catchments within seq regions cc mc and npc with an average of 50 km length per catchment within each catchment three sites were selected for sampling fig 1 to ensure the water samples represent each site 10 transect samples per site 500 ml each were collected from a stretch of 200 m upstream and downstream of each of the three sites per catchment in all 90 water samples were collected in sterile bottles from a depth of 30 cm below the water surface transported to the laboratory on ice and filtered through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose membranes millipore tokyo japan the catchments and sampling sites were identified by the regional water authority as sites that required assessment 2 3 dna extraction dna was extracted from most individual animal fecal samples using the qiaamp power fecal dna kit qiagen valencia ca usa according to manufacturer s instructions dna was eluted to a final volume of 150 μl in elution buffer c6 flying fox fecal samples were extracted using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit qiagen according to manufacturer s instructions with an additional bead beating step after addition of asl buffer tubes were incubated at 65 c for 10 min and vortexed using a bio fastprep 24 vortex mp biomedicals santa ana california usa for 45 s hart et al 2015 dna was extracted from raw wastewater and water samples using the qiaamp power soil dna kit qiagen as per the manufacturer s protocol the quality and quantity of each dna sample was determined by nanodrop thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa analysis a 260 280 ratio of 2 0 0 2 together with a minimum of 20 ng μl dna concentration was employed to select samples for further sequence analysis of the 30 fecal samples from each animal species six composite dna samples were prepared for sequencing by mixing equal amounts of dna from five individual animals six composites per animal source without individual overlap between composites human samples were prepared for sequencing as either individual samples n 3 or composites of two samples n 3 three samples n 3 or four samples n 3 12 samples altogether each pooled sample contained an equal concentration of dna from individual fecal samples dna from three sites of each catchment ten samples from each site was extracted from the filters using a lysing buffer of the extraction kit and pooled into three composite samples by mixing equal concentration of dna of ten individual water samples from each site yielding a total of nine composite water samples from three catchments 2 4 pcr amplification and illumina sequencing amplicon sequencing was performed by the university of minnesota genomics center http genomics umn edu using standard workflows and qc program briefly 784f 5 rgg att aga tac cc 3 and 1064r 5 cga crr cca tgc anc acc t 3 primers were used to amplify the v5 v6 hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna gene claesson et al 2010 kapa hifidelity hot start polymerase was used for pcr amplification samples were first amplified using the following cycling conditions 95 c for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 98 c for 20 s 55 c for 15 s and 72 c for 1 min then the illumina adapter and barcode sequences were added with an additional ten cycle pcr using the dual index method gohl et al 2016 amplicons were gel purified pooled and paired end sequenced at a read length of 300 nt on the illumina miseq platform illumnia inc san diego ca usa negative sterile water controls were included for the amplification and sequencing procedures these negative controls did not produce any amplicon products or sequence reads raw sequencing data from newly collected samples were deposited in the sequence read archive sra of ncbi under accession number srp156322 2 5 bioinformatics all sequence data were processed using mothur ver 1 34 0 schloss et al 2009 low quality regions at the 3 ends of sequence reads were removed sequences were paired end joined using fastq join aronesty 2013 and were quality trimmed using the following criteria an average quality scores of 35 over a window of 50 nt homopolymers of 8 nt no ambiguous bases and 2 mismatches to primer sequences ahmed et al 2017 high quality sequence reads were aligned using the silva database ver 132 pruesse et al 2007 and subjected to a 2 pre cluster step to remove likely sequence errors huse et al 2010 uchime software ver 4 2 40 was used to identify and remove chimeric sequence reads edgar et al 2011 for unbiased statistical comparison the numbers of sequences for all samples were rarefied to 10 000 sequences per sample by random sub sampling gihring et al 2012 operational taxonomic units otus were binned at 97 sequence similarity using complete linkage clustering and taxonomic classification was done using the ribosomal database project rdp release version 14 cole et al 2009 2 6 fecal taxon libraries and sourcetracker configuration to evaluate the temporal stability as well as the effect of the library composition on sourcetracker source allocations to freshwater samples two source libraries were used in this study i a new local source library assembled in this study from seq catchments and ii the full library comprised of the new sources as well as previously described sources from australia and usa ahmed et al 2015 staley et al 2018 the previously described source library was comprised of fecal dna samples from dogs horses kangaroos and wastewater collected from seq between 2014 and 2016 sourcetracker ver 0 9 8 was used with default parameters knights et al 2011 and analyses were performed for individual sources to compare results between libraries in addition microbial community compositions from animals including humans were grouped into broader categories based on their typical habitats these included martin laurent et al 2001 1797 agricultural animals chickens horses and pigs domestic dogs humans and wastewater ruminants cattle deer and sheep wildlife flying foxes kangaroos and parrots and freshwater samples when compared against the full library cats were included in the domestic category and beavers birds canadian geese gulls possums rabbits and turkeys were included in the wildlife category 2 7 statistical analyses bacterial alpha and beta diversities and ordination were calculated and analyzed using mothur briefly alpha diversity was calculated as the estimated good s coverage shannon index and chao1 estimate of richness linear discriminant analysis lda of effect size lefse was performed to determine otus that differed significantly among source categories segata et al 2011 and these otus were classified to genera for clarity analysis of similarity anosim was used to evaluate differences among bacterial communities clarke 1993 using bray curtis dissimilarity matrices bray and curtis 1957 ordination of bray curtis distances was done using principal coordinate analysis pcoa anderson and willis 2003 the corr axes command in mothur was used to determine significant correlations e g spearman correlation between relative abundances of genera and ordination position for simplicity in presentation genera are presented as those most abundant for each source category analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s post hoc test was used to compare the differences of alpha diversity among samples and to evaluate differences in source assignments using xlstat ver 19 03 spearman correlations relating source allocations were also calculated in xlstat all statistics were evaluated using α 0 05 with bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons 3 results 3 1 alpha diversity after quality filtering 75 samples from the current dataset could be rarefied to 10 000 reads per sample table 1 yielding a mean estimated good s coverage of 95 7 4 1 significantly greater alpha diversity measured by the shannon index was observed among samples in the broader ruminant category relative to others post hoc p 0 027 agricultural and water samples had intermediate diversity while samples grouped to the wildlife and domestic categories had significantly lower shannon indices than those of the ruminant and agricultural groups p 0 009 similarly ruminant and water samples had significantly greater chao1 richness than domestic samples p 0 0001 and 0 047 respectively with other groups observed to have intermediate richness notably among the specific hosts or sites within the broader categories significant differences in alpha diversity were only observed among water samples where greater chao1 richness was observed in samples from np relative to cc p 0 046 3 2 source community composition the predominant genera among sources and the broader source categories varied considerably fig 2 supplemental figure s1 among agricultural sources bacterial community composition was significantly different for each host animal anosim r 1 00 p 0 011 for pairwise comparisons chicken and pig fecal communities were predominantly comprised of taxa that showed significant differences in abundance among sources with chicken fecal communities composed of greater relative abundances of lactobacillus anaerosporobacter and lysinibacullis and pig communities with greater abundances of alloprevotella prevotella and treponema genera fig 2a several less abundant genera including megamonas and pseudomonas were also significantly correlated with ordination position and were present at greater abundances in horse fecal communities based on similar ordination position fig 3 a bacterial communities among domestic sources also differed by host type anosim r 0 91 p 0 011 dog communities were comprised nearly entirely x 87 7 of taxa that showed significantly different abundances than those found in human feces or wastewater fig 2b and were characterized by greater relative abundances of members of the genera prevotella bacteroides fusobacterium and megamonas figs 2b and 3b in contrast human fecal communities had greater relative abundances of fecalibacterium and parabacteroides while wastewater was characterized by greater abundances of arcobacterium and pseudomonas distinct community compositions were also observed among ruminant fecal sources anosim r 0 89 p 0 004 although similar genera including mucinivorans and lysinibacillus were observed for each host type fig 2c these results indicate that species or strain level differences within these genera differ among host types moreover ordination analysis revealed greater associations of these genera as well as dehalobacter and clostridium clade iv with sheep fecal communities based on similar ordination position fig 3c wildlife sources were poorly differentiated and did not differ significantly by anosim r 0 30 p 0 044 0 121 at bonferroni corrected α 0 017 communities from flying foxes were more distinct than those from kangaroos or parrots and were comprised of greater abundances of taxa within the genus actinobacillus fig 2d greater relative abundance of members of the genus lactobacillus was associated with parrot fecal samples by ordination fig 3d while greater abundances of akkermansia bacteroides and lysinibacillus were associated with kangaroo fecal samples 3 3 sourcetracker freshwater results by use of fecal sources collected in this current study bacterial signatures resembling that akin to wastewater was found to represent low levels of water contamination 2 of sequence reads in the bacterial communities of mc and np samples and low levels 0 5 in cc table 2 deer and flying fox represented more significant amounts of fecal pollution in one composite each from np flying fox and kangaroo were observed in one composite each from cc and parrot fecal contamination was also observed in one composite from cc all other sources were infrequently detected and had very low contributions to overall contamination interestingly when samples were binned to broader categories table 3 a small quantity of wildlife contamination was estimated in cc and mc samples but contributions from the domestic category which included wastewater were estimated to have very low 0 1 contribution to the freshwater bacterial communities in contrast no significant differences in sink predictions were observed among all freshwater samples anova p 0 108 table 2 when sourcetracker was used to analyze the full library including both source communities collected in this study as well as those previously characterized notably one external source in the full library canadian geese was predicted to have a small 5 contribution to communities in the cc samples when sources were grouped into broader categories there were also no significant differences in sink assignments p 0 107 however increased allocation of domestic and wildlife sources was observed to further investigate the potential cause s for these discrepancies correlation analyses relating the percentage of individual sources to the allocation assigned the broader category were performed when using the library created in this study alone no correlations were observed between sink contributions from individual sources or those from their respective broader categories however when the full library was considered the contribution from flying fox was strongly and negatively correlated with that from wildlife in general spearman s ρ 0 888 p 0 005 moreover the contribution from wastewater was strongly positively correlated with that from the broader domestic category ρ 0 930 p 0 002 3 4 temporal stability of fecal taxa libraries four sources including dog horse kangaroo and wastewater were previously characterized as potential sources from seq and were again sampled in this study for each source the bacterial community composition of the newly collected material differed significantly from that collected previously anosim r 1 00 p 0 001 for all sources fig s2 to assess the effect of temporal variability among these sources on sourcetracker sink predictions reciprocal analyses were done treating the new and old communities from these hosts as sources and sinks fig 4 when the new sources were tested as sinks all showed low similarity 85 of community composition to the previously characterized sources dog samples showed significantly greater similarity 11 3 8 30 than other sources a comparable degree of similarity was observed when the new local sources were tested as sources except for horse in which significantly greater similarity was observed anova p 0 002 4 discussion low levels of fecal contamination were detected in each composite water sample evaluated with deer and flying foxes found to represent more prominent sources in several samples we further evaluated sink assignments using our larger library of samples collected from throughout the usa and australia and found that the inclusion of extraneous sources as well as additional sources from varying geographic regions minimally impacted sourcetracker sink predictions similar to our recent report using known source mesocosms brown et al 2018 prior source tracking studies employing next generation sequencing have suggested that many taxa may be host associated rather than host specific mclellan and eren 2014 roguet et al 2018 similarly we previously suggested that categorizing sources to broader categories may improve the transmissibility of next generation fecal taxon libraries staley et al 2018 results of the present study however revealed discrepancies in source assignments using this approach we hypothesized that using the full library would increase predicted source contributions however use of the full library resulted in a greater allocation of communities to flying fox and lower allocation to wastewater as well as a prediction of goose fecal contribution in contrast the broad category assessment showed increased domestic contamination which includes wastewater in samples where greater levels of wastewater contamination using the new i e local library were observed moreover the wildlife contribution using the full library was similar to the contamination allocated to canadian geese which were included in this category greater allocation to flying fox may reflect a better ability to distinguish this individual source using more source types and samples since the community composition did not vary significantly in the new local library furthermore bacterial wastewater signatures in the new local library may have been overshadowed by individual humans in the domestic category but could be more clearly distinguished when additional wastewater samples from the previous study were included however since additional validation e g quantitative pcr assays of genetic markers were not performed an independent accurate characterization of the magnitude of fecal contamination was not possible highlighting the necessity of using toolbox approaches to validate emerging methods ahmed et al 2015 additionally using a uniform number of sources may improve sourcetracker accuracy when the numbers of individuals are low as has been previously shown henry et al 2016 sun et al 2017 in addition a minimum number of individuals within each source type are needed for accurate source assignments brown et al 2017 importantly this is the first study to evaluate the temporal stability of fecal taxon libraries using sourcetracker among the four previously characterized sources for which new samples were collected dog samples showed the greatest temporal stability with approximately 10 15 similarity between new and old sources this may be due to a more cosmopolitan intestinal microbiome among dogs that gives a relatively low specificity to detect seeded dog fecal samples boehm et al 2013 significantly greater similarity was observed when new horse fecal communities were treated as sources rather than sinks these data may reflect an advantage of using composite samples for some animals to better capture microbial diversity with decreased sequencing effort however the degree of disparity between samples is not surprising although the sequencing method was conserved different dna extraction kits were used previously to characterize the fecal communities than those used here ahmed et al 2015 however it was previously reported that dna extraction methods did not significantly impact microbial community composition in freshwater samples staley et al 2015 and some overlap was observed among wastewater samples collected at separate times previous reports of dna extraction techniques on soil bacteria using various extraction methods also displayed little variance when comparing microbial community composition fouhy et al 2016 de lipthay et al 2004 martin laurent et al 2001 yuan et al 2012 several factors impact the microbial community composition of surface waters in subtropical regions of south east queensland it is possible that seasonal variability in the microbiomes of some animals may affect the composition of environmental waters affecting the efficacy of community based mst approaches davenport et al 2014 garcía armisen et al 2014 smits et al 2017 other factors such as food or dietary changes may also be involved however this supposition was beyond the scope of the current investigation we recently evaluated the efficacy of sourcetracker software to attribute contamination from a variety of fecal sources spiked into ambient freshwater samples staley et al 2018 the inclusion of local sources was found to be necessary for accurate source assignments which could not be made using non local sources alone however combining local and non local sources did not significantly affect sink fecal sources contributions p 0 79 similar results were recently reported by brown et al 2018 moreover the sink predictions were positively correlated with the spiked source volumes staley et al 2018 to observe the possible regional differences in microbial composition of the same animal species composite samples were prepared by using equal amounts of dna extracted individually from five animals within the same residing habitat this resulted in six composite samples from the same animal species from six different sites within a 200 km diameter within the south east queensland region the results indicated that whilst certain genera were more abundant in some animal species there were very little differences in fecal microbial composition of composite samples sourcetracker has also been shown to correlate well with hydrologic modelling mccarthy et al 2017 and provide accurate and perhaps relatively quantitative identification of known source seeded samples when local sources are included in the source library henry et al 2016 brown et al 2018 staley et al 2018 however we previously showed that this community based mst method suffers from the same geographic inconsistencies common to many library based mst methods staley et al 2018 here we again report a similar limitation in temporal stability of source libraries moreover standardized practices for dna extraction and sequencing as are being implemented by consortia such as the earth microbiome project gilbert et al 2014 2018 have yet to be applied to the field of mst making inter laboratory sharing of data difficult 5 conclusion sourcetracker is a useful tool to detect low levels bacterial signatures of wastewater in a studied catchment 16s rrna community analysis of any catchments should focus on using composite water samples to obtain a realistic snap shot of fecal pollution by a target species increased allocation of domestic and wildlife sources within a catchment may underpin the importance of agricultural sources of water contamination temporal instability of fecal taxon libraries among tested

wastewater treatment plants wwtps and to 17 9 μg l 66 nmol l in another plant with a higher contribution of industrial wastewater their concentration increased in the wwtps by a factor of 2 4 likely

recently been considered as a potential threat to drinking water resources reemtsma et al 2016 with a combination of lab degradation experiments and lc hrms analyses in municipal wastewaters surface

suspect screening of hmmm and its tps in aqueous samples the ms data of the tps detected in the lab degradation experiment were used for suspect screening in the real samples by target lynx software the criteria for the tentative identification or confirmation when standards were available only for melamine and hmmm of these tps were the chromatographic retention time 0 2 min and the mass accuracy of the molecular ion 5 ppm and of the previously detected fragment ions 2 7 quantification of hmmm and its tps the performance of the liquid chromatography pda coupled to a quadrupole time of

were within a range of 0 12 and 0 25 μmol l for hmmm and 0 78 and 3 93 μmol l for melamine lc uv chromatograms show that all tps are well separated from hmmm fig s2 and there was no interference at the retention time rt of hmmm and it s tps uv vis spectra of all tps were recorded fig s4 and on this basis absorbance at 217 nm was selected as detection wavelengths for hmmm and its tps the calibration by hmmm was applied to all tps melamine was quantitated independently the peak of each tp was confirmed and determined by comparing the retention time of tp in uv spectrum with the retention time in lc hrms the quantities determined by the lc uv approach were used to calibrate the lc hrms method using diluted samples of the lab degradation study these response factors were employed to quantitatively assess the concentrations of the tps of hmmm in environmental samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of hmmm with activated sludge a lab degradation experiment was performed a to learn about the aerobic biodegradability of hmmm its transformation pathway and the tps formed from it and b to collect ms data of the hmmm tps that would enable their detection and quantitative assessment by lc hrms also in environmental samples at lower concentration and in more complex samples according to the doc data no significant mineralization of hmmm occurred although the biomass was active and mineralized comparable concentrations of aniline within 5 days fig 1 a based on these data hmmm would be considered persistent hmmm analyses however showed that the biomass was able to transform hmmm 53 in 18 d fig 1b in the abiotic control approximately 25 of hmmm were transformed only transformation of hmmm in the abiotic control fig 1b may be due to hydrolysis initiated by protonation of the n atom in one of the a side chains berge et al 1970 the more efficient transformation of hmmm by the sludge may either indicate a more effective biocatalyzed hydrolysis or be due also other transformation processes 3 2 identification of tps and proposed transformation pathway of hmmm to elucidate the transformation processes of hmmm tps were searched for by time resolved lc hrms analysis of the degradation experiment tp identification was based on typical neutral losses like methanol m z 32 0262 and the formation of characteristic product ions for example three fragment ions appeared to be common to all tps with an intact triaminotriazine ring system fig 2 and they were used to search for hmmm degradation products in the non target screening data in total 21 tps were detected by lc hrms from this hmmm degradation experiment table s1 in the positive mode while the negative mode did not provide any additional tps and no further useful fragment ions based on the exact masses of the detected tps and their fragment ions structure proposals were elaborated table s1 by considering also the sequence in which the tps became detectable during the degradation experiment a transformation pathway for hmmm by activated sludge is proposed fig 3 generally the tps that appeared as impurities at day 0 already pmmm tp 363 and tp 377 are not much lower in molecular weight than the parent hmmm with ongoing transformation large numbers of other tps became detectable that were characterized by lower molecular weight together with stronger modifications of the initial hmmm structure fig 3 pmmm is a known impurity of hmmm bobeldijk et al 2002 and therefore detected from begin on at the day 18 when 51 of hmmm were transformed fig 1b the lightest tp 155 was detected the low molecular weight tps formed towards the end of the experiment melamine tp 157 tp 155 and tp 171 all exhibited retention times of below 1 min indicating their very high polarity fig s2 the proposed aerobic transformation pathway of hmmm is complex as one tp may be further transformed to several other tps along different routes fig 3 however only three basic reactions make up the whole sequence first the hydrolysis of a methoxy groups leads to meoh and an n methylol the n methylol may then be either transformed to a free amine n h by elimination of formaldehyde or oxidized to an aldehyde hydrolysis and elimination of formaldehyde have been described earlier for melamine formaldehyde bauer 1982 it is likely that the second hydrolysis of hmmm in such a sequence takes place at the same amino group as the first one berge et al 1970 so that a dimethoxymethylamine moiety is transformed into a primary amine e g hmmm to tetrammm in fig 3 these two reactions may also occur abiotically but at lower rate so that hmmm was more stable without biomass than in the presence of biomass fig 1b contrary to that the oxidation of the methylol group to an aldehyde was observed only in the presence of biomass no indication was found that these aldehydes were oxidized further to a carboxylate rather they appeared to be comparatively stable and their intensity increased during the experiments until day 25 or 29 tp 375 tp 383 tp 353 tp 287 tp 325 tp 339 tp 315 tp 243 and tp 155 fig s5 mesomeric effects may contribute to this stability however in most cases only one of the six methoxymethyl groups of hmmm was found to be transformed into an aldehyde fig 3 the calculated physico chemical data of these tps indicate that with decreasing molecular weight and increasing relative oxygen content the polarity of the tps increases while the molecular weight decreases from 390 for hmmm to 154 for tp 155 also the logd value at ph 7 4 decreases from 1 54 to 1 65 fig s3 this decrease should drastically increase the tps mobility in partially closed water cycles and if they turn out to be persistent increase also their risk of occurrence in groundwaters influenced by bank filtration reemtsma et al 2016 3 3 semi quantification of tps by lc uv ms one challenge in biotransformation studies is the quantification of tps which are not available as reference compounds for method calibration often the signal intensity of a tp in lc ms is used as a surrogate for its concentration e g peter et al 2018 however the esi ms response even of structurally similar compounds can vary by orders of magnitude making this a very risky strategy in this study an alternate approach was selected making use of the fact that the uv absorbance of structurally similar aromatic compounds is less variable than their esi ms response and thus lc uv analyses should provide a more reasonable estimate of the concentration of tps than esi ms the samples obtained from the biodegradation experiment of hmmm starting with 25 7 mg l of hmmm 65 μmol l provided sufficient concentration of tps to allow for their determination by lc uv indeed the lc uv analyses of these samples showed signals for 21 tps and their uv absorbance spectra recorded by lc dad were comparatively similar most of them showed an absorbance maximum in the same range as hmmm λ max of 217 nm fig s4 only melamine differed significantly with a maximum at 236 nm but melamine could be quantified separately as it is commercially available thus the response factor of hmmm at 217 nm was used to quantify all tps except melamine the validity of this quantitation approach is supported by the fact that the concentration of hmmm and its tps between day 15 and day 29 of the degradation experiment sum up to 99 102 of the initial hmmm concentration table s2 which is in agreement with the doc data fig 1a between day 5 and 11 of the experiment the sum is a little lower 84 85 table s2 possibly due to the fact that several tps occurred at concentrations too low to be detectable by lc uv analysis the relative concentrations of all tps during the degradation experiment of hmmm based on lc uv are presented in fig s5 tp 157 turned out to be quantitatively most important fig s5 in this tp all but one methoxymethyl groups are split of and the last one is hydrolyzed fig 3 this tp accounts for about 29 of the initial hmmm after 29 days fig 4 b tp 157 was not formed in the abiotic control fig 4a melamine does not seem to be a quantitatively relevant tp of hmmm fig 4 some of the samples were analyzed by lc hrms in parallel and based on the concentrations determined by lc uv response factors were estimated for the lc hrms detection these lc hrms response factors differed by almost two orders of magnitude from 0 5 to 22 table s1 this approach which linked lc uv analyses of less complex samples at a high concentration with lc hrms analysis paved the way to estimate the concentration of all 21 tps in environmental samples which were much more complex and in which these tps occurred at much lower concentration level 3 4 occurrence of hmmm and its tps in the water cycle 3 4 1 municipal wastewater treatment the knowledge on the identity of tps being formed from hmmm and on their determination by lc hrms was used to study hmmm removal in four municipal wwtps median influent concentrations of hmmm were in the range of 1 6 2 9 μg l for three of the plants b d fig s6 in the influent of a fourth plant a the median hmmm concentration was 6 3 μg l fig 5 with a maximum of 60 μg l in february table s3 the higher concentration of hmmm in plant a may be due to the fact that this plant receives larger amounts of industrial wastewater inter alia of the automotive industry while plant b d were dominated by household wastewater hmmm has earlier been attributed to an industrial origin dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 high variability in hmmm concentrations of wastewater could then be explained by the fact that many industrial processes and thus the discharge of their process waters are discontinuous consequently the hmmm concentration in the influent of plant a was much more variable rsd 113 than for the concentration of other pollutants like carbamazepine rsd 30 or benzotriazole rsd 48 table s3 in all four wwtps studied the hmmm concentration increased rather than decreased in the course of wastewater treatment by a factor of 2 4 fig 5 fig s6 this suggests that further hmmm is formed from hmmm precursors present in the untreated wastewater and that this formation is faster than hmmm transformation such hmmm precursors may be synthesis by products or reaction products that are formed during use of hmmm as a cross linker bauer 1982 a number of reaction products of hmmm with other compounds have also been preregistered under the reach regulation the occurrence of hmmm precursors is corroborated by lc ms analyses of the wwtp a influent which indicates presence of compounds with higher m z values than hmmm but with its typical fragment ion of m z 177 092 c7h9n6 fig s7 and table s4 nine of the tps known from the hmmm biodegradation experiment fig 3 were detected already in the influent of wwtp a and their concentration assessed with the approach outlined above monommm dimmm tp 245 tp 243 tetrammm trimmm tp 353 tp 377 pmmm at a total concentration of 28 μg l of these dimmm and tetrammm were the most important ones fig 5 with median concentrations of 9 μg l 42 nmol l and 2 6 μg l 8 6 nmol l respectively these tps with an even number of methoxymethyl groups had proven more stable than the odd numbered ones in the biodegradation experiment fig s5 also for the hmmm tps an increase in concentration during the wastewater treatment was determined to a median of 42 μg l so that the total concentration of hmmm and its two major tps tetrammm and dimmm almost doubled in wwtp a from a median of 18 μg l 66 nmol l in the influent to 34 μg l 119 nmol l in the effluent also melamine was detected with a median concentration of 0 5 1 7 μg l in the influents of the four wwtps for plant a see fig 5 it increases by more than one order of magnitude to 8 μg l in the effluent of wwtp a while this increase was lower factor 2 5 in the other three wwtps based on the laboratory experiment fig 3 it appears unlikely that hmmm is the source of the melamine increase in the wwtp melamine was reported not to be biodegradable an et al 2017 xu et al 2013 earlier studies have reported the occurrence of hmmm in wwtp effluents in germany dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 eberhard et al 2015 and spain consejo et al 2005 but removal was reported by only one study to be low and variable seitz and winzenbacher 2017 moreover this is the first study quantitatively assessing a larger number of hmmm tps and reporting the involvement of hmmm precursors which lead to an increase of the hmmm concentration in wwtps 3 4 2 surface water in accordance to its presence in wwtp effluents hmmm was also determined in surface waters of river mulde a tributary of river elbe in germany with wwtp discharges upstream at concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 μg l median 0 45 μg l 1 2 nmol l table s5 during four samplings between november 2016 and may 2017 these concentrations are comparable to earlier reports for river mulde dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 and other german surface waters eberhard et al 2015 as well as for the river rhine stoks et al 2009 the median hmmm concentrations determined in river mulde compare well with the concentration of benzotriazole median 0 7 μg l and exceeds the concentration of carbamazepine median 0 15 μg l in that river however the surface water samples were also analyzed for the 21 tps of hmmm from the lab experiment eleven of them were detected in river mulde and were quantitatively assessed table s5 the median concentrations of dimmm 0 5 μg l 2 3 nmol l and tetrammm 0 17 μg l 0 57 nmol l were in the same range to those of hmmm while those of pmmm were approximately 50 of hmmm 0 05 μg l 0 13 nmol l and trimmm 0 01μg l 0 03 nmol l was only 10 20 again the even mmms were more prominent than the odd mmms taken together these four tps of hmmm exceeded the hmmm concentration in the respective samples by a factor of 2 3 which already slightly higher than in the wastewater 1 8 2 2 however in the river samples additional hmmm related tps were detected based on characteristic fragmentations see section 3 2 these four tps have been absent in the wastewater table s5 all detected tps taken together have a median concentration of 4 9 μg l 16 nmol l and exceed the hmmm concentration by one order of magnitude thus the proportion of hmmm tps relative to hmmm itself increased from the wwtp influent over the wwtp effluent to the surface water samples reflecting the ongoing transformation of hmmm consequently analyzing hmmm only would have significantly underestimated the contamination of surface waters by this class of compounds in a recent study it was reported that the peak area of four hmmm related compounds in road runoff and receiving creeks corresponded to approx 50 of hmmm itself peter et al 2018 considering a larger number of compounds and performing a semi quantification in river water this study shows that the contribution of hmmm related compounds and of hmmm tps can be significantly larger 3 4 3 bank filtration bank filtration is an important process to generate raw water used for drinking water production from surface waters many organic contaminants are degraded while the water passes the subsurface often with travelling times exceeding several weeks grunheid et al 2005 poorly degradable and highly polar compounds however may be mobile also in the subsurface pm compounds because retention by sorption of highly polar compounds is generally weak reemtsma et al 2016 therefore bank filtration may not be an effective barrier for pm compounds unless they are cationic and retained by electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged surfaces of underground material the bank filtration site used for this study was equipped with two sampling wells well 1 2 between the river and the production wells the production wells have an average distance of 500 m from the river banks fig s1 another three wells were sampled that are located beyond the production wells with increasing contribution of background water well 3 5 the raw water used for drinking water production at this site was a mix of bank filtrate 80 and background water 20 as assessed from its primidone concentration fig s8 despite its omnipresence in the surface water median concentration 0 45 μg l during the study period hmmm was detected only in the well closest to the river well 1 40 m travel distance and only on two of the four sampling occasions between november and may 2017 fig 6 this suggests that hmmm is either rapidly degraded in the subsurface which does not seem likely based on the lab degradation study and the data of the wwtps or retained by sorption anyhow bank filtration appears to be an effective barrier for hmmm the picture becomes more complex if hmmm tps are also considered of which 11 were detected in bank filtrate in the different wells figs 6 and 7 many of these tps are less effectively retained than hmmm while for others the concentration even increases in bank filtration the concentration gradient from surface water to the production well gets shallower from hmmm and pmmm over tetrammm to dimmm and monommm fig 6 the last two even reach the production well monommm in concentrations around 0 1 μg l the decreasing retention of melamines with decreasing number of methoxymethyl groups is consistent with their decreasing logd values from 0 23 for pmmm to 0 3 for monommm fig s3 which indicates decreasing sorption tendency not only are hmmm tps with less methoxymethyl groups less effectively retained but they may also be generated while the water is travelling through the subsurface from sorbed or dissolved precursors with a larger number of methoxymethyl groups concentrations of tps formed by stepwise hydrolysis of the methoxymethyl moieties and oxidation i e the carbonylated versions of tetrammm tp 353 trimmm tp 287 and dimmm tp 243 and carbonylated melamine tp 155 show an even different concentration profile fig 7 these tps first increase in concentration from the river towards the production well some do then decrease again tp 353 tp 243 tp 155 while others remain constant in concentration tp 287 tp 259 these concentration profiles clearly witness continuous biotransformation of hmmm and of its earlier tps such as the series from tetrammm to monommm fig 6 during bank filtration eventually the following four tps of hmmm are found in measureable concentrations in the raw water tp 353 at 1 14 μg l tp 243 at 0 2 μg l tp 287 and tp 155 around 0 1 μg l on a molar basis these three tps correspond to 50 of the sum of hmmm and it s tps in the river mulde during that time considering a 20 decrease in concentration by dilution with background water fig s8 the efficacy of the bank filtration site in removing hmmm and its tps was approximately 60 apparently the oxidized tps tp 353 tp 243 tp 287 and tp 155 with a carbonyl moiety are more mobile in the subsurface than their respective non oxidized precursors with a methylol group this is understandable if one does not only consider the polarity of the tps expressed by their logd values but also their charge at environmental ph all these oxidized species are predicted to be neutral at ambient ph fig s3 rendering these tps more mobile than their non oxidized precursors which are predicted to be cationic cations are effectively retained on negatively charged mineral surfaces this may also explain why the major tp of hmmm formed in the lab degradation study tp 157 figs 3 and 4 100 cationic was not detected in the groundwater samples and instead its non ionic oxidation product tp 155 occurs as the smallest hmmm tp in the groundwater fig 7 fig s3 a compound that seems to contradict this trend i e to be mobile in the subsurface although occurring as a cation is melamine fig 7 no concentration decrease is visible from the well data and concentrations in the range of several μg l were found in the raw water used for drinking water production although the concentration profile suggests that melamine is formed as a tp during subsurface passage this study did not provide indication that hmmm would be this precursor 4 conclusions the combination of a lab degradation study of hmmm and of analyses for hmmm and its tps in wwtps in surface waters river mulde and along a bank filtration transect to raw waters used for drinking water production provided a comprehensive picture of hmmm and its tps hmmm and its two most prominent tps tetrammm and dimmm occur in the influent of four wwtps in median total concentrations of 2 34 μg l the elevated concentrations in one of the plants likely originate from indirect discharge of industrial wastewater all three compounds are continuously formed from yet unknown precursors in wastewater treatment so that effluents concentrations exceed the influent concentrations by a factor of 2 3 the six methoxymethyl groups of hmmm appear to be stepwise transformed by hydrolysis to methylol groups elimination of this group as formaldehyde to form a primary amino group and oxidation of the methylol group to a carbonyl no significant mineralization of hmmm or any of its tps was observed in a lab degradation study here the major final tp was methylol 1 3 5 triazin 2 4 6 triamin tp 157 biodegradation of hmmm continues in surface waters and in the subsurface during bank filtration tps with a carboxylate moiety that were predicted to occur in a non ionic stage at neutral ph turned out to be more stable and most mobile in the subsurface eventually three tps of hmmm reached the raw water used for drinking water production in concentrations of 0 1 1 μg l the crosslinker hmmm does not seem to be covered by the european reach registration however it is a chemical that is biotransformed but not mineralized and from which tps are formed some of which are persistent and mobile enough to make their way from municipal wastewater via surface waters to bank filtrate use as raw water for drinking water production not only pm compounds but also precursor compounds that lead to tps with pm properties deserve

and widely used in the production of coatings and plastics e g for cans coils and automobiles despite its widespread application little is known about the occurrence of hmmm in municipal wastewater the extent of its removal in wastewater treatment and the fate of transformation products that may be formed from it a lab degradation experiment with activated sludge showed that hmmm is transformed but not mineralized under aerobic conditions by lc uv and lc hrms analyses 21 transformation products tps were detected and tentatively identified with modified di methoxymethyl amino side chains and a pathway for their formation was proposed the major tp after 28 days was methylol 1 3 5 triazin 2 4 6 triamin lc uv and lc hrms response of the tps in the lab experiment was used to quantitatively assess the concentration of tps also in environmental samples in municipal wastewater hmmm and its two tps tetrammm and dimmm added up to median concentrations of 2 8 μg l 7 5 nmol l in three wastewater treatment plants wwtps and to 17 9 μg l 66 nmol l in another plant with a higher contribution of industrial wastewater their concentration increased in the wwtps by a factor of 2 4 likely due to ongoing formation from hmmm related precursor compounds also melamine concentrations increased in the four wwtps to 3 8 μg l but this did not seem to be linked to hmmm transformation in surface water affected by wwtp discharges hmmm and 12 tps were determined at median total concentrations of 5 μg l with an even higher proportion of the tps relative to hmmm compared to the wwtp effluents during bank filtration hmmm tetrammm and dimmm together with some cationic tps were largely removed while three tps all carrying one carbonylated side chain were eventually determined in raw waters used for drinking water production in median concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 1 μg l it appears that hmmm while falling under the exemptions of reach registration is a precursor for widely found

to be registered under reach https echa europa eu information on chemicals registered substances as of may 2019 however in the preregistration process hmmm was included into the so called annex iii

sketch calculator plugins marvin 6 1 3 2013 chemaxon http www chemaxon com hmmm was first reported to occur in surface waters of the netherlands subsequent to its detection in an industrial wastewater bobeldijk et al 2002 de hoogh et al 2006 it was later on reported to occur also in german rivers bobeldijk et al 2002 de hoogh et al 2006 dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 eberhard et al 2015 schwarzbauer and ricking 2010 hmmm concentrations in river waters were noted to be highly variable and suggested to indicate indirect industrial discharge dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 it was found in the runoff water of roads as well seitz and winzenbacher 2017 the hydrolysis of melamine resin was studied in a lab experiment bauer 1982 and two impurities in commercial hmmm formulations have been identified penta methoxymethyl melamine pmmm de hoogh et al 2006 and a doubly formylated by product bobeldijk et al 2002 additionally tetra methoxymethyl melamine tmmm and hexamethylolmelamine pentamethyl ether hmpe were reported to occur in road runoff peter et al 2018 while the core structure of hmmm corresponds to melamine it is not clear yet if melamine would also be a degradation product of hmmm and thus whether hmmm contributes to the omnipresence of melamine in the water cycle schulz et al 2007 despite the occasional reports on hmmm in surface waters dedicated studies on hmmm and its fate in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwpts and in the aqueous environment are not available the extent of hmmm removal in wwtps has been reported to vary between 20 and 45 in four different plants seitz and winzenbacher 2017 and while it has been speculated that hmmm stability in surface waters was limited dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 the transformation pathway of hmmm or the identity of its transformation products tps have not been reported yet therefore it is presently unclear to which extent hmmm is removed in wwtps and if so whether it is mineralized or transformed it is also unknown if stable tps of hmmm are being formed persistent and mobile highly polar compounds pm compounds whether chemicals or tps of chemicals have recently been considered as a potential threat to drinking water resources reemtsma et al 2016 with a combination of lab degradation experiments and lc hrms analyses in municipal wastewaters surface waters and a bank filtration transect the present study aims at extending our knowledge on the fate of hmmm in partially closed water cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents methanol

suspect screening of hmmm and its tps in aqueous samples the ms data of the tps detected in the lab degradation experiment were used for suspect screening in the real samples by target lynx software the criteria for the tentative identification or confirmation when standards were available only for melamine and hmmm of these tps were the chromatographic retention time 0 2 min and the mass accuracy of the molecular ion 5 ppm and of the previously detected fragment ions 2 7 quantification of hmmm and its tps the performance of the liquid chromatography pda coupled to a quadrupole time of

were within a range of 0 12 and 0 25 μmol l for hmmm and 0 78 and 3 93 μmol l for melamine lc uv chromatograms show that all tps are well separated from hmmm fig s2 and there was no interference at the retention time rt of hmmm and it s tps uv vis spectra of all tps were recorded fig s4 and on this basis absorbance at 217 nm was selected as detection wavelengths for hmmm and its tps the calibration by hmmm was applied to all tps melamine was quantitated independently the peak of each tp was confirmed and determined by comparing the retention time of tp in uv spectrum with the retention time in lc hrms the quantities determined by the lc uv approach were used to calibrate the lc hrms method using diluted samples of the lab degradation study these response factors were employed to quantitatively assess the concentrations of the tps of hmmm in environmental samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of hmmm with activated sludge a lab degradation experiment was performed a to learn about the aerobic biodegradability of hmmm its transformation pathway and the tps formed from it and b to collect ms data of the hmmm tps that would enable their detection and quantitative assessment by lc hrms also in environmental samples at lower concentration and in more complex samples according to the doc data no significant mineralization of hmmm occurred although the biomass was active and mineralized comparable concentrations of aniline within 5 days fig 1 a based on these data hmmm would be considered persistent hmmm analyses however showed that the biomass was able to transform hmmm 53 in 18 d fig 1b in the abiotic control approximately 25 of hmmm were transformed only transformation of hmmm in the abiotic control fig 1b may be due to hydrolysis initiated by protonation of the n atom in one of the a side chains berge et al 1970 the more efficient transformation of hmmm by the sludge may either indicate a more effective biocatalyzed hydrolysis or be due also other transformation processes 3 2 identification of tps and proposed transformation pathway of hmmm to elucidate the transformation processes of hmmm tps were searched for by time resolved lc hrms analysis of the degradation experiment tp identification was based on typical neutral losses like methanol m z 32 0262 and the formation of characteristic product ions for example three fragment ions appeared to be common to all tps with an intact triaminotriazine ring system fig 2 and they were used to search for hmmm degradation products in the non target screening data in total 21 tps were detected by lc hrms from this hmmm degradation experiment table s1 in the positive mode while the negative mode did not provide any additional tps and no further useful fragment ions based on the exact masses of the detected tps and their fragment ions structure proposals were elaborated table s1 by considering also the sequence in which the tps became detectable during the degradation experiment a transformation pathway for hmmm by activated sludge is proposed fig 3 generally the tps that appeared as impurities at day 0 already pmmm tp 363 and tp 377 are not much lower in molecular weight than the parent hmmm with ongoing transformation large numbers of other tps became detectable that were characterized by lower molecular weight together with stronger modifications of the initial hmmm structure fig 3 pmmm is a known impurity of hmmm bobeldijk et al 2002 and therefore detected from begin on at the day 18 when 51 of hmmm were transformed fig 1b the lightest tp 155 was detected the low molecular weight tps formed towards the end of the experiment melamine tp 157 tp 155 and tp 171 all exhibited retention times of below 1 min indicating their very high polarity fig s2 the proposed aerobic transformation pathway of hmmm is complex as one tp may be further transformed to several other tps along different routes fig 3 however only three basic reactions make up the whole sequence first the hydrolysis of a methoxy groups leads to meoh and an n methylol the n methylol may then be either transformed to a free amine n h by elimination of formaldehyde or oxidized to an aldehyde hydrolysis and elimination of formaldehyde have been described earlier for melamine formaldehyde bauer 1982 it is likely that the second hydrolysis of hmmm in such a sequence takes place at the same amino group as the first one berge et al 1970 so that a dimethoxymethylamine moiety is transformed into a primary amine e g hmmm to tetrammm in fig 3 these two reactions may also occur abiotically but at lower rate so that hmmm was more stable without biomass than in the presence of biomass fig 1b contrary to that the oxidation of the methylol group to an aldehyde was observed only in the presence of biomass no indication was found that these aldehydes were oxidized further to a carboxylate rather they appeared to be comparatively stable and their intensity increased during the experiments until day 25 or 29 tp 375 tp 383 tp 353 tp 287 tp 325 tp 339 tp 315 tp 243 and tp 155 fig s5 mesomeric effects may contribute to this stability however in most cases only one of the six methoxymethyl groups of hmmm was found to be transformed into an aldehyde fig 3 the calculated physico chemical data of these tps indicate that with decreasing molecular weight and increasing relative oxygen content the polarity of the tps increases while the molecular weight decreases from 390 for hmmm to 154 for tp 155 also the logd value at ph 7 4 decreases from 1 54 to 1 65 fig s3 this decrease should drastically increase the tps mobility in partially closed water cycles and if they turn out to be persistent increase also their risk of occurrence in groundwaters influenced by bank filtration reemtsma et al 2016 3 3 semi quantification of tps by lc uv ms one challenge in biotransformation studies is the quantification of tps which are not available as reference compounds for method calibration often the signal intensity of a tp in lc ms is used as a surrogate for its concentration e g peter et al 2018 however the esi ms response even of structurally similar compounds can vary by orders of magnitude making this a very risky strategy in this study an alternate approach was selected making use of the fact that the uv absorbance of structurally similar aromatic compounds is less variable than their esi ms response and thus lc uv analyses should provide a more reasonable estimate of the concentration of tps than esi ms the samples obtained from the biodegradation experiment of hmmm starting with 25 7 mg l of hmmm 65 μmol l provided sufficient concentration of tps to allow for their determination by lc uv indeed the lc uv analyses of these samples showed signals for 21 tps and their uv absorbance spectra recorded by lc dad were comparatively similar most of them showed an absorbance maximum in the same range as hmmm λ max of 217 nm fig s4 only melamine differed significantly with a maximum at 236 nm but melamine could be quantified separately as it is commercially available thus the response factor of hmmm at 217 nm was used to quantify all tps except melamine the validity of this quantitation approach is supported by the fact that the concentration of hmmm and its tps between day 15 and day 29 of the degradation experiment sum up to 99 102 of the initial hmmm concentration table s2 which is in agreement with the doc data fig 1a between day 5 and 11 of the experiment the sum is a little lower 84 85 table s2 possibly due to the fact that several tps occurred at concentrations too low to be detectable by lc uv analysis the relative concentrations of all tps during the degradation experiment of hmmm based on lc uv are presented in fig s5 tp 157 turned out to be quantitatively most important fig s5 in this tp all but one methoxymethyl groups are split of and the last one is hydrolyzed fig 3 this tp accounts for about 29 of the initial hmmm after 29 days fig 4 b tp 157 was not formed in the abiotic control fig 4a melamine does not seem to be a quantitatively relevant tp of hmmm fig 4 some of the samples were analyzed by lc hrms in parallel and based on the concentrations determined by lc uv response factors were estimated for the lc hrms detection these lc hrms response factors differed by almost two orders of magnitude from 0 5 to 22 table s1 this approach which linked lc uv analyses of less complex samples at a high concentration with lc hrms analysis paved the way to estimate the concentration of all 21 tps in environmental samples which were much more complex and in which these tps occurred at much lower concentration level 3 4 occurrence of hmmm and its tps in the water cycle 3 4 1 municipal wastewater treatment the knowledge on the identity of tps being formed from hmmm and on their determination by lc hrms was used to study hmmm removal in four municipal wwtps median influent concentrations of hmmm were in the range of 1 6 2 9 μg l for three of the plants b d fig s6 in the influent of a fourth plant a the median hmmm concentration was 6 3 μg l fig 5 with a maximum of 60 μg l in february table s3 the higher concentration of hmmm in plant a may be due to the fact that this plant receives larger amounts of industrial wastewater inter alia of the automotive industry while plant b d were dominated by household wastewater hmmm has earlier been attributed to an industrial origin dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 high variability in hmmm concentrations of wastewater could then be explained by the fact that many industrial processes and thus the discharge of their process waters are discontinuous consequently the hmmm concentration in the influent of plant a was much more variable rsd 113 than for the concentration of other pollutants like carbamazepine rsd 30 or benzotriazole rsd 48 table s3 in all four wwtps studied the hmmm concentration increased rather than decreased in the course of wastewater treatment by a factor of 2 4 fig 5 fig s6 this suggests that further hmmm is formed from hmmm precursors present in the untreated wastewater and that this formation is faster than hmmm transformation such hmmm precursors may be synthesis by products or reaction products that are formed during use of hmmm as a cross linker bauer 1982 a number of reaction products of hmmm with other compounds have also been preregistered under the reach regulation the occurrence of hmmm precursors is corroborated by lc ms analyses of the wwtp a influent which indicates presence of compounds with higher m z values than hmmm but with its typical fragment ion of m z 177 092 c7h9n6 fig s7 and table s4 nine of the tps known from the hmmm biodegradation experiment fig 3 were detected already in the influent of wwtp a and their concentration assessed with the approach outlined above monommm dimmm tp 245 tp 243 tetrammm trimmm tp 353 tp 377 pmmm at a total concentration of 28 μg l of these dimmm and tetrammm were the most important ones fig 5 with median concentrations of 9 μg l 42 nmol l and 2 6 μg l 8 6 nmol l respectively these tps with an even number of methoxymethyl groups had proven more stable than the odd numbered ones in the biodegradation experiment fig s5 also for the hmmm tps an increase in concentration during the wastewater treatment was determined to a median of 42 μg l so that the total concentration of hmmm and its two major tps tetrammm and dimmm almost doubled in wwtp a from a median of 18 μg l 66 nmol l in the influent to 34 μg l 119 nmol l in the effluent also melamine was detected with a median concentration of 0 5 1 7 μg l in the influents of the four wwtps for plant a see fig 5 it increases by more than one order of magnitude to 8 μg l in the effluent of wwtp a while this increase was lower factor 2 5 in the other three wwtps based on the laboratory experiment fig 3 it appears unlikely that hmmm is the source of the melamine increase in the wwtp melamine was reported not to be biodegradable an et al 2017 xu et al 2013 earlier studies have reported the occurrence of hmmm in wwtp effluents in germany dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 eberhard et al 2015 and spain consejo et al 2005 but removal was reported by only one study to be low and variable seitz and winzenbacher 2017 moreover this is the first study quantitatively assessing a larger number of hmmm tps and reporting the involvement of hmmm precursors which lead to an increase of the hmmm concentration in wwtps 3 4 2 surface water in accordance to its presence in wwtp effluents hmmm was also determined in surface waters of river mulde a tributary of river elbe in germany with wwtp discharges upstream at concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 μg l median 0 45 μg l 1 2 nmol l table s5 during four samplings between november 2016 and may 2017 these concentrations are comparable to earlier reports for river mulde dsikowitzky and schwarzbauer 2015 and other german surface waters eberhard et al 2015 as well as for the river rhine stoks et al 2009 the median hmmm concentrations determined in river mulde compare well with the concentration of benzotriazole median 0 7 μg l and exceeds the concentration of carbamazepine median 0 15 μg l in that river however the surface water samples were also analyzed for the 21 tps of hmmm from the lab experiment eleven of them were detected in river mulde and were quantitatively assessed table s5 the median concentrations of dimmm 0 5 μg l 2 3 nmol l and tetrammm 0 17 μg l 0 57 nmol l were in the same range to those of hmmm while those of pmmm were approximately 50 of hmmm 0 05 μg l 0 13 nmol l and trimmm 0 01μg l 0 03 nmol l was only 10 20 again the even mmms were more prominent than the odd mmms taken together these four tps of hmmm exceeded the hmmm concentration in the respective samples by a factor of 2 3 which already slightly higher than in the wastewater 1 8 2 2 however in the river samples additional hmmm related tps were detected based on characteristic fragmentations see section 3 2 these four tps have been absent in the wastewater table s5 all detected tps taken together have a median concentration of 4 9 μg l 16 nmol l and exceed the hmmm concentration by one order of magnitude thus the proportion of hmmm tps relative to hmmm itself increased from the wwtp influent over the wwtp effluent to the surface water samples reflecting the ongoing transformation of hmmm consequently analyzing hmmm only would have significantly underestimated the contamination of surface waters by this class of compounds in a recent study it was reported that the peak area of four hmmm related compounds in road runoff and receiving creeks corresponded to approx 50 of hmmm itself peter et al 2018 considering a larger number of compounds and performing a semi quantification in river water this study shows that the contribution of hmmm related compounds and of hmmm tps can be significantly larger 3 4 3 bank filtration bank filtration is an important process to generate raw water used for drinking water production from surface waters many organic contaminants are degraded while the water passes the subsurface often with travelling times exceeding several weeks grunheid et al 2005 poorly degradable and highly polar compounds however may be mobile also in the subsurface pm compounds because retention by sorption of highly polar compounds is generally weak reemtsma et al 2016 therefore bank filtration may not be an effective barrier for pm compounds unless they are cationic and retained by electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged surfaces of underground material the bank filtration site used for this study was equipped with two sampling wells well 1 2 between the river and the production wells the production wells have an average distance of 500 m from the river banks fig s1 another three wells were sampled that are located beyond the production wells with increasing contribution of background water well 3 5 the raw water used for drinking water production at this site was a mix of bank filtrate 80 and background water 20 as assessed from its primidone concentration fig s8 despite its omnipresence in the surface water median concentration 0 45 μg l during the study period hmmm was detected only in the well closest to the river well 1 40 m travel distance and only on two of the four sampling occasions between november and may 2017 fig 6 this suggests that hmmm is either rapidly degraded in the subsurface which does not seem likely based on the lab degradation study and the data of the wwtps or retained by sorption anyhow bank filtration appears to be an effective barrier for hmmm the picture becomes more complex if hmmm tps are also considered of which 11 were detected in bank filtrate in the different wells figs 6 and 7 many of these tps are less effectively retained than hmmm while for others the concentration even increases in bank filtration the concentration gradient from surface water to the production well gets shallower from hmmm and pmmm over tetrammm to dimmm and monommm fig 6 the last two even reach the production well monommm in concentrations around 0 1 μg l the decreasing retention of melamines with decreasing number of methoxymethyl groups is consistent with their decreasing logd values from 0 23 for pmmm to 0 3 for monommm fig s3 which indicates decreasing sorption tendency not only are hmmm tps with less methoxymethyl groups less effectively retained but they may also be generated while the water is travelling through the subsurface from sorbed or dissolved precursors with a larger number of methoxymethyl groups concentrations of tps formed by stepwise hydrolysis of the methoxymethyl moieties and oxidation i e the carbonylated versions of tetrammm tp 353 trimmm tp 287 and dimmm tp 243 and carbonylated melamine tp 155 show an even different concentration profile fig 7 these tps first increase in concentration from the river towards the production well some do then decrease again tp 353 tp 243 tp 155 while others remain constant in concentration tp 287 tp 259 these concentration profiles clearly witness continuous biotransformation of hmmm and of its earlier tps such as the series from tetrammm to monommm fig 6 during bank filtration eventually the following four tps of hmmm are found in measureable concentrations in the raw water tp 353 at 1 14 μg l tp 243 at 0 2 μg l tp 287 and tp 155 around 0 1 μg l on a molar basis these three tps correspond to 50 of the sum of hmmm and it s tps in the river mulde during that time considering a 20 decrease in concentration by dilution with background water fig s8 the efficacy of the bank filtration site in removing hmmm and its tps was approximately 60 apparently the oxidized tps tp 353 tp 243 tp 287 and tp 155 with a carbonyl moiety are more mobile in the subsurface than their respective non oxidized precursors with a methylol group this is understandable if one does not only consider the polarity of the tps expressed by their logd values but also their charge at environmental ph all these oxidized species are predicted to be neutral at ambient ph fig s3 rendering these tps more mobile than their non oxidized precursors which are predicted to be cationic cations are effectively retained on negatively charged mineral surfaces this may also explain why the major tp of hmmm formed in the lab degradation study tp 157 figs 3 and 4 100 cationic was not detected in the groundwater samples and instead its non ionic oxidation product tp 155 occurs as the smallest hmmm tp in the groundwater fig 7 fig s3 a compound that seems to contradict this trend i e to be mobile in the subsurface although occurring as a cation is melamine fig 7 no concentration decrease is visible from the well data and concentrations in the range of several μg l were found in the raw water used for drinking water production although the concentration profile suggests that melamine is formed as a tp during subsurface passage this study did not provide indication that hmmm would be this precursor 4 conclusions the combination of a lab degradation study of hmmm and of analyses for hmmm and its tps in wwtps in surface waters river mulde and along a bank filtration transect to raw waters used for drinking water production provided a comprehensive picture of hmmm and its tps hmmm and its two most prominent tps tetrammm and dimmm occur in the influent of four wwtps in median total concentrations of 2 34 μg l the elevated concentrations in one of the plants likely originate from indirect discharge of industrial wastewater all three compounds are continuously formed from yet unknown precursors in wastewater treatment so that effluents concentrations exceed the influent concentrations by a factor of 2 3 the six methoxymethyl groups of hmmm appear to be stepwise transformed by hydrolysis to methylol groups elimination of this group as formaldehyde to form a primary amino group and oxidation of the methylol group to a carbonyl no significant mineralization of hmmm or any of its tps was observed in a lab degradation study here the major final tp was methylol 1 3 5 triazin 2 4 6 triamin tp 157 biodegradation of hmmm continues in surface waters and in the subsurface during bank filtration tps with a carboxylate moiety that were predicted to occur in a non ionic stage at neutral ph turned out to be more stable and most mobile in the subsurface eventually three tps of hmmm reached the raw water used for drinking water production in concentrations of 0 1 1 μg l the crosslinker hmmm does not seem to be covered by the european reach registration however it is a chemical that is biotransformed but not mineralized and from which tps are formed some of which are persistent and mobile enough to make their way from municipal wastewater via surface waters to bank filtrate use as raw water for drinking water production not only pm compounds but also precursor compounds that lead to tps with pm properties deserve

18503,electrochemical oxidation is widely used for water and wastewater treatment anodic material is crucial and the shape tailored 001 exposed tio2 has been proven to be an ideal electrode material for pollutant oxidation in this work the electrochemical treatment of wastewater containing typical p substituted phenols by facet tailored tio2 is studied in terms of efficiency characteristics and mechanisms experimental results demonstrate that the anodic oxidation of p substituted phenols becomes more difficult with the increasing hammett s constant σ of phenols while their degradation rates k increase continuously with the initial surface concentration γ phenols are degraded mainly by surface bound oh and direct electron transfer on the tio2 ti electrode rather than by bulk free oh suspended in the aqueous phase theoretical calculations reveal that the surface bound oh mediated oxidation mechanism is attributed mainly to the strong surface bond strength between shape tailored tio2 and water molecule as well as the reactive oh such strong interactions are associated with the higher density of atomic steps edges and kinks of low coordinate surface atoms with a large number dangling bonds on the high energy 001 polar facet for practical treatment of real wastewater with different matrixes the facet tailored tio2 ti electrode exhibits both a high efficiency and a fast

no involvement of any substrates other than electrons thus both high current efficiency and low energy consumption are achieved panizza and cerisola 2009 one main bottleneck is severe electrode fouling by polymeric intermediates liu et al 2017 the indirect oh mediated degradation is more practical due to strong capacity and rapid dynamics but its energy efficiency is diminished by oxygen

governs its catalytic mechanism i e the partition between oh mediated and direct electron transfer pathways and thus its efficiency and characteristics for electrochemical water treatment torres et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 2007 for example boron doped diamond has an inert surface with poor bonding and affinitive properties the generated oh is weakly bonded and more reactive for pollutant oxidation with a high oxygen evolution overpotential lei et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 also the surface modified pbo2 by hydrophobic resin can substantially increase its oxygen evolution overpotential and thus electrochemical mineralization efficiency zhou et al 2005 for the anatase tio2 with low energy 101 non polar facet 0 44 j m 2 the direct electron transfer pathway is widely reported for pollutant

calcinating in n2 atmosphere please see si for details pbo2 sno2 sb ti electrode included three layers figs s5 and s6 the ti substrate inner layer the thermally deposited sn sb intermediate layer as protective film and the electrodeposited pbo2 outer layer zhao et al 2010 the intermediate sb sno2 layer between the outer pbo2 layer and the bottom ti metallic support was introduced to protect ti substrate from oxidative deactivation and improve the electric conductivity and the mechanical strength of pbo2 attachment typically saturated pb no3 2 solution mixed with n butyl alcohol was uniformly dispersed on polished ti substrate then dried at 80 c for 10 min finally calcinated at 500 c for 10 min this procedure was repeated for 10 cycles then calcinated at 500 c for 60 min it is recognized that only the outer layer of the electrode is reactive for electrochemical reaction at the electrode electrolyte interface no sb sno2 component was exposed on the as prepared pbo2 electrode for anodic pollutant degradation as confirmed by the xrd and xps measurements fig s6 this result could exclude the possible contribution of the intermediate sb sno2 layer to the outer pbo2 electrolysis 2 2 electrochemical phenol degradation and wastewater treatment tests electrochemical degradation tests were conducted in a galvanostatic mode in a cylindrical single compartment cell

effective volume of 800 ml after ph adjustment a 500 ml of artificial or practical wastewater and 0 1 m na2so4 as supporting electrolyte was added the concentration of each phenol in artificial

oxidation electrochemical oxidation of p substituted phenols with both electron donating and withdrawing groups was evaluated at 25 ma cm 2 the degradation of p och3 and p no2 was much faster than p ch3 p cho and p h fig 1 and s7 s10 as the current density was increased the removal efficiencies of p ch3 p cho and p h were improved but still lower than p och3 and p no2 fig 1 and s7 degradation of some phenols did not follow first order reaction kinetics due to their weak surface enrichment fig 2 a compared to the 101 exposed tio2 degussa p25 a much higher anodic activity was observed for the 001 exposed tio2 scs fig 1 s11 and s12 table 1 although it was still lower than for pbo2 benchmark figs s13 and s14 table 1 wu et al 2014 fig 1d illustrates the electrochemical incineration capacity of tio2 scs at 25 ma cm 2 p och3 and p no2 were mainly converted to soluble intermediates liu et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 zhou et al 2005 toc removals were only 37 and 39 for p och3 and p no2 respectively electrochemical conversion was also observed for p ch3 p cho and p h despite of their low toc removals fig 1d at 75 ma cm 2 the mineralization was promoted to 45 75 with less formed polymeric intermediates to understand the electrochemical characteristics for phenol oxidation the relationships between the anodic activity langmuir hinshelwood first order reaction rate constant k with the initial surface concentration of phenols γ the hammett s constant of p substituted groups σ and phenol diffusion coefficient onto electrode d were explored fig 2 and s15 s20 table 1 torres et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 2007 similar to the p25 reference figs s21 and s22 the anodic reactivity k of the phenols on the tio2 scs were highly related with their initial surface enrichment concentrations γ calculated from the linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurements at different scanning rates fig 2a and s15 s17 for example at 50 ma cm 2 the reaction rate constant k was 0 46 0 29 0 37 0 66 and 0 81 h 1 for p h p ch3 p cho p och3 and p no2 respectively with an initial surface concentration γ of 1 65 1 72 1 73 2 73 and 2 87 10 9 mol cm 2 respectively figs s15 s17 the higher reaction rate constant k of lowly enriched p h 0 46 h 1 might be attributed to the higher electron withdrawing property of its p substituted group park et al 2008b such a positive trend was also observed at 25 and 75 ma cm 2 fig 2a no correlation between k and σ was observed fig 2b these relationships indicate that anodic phenol oxidation occurred mainly on tio2 surface and was governed by mass transfer from bulk solution to electrode surface zhu et al 2008 2007 in general the phenols with electron withdrawing groups are more resistant to degradation compared to those with electron donating groups herein the electrochemical reactivity was not correlated with the hammett s constant in a homogeneous mode fig 2b but strongly with the pollutant surface enriching concentration in a heterogeneous mode fig 2a such anodic characteristics of tailored tio2 were similar to pbo2 based on the lsv measurements at different scanning rates figs s23 and s24 on which the surface bound oh mediated oxidation mechanism is proposed zhu et al 2008 moreover the great relationship between the anodic activity k and diffusion coefficient d for phenol degradation provided direct proof for this mechanism fig 2c this unique heterogeneous characteristics were mainly attributed to the localized structural speciation of low potential surface bound oh ohbound e0 1 23 v nhe the main intermediate in water splitting and oxygen evolution the intermediate was generated on the high energy 001 polar facet under anodic polarization due to the strong surface bond strength between tio2 and water as well as oh table 2 and scheme 1 but not the high potential free oh ohfree e0 2 72 v nhe in bulk solution like on boron doped diamond electrode zhu et al 2007 2008 the homogeneous reactivity of oh is correlated with the pollutant s hammett constant torres et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 2007 while the surface anchored oh can attack pre adsorbed pollutants only in heterogeneous mode with a large mass transfer limitation if its high activity thermodynamic nature is taken into account scheme 1 panizza and cerisola 2009 also the stripping by in situ generated oxygen from anodic water decomposition at the given high current density might also contribute to the phenol removal fig 1 and table 1 no intrinsic correlation existed between the reaction rate constant k and the pollutant s hammett constant σ for the five typical p substituted phenols fig 2b thus the relationship between the reaction rate and the pollutant s hammett constant was occasionally featured with a volcanic type curve this could be mainly attributed to the surface bound oh mediated electrochemical oxidation mechanism on the high energy 001 exposed tio2 ti electrode scheme 1 limiting current density i lim of phenols in the tailored tio2 based system was calculated to be 5 25 10 48 5 86 8 33 and 6 59 ma cm 2 respectively figs s18 s20 since the applied current densities i appl were higher than their limiting current densities i lim the phenol anodic degradation was thus under mass transport control with a good stability figs s25 s28 these results are consistent with the degradation trends and the proposed anodic mechanism fig 2 and scheme 1 mce and e c are important parameters to characterize electrochemical water treatment panizza and cerisola 2009 compared to 101 tio2 higher mce and e c were observed on 001 tio2 table 1 mce continuously decreased with the increasing current density due to the intensified oxygen evolution martínez huitle et al 2015 miklos et al 2018 and was lower than that for pbo2 table 1 3 2 mechanisms for anodic phenol oxidation lsv was used to explore the contribution of direct anodic oxidation fig 3 a the anodic overpotential e p of phenols was positively correlated to the hammett s constant σ of p substituted groups with 0 94 v sce for p h 0 72 v sce for p ch3 0 90 v sce for p cho 0 73 v sce for p och3 and 1 00 v sce for p no2 respectively fig 3b the direct electron transfer from p substituted phenols with electron withdrawing groups and deficient electric environment was more difficult than those with electron donating groups and rich electric environment zhu et al 2007 their reaction rate constants k in bulk degradation were correlated to neither e p nor i p in lsv fig 3c and d these results indicate that electrochemical phenol oxidation in bulk degradation did not proceed mainly via direct electron transfer fig 1 instead the oh mediated mechanism occurred scheme 1 the surface bound oh mediated anodic mechanism was elucidated from the relationships between the anodic activity k and initial surface pollutant concentration on anodic material γ as well as hammett s constant of p substituted groups σ fig 2 and scheme 1 torres et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 this mechanism was ascribed mainly to the unique surface chemistry of high energy 001 polar facet such as the super hydrophilic property and the strong affinity for both h2o and oh via surface oh figs s29a c reactions 1 and 2 cho and hoffmann 2014 cho et al 2014 kesselman et al 1997 kim et al 2014 park et al 2008a 2008b 2009 the strong bond strength with oxygen as confirmed by ftir fig s29b made oh strictly bound onto tio2 scs thus attacking the pre adsorbed pollutants only reactions 3 and 4 with a low oxygen evolution overpotential fig s29d reactions 5 and 6 zhu et al 2008 since bulk degradation was under constant current the rate constant should be governed by the selectivity of oh as the primary oxidant 1 tio2 h2o tio2 h2oads tio2 ohads hads 2 tio2 ohads bias tio2 oh ads e 3

determined by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule fig 4 a qin et al 2018 and a much higher oh concentration was generated on tio2 scs than p25 benchmark but lower than on pbo2 fig 4a s30 and s31 terephthalic acid is widely used as a probe to quantify oh as it could not be oxidized via direct electron transfer for hydroxylation reaction figs s32 s34 thus the formed adduct from terephthalic acid for oh quantification is exclusively attributed to the oh mediated reaction pathway jing and chaplin 2017 the high oh generating capacity of tio2 scs was responsible for superior anodic activity fig 1 zhu et al 2008 although the higher oh generating capacity on 001 tio2 is well documented in photochemical water treatment liu et al 2014 2011 but it is new for electrochemical water treatment due to the different tio2 activation mechanisms and oh structural speciation liu et al 2017 the mechanism to generate oh in photochemical process relies on the valance band activation by uv photons λ 385 nm scheme s1a in comparison the mechanism in electrochemical process mainly relies on the conduction band activation at low anodic bias e eg 3 2 v while the valance band activation might also occur at high anodic bias e eg 3 2 v scheme s1b these are two discrete activation mechanisms for carrier generation and oh formation because in general the electronic structures of conduction band and valance band as well as the wide band gap of 3 2 ev are mainly comprised of o2p and ti3d states at the band edges in tio2 atomic configurations thus in photochemical water treatment oh is generated from h2o oh oxidation by the valance band holes remained in o2p orbital of tio2 configuration hvb scheme s1a in electrochemical water treatment oh is generated from h2o oh oxidation by the conduction band holes present in ti3d orbital of tio2 configuration at low bias hcb or by the conduction band holes in ti 3d orbital and the valance band holes in o2p orbital of tio2 configuration at high bias hcb hvb scheme s1b moreover the structural speciation of generated oh is completely different in photochemical and electrochemical modes on tio2 in photochemical water treatment the high potential free oh ohfree e0 2 72 v nhe is generated for exhaustive decontamination in bulk solution due to the high redox power of valance band holes under uv band gap excitation in electrochemical water treatment the low potential surface bound oh ohbound e0 1 23 v nhe is generated for partial conversion at electrode surface due to the low redox power of conduction band holes under anodic non band gap excitation scheme s1b which plays governing roles in its surface mediated catalytic characteristics scheme 1 to further explore anodic mechanisms on the facet tailored tio2 ti electrode three oh scavengers with distinct natures were respectively used the hydrophobic butyl alcohol which mainly quenchs the dissociated free oh suspended in the diffusion layer due to its low molecular affinity toward hydrophilic tio2 surface kn 1 0 figs s29 and s35 liu et al 2014 zhou et al 2005 decreased phenol degradation by less than 20 fig 4b however the inhibitory effect of butyl alcohol was much enhanced after adding naf to desorb surface adsorbed radicals into aqueous solution figs s36a c the first order reaction rate constant for pnp oxidation was drastically decreased from 0 43 0 81 and 0 96 h 1 to 0 09 0 11 and 0 13 h 1 respectively at 25 50 and 75 ma cm 2 fig s36d their inhibiting ratios of 4 8 7 4 and 7 4 with naf were much higher than those of 1 2 1 1 and 1 1 without naf respectively fig 4b furthermore ki is usually used as a scavenger for both hole and adsorbed oh surface mediated reactive species lai et al 2017 zhu et al 2008 and it reduced the phenol degradation by over 80 fig 4b although the generation and accumulation of iodine radicals i and i2 might contribute to pollutant degradation when ki was introduced figs 4b and s37 they should not be the major oxidants in our electrochemical oxidation system scheme 1 ki can be easily electrochemically oxidized and there was a great possibility that the generated i2 might be strongly deposited onto tio2 ti electrode to occupy surface reactive sites for further pollutant degradation figs s38 s40 thus the decreasing pollutant removal in the presence of ki might be also attributed to its oxidation and the subsequent adsorption of the product on the active sites in addition to its reaction with oh radicals in the solid phase fig 4b from this standpoint ki might indeed be not a good radical scavenger to explore catalytic mechanism although it has been widely used in oxidation systems moreover the inhibitory effects of ki and hydrophobic butyl alcohol with naf were comparable with the hydrophilic methanol fig s41 the most typical oh scavenger from both solid and aqueous phases k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 esr measurements further confirm the inhibiting results in pnp degradation fig s42 these results clearly indicate that the surface bound oh plays a dominant role in p substituted phenols oxidation on the facet tailored tio2 ti electrode scheme 1 and fig 4 while direct electron transfer might also play a minor role even under oh generation and water splitting fig 3 3 3 roles of 001 polar facet in anodic oxidation mechanisms for electrochemical water treatment surface interactions between h2o and tio2 play governing roles in oh generation speciation and pollutant degradation sun et al 2010 wang et al 2017 the central role is whether or not h2o dissociates over tio2 since h2o dissociation can introduce both oh and h and drastically affect tio2 surface chemistry to benefit oh generation and pollutant degradation sun et al 2010 the coordination numbers of surface atoms and their mutual distance critically affect h2o tio2 interactions and the unsaturated ti and o sites play a dominant role in h2o adsorption onto tio2 through ti o and h o bonds sun et al 2010 thus understanding the adsorbed h2o structure and its dissociation to surface oh on tio2 surface is essential wang et al 2017 in comparison with the low energy 101 facet of anatase tio2 50 ti3c 50 ti2c 50 o3c 50 o2c 0 44 j m 2 the surface ti and o atoms on the high energy 001 polar facet are exclusively unsaturated 100 ti2c 100 o2c 0 90 j m 2 liu et al 2014 2011 adsorbed h2o was steered and reoriented by long range electrostatic fields emanated from oxide lattice to activate and deprotonate to generate surface oh in energy transfer and redistribution fig 5 and s43 h2o adsorption energy onto 001 facet was more negative with a higher stability δe ads h2o table 2 which is consistent with ftir results fig s29b after adsorption fig s43a h2o dissociation occurred via transferring a h to nearby surface o2c to form surface terminated oh reaction 7 figs s43b and s43d or ejecting a h to generate h3o with another free h2o reaction 8 figs s43f and s43h 7 tio2 h2o ho tio2 h 8 tio2 h2o h2o tio2 oh h3o e a barrier less process with a negative overall energy change reaction 7 δe eq 7 1 330 ev table 2 was observed on anatase 001 facet for h2o dissociation to generate surface oh fig 5 h2o dissociation was not favorable under other circumstance due to the positive overall energies δe eq 7 on 101 facet as well as δe eq 9 on both 101 and 001 facets table 2 moreover the reduced activation energies e a of h2o dissociation reactions 7 and 8 on 001 facet meant a higher reaction rate for surface oh formation e a eq 7 and e a eq 8 table 2 the energy difference between h2o adsorption structures indicates that the liberated h preferred to bind with the nearby o2c leading to additional surface oh fig 5 and table 2 under anodic polarization the formed surface oh lost an electron to generate surface anchored oh reaction 9 the main active oxygen species for anodic pollutant degradation reactions 3 and 4 panizza and cerisola 2009 9 tio2 ohads bias tio2 oh ads e a much less energy was needed for oh generation on 001 facet the energy changes for reaction 9 were 0 350 ev and 0 913 ev on 001 and 101 facets δe eq 9 table 2 respectively these results are highly consistent with the measured oh fig 4a s30 and s31 the generated oh also exhibited a much higher affinity onto 001 polar facet than 101 analogue and the adsorption energy was calculated to be 17 110 ev and 14 126 ev respectively δe ads oh table 2 dft studies indicate that the high energy ti5c centered 001 polar facet was not only favorable for oh generation but also more affinitive to form surface bound active oxygen species for pollutant degradation fig 1 and table 1 such atomic scale insights could provide critical information to improve the capacity of anodic materials through facet engineering for electrochemical water treatment 3 4 electrochemical treatment of real wastewater the feasibility of using facet tailored tio2 for electrochemical treatment of real wastewater containing phenolic pollutants was further explored fig 6 compared to p25 reference higher removal efficiency and faster reaction kinetics were obtained on the 001 tio2 for wastewater with different matrixes although they were lower than those for pbo2 benchmark fig 6 in 9 h degradation at 25 ma cm 2 the calculated first order reaction rate constants were 0 173 0 306 0 207 0 461 and 0 24 h 1 respectively on the 001 tio2 electrode for real phenolic effluent municipal effluent dying effluents and surface water in comparison they were 0 092 0 246 0 129 0 360 and 0 200 h 1 only on p25 reference fig 6f tio2 anodic activity for electrochemical treatment of real phenol containing wastewater was substantially enhanced by facet engineering strategy such a superiority in both electric conductivity and anodic activity should be attributed mainly to both the single crystalline structure in the bulk and the co exposed 101 001 crystal facets on the surface the single crystalline structure with continuous and ordered atomic and electronic structures is highly favorable for the convenient and rapid charge transfer within the bulk phase due to less grain boundary and interface states lei et al 2010 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 also the co exposed 101 001 crystal facets can self establish the thermodynamic epitaxial facet junction with type ii band alignment to allow a built in electric field for the effective carrier separation between different exposed facets on the solid surface thus exhibits an enhanced quantum efficiency and catalytic performance zhang et al 2019 compared to the typical commercial dimensionally stable anodes e g pbo2 the high energy 001 exposed tio2 possessed a high stability low cost no toxicity and great safety for electrochemical water treatment all of these advantages endows it a promising anodic material for electrochemical water treatment 4 conclusions in this work the efficiency characteristics and mechanisms of 001 tailored tio2 ti electrode for electrochemical treatment of wastewater containing phenolic pollutants were investigated both artificial wastewater containing p substituted phenols and real wastewater with different water matrixes were selected for five p substituted phenols with both electron donating and withdrawing groups anodic oxidation mainly occurred on 001 tio2 surface and governed by mass transfer the surface bound oh mediated oxidation mechanism was proposed for phenol anodic conversion for real wastewater containing phenolic pollutants both a superior anodic activity and treatment capacity were obtained on 001 tio2 electrode regardless of water matrix dft calculations indicated the dominant roles of high energy 001 facet and single crystalline structure in the surface bound oh mediated mechanism on 001 tio2 electrode for phenol conversion our findings provided an efficient way to treat phenol containing water and wastewater and further to prepare modify and apply tio2 based anodic materials for electrochemical water

18503,electrochemical oxidation is widely used for water and wastewater treatment anodic material is crucial and the shape tailored 001 exposed tio2 has been proven to be an ideal electrode material for pollutant oxidation in this work the electrochemical treatment of wastewater containing typical p substituted phenols by facet tailored tio2 is studied in terms of efficiency characteristics and mechanisms experimental results demonstrate that the anodic oxidation of p substituted phenols becomes more difficult with the increasing hammett s constant σ of phenols while their degradation rates k increase continuously with the initial surface concentration γ phenols are degraded mainly by surface bound oh and direct electron transfer on the tio2 ti electrode rather than by bulk free oh suspended in the aqueous phase theoretical calculations reveal that the surface bound oh mediated oxidation mechanism is attributed mainly to the strong surface bond strength between shape tailored tio2 and water molecule as well as the reactive oh such strong interactions are associated with the higher density of atomic steps edges and kinks of low coordinate surface atoms with a large number dangling bonds on the high energy 001 polar facet for practical treatment of real wastewater with different matrixes the facet tailored tio2 ti electrode exhibits both a high efficiency and a fast kinetics our findings provide a new chance to degrade phenolic pollutants in wastewater and offer atomic scale insights into the preparation modification and application of tio2 based anodic materials

with a high oxygen evolution overpotential lei et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 also the surface modified pbo2 by hydrophobic resin can substantially increase its oxygen evolution overpotential and thus electrochemical mineralization efficiency zhou et al 2005 for the anatase tio2 with low energy 101 non polar facet 0 44 j m 2 the direct electron transfer pathway is widely reported for pollutant degradation even under oh generation cho and hoffmann 2014 cho et al 2014 kesselman et al 1997 kim et al 2014 park et al 2009 park et al 2008a 2008b in comparison the high energy 001 polar facet 0 90 j m 2 with unique surface arrangement and coordination features a higher density of atomic steps edges and kinks of low coordinate surface atoms with a large number dangling bonds these properties govern the surface chemistry i e wetting ability and oxygen bonding strength catalytic reactivity and chemical stability of anatase tio2 liu et al 2014 2011 thus in depth understanding the specific roles of 001 polar facet is of considerable interest for tio2 based electrochemical water treatment in this work the efficiency characteristics and mechanisms of 001 tailored tio2 for electrochemical treatment of water containing phenolic pollutants were explored five p substituted phenols with both electron donating and withdrawing groups were selected as electrochemical signal molecules torres et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 2007 and real effluents with different water matrixes were tested density functional theory dft calculations were carried out to provide atomic scale insights into anodic mechanism in this way new ideas were provided to prepare modify and apply tio2 based anodic materials for electrochemical water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of tio2 ti p25 ti and pbo2 ti electrodes tio2 scs were prepared using a solvothermal method figs s1 and s2 liu et al 2017 polycrystalline tio2 with low energy 101 non polar facet exposed ratio 95 mean particle size of 25 nm anatase rutile 80 20 bet surface area of 50 m2 g 1 were purchased for reference degussa p25 degussa co germany figs s3 and s4 tio2 ti and p25 ti electrodes were prepared by dip coating and calcinating in n2 atmosphere please see si for details pbo2 sno2 sb ti electrode included three layers figs s5 and s6 the ti substrate inner layer the thermally deposited sn sb intermediate layer as protective film and the electrodeposited pbo2 outer layer zhao et al 2010 the intermediate sb sno2 layer between the outer pbo2 layer and the bottom ti metallic support was introduced to protect ti substrate from oxidative deactivation and improve the electric conductivity and the mechanical strength of pbo2 attachment typically saturated pb no3 2 solution mixed with n butyl alcohol was uniformly dispersed on polished ti substrate then dried at 80 c for 10 min finally calcinated at 500 c for 10 min this procedure was repeated for 10 cycles then calcinated at 500 c for 60 min it is recognized that only the outer layer of the electrode is reactive for electrochemical reaction at the electrode electrolyte interface no sb sno2 component was exposed on the as prepared pbo2 electrode for anodic pollutant degradation as confirmed by the xrd and xps measurements fig s6 this result could exclude the possible contribution of the intermediate sb sno2 layer to the outer pbo2 electrolysis 2 2 electrochemical phenol degradation and wastewater treatment tests electrochemical degradation tests were conducted in a galvanostatic mode in a cylindrical single compartment cell equipped with a magnetic stirrer tio2 ti anode of 10 0 cm2 and ti sheet cathode with the same size were assembled with an electrode gap of 1 0 cm into a home made electrolytic reactor with an effective volume of 800 ml after ph adjustment a 500 ml of artificial or practical wastewater and 0 1 m na2so4 as supporting electrolyte was added the concentration of each phenol in artificial wastewater was 300 mg l 1 the practical water included the surface water from chaohu lake china the effluents from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant and a printing and dyeing wastewater treatment plant in hefei china wastewater samples were micro filtered by 0 45 μm membrane and diluted by 0 2 m na2so4 aqueous solution to maintain a sufficient ionic strength and electric conductivity 0 1 m na2so4 fig s4 current density was controlled at 25 50 and 75 ma cm 2 respectively at given time intervals samples were taken for analysis and all tests were conducted in triplicate and the

oxidation electrochemical oxidation of p substituted phenols with both electron donating and withdrawing groups was evaluated at 25 ma cm 2 the degradation of p och3 and p no2 was much faster than p ch3 p cho and p h fig 1 and s7 s10 as the current density was increased the removal efficiencies of p ch3 p cho and p h were improved but still lower than p och3 and p no2 fig 1 and s7 degradation of some phenols did not follow first order reaction kinetics due to their weak surface enrichment fig 2 a compared to the 101 exposed tio2 degussa p25 a much higher anodic activity was observed for the 001 exposed tio2 scs fig 1 s11 and s12 table 1 although it was still lower than for pbo2 benchmark figs s13 and s14 table 1 wu et al 2014 fig 1d illustrates the electrochemical incineration capacity of tio2 scs at 25 ma cm 2 p och3 and p no2 were mainly converted to soluble intermediates liu et al 2011 zhao et al 2010 zhou et al 2005 toc removals were only 37 and 39 for p och3 and p no2 respectively electrochemical conversion was also observed for p ch3 p cho and p h despite of their low toc removals fig 1d at 75 ma cm 2 the mineralization was promoted to 45 75 with less formed polymeric intermediates to understand the electrochemical characteristics for phenol oxidation the relationships between the anodic activity langmuir hinshelwood first order reaction rate constant k with the initial surface concentration of phenols γ the hammett s constant of p substituted groups σ and phenol diffusion coefficient onto electrode d were explored fig 2 and s15 s20 table 1 torres et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 2007 similar to the p25 reference figs s21 and s22 the anodic reactivity k of the phenols on the tio2 scs were highly related with their initial surface enrichment concentrations γ calculated from the linear sweep voltammetry lsv measurements at different scanning rates fig 2a and s15 s17 for example at 50 ma cm 2 the reaction rate constant k was 0 46 0 29 0 37 0 66 and 0 81 h 1 for p h p ch3 p cho p och3 and p no2 respectively with an initial surface concentration γ of 1 65 1 72 1 73 2 73 and 2 87 10 9 mol cm 2 respectively figs s15 s17 the higher reaction rate constant k of lowly enriched p h 0 46 h 1 might be attributed to the higher electron withdrawing property of its p substituted group park et al 2008b such a positive trend was also observed at 25 and 75 ma cm 2 fig 2a no correlation between k and σ was observed fig 2b these relationships indicate that anodic phenol oxidation occurred mainly on tio2 surface and was governed by mass transfer from bulk solution to electrode surface zhu et al 2008 2007 in general the phenols with electron withdrawing groups are more resistant to degradation compared to those with electron donating groups herein the electrochemical reactivity was not correlated with the hammett s constant in a homogeneous mode fig 2b but strongly with the pollutant surface enriching concentration in a heterogeneous mode fig 2a such anodic characteristics of tailored tio2 were similar to pbo2 based on the lsv measurements at different scanning rates figs s23 and s24 on which the surface bound oh mediated oxidation mechanism is proposed zhu et al 2008 moreover the great relationship between the anodic activity k and diffusion coefficient d for phenol degradation provided direct proof for this mechanism fig 2c this unique heterogeneous characteristics were mainly attributed to the localized structural speciation of low potential surface bound oh ohbound e0 1 23 v nhe the main intermediate in water splitting and oxygen evolution the intermediate was generated on the high energy 001 polar facet under anodic polarization due to the strong surface bond strength between tio2 and water as well as oh table 2 and scheme 1 but not the high potential free oh ohfree e0 2 72 v nhe in bulk solution like on boron doped diamond electrode zhu et al 2007 2008 the homogeneous reactivity of oh is correlated with the pollutant s hammett constant torres et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 2007 while the surface anchored oh can attack pre adsorbed pollutants only in heterogeneous mode with a large mass transfer limitation if its high activity thermodynamic nature is taken into account scheme 1 panizza and cerisola 2009 also the stripping by in situ generated oxygen from anodic water decomposition at the given high current density might also contribute to the phenol removal fig 1 and table 1 no intrinsic correlation existed between the reaction rate constant k and the pollutant s hammett constant σ for the five typical p substituted phenols fig 2b thus the relationship between the reaction rate and the pollutant s hammett constant was occasionally featured with a volcanic type curve this could be mainly attributed to the surface bound oh mediated electrochemical oxidation mechanism on the high energy 001 exposed tio2 ti electrode scheme 1 limiting current density i lim of phenols in the tailored tio2 based system was calculated to be 5 25 10 48 5 86 8 33 and 6 59 ma cm 2 respectively figs s18 s20 since the applied current densities i appl were higher than their limiting current densities i lim the phenol anodic degradation was thus under mass transport control with a good stability figs s25 s28 these results are consistent with the degradation trends and the proposed anodic mechanism fig 2 and scheme 1 mce and e c are important parameters to characterize electrochemical water treatment panizza and cerisola 2009 compared to 101 tio2 higher mce and e c were observed on 001 tio2 table 1 mce continuously decreased with the increasing current density due to the intensified oxygen evolution martínez huitle et al 2015 miklos et al 2018 and was lower than that for pbo2 table 1 3 2 mechanisms for anodic phenol oxidation lsv was used to explore the contribution of direct anodic oxidation fig 3 a the anodic overpotential e p of phenols was positively correlated to the hammett s constant σ of p substituted groups with 0 94 v sce for p h 0 72 v sce for p ch3 0 90 v sce for p cho 0 73 v sce for p och3 and 1 00 v sce for p no2 respectively fig 3b the direct electron transfer from p substituted phenols with electron withdrawing groups and deficient electric environment was more difficult than those with electron donating groups and rich electric environment zhu et al 2007 their reaction rate constants k in bulk degradation were correlated to neither e p nor i p in lsv fig 3c and d these results indicate that electrochemical phenol oxidation in bulk degradation did not proceed mainly via direct electron transfer fig 1 instead the oh mediated mechanism occurred scheme 1 the surface bound oh mediated anodic mechanism was elucidated from the relationships between the anodic activity k and initial surface pollutant concentration on anodic material γ as well as hammett s constant of p substituted groups σ fig 2 and scheme 1 torres et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 this mechanism was ascribed mainly to the unique surface chemistry of high energy 001 polar facet such as the super hydrophilic property and the strong affinity for both h2o and oh via surface oh figs s29a c reactions 1 and 2 cho and hoffmann 2014 cho et al 2014 kesselman et al 1997 kim et al 2014 park et al 2008a 2008b 2009 the strong bond strength with oxygen as confirmed by ftir fig s29b made oh strictly bound onto tio2 scs thus attacking the pre adsorbed pollutants only reactions 3 and 4 with a low oxygen evolution overpotential fig s29d reactions 5 and 6 zhu et al 2008 since bulk degradation was under constant current the rate constant should be governed by the selectivity of oh as the primary oxidant 1 tio2 h2o tio2 h2oads tio2 ohads hads 2 tio2 ohads bias tio2 oh ads e 3

determined by using terephthalic acid as a probe molecule fig 4 a qin et al 2018 and a much higher oh concentration was generated on tio2 scs than p25 benchmark but lower than on pbo2 fig 4a s30 and s31 terephthalic acid is widely used as a probe to quantify oh as it could not be oxidized via direct electron transfer for hydroxylation reaction figs s32 s34 thus the formed adduct from terephthalic acid for oh quantification is exclusively attributed to the oh mediated reaction pathway jing and chaplin 2017 the high oh generating capacity of tio2 scs was responsible for superior anodic activity fig 1 zhu et al 2008 although the higher oh generating capacity on 001 tio2 is well documented in photochemical water treatment liu et al 2014 2011 but it is new for electrochemical water treatment due to the different tio2 activation mechanisms and oh structural speciation liu et al 2017 the mechanism to generate oh in photochemical process relies on the valance band activation by uv photons λ 385 nm scheme s1a in comparison the mechanism in electrochemical process mainly relies on the conduction band activation at low anodic bias e eg 3 2 v while the valance band activation might also occur at high anodic bias e eg 3 2 v scheme s1b these are two discrete activation mechanisms for carrier generation and oh formation because in general the electronic structures of conduction band and valance band as well as the wide band gap of 3 2 ev are mainly comprised of o2p and ti3d states at the band edges in tio2 atomic configurations thus in photochemical water treatment oh is generated from h2o oh oxidation by the valance band holes remained in o2p orbital of tio2 configuration hvb scheme s1a in electrochemical water treatment oh is generated from h2o oh oxidation by the conduction band holes present in ti3d orbital of tio2 configuration at low bias hcb or by the conduction band holes in ti 3d orbital and the valance band holes in o2p orbital of tio2 configuration at high bias hcb hvb scheme s1b moreover the structural speciation of generated oh is completely different in photochemical and electrochemical modes on tio2 in photochemical water treatment the high potential free oh ohfree e0 2 72 v nhe is generated for exhaustive decontamination in bulk solution due to the high redox power of valance band holes under uv band gap excitation in electrochemical water treatment the low potential surface bound oh ohbound e0 1 23 v nhe is generated for partial conversion at electrode surface due to the low redox power of conduction band holes under anodic non band gap excitation scheme s1b which plays governing roles in its surface mediated catalytic characteristics scheme 1 to further explore anodic mechanisms on the facet tailored tio2 ti electrode three oh scavengers with distinct natures were respectively used the hydrophobic butyl alcohol which mainly quenchs the dissociated free oh suspended in the diffusion layer due to its low molecular affinity toward hydrophilic tio2 surface kn 1 0 figs s29 and s35 liu et al 2014 zhou et al 2005 decreased phenol degradation by less than 20 fig 4b however the inhibitory effect of butyl alcohol was much enhanced after adding naf to desorb surface adsorbed radicals into aqueous solution figs s36a c the first order reaction rate constant for pnp oxidation was drastically decreased from 0 43 0 81 and 0 96 h 1 to 0 09 0 11 and 0 13 h 1 respectively at 25 50 and 75 ma cm 2 fig s36d their inhibiting ratios of 4 8 7 4 and 7 4 with naf were much higher than those of 1 2 1 1 and 1 1 without naf respectively fig 4b furthermore ki is usually used as a scavenger for both hole and adsorbed oh surface mediated reactive species lai et al 2017 zhu et al 2008 and it reduced the phenol degradation by over 80 fig 4b although the generation and accumulation of iodine radicals i and i2 might contribute to pollutant degradation when ki was introduced figs 4b and s37 they should not be the major oxidants in our electrochemical oxidation system scheme 1 ki can be easily electrochemically oxidized and there was a great possibility that the generated i2 might be strongly deposited onto tio2 ti electrode to occupy surface reactive sites for further pollutant degradation figs s38 s40 thus the decreasing pollutant removal in the presence of ki might be also attributed to its oxidation and the subsequent adsorption of the product on the active sites in addition to its reaction with oh radicals in the solid phase fig 4b from this standpoint ki might indeed be not a good radical scavenger to explore catalytic mechanism although it has been widely used in oxidation systems moreover the inhibitory effects of ki and hydrophobic butyl alcohol with naf were comparable with the hydrophilic methanol fig s41 the most typical oh scavenger from both solid and aqueous phases k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 esr measurements further confirm the inhibiting results in pnp degradation fig s42 these results clearly indicate that the surface bound oh plays a dominant role in p substituted phenols oxidation on the facet tailored tio2 ti electrode scheme 1 and fig 4 while direct electron transfer might also play a minor role even under oh generation and water splitting fig 3 3 3 roles of 001 polar facet in anodic oxidation mechanisms for electrochemical water treatment surface interactions between h2o and tio2 play governing roles in oh generation speciation and pollutant degradation sun et al 2010 wang et al 2017 the central role is whether or not h2o dissociates over tio2 since h2o dissociation can introduce both oh and h and drastically affect tio2 surface chemistry to benefit oh generation and pollutant degradation sun et al 2010 the coordination numbers of surface atoms and their mutual distance critically affect h2o tio2 interactions and the unsaturated ti and o sites play a dominant role in h2o adsorption onto tio2 through ti o and h o bonds sun et al 2010 thus understanding the adsorbed h2o structure and its dissociation to surface oh on tio2 surface is essential wang et al 2017 in comparison with the low energy 101 facet of anatase tio2 50 ti3c 50 ti2c 50 o3c 50 o2c 0 44 j m 2 the surface ti and o atoms on the high energy 001 polar facet are exclusively unsaturated 100 ti2c 100 o2c 0 90 j m 2 liu et al 2014 2011 adsorbed h2o was steered and reoriented by long range electrostatic fields emanated from oxide lattice to activate and deprotonate to generate surface oh in energy transfer and redistribution fig 5 and s43 h2o adsorption energy onto 001 facet was more negative with a higher stability δe ads h2o table 2 which is consistent with ftir results fig s29b after adsorption fig s43a h2o dissociation occurred via transferring a h to nearby surface o2c to form surface terminated oh reaction 7 figs s43b and s43d or ejecting a h to generate h3o with another free h2o reaction 8 figs s43f and s43h 7 tio2 h2o ho tio2 h 8 tio2 h2o h2o tio2 oh h3o e a barrier less process with a negative overall energy change reaction 7 δe eq 7 1 330 ev table 2 was observed on anatase 001 facet for h2o dissociation to generate surface oh fig 5 h2o dissociation was not favorable under other circumstance due to the positive overall energies δe eq 7 on 101 facet as well as δe eq 9 on both 101 and 001 facets table 2 moreover the reduced activation energies e a of h2o dissociation reactions 7 and 8 on 001 facet meant a higher reaction rate for surface oh formation e a eq 7 and e a eq 8 table 2 the energy difference between h2o adsorption structures indicates that the liberated h preferred to bind with the nearby o2c leading to additional surface oh fig 5 and table 2 under anodic polarization the formed surface oh lost an electron to generate surface anchored oh reaction 9 the main active oxygen species for anodic pollutant degradation reactions 3 and 4 panizza and cerisola 2009 9 tio2 ohads bias tio2 oh ads e a much less energy was needed for oh generation on 001 facet the energy changes for reaction 9 were 0 350 ev and 0 913 ev on 001 and 101 facets δe eq 9 table 2 respectively these results are highly consistent with the measured oh fig 4a s30 and s31 the generated oh also exhibited a much higher affinity onto 001 polar facet than 101 analogue and the adsorption energy was calculated to be 17 110 ev and 14 126 ev respectively δe ads oh table 2 dft studies indicate that the high energy ti5c centered 001 polar facet was not only favorable for oh generation but also more affinitive to form surface bound active oxygen species for pollutant degradation fig 1 and table 1 such atomic scale insights could provide critical information to improve the capacity of anodic materials through facet engineering for electrochemical water treatment 3 4 electrochemical treatment of real wastewater the feasibility of using facet tailored tio2 for electrochemical treatment of real wastewater containing phenolic pollutants was further explored fig 6 compared to p25 reference higher removal efficiency and faster reaction kinetics were obtained on the 001 tio2 for wastewater with different matrixes although they were lower than those for pbo2 benchmark fig 6 in 9 h degradation at 25 ma cm 2 the calculated first order reaction rate constants were 0 173 0 306 0 207 0 461 and 0 24 h 1 respectively on the 001 tio2 electrode for real phenolic effluent municipal effluent dying effluents and surface water in comparison they were 0 092 0 246 0 129 0 360 and 0 200 h 1 only on p25 reference fig 6f tio2 anodic activity for electrochemical treatment of real phenol containing wastewater was substantially enhanced by facet engineering strategy such a superiority in both electric conductivity and anodic activity should be attributed mainly to both the single crystalline structure in the bulk and the co exposed 101 001 crystal facets on the surface the single crystalline structure with continuous and ordered atomic and electronic structures is highly favorable for the convenient and rapid charge transfer within the bulk phase due to less grain boundary and interface states lei et al 2010 liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 also the co exposed 101 001 crystal facets can self establish the thermodynamic epitaxial facet junction with type ii band alignment to allow a built in electric field for the effective carrier separation between different exposed facets on the solid surface thus exhibits an enhanced quantum efficiency and catalytic performance zhang et al 2019 compared to the typical commercial dimensionally stable anodes e g pbo2 the high energy 001 exposed tio2 possessed a high stability low cost no toxicity and great safety for electrochemical water treatment all of these advantages endows it a promising anodic material for electrochemical water treatment 4 conclusions in this work the efficiency characteristics and mechanisms of 001 tailored tio2 ti electrode for electrochemical treatment of wastewater containing phenolic pollutants were investigated both artificial wastewater containing p substituted phenols and real wastewater with different water matrixes were selected for five p substituted phenols with both electron donating and withdrawing groups anodic oxidation mainly occurred on 001 tio2 surface and governed by mass transfer the surface bound oh mediated oxidation mechanism was proposed for phenol anodic conversion for real wastewater containing phenolic pollutants both a superior anodic activity and treatment capacity were obtained on 001 tio2 electrode regardless of water matrix dft calculations indicated the dominant roles of high energy 001 facet and single crystalline structure in the surface bound oh mediated mechanism on 001 tio2 electrode for phenol conversion our findings provided an efficient way to treat phenol containing water and wastewater and further to prepare modify and apply tio2 based anodic materials for electrochemical water

18504,membrane biofouling remains a significant challenge in seawater reverse osmosis desalination for drinking water production this study investigated nutrient imbalance as the cause of biofouling in lab scale experiments and carried out a year long field testing at a seawater desalination pilot plant lab experiments showed that growth medium with excess of organic carbon c but with low nitrogen n and phosphorus p accelerated the formation of bacterial biofilm balancing c to n and p ratios by adding n and p to growth medium increased the proliferation of free living cells but reduced attached form of bacteria as biofilm the cell excretion of excess c in the form of extracellular polysaccharides eps was considered as a strategy for nutrient storage for future use cell enzyme activity assays indicated some of the bacteria had enhanced enzyme activities to degrade polysaccharides in the absence of organic c in growth medium possibly using eps in the biofilm a year long field study indicated that accelerated biofouling of seawater reverse osmosis swro membranes was associated with the elevated content of total organic carbon toc in the intake seawater adding n and p to the intake seawater to balance the increase of toc resulted in reduction of membrane biofouling microbial community analysis of the biofouling layer using 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated biofouling communities varied with seasonal changes dosing of n and p did not induce dramatic changes in the fouling microbial community growing on the membrane surface the outcome of this work implies that membrane biofouling associated with the elevated concentration of toc in intake seawater is caused by imbalance of c n p in the source seawater which occurs often during algal blooms addition of n and p to rebalance the nutrients can prevent accelerated swro membrane biofouling keywords membrane desalination reverse osmosis nutrient imbalance biofouling 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro membrane fouling is described as the achilles heel of the membrane processes for water purification and seawater membrane desalination flemming et al 1997 although inorganic organic and bio fouling all contribute to the retardation of the water production and elevation of energy consumption biofouling and associated organic fouling are the most difficult to predict and control in seawater desalination plants ridgway 1991 ridgway and flamming 1996 biofouling is caused by biofilm formation on the ro membrane surface by bacteria that have bypassed the pretreatment the membrane biofilm formation is initiated by organic conditioning of the membrane surface followed by the attachment of individual bacteria and establishment of micro colonies before developing into continuous layers of biofilm bold and district 1998 davies et al 1993 the availability of organic nutrients specifically organic carbon c seems to be the most important factor that influences the formation rate of biofilm on membranes ridgway and flamming 1996 schneider et al 2005 sim et al 2011 tsai et al 2004 vrouwenvelder and kooij 2002 in our previous study huang et al 2013 we investigated the influence of different environmental and water quality parameters on membrane biofilm formation using a flat sheet membrane system fed with a side stream of ultrafiltration pretreated seawater the tests have shown that the increase of organic c concentration in the natural feed seawater from 0 5 mg l to above 1 5 mg l has greatly affected the number of attached cells and the biofilm thickness on ro membranes over the one year study period huang et al 2013 yet the organic c concentration that causes accelerated biofouling in seawater 1 1 5 mg l is only 10 of that commonly found in treated sewage effluent 8 15 mg l used for reclamation by ro membrane process ocsd 2016 biofouling of ro membranes for wastewater reclamation under such condition is not accelerated these results suggest that in addition to the increase of organic c concentration other factors also play a role in accelerated biofilm formation on ro membranes for desalinating seawater contrary to the nutrient enrichment observation in the membrane biofilm formation in the water treatment industries the long standing theory of biofilm formation in clinically important microorganisms is that biofilm formation is triggered by unfavorable conditions including nutrient starvation o toole et al 2000 wai et al 1998 the disparity between such seemingly opposite observations may be due to the nutrient composition required for bacterial growth and biofilm production specifically the ratio of organic c to nitrogen n and to phosphorus p may be important in biofilm formation biofilm is an organic film composed of live and dead microorganisms embedded in a polymer matrix known as extracellular polymeric substances eps characklis and marshall 1990 wingender et al 1999 although proteins and lipids are commonly observed in biofilm retrieved from wastewater treatment facilities and membrane bioreactors polysaccharides are the main component of marine biofilms decho 2000 the growth of marine bacteria depends on the availability of dissolved organic c as an energy and structural c source n and p for replication of nucleic acid synthesis proteins and cell wall for cell division thompson et al 2006 the production and secretion of eps which plays an important role at the initial stage of biofilm formation are at the expense of cellular energy eps production also increases the demand of bioavailable organic c in competition for essential cellular functions and organelle synthesis therefore from a microbial ecology point of view eps production may be a mechanism to store excess organic c that cannot be utilized by the cell for replication due to the lack of n and p limiting nutrients to support cell proliferation this postulation was supported by work by stuart et al who showed that cyanobacteria could reuse extracellular organic c in microbial mats and suggested eps as a pool of extracellular nutrient resources stuart et al 2016 this function may be more common in marine environments where n is limited even during the post algal bloom periods romanı 2009 previous studies on bacterial biofilm growth have indirectly identified the c n p ratio as one of the key factors for eps production and biofilm formation thompson et al 2006 allan et al 2002 fang et al 2009 for example huang et al have reported that polysaccharide secretion by biofilm forming e coli dh5a increased significantly at high c n ratio 10 1 huang et al 1994 thompson et al have tested the effects of the c n p ratio on biofilm formation using enterobacter and citrobacter they have found that higher c n p ratios 334 28 5 6 have resulted in significantly higher numbers of attached cells in both bacterial genera thompson et al 2006 the adherence property of the plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens was enhanced under p limitation despite the lower cell growth rate danhorn et al 2004 the low p concentration was shown to trigger the two component regulatory system phor phob which promoted the biofilm formation danhorn et al 2004 these studies suggest that lower c n p ratios may reduce eps production and the biofilm formation by bacteria past studies have attempted to reduce organic c loading to desalination ro feed seawater to achieve low c n p ratios in order to prevent membrane biofouling huang et al 2013 however the existing technologies for desalination pretreatment including coagulation flocculation microfiltration and ultrafiltration are only effective at removing particulates in water but are inefficient to remove dissolved organic c in fact pressure driven filtrations such as ultrafiltration have been shown to break algal cells during algal blooms to release additional dissolved organic c to support the excess biofilm production jiang and voutchkov 2014 thus the alternative approach to balance organic c n p ratio is to increase n and p concentration in the treated seawater to match the c content without removing it from the feed seawater in this study we have first examined bacterial isolates for biofilm production under different organic c n p composition we then investigated bacterial physiological changes through up regulation of enzyme activities triggered by changes of the c n p composition in growth media in order to develop a practical methodology for modifying organic c n p ratio for desalination membrane fouling prevention we performed a year long study at a desalination pilot facility which included dosing of n and p to the pretreated intake seawater to match the content of organic c in the water and thereby rebalance the c n p ratio 2 materials and methods 2 1 impact of the c n p ratio on bacterial growth and biofilm production six bacteria b1 to b6 isolated from biofouled ro membrane and cartridge filters from the carlsbad desalination pilot plant were used in this study they were identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing in a previous study zhang et al 2012 b1 and b4 were identified as shewanella sp b2 and b3 were nearly identical in 16s rrna gene sequence and were matched to alteromonas sp b5 was identified as cellulophaga sp and b6 matched vibrio sp in the rdp database zhang et al 2012 the bacteria were isolated on artificial seawater medium formulated by john paul aswjp paul 1982 supplemented with 1 mg l peptone and 0 5 mg l yeast extract py the bacteria were grown overnight at room temperature in aswjp py with shaking at 30 rpm harvested by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 1 min the cell pellet was washed with aswjp first to remove any remaining organic nutrient before it was used for biofilm production experiments to characterize bacterial growth and biofilm formation under preset c n p conditions sodium acetate naac was used as the single organic c source in the biofilm formation experiments the inorganic n and p concentrations in the aswjp were modified to match the typical concentrations found in the pacific coast seawater called base concentration in this study the c n p concentrations were varied based on the desired ratio as shown in table 1 in two sets of experiments the highest organic c concentration chosen 8 mg l in the experiments represents the high total organic carbon toc loading condition in the southern california pacific coast seawater e g post algal bloom or after a heavy storm that carries pollution from urban runoff the first set of lab experiments focused on holding the n and p concentrations at a constant value while increasing the organic c concentration from 0 4 mg l 1x to 4 mg l 10x and to 8 mg l 20x experiment ii focused on holding the organic c concentration at 8 mg l biofouling condition while increasing the concentration of n and p from the base level of 0 2 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively to 5x 10x and 20x the base concentration table 1 the cell growth and biofilm biomass assays were performed in clear 96 well microplates round bottom 330 μl well vwr international corp cat 734 1546 briefly washed cell pellets were resuspended and diluted in 1 10 ratio in each modified aswjp medium as shown in table 1 each individual bacterial suspension was inoculated into 8 wells 8 replicates of the microplate the 8 wells in the last column of the plate were inoculated with medium only and were used as the negative control two identical plates were prepared one was used for cell growth measurement by optical density using absorbance wavelength of 550 nm and the other was used for biofilm quantification using the crystal violet assay method alhadidi et al 2012 crystal violet biofilm biomass assay was performed following the protocol of stephanovic et al stepanovic et al 2000 briefly bacterial biofilm on the plate was fixed with methanol stained with crystal violet 2 hucker crystal violet used for gram stain and then released with the bound dye using 33 glacial acetic acid the optical density of the released solution was measured at absorbance wavelength of 590 nm microplates were incubated at 24 c and were read using spectramax plus 384 molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa the average value of eight control wells was used to normalize the average value of each set of 8 wells for individual bacterial strain 2 2 impact of the c n p ratio on bacterial enzyme activities bacterial enzyme activity assays were performed to examine the physiological responses of biofouling bacteria as a result of changing the c n p ratio enzyme assays were carried out using fluorometric assay protocol adapted from saiya corka et al 2002 in black 96 well microplates round bottom 330μl well fisher scientific cat 07 200 627 for β glucosidase bg β n acetylglucosaminidase nag leucine aminopeptidase lap and alkaline phosphatase ap briefly cells were grown in 96 well plates in aswjp py for 48 h under the same condition as for growth and biofilm assay the growth medium together with suspended cells was then carefully removed from each well leaving only the biofilm attached to the plate the wells with biofilm were carefully washed twice using aswjp to remove residual nutrient medium before they were filled with aswjp without adding any organic c the plates were incubated for two more days at room temperature the enzyme activities were first measured in bacterial biofilm grown in rich complex organic nutrient medium immediately after the removal of unattached cells and nutrient medium time zero and then again at 24 h and 48 h when aswjp was used as the only source of nutrients without any addition of organic c the parallel clear 96 well microplates managed under the same condition were used to quantify cell density and biofilm thickness at each time point when enzyme assay were performed 2 3 pilot scale testing of c n p ratio on membrane biofouling a year long field study was set up at the carlsbad desalination pilot facility two flat sheet bio monitoring systems were operated in parallel with the spiral wound ro membrane train of the pilot plant using ultrafiltration pretreated ro feed fig 1 shows the schematic set up of the testing system the system was designed to change the c n p ratio through dosing of n and p rather than reducing natural level of organic c in feed water unit 1 is a control membrane without dosing of n and p while unit 2 is dosed with nh4no3 and na2hpo4 through a pump to final concentrations of 10 mg l and 2 mg l respectively no additional organic c was added to the feed seawater thus the toc concentration in this water reflected the natural variability of toc in the source seawater the toc of the ro intake water was measured using the ge sievers 5310 c on line toc analyzer ge instruments boulder colorado as described by huang et al 2013 the bio monitor consists of a 5 20 cm flat sheet swc5 membrane hydranautics placed directly on top of a plastic support the feed channel was separated by a single piece of 0 87 mm thick nylon spacer the cross section area of the feed channel is 44 mm2 the system was run at cross flow rate of 0 023 m3 h 1 using 42 kpa feed pressure without permeation the flat sheet bio monitor was designed to simulate the cross flow velocity of the seven spiral wound ro membrane elements in the pressure vessels of the pilot plant the membrane was removed from the monitor for analysis every two weeks and was replaced with a new membrane each time after each removal the system was cleaned and rinsed with clean tap water the system was run at the carlsbad desalination pilot facility from june 2010 to july 2011 2 4 determination of membrane biofilm density and thickness the retrieved flat sheet membranes from the bio monitor were examined for biofilm thickness and total bacterial cell counts on the membrane surface by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm zeiss lsm 510 meta briefly membranes were cut into 1 cm 1 cm squares and stained using syto 9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain for detecting live bacteria and propidium iodide red fluorescent nucleic acid stain filmtracer live dead biofilm viability kit invitrogen carlsbad ca for detecting dead bacteria the stained membranes were then mounted onto a glass slide and observed under the clsm excitation emission wavelengths of 488nm 500 nm were used for syto 9 and 510nm 635 nm were used for propidium iodide respectively images captured at each wavelength were composited into one final image the z sectioning method was used to determine the thickness of the biofilm the thickness was calculated from 10 images captured cross the diagonal section of the membrane by locating the highest point above each pixel in the bottom layer containing biomass heydorn et al 2000 bacterial colonization was evaluated by visually counting the number of cells attached to the membranes surface and was determined by the average counts from 10 images for each sample 2 5 analysis of bacterial community on the membranes to identify the bacteria colonizing the membrane surfaces four sets membrane samples 4 controls and 4 dosed with n and p were collected each in autumn winter spring and summer season and were used for bacterial community analysis approximately 2 2cm area of each membrane surface was swabbed for biofilm biomass the genomic dna was extracted and used for pcr of 16s rrna gene using primers targeting the v7 v9 939f 1492r region bacterial tag encoded flx amplicon pyrosequencing btefap roche nj usa was performed by the research and testing laboratory tx usa the sequences from pyrosequencing were analyzed using qiime quantitative insights into microbial ecology pipeline caporaso et al 2010 low quality sequences 25 and short sequences 200bp were filtered and removed sequences with 97 similarity were clustered and defined as an operational taxonomic unit otu representative sequences from each otu were aligned and assigned to taxonomic identity using rdp classifier cole et al 2005 the microbial communities were compared using the taxonomic and phylogenetic assignments beta diversity was plotted in principal coordinate analysis pcoa to identify the community diversity between membrane samples 3 results 3 1 impact of c n p ratio on bacterial growth and biofilm production the cell density and biofilm biomass in response to increased organic c in the growth medium are shown in fig 2 changes in cell and biofilm densities are expressed as the ratio of the measurements at a specific nutrient condition to those at the base nutrient concentration of c n p 1 1 1 which is set as 1 with the increase of c by adding naac concentration from 1x 0 4 mg l to 20x 8 mg l in growth medium the cell density od550 ratio had minimal changes p 0 01 this result showed although bacterial isolates could use naac as the single organic c source the cell growth was limited by other nutrients however the biofilm biomass od590 ratio increased significantly p 0 01 in bacteria b1 and b2 when organic c in the growth medium increased from 0 4 mg l to 8 mg l 20x fig 2 this result indicated these two strains actively converted organic c to biofilm content eps in the presence of high concentration of organic c in the medium fig 3 shows the results from experiment ii in which n and p concentrations increased from 1x 0 2 mg l nh4no3 0 05 mg l na2hpo4 respectively to 20x with the fixed naac concentration at 20x 8 mg l increases in p and n concentrations resulted in increases in bacterial growth the cell density was about 30 higher at 20x n p concentration than those at base n p concentration suggesting n p additions promoted the proliferation of free living cells however the biofilm biomass od590 decreased significantly p 0 01 for four of six bacteria tested strain b1 b2 b4 and b5 at the higher n p concentrations there was a dramatic drop more than 50 in biofilm biomass once the n p reached 5x of the base concentration for bacteria b1 b4 and b5 bacteria strain b3 and b6 generated low level of biofilm at all n p concentrations 3 2 enzymatic activities in the presence of low organic carbon bacterial enzymatic activities were measured to determine bacteria s ability to use biofilm as nutrient when organic c was removed from the seawater growth medium the bacterial enzyme activities following the removal of organic c are presented in fig 4 up regulation of all four degradation enzymes was observed for bacterial b2 b3 also displayed enhanced activities for β glucosidase bg and leucine aminopeptidase lap enzyme activities decreased in bacterial b4 and b5 only had elevation in leucine aminopeptidase lap activity these results indicated that some bacteria could utilize the nutrients stored in the biofilm for cell activities but not all bacteria could 3 3 field experiments with bio monitoring system the year long monitoring of water quality and biofouling potential at the carlsbad desalination pilot plant showed that toc of the feed seawater varied between 0 03 and 2 mg l 30 ppb and 2000 ppb increases in toc concentration in the intake raw seawater were observed several times over the year these increases were mainly associated with land runoffs after rainfall events fig 5 higher biofilm thickness and cell counts were observed on the control u1 membranes that were collected on the dates with elevated organic c in the feed water as indicated by the upward trend in fitted lines in fig 5 in comparison membranes recovered from bio monitor unit 2 u2 where n and p were dosed into the feed water did not experience dramatic increases in biofilm thickness or total cell counts as indicated by the relatively flat fitted line fig 5 both the biofilm thickness and cell counts on u2 membranes were fairly constant over the one year study period clsm images fig 6 also revealed that there was an observable difference between the flat sheet ro membrane retrieved from the control unit u1 fig 6a and the one from the n p dosed unit u2 fig 6b during the period of high toc measurements in feed water jan 6 2011 3 4 analysis of biofilm bacteria community on ro membranes by 16s rrna gene the relationship between membrane biofouling the bacterial community and the change of water quality seasonality was determined using 16s rrna gene sequence analyses fig 7 a total of 18728 qualified pyrosequencing reads of the v7 v9 regions of the 16s rrna gene were obtained from the eight membrane samples collected between september 2010 and june 2011 sequences were clustered into a total of 1778 otus by complete linkage clustering among them 95 otus matched rdp database and were assigned the taxonomic identities table s1 the bacterial composition varied among samples retrieved from different seasons of the 1206 otus that were assigned taxonomy data only 15 of them were observed on all membranes and 396 of them were presented in a single set of samples taxonomy assignment for the top 10 most abundant classes of microorganism is shown in fig 7 samples are labeled using membrane retrieval dates for example u1 9 16 10 is the biomass from membrane unit 1 untreated control unit retrieved on sept 16 2010 and u2 9 16 10 is the biomass from membrane unit 2 treated by n p dosing retrieved on the same date alpha gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteria dominated membrane biofilm communities with the combined abundance of 60 80 in all samples the most severe membrane fouling was observed on u1 3 2 11 that was retrieved during the period of high toc concentration in the feed water the abundance of gammaproteobacteria increased significantly on this membrane in comparison with other membranes pcoa plot of beta diversity showed microbial biofilm composition was unique for each season fig 8 biofouling communities collected during autumn winter spring and summer seasons were spread across the four different coordinates of the pcoa plot however samples collected from control unit u1 and treatment unit u2 were clustered together indicating nutrient dosing did not change the biofilm composition significantly but reduced the level of biofouling 4 discussion the results from bench top experiments using variable c n p composition media seawater for cultivating marine biofouling bacteria support the hypothesis that excess organic c to n and p promotes the formation of microbial biofilm by marine bacteria on the other hand increasing n p concentration in the medium in the presence of bioavailable organic c promotes cell proliferation but reduces biofilm formation we attribute the reduction of biofilm to the utilization of organic c in support of cell growth in the presence of n and p for synthesis of proteins lipids and the other cell components based on our knowledge on nutrient compositions and bacterial growth touratier et al 1999 in the absence of sufficient n and or p limiting nutrients to support protein synthesis and cell proliferation we observed bacterial excretion of the excess organic c as biofilm in both the bench scale experiments and the pilot scale membrane fouling studies the bacterial enzyme activity assay results in part support the hypothesis that the biofilm formation may be a nutrient storage mechanism for future use in low carbon conditions this result agrees with a previous study demonstrating trace isotopically labeled eps uptake into single cells of cyanobacteria stuart et al 2016 although we were not able to directly trace the uptake of c from biofilm eps into cell biomass the results of enzyme activity assays indicated that at least some of the bacteria could utilize nutrients in biofilm for active growth future research such as isotopically labeled c tracer studies is necessary to directly assess the role of biofilm as potential nutrient source for bacterial metabolic function under different environmental conditions the field experiments using two parallel tests with ro feed stream from a desalination pilot plant further confirmed the importance of the c n p ratio in formation of membrane biofilm the year long study confirmed that toc increase in source water was the cause to trigger accelerated biofouling this observation agrees with previous studies showing that elevation of organic c is the cause of biofilm production and a major culprit for membrane biofouling ridgway and flamming 1996 schneider et al 2005 sim et al 2011 tsai et al 2004 vrouwenvelder and kooij 2002 the field experiments in the pilot plant demonstrated for the first time that n and p dosing in the feed stream could reduce biofouling on membrane surface the biofilm formation on membrane surface under the shear of flow should be viewed as a dynamic process in which biofilm accumulation production detachment attachment hunt et al 2004 the rate of direct bacterial attachment on the membrane was expected to be low because the bacterial concentration in the uf pretreated feed water was low 103 l huang et al 2013 thus the lower density of biofilm observed in the membrane unit with balanced c n p seawater feed is attributed to the slower rate of biofilm formation our observations showed that the addition of n and p to balance the c content in the source seawater reduced the available organic c for eps production as also demonstrated in the bench scale experiments accelerated biofilm detachment or sloughing under balanced c n p concentration could also play a part in the change of biofilm quantity which was documented in a study of nutrient induced p aeruginosa biofilm dispersion sauer et al 2004 this study showed that the increased concentration of inorganic n triggered up regulation of flagella gene expression which led to enhanced biofilm detachment under flow shear sauer et al 2004 overall the reduced biofilm thickness and cell counts on n p treated membrane unit in the field experiment coincided with the results observed in the laboratory tests of bacterial growth and biofilm production in defined c n p nutrient media both results suggest balancing the ratio of total organic c with the addition of n and p can be a strategy to reduce membrane biofouling during periods with excess organic loading however the practical application of such approach is seriously challenging because the excess n and p in the feed stream will end up in the brine reject and eventually be discharged back to the ocean the excess nutrient loading could trigger new algal blooms and other negative environmental consequences a nutrient trapping technology in brine reject e g using a biofiltration system will be needed before n and p dosing can be considered for membrane fouling mitigation the ro membrane biofouling microbial community analyses results agree with previous work indicating that gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria are the most dominant bacteria classes of membrane surface biofilm zhang et al 2012 seasonal shifts of biofouling microbial communities on membrane surface reflect the well known seasonal succession of marine bacterial plankton bunse and pinhassi 2017 complex physical chemical and biological factors influence marine microbial communities in time and space differential adaptation or sensitivity to variability in these factors is likely to determine the dynamics of the functional and taxonomic phylogenetic diversity of bacterioplankton manual dosing of n and p in the feed water can also influence the microbial composition for example ovreas et al have shown that the addition of organic c n and p in seawater lead to the increase in population of gammaproteobacteria and a smaller increase in alphaproteobacteria ovreas et al 2003 the results of the current study indicate the changes of microbial composition due to dosing of n p are less significant than the seasonal shift of natural microbial community in feed water the diverse microbial composition recovered from the membrane surface also indicates that there is no single or a few bacterial species that are responsible for the biofilm formation the reduction of membrane biofilm using n p dosing implies that such management action has a broad effect in suppressing the biofilm formation by a diverse biofouling community further investigation such as gene expression analysis could shed new lights on the molecular mechanism of the n p dosing on biofilm formation 5 conclusions results of laboratory studies showed that dosing n and p in the presence of high organic c promoted replication of marine bacteria but reduced biofilm formation when organic c was removed from the culture medium source seawater some of the marine bacteria could utilize nutrients in the biofilm for growth as indicated by elevated enzyme activities a year long field study demonstrated that dosing n and p to feed seawater could reduce the thickness of biofilm on the membrane surface during conditions of elevated toc concentration in the feed water analysis of biofilm bacterial community revealed that the biofouling bacteria were influenced by the seasonal changes in water quality n and p dosing did not change the fouling microbial composition

18504,membrane biofouling remains a significant challenge in seawater reverse osmosis desalination for drinking water production this study investigated nutrient imbalance as the cause of biofouling in lab scale experiments and carried out a year long field testing at a seawater desalination pilot plant lab experiments showed that growth medium with excess of organic carbon c but with low nitrogen n and phosphorus p accelerated the formation of bacterial biofilm balancing c to n and p ratios by adding n and p to growth medium increased the proliferation of free living cells but reduced attached form of bacteria as biofilm the cell excretion of excess c in the form of extracellular polysaccharides eps was considered as a strategy for nutrient storage for future use cell enzyme activity assays indicated some of the bacteria had enhanced enzyme activities to degrade polysaccharides in the absence of organic c in growth medium possibly using eps in the biofilm a year long field study indicated that accelerated biofouling of seawater reverse osmosis swro membranes was associated with the elevated content of total organic carbon toc in the intake seawater adding n and p to the intake seawater to balance the increase of toc resulted in reduction of membrane biofouling microbial community analysis of the biofouling layer using 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated biofouling communities varied with seasonal changes dosing of n and p did not induce dramatic changes in the fouling microbial community growing on the membrane surface the outcome of this work implies that membrane biofouling associated with the elevated concentration of toc in intake seawater is caused by imbalance of c n p in the source seawater which occurs often during algal blooms addition of n and p to rebalance the nutrients can prevent accelerated swro membrane biofouling keywords membrane desalination reverse osmosis nutrient imbalance biofouling 1 introduction reverse osmosis ro membrane fouling is described as the achilles heel of the membrane processes for water purification and seawater membrane desalination flemming et al 1997 although inorganic organic and bio fouling all contribute to the retardation of the water production and elevation of energy consumption biofouling and associated organic fouling are the most difficult to predict and control in seawater desalination plants ridgway 1991 ridgway and flamming 1996 biofouling is caused by biofilm formation on the ro membrane surface by bacteria that have bypassed the pretreatment the membrane biofilm formation is initiated by organic conditioning of the membrane surface followed by the attachment of individual bacteria and establishment of micro colonies before developing into continuous layers of biofilm bold and district 1998 davies et al 1993 the availability of organic nutrients specifically organic carbon c seems to be the most important factor that influences the formation rate of biofilm on membranes ridgway and flamming 1996 schneider et al 2005 sim et al 2011 tsai et al 2004 vrouwenvelder and kooij 2002 in our previous study huang et al 2013 we investigated the influence of different environmental and water quality parameters on membrane biofilm formation using a flat sheet membrane system fed with a side stream of ultrafiltration pretreated seawater the tests have shown that the increase of organic c concentration in the natural feed seawater from 0 5 mg l to above 1 5 mg l has greatly affected the number of attached cells and the biofilm thickness on ro membranes over the one year study period huang et al 2013 yet the organic c concentration that causes accelerated biofouling in seawater 1 1 5 mg l is only 10 of that commonly found in treated sewage effluent 8 15 mg l used for reclamation by ro membrane process ocsd 2016 biofouling of ro membranes for wastewater reclamation under such condition is not accelerated these results suggest that in addition to the increase of organic c concentration other factors also play a role in accelerated biofilm formation on ro membranes for desalinating seawater contrary to the nutrient enrichment observation in the membrane biofilm formation in the water treatment industries the long standing theory of biofilm formation in clinically important microorganisms is that biofilm formation is triggered by unfavorable conditions including nutrient starvation o toole et al 2000 wai et al 1998 the disparity between such seemingly opposite observations may be due to the nutrient composition required for bacterial growth and biofilm production specifically the ratio of organic c to nitrogen n and to phosphorus p may be important in biofilm formation biofilm is an organic film composed of live and dead microorganisms embedded in a polymer matrix known as extracellular polymeric substances eps characklis and marshall 1990 wingender et al 1999 although proteins and lipids are commonly observed in biofilm retrieved from wastewater treatment facilities and membrane bioreactors polysaccharides are the main component of marine biofilms decho 2000 the growth of marine bacteria depends on the availability of dissolved organic c as an energy and structural c source n and p for replication of nucleic acid synthesis proteins and cell wall for cell division thompson et al 2006 the production and secretion of eps which plays an important role at the initial stage of biofilm formation are at the expense of cellular energy eps production also increases the demand of bioavailable organic c in competition for essential cellular functions and organelle synthesis therefore from a microbial ecology point of view eps production may be a mechanism to store excess organic c that cannot be utilized by the cell for replication due to the lack of n and p limiting nutrients to support cell proliferation this postulation was supported by work by stuart et al who showed that cyanobacteria could reuse extracellular organic c in microbial mats and suggested eps as a pool of extracellular nutrient resources stuart et al 2016 this function may be more common in marine environments where n is limited even during the post algal bloom periods romanı 2009 previous studies on bacterial biofilm growth have indirectly identified the c n p ratio as one of the key factors for eps production and biofilm formation thompson et al 2006 allan et al 2002 fang et al 2009 for example huang et al have reported that polysaccharide secretion by biofilm forming e coli dh5a increased significantly at high c n ratio 10 1 huang et al 1994 thompson et al have tested the effects of the c n p ratio on biofilm formation using enterobacter and citrobacter they have found that higher c n p ratios 334 28 5 6 have resulted in significantly higher numbers of attached cells in both bacterial genera thompson et al 2006 the adherence property of the plant pathogen agrobacterium tumefaciens was enhanced under p limitation despite the lower cell growth rate danhorn et al 2004 the low p concentration was shown to trigger the two component regulatory system phor phob which promoted the biofilm formation danhorn et al 2004 these studies suggest that lower c n p ratios may reduce eps production and the biofilm formation by bacteria past studies have attempted to reduce organic c loading to desalination ro feed seawater to achieve low c n p ratios in order to prevent membrane biofouling huang et al 2013 however the existing technologies for desalination pretreatment including coagulation flocculation microfiltration and ultrafiltration are only effective at removing particulates in water but are inefficient to remove dissolved organic c in fact pressure driven filtrations such as ultrafiltration have been shown to break algal cells during algal blooms to release additional dissolved organic c to support the excess biofilm production jiang and voutchkov 2014 thus the alternative approach to balance organic c n p ratio is to increase n and p concentration in the treated seawater to match the c content without removing it from the feed seawater in this study we have first examined bacterial isolates for biofilm production under different organic c n p composition we then investigated bacterial physiological changes through up regulation of enzyme activities triggered by changes of the c n p composition in growth media in order to develop a practical methodology for modifying organic c n p ratio for desalination membrane fouling prevention we performed a year long study at a desalination pilot facility which included dosing of n and p to the pretreated intake seawater to match the content of organic c in the water and thereby rebalance the c n p ratio 2 materials and methods 2 1 impact of the c n p ratio on bacterial growth and biofilm production six bacteria b1 to b6 isolated from biofouled ro membrane and cartridge filters from the carlsbad desalination pilot plant were used in this study they were identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing in a previous study zhang et al 2012 b1 and b4 were identified as shewanella sp b2 and b3

isolated on artificial seawater medium formulated by john paul aswjp paul 1982 supplemented with 1 mg l peptone and 0 5 mg l yeast extract py the bacteria were grown overnight at room temperature in aswjp py with shaking at 30 rpm harvested by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 1 min the cell pellet was washed with aswjp first to remove any remaining organic nutrient before it was used for biofilm production experiments to characterize bacterial growth and biofilm formation under preset c n p conditions sodium acetate naac was used as the single organic c source in the biofilm formation experiments the inorganic n and p concentrations in the aswjp were modified to match the typical concentrations found in the pacific coast seawater called base concentration in this study the c n p concentrations were varied based on the desired ratio as shown in table 1 in two sets of experiments the highest organic c concentration chosen 8 mg l in the experiments represents the high total organic carbon toc loading condition in the southern california pacific coast seawater e g post algal bloom or after a heavy storm that carries pollution from urban runoff the first set of lab experiments focused on holding the n and p concentrations at a constant value while increasing the organic c concentration from 0 4 mg l 1x to 4 mg l 10x and to 8 mg l 20x experiment ii focused on holding the organic c concentration at 8 mg l biofouling condition while increasing the concentration of n and p from the base level of 0 2 mg l and 0 05 mg l respectively to 5x 10x and 20x the base concentration table 1 the cell growth and biofilm biomass assays were performed in clear 96 well microplates round bottom 330 μl well vwr international corp cat 734 1546 briefly washed cell pellets were resuspended and diluted in 1 10 ratio in each modified aswjp medium as shown in table 1 each individual bacterial suspension was inoculated into 8 wells 8 replicates of the microplate the 8 wells in the last column of the plate were inoculated with medium only and were used as the negative control two identical plates were prepared one was used for cell growth measurement by optical density using absorbance wavelength of 550 nm and the other was used for biofilm quantification using the crystal violet assay method alhadidi et al 2012 crystal violet biofilm biomass assay was performed following the protocol of stephanovic et al stepanovic et al 2000 briefly bacterial biofilm on the plate was fixed with methanol stained with crystal violet 2 hucker crystal violet used for gram stain and then released with the bound dye using 33 glacial acetic acid the optical density of the released solution was measured at absorbance wavelength of 590 nm microplates were incubated at 24 c and were read using spectramax plus 384 molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa the average value of eight control wells was used to normalize the average value of each set of 8 wells for individual bacterial strain 2 2 impact of the c n p ratio on bacterial enzyme activities bacterial enzyme activity assays were performed to examine the physiological responses of biofouling bacteria as a result of changing the c n p ratio enzyme assays were carried out using fluorometric assay protocol adapted from saiya corka et al 2002 in black 96 well microplates round bottom 330μl well fisher scientific cat

condition as for growth and biofilm assay the growth medium together with suspended cells was then carefully removed from each well leaving only the biofilm attached to the plate the wells with biofilm were carefully washed twice using aswjp to remove residual nutrient medium before they were filled with aswjp without adding any organic c the plates were incubated for two more days at room temperature the enzyme activities were first measured in bacterial biofilm grown in rich complex organic nutrient medium immediately after the removal of unattached cells and nutrient medium time zero and then again at 24 h and 48 h when aswjp was used as the only source of nutrients without any addition of organic c the parallel clear 96 well microplates managed under the same condition were used to quantify cell density and biofilm thickness at each time point when enzyme assay were performed 2 3 pilot scale testing of c n p ratio on membrane biofouling a year long field study was set up at the carlsbad desalination pilot facility two flat sheet bio monitoring systems were operated in parallel with the spiral wound ro membrane train of the pilot plant using ultrafiltration pretreated ro feed fig 1 shows the schematic set up of the testing system the system was designed to change the c n p ratio through dosing of n and p rather than reducing natural level of organic c in feed water unit 1 is a control membrane without dosing of n and p while unit 2 is dosed with nh4no3 and na2hpo4 through a pump to final concentrations of 10 mg l and 2 mg l respectively no additional organic c was added to the feed seawater thus the toc concentration in this water reflected the natural variability of toc in the source seawater the toc of the ro intake water was measured using the ge sievers 5310 c on line toc analyzer ge instruments boulder colorado as described by huang et al 2013 the bio monitor consists of a 5 20 cm flat sheet swc5 membrane hydranautics placed directly on top of a plastic support the feed channel was separated by a single piece of 0 87 mm thick nylon spacer the cross section area of the feed channel is 44 mm2 the system was run at cross flow rate of 0 023 m3 h

containing biomass heydorn et al 2000 bacterial colonization was evaluated by visually counting the number of cells attached to the membranes surface and was determined by the average counts from 10 images for each sample 2 5 analysis of bacterial community on the membranes to identify the bacteria colonizing the membrane surfaces four sets membrane samples 4 controls and 4 dosed with n and p were collected each in autumn winter spring and summer season and were used for bacterial community analysis approximately 2 2cm area of each membrane surface was swabbed for biofilm biomass the

biomass in response to increased organic c in the growth medium are shown in fig 2 changes in cell and biofilm densities are expressed as the ratio of the measurements at a specific nutrient condition to those at the base nutrient concentration of c n p 1 1 1 which is set as 1 with the increase of c by adding naac concentration from 1x 0 4 mg l to 20x 8 mg l in growth medium the cell density od550 ratio had minimal changes p 0 01 this result showed although bacterial isolates could use naac as the single organic c source the cell growth was limited by other nutrients however the biofilm biomass od590 ratio increased significantly p 0 01 in bacteria b1 and b2 when organic c in the growth medium increased from 0 4 mg l to 8 mg l 20x fig 2 this result indicated these two strains actively converted organic c to biofilm content eps in the presence of high concentration of organic c in the medium fig 3 shows the results from experiment ii in which n and p concentrations increased from 1x 0 2 mg l nh4no3 0 05 mg l na2hpo4 respectively to 20x with the fixed naac concentration at 20x 8 mg l increases in p and n concentrations resulted in increases in bacterial growth the cell density was about 30 higher at 20x n p concentration than those at base n p concentration suggesting n p additions promoted the proliferation of free living cells however the biofilm biomass od590 decreased significantly p 0 01 for four of six bacteria tested strain b1 b2 b4 and b5 at the higher n p concentrations there was a dramatic drop more than 50 in biofilm biomass once the n p reached 5x of the base concentration for bacteria b1 b4 and b5 bacteria strain b3 and b6 generated low level of biofilm at all n p concentrations 3 2 enzymatic activities in the presence of low organic carbon bacterial enzymatic activities were measured to determine bacteria s ability to use biofilm as nutrient when organic c was removed from the seawater growth medium the bacterial enzyme activities following the removal of organic c are presented in fig 4 up regulation of all four degradation enzymes was observed for bacterial b2 b3 also displayed enhanced activities for β glucosidase bg and leucine aminopeptidase lap enzyme activities decreased in bacterial b4 and b5 only had elevation in leucine aminopeptidase lap activity these results indicated that some bacteria could utilize the nutrients stored in the biofilm for cell activities but not all bacteria could 3 3 field experiments with bio monitoring system the year long monitoring of water quality and biofouling potential at the carlsbad desalination pilot plant showed that toc of the feed seawater varied between 0 03 and 2 mg l 30 ppb and 2000 ppb increases in toc concentration in the intake raw seawater were observed several times over the year these increases were mainly associated with land runoffs after rainfall events fig 5 higher biofilm thickness and cell counts were observed on the control u1 membranes that were collected on the dates with elevated organic c in the feed water as indicated by the upward trend in fitted lines in fig 5 in comparison membranes recovered from bio monitor unit 2 u2 where n and p were dosed into the feed water did not experience dramatic increases in biofilm thickness or total cell counts as indicated by the relatively flat fitted line fig 5 both the biofilm thickness and cell counts on u2 membranes were fairly constant over the one year study period clsm images fig 6 also revealed that there was an observable difference between the flat sheet ro membrane retrieved from the control unit u1 fig 6a and the one from the n p dosed unit u2 fig 6b during the period of high toc measurements in feed water jan 6 2011 3 4 analysis of biofilm bacteria community on ro membranes by 16s rrna gene the relationship between membrane biofouling the bacterial community and the change of water quality seasonality was determined using 16s rrna gene sequence analyses fig 7 a total of 18728 qualified pyrosequencing reads of the v7 v9 regions of the 16s rrna gene were obtained from the eight membrane samples collected between september 2010 and june 2011 sequences were clustered into a total of 1778 otus by complete linkage clustering among them 95 otus matched rdp database and were assigned the taxonomic identities table s1 the bacterial composition varied among samples retrieved from different seasons of the 1206 otus that were assigned taxonomy data only 15 of them were observed on all membranes and 396 of them were presented in a single set of samples taxonomy assignment for the top 10 most abundant classes of microorganism is shown in fig 7 samples are labeled using membrane retrieval dates for example u1 9 16 10 is the biomass from membrane unit 1 untreated control unit retrieved on sept 16 2010 and u2 9 16 10 is the biomass from membrane unit 2 treated by n p dosing retrieved on the same date alpha gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteria dominated membrane biofilm communities with the combined abundance of 60 80 in all samples the most severe membrane fouling was observed on u1 3 2 11 that was retrieved during the period of high toc concentration in the feed water the abundance of gammaproteobacteria increased significantly on this membrane in comparison with other membranes pcoa plot of beta diversity showed microbial biofilm composition was unique for each season fig 8 biofouling communities collected during autumn winter spring and summer seasons were spread across the four different coordinates of the pcoa plot however samples collected from control unit u1 and treatment unit u2 were clustered together indicating nutrient dosing did not change the biofilm composition significantly but reduced the level of biofouling 4 discussion the results from bench top experiments using variable c n p composition media seawater for cultivating marine biofouling bacteria support the hypothesis that excess organic c to n and p promotes the formation of microbial biofilm by marine bacteria on the other hand increasing n p concentration in the medium in the presence of bioavailable organic c promotes cell proliferation but reduces biofilm formation we attribute the reduction of biofilm to the utilization of organic c in support of cell growth in the presence of n and p for synthesis of proteins lipids and the other cell components based on our knowledge on nutrient compositions and bacterial growth touratier et al 1999 in the absence of sufficient n and or p limiting nutrients to support protein synthesis and cell proliferation we observed bacterial excretion of the excess organic c as biofilm in both the bench scale experiments and the pilot scale membrane fouling studies the bacterial enzyme activity assay results in part support the hypothesis that the biofilm formation may be a nutrient storage mechanism for future use in low carbon conditions this result agrees with a previous study demonstrating trace isotopically labeled eps uptake into single cells of cyanobacteria stuart et al 2016 although we were not able to directly trace the uptake of c from biofilm eps into cell biomass the results of enzyme activity assays indicated that at least some of the bacteria could utilize nutrients in biofilm for active growth future research such as isotopically labeled c tracer studies is necessary to directly assess the role of biofilm as potential nutrient source for bacterial metabolic function under different environmental conditions the field experiments using two parallel tests with ro feed stream from a desalination pilot plant further confirmed the importance of the c n p ratio in formation of membrane biofilm the year long study confirmed that toc increase in source water was the cause to trigger accelerated biofouling this observation agrees with previous studies showing that elevation of organic c is the cause of biofilm production and a major culprit for membrane biofouling ridgway and flamming 1996 schneider et al 2005 sim et al 2011 tsai et al 2004 vrouwenvelder and kooij 2002 the field experiments in the pilot plant demonstrated for the first time that n and p dosing in the feed stream could reduce biofouling on membrane surface the biofilm formation on membrane surface under the shear of flow should be viewed as a dynamic process in which biofilm accumulation production detachment attachment hunt et al 2004 the rate of direct bacterial attachment on the membrane was expected to be low because the bacterial concentration in the uf pretreated feed water was low 103 l huang et al 2013 thus the lower density of biofilm observed in the membrane unit with balanced c n p seawater feed is attributed to the slower rate of biofilm formation our observations showed that the addition of n and p to balance the c content in the source seawater reduced the available organic c for eps production as also demonstrated in the bench scale experiments accelerated biofilm detachment or sloughing under balanced c n p concentration could also play a part in the change of biofilm quantity which was documented in a study of nutrient induced p aeruginosa biofilm dispersion sauer et al 2004 this study showed that the increased concentration of inorganic n triggered up regulation of flagella gene expression which led to enhanced biofilm detachment under flow shear sauer et al 2004 overall the reduced biofilm thickness and cell counts on n p treated membrane unit in the field experiment coincided with the results observed in the laboratory tests of bacterial growth and biofilm production in defined c n p nutrient media both results suggest balancing the ratio of total organic c with the addition of n and p can be a strategy to reduce membrane biofouling during periods with excess organic loading however the practical application of such approach is seriously challenging because the excess n and p in the feed stream will end up in the brine reject and eventually be discharged back to the ocean the excess nutrient loading could trigger new algal blooms and other negative environmental consequences a nutrient trapping technology in brine reject e g using a biofiltration system will be needed before n and p dosing can be considered for membrane fouling mitigation the ro membrane biofouling microbial community analyses results agree with previous work indicating that gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria are the most dominant bacteria classes of membrane surface biofilm zhang et al 2012 seasonal shifts of biofouling microbial communities on membrane surface reflect the well known seasonal succession of marine bacterial plankton bunse and pinhassi 2017 complex physical chemical and biological factors influence marine microbial communities in time and space differential adaptation or sensitivity to variability in these factors is likely to determine the dynamics of the functional and taxonomic phylogenetic diversity of bacterioplankton manual dosing of n and p in the feed water can also influence the microbial composition for example ovreas et al have shown that the addition of organic c n and p in seawater lead to the increase in population of gammaproteobacteria and a smaller increase in alphaproteobacteria ovreas et al 2003 the results of the current study indicate the changes of microbial composition due to dosing of n p are less significant than the seasonal shift of natural microbial community in feed water the diverse microbial composition recovered from the membrane surface also indicates that there is no single or a few bacterial species that are responsible for the biofilm formation the reduction of membrane biofilm using n p dosing implies that such management action has a broad effect in suppressing the biofilm formation by a diverse biofouling community further investigation such as gene expression analysis could shed new lights on the molecular mechanism of the n p dosing on biofilm formation 5 conclusions results of laboratory studies showed that dosing n and p in the presence of high organic c promoted replication of marine bacteria but reduced biofilm formation when organic c was removed from the culture medium source seawater some of the marine bacteria could utilize nutrients in the biofilm for growth as indicated by elevated enzyme activities a year long field study demonstrated that dosing n and p to feed seawater could reduce the thickness of biofilm on the membrane surface during conditions of elevated toc concentration in the feed water analysis of biofilm bacterial community revealed that the biofouling bacteria were influenced by the seasonal changes in water quality n and p dosing did not change the fouling microbial composition
