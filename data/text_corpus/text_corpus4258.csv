fields for instance slender underwater vehicles marine pipelines side scan sonar towed streamer cables etc from a practical perspective long slender cylinders serve well as acute undersea listening devices because their prolonged length supports a wide acoustic aperture towed arrays or streamers are excellent examples that navy scientists and oceanographers use for undersea defense detection as well as for mapping the seafloor topography and stratification of the sub seafloor sediments a sonar array may have a very large ratio of length to radius up to o 105 with a radius in the order of centimeters and a length of a kilometer or more the axial flow over a long cylinder can be divided into three regimes e g leading edge flow developing boundary layer flow and developed boundary layer flow fig 1 in the leading edge flow regime the flow separates from the leading edge and reattaches on the cylinder surface forming a laminar separation bubble at the leading edge the separation bubble is characterized by strong recirculation and strong fluctuating pressure after the reattachment the boundary layer develops and the thickness of the boundary layer rapidly grows downstream which can be called developing boundary layer flow the growth of the boundary layer thickness attenuates after a certain distance and the boundary layer thickness becomes constant this can be termed as the developed boundary layer flow the leading edge flow features have been examined by ota 1975 dong et al 1997 kiya and sasaki 1983 and kiya et al 1991 investigations on the leading edge and developing boundary layer flows have been conducted by ota 1975 kiya et al 1991 fung 1996 and alam et al 2018 kiya and sasaki 1983 kiya et al 1991 and alam et al 2018 measured fluctuating pressure and frequency responses particularly for the leading edge flow there are two predominant frequency responses for the leading edge and developing boundary layer flows kiya and sasaki 1983 kiya et al 1991 eaton and johnston 1982 alam et al 2018 one is a low frequency appearing near the leading edge of the bubble and the other is a high frequency prevailing near the reattachment the low frequency response is generated from the flapping motion of the separated shear layer while the high frequency response is from small scale eddies generated due to the reattachment however less attention has been paid to examine the flow development in developing boundary layer flow regime the boundary layer formed due to axial flow over a cylinder rapidly reaches an asymptotic thickness generally on one to two orders of magnitude greater than the cylinder radius lueptow et al 1985 cipolla et al 2006 jordan 2011a this thickness is almost invariant along the rest of the cylinder accordingly the local friction coefficient remains almost constant along the length this friction coefficient is an imperative parameter to be considered for the design of a long cylinder submerged or towed in an ocean current this is because the friction coefficient causes a large integrated friction force on a long cylinder the longer the cylinder length the higher the integrated friction force while the local friction over a flat plate is contingent on the boundary layer thickness or reynolds number an additional length scale i e the radius a of the cylinder determines the flow over a cylinder hence friction force the surface of a cylinder has a finite curvature 1 a while that of a flat plate has zero curvature as such there are three significant parameters pertaining to the flow over a cylinder namely transverse curvature a au τ ν boundary layer thickness ratio δ a and reynolds number re a au ν where u is the free stream velocity ν is the kinematic viscosity u τ is the friction velocity and δ is the boundary layer thickness willmarth et al 1976 lueptow et al 1985 kiya et al 1991 tutty 2008 krane et al 2010 alam et al 2018 both a and re a are reynolds numbers where the former is based on friction velocity instead of the freestream velocity a large a generally corresponds to a small δ a and vice versa the δ a ο 1 generally corresponds to the case of a relatively thick cylinder on which the boundary layer is comparable to that on a flat plate and the transverse curvature effect is insignificant cipolla and keith 2006 for an axis symmetric boundary layer found that the transverse curvature leads to increased transverse mixing which generates higher wall shear the classic flat plate scaling of friction force with length reynolds number does not collapse the data with transverse curvature at high δ a values a fully developed turbulent boundary layer forms beyond 10a downstream from the leading edge ota 1975 kiya et al 1991 dong et al 1997 higuchi et al 2005 2006 2008 sun et al 2014 the δ a ο 1 corresponds to the case of a long thin cylinder where the transverse curvature affects both inner near the wall and outer regions of the boundary layer as to a when a is large the boundary layer near the wall is similar to that on a flat plate a largely affecting the outer region of the boundary layer however the transverse curvature at a small a has a significant effect on both inner and outer regions of the boundary layer neves et al 1994a b tutty 2008 the previous experimental measurements from willmarth et al 1976 and lueptow et al 1985 showed that at a 20 the turbulence intensity in the inner region of the boundary layer dramatically decreases with increasing a krane et al 2010 demonstrated that the velocity profile at a 20 does not meet the law of wall in the viscous sublayer and the slope of the near wall velocity profile dips very close to the wall the friction force coefficient was therefore noticeably smaller than that for a 20 the three parameters i e a δ a and re a dictate the features of the velocity field around the cylinder hence affecting the friction force coefficient then a couple of questions come into being what is the effect of the surface curvature effect on the leading edge and developed boundary layer flows what is the dependence of the friction force coefficient on a δ a and re a what are the relationships between a δ a and re a based on the available data in the literature some empirical relations for calculating the friction force coefficient as a function of a δ a and re a would be useful therefore the main interest in the present paper is to provide clear relationships between these parameters and find out their influences on the skin friction coefficient c f 2 τ w ρ u 2 where τ w is the wall shear stress based on available data in the literature 2 transverse curvature effect on the leading edge flow the leading edge flow is largely characterized by flow separation and reattachment occurring near the leading edge which could dramatically affect the turbulence evolution and statistical properties of the flow higuchi et al 2006 in the literature there is a scarcity of investigations on the effect of re a on the separation bubble and transition to turbulence recently alam et al 2018 examined the effect of re a on the separation bubble size pressure fluctuation in the bubble and occurrence of transition to turbulence the streamwise size of the separation bubble is represented by reattachment length x r fig 2 a while the streamwise position of the transition to turbulence is indicated by x tr both measured from the leading edge fig 2b shows the dependence of reattachment length x r a on re a the reattachment length x r a dramatically shrinks when re a is increased from 7 102 to 5 103 attenuating for re a 5 103 the variation in x r a with re a can be expressed as an empirical relation obtained from the least square curve fit as follows 1 x r a 1950 re a 2 95 the separated shear layer undergoes transition to turbulence before reattaching on the cylinder surface fig 2a and the transition to turbulence point x tr a shifts towards the leading edge with increasing re a fig 2c as such alam et al 2018 proposed a relationship between x r a and x tr a fig 2d which was expressed as follows 2 x r a 1 22 x tr a 2 32 for r ea 7 9 10 2 5 10 3 and x r a 0 2 x tr a 2 96 for r ea 5 10 3 1 6 10 4 kiya et al 1991 at re a 0 5 105 found that the flow around the shear layer reattachment region has a cellular structure and that in the separation bubble has two typical frequencies one is associated with a low frequency flapping of the separated shear layer and the other is linked to the shedding of large scale vortices 3 transverse curvature effect on the developed boundary layer flow 3 1 dependence of c f on a and re a fig 3 presents the skin friction coefficient c f as a function of a on a semi logarithmic scale incorporating both experimental and numerical data available in the literature some of the data by youssef et al 1998 woods 2006 and krane et al 2010 obviously deviate from the main trend while youssef et al s 1998 and krane et al s 2010 data were obtained from wind and water tunnel experiments respectively woods 2006 data were obtained from numerical simulations the specific reasons for the deviations will be discussed later apart from these three sets of data the rest follows a global trend c f decreasing with a the decrease of c f with a is however exponential for a 2 5 102 and weak for a 2 5 102 afzal and narasimha 1985 suggested a threshold value of a 2 5 102 beyond which the boundary layer characteristics are akin to those on a flat plate the karman parameter being constant the transverse curvature effect at a 2 5 102 is insignificant hence c f does not change appreciably with the increase in a the relationship between c f and a can be expressed by a best fit curve equation as follows 3 c f 0 006 a 0 1 0 13 a the values of the coefficients were obtained using the least square method two small values of data points far away from the main trend by krane et al 2010 were excluded in the curve fit calculation later we will show how this equation can reflect the threshold a 2 5 102 obtained by afzal and narasimha 1985 from the above relationship it is seen that if an engineer wants to calculate c f for a practical purpose he will need to estimate a first but a is linked with the friction velocity hence one cannot estimate a without doing experiments hence re a is usually chosen as the variable to estimate c f as re a can be obtained directly without experiment and is more practical than a and δ a as such most researchers presented c f as a function of re a e g jordan 2011b the c f data from the literature are plotted as a function of re a in fig 4 the general trend of the data is presented as a least square curve fit solid line the c f decreases with increasing re a the trend having a similar tendency to that of the c f vs a curve fig 3 the observation points out that there is a rapport between a and re a which will be further proved later the decrease in c f is however significant for re a 2 103 and rather mild for re a 2 103 the curve fit equation for estimating c f as a function of re a fig 4 is obtained as 4 c f 0 008 r e a 0 09 1 5 r e a jordan 2011b put forward an expression of c f against re a based on their les results and partially available data from the literature nevertheless the present paper adds as much data as possible e g willmarth and yang 1970 lueptow et al 1985 and woods 2006 jordan 2011b identified that notable differences exist between the near wall streaky structures at re a 2 103 and re a 2 103 the re a 2 103 corresponds to fewer streaks having coherence for a longer axial length and wider circumferential spacing on the contrary at re a 2 103 the streaks were small in scale and large in numbers having a smaller coherence along the cylinder axis jordan 2011b therefore re a 2 103 was assumed as a threshold to distinguish the two regimes 3 2 relationship between a and re a from the above observation and also from the definitions of a and re a one can expect a good correlation between a and re a in order to find the correlation a data are plotted as a function of re a in fig 5 interestingly the plot demonstrates a linear relationship between them the approximately linear relationship is obtained as 5 a r e a 0 87 6 5 this equation may be very useful to calculate a or friction velocity without doing experiments 3 3 relationship between δ a and re a and their influence on c f the relationship between δ a and re a is found not to be straight forward as that between a and re a nevertheless to explore the relationship between δ a and re a the c f data are plotted as a function of δ a and re a as shown in fig 6 a few data from youssef et al 1998 krane et al 2010 and woods 2006 are excluded due to significant deviations from the majority of the data some interesting observations can be made here firstly δ a and re a are interconnected to each other where an increase in re a is accompanied by a decrease in δ a and vice versa see the trend by the solid line secondly the c f declines with increasing re a or with decreasing δ a thirdly when re a is small say re a 2 103 δ a is typically large the dashed line accompanied by large coherent structures in the boundary layer with the increasing δ a the streaky structures get stronger and transport high velocity fluid near the wall which considerably increases the velocity gradient near the wall hence the friction force coefficient lueptow and haritonidis 1987 the c f profile thus has an escalating tendency for δ a 10 dashed line it can be concluded that at re a 2 103 the c f is largely dependent on δ a while at re a 2 103 the c f is re a dependent keith et al 2009 and keith and cipolla 2010 designed experiments to enable the development of high reynolds number boundary layers that are directly relevant to undersea towed array applications they at high re a 1 21 105 2 95 105 found a more rapid decay of turbulent structures in the cylindrical boundary layer in comparison with the flat plate case as such the correlation between pressure sensors separated by 90 and 180 around the cylinder circumference was low it was further found that the transverse curvature has a significant effect on the mean wall shear stress and streamwise growth of the momentum thickness 3 4 signatures of two flow regimes as pointed out above a threshold value of a 2 5 102 was obtained by afzal and narasimha 1985 for a before the threshold the effect of the curvature on c f is significant while after the threshold a the boundary layer is similar to that on a flat plate the transverse curvature effect at a 2 5 102 being insignificant likewise the near wall streaky structures at re a 2 103 and re a 2 103 are different fewer and larger streaky structures appearing in the former re a regime while more and smaller streaky structures in the latter re a regime jordan 2011b in order to see whether empirical correlations eqs 3 and 4 obtained from figs 3 and 4 echo these thresholds or not the derivatives of c f with respect to a and re a i e dc f da and dc f dre a are illustrated in fig 7 interestingly the dc f da approaches its asymptotic value at a 2 5 102 as does dc f da at re a 2 103 the empirical relations obtained presently indeed reflect the thresholds dashed lines demonstrating the two flow regimes 4 discussion going back to figs 3 and 4 we see that c f data collapse well in the region of large a 103 or re a 104 while substantially scattered for a 103 or re a 104 it can be noted that the tendency is opposite in c f vs δ a plot fig 6 the primary cause of this is that with the cylinder becoming very long and thin i e small a or large δ a it is difficult to obtain accurate measurements of near wall velocity when a is large corresponding to small δ a the friction force coefficient can be measured directly because the cylindrical boundary layer in character is similar to the flat plate case the methods used for the measurements of the planar boundary layer have relatively high accuracy such as preston tubes used by willmarth and yang 1970 willmarth et al 1976 and lueptow and haritonidis 1987 that is the reason why their results collapse well nevertheless for small a i e large δ a the planar law of the wall does not apply to a cylindrical boundary layer especially in the viscous sublayer and preston tubes cannot be used the arguably optimal method is to measure the velocity profile near the wall and calculate the gradient of it unfortunately because of the limitation of the technology seldom measurements at small a have been performed by employing this direct method particularly in the wind tunnel test willmarth et al 1976 indirectly measured the friction force coefficient by using a hotwire to measure the velocity at small a fig 3 they fit the mean velocity data to the buffer and inner layer of the planar law of the wall which leads to much larger values of skin friction than other experimental and numerical results which is also ascribed to heat transfer between the hotwire and the cylinder wall lueptow and haritonidis 1987 tutty 2008 particularly at a 102 103 or re a 103 104 some of the data by youssef et al 1998 are scattered having higher c f values than those by others fig 3 lueptow and haritonidis 1987 revealed that c f may depend on length to radius ratio l a in the experiment by youssef et al 1998 δ a 0 67 1 84 and l a 60 75 2 both are smaller compared to those by others e g δ a 1 6 2 15 l a 320 by willmarth and yang 1970 δ a 1 76 42 5 l a 440 20000 by willmarth et al 1976 δ a 0 6 7 95 l a 262 4 by krane et al 2010 and δ a 1 76 42 5 l a 220 20000 by tutty 2008 youssef et al s data thus may not reflect the effects of transverse curvature it can be noted that the velocity profiles obtained by youssef et al 1998 were actually inconsistent with the planar mean velocity profile especially in wall coordinates for y 20 y yu τ ν where the slope is significantly larger than the planar case krane et al s 2010 two c f data at small a are very small noticeably different fig 3 it should be noted that krane et al performed their experiments in a water tunnel and dpiv was used to measure the velocity field so that the relatively high accuracy of the near wall velocity profile in wall coordinates is expected they gave an explanation for the two low values of c f at small a when a goes below around 20 the arc length close to the cylinder is so small that there may not be enough space to form the near wall turbulent coherent structures however the flow does not become laminar since the reynolds stresses are never zero monte et al 2011 it is of fundamental importance to gain an in depth understanding of the transverse curvature effect on the flow the possible physical aspects of flow are schematically presented in fig 8 with increasing re a the x r x tr δ and c f all drop while the first two parameters are involved in the leading edge flow regime the latter two are in the developed boundary layer flow regime the drop in x r is largely ascribed to an upstream shift in the transition to turbulence in the shear layer for a higher re a 5 conclusions through a combination of nearly all available data the relationship between the skin friction coefficient c f and three key parameters a re a and δ a are studied the c f decreases with a exponentially for a 2 5 102 and asymptotically for a 2 5 102 implying a significant transverse curvature effect for a 2 5 102 the relationship between c f and a is obtained as c f 0 006 a 0 1 0 13 a the c f declines with increasing re a following a similar trend of c f vs re a curve the relationship between a and re a is obtained as a r e a 0 87 6 5 when re a or a is small δ a is typically large the c f is largely dependent on δ a for re a 2 103 and on re a for re a 2 103 the signatures of the thresholds a 2 5 102 and re a 2 103 below which c f is sensitive to a and re a are established the experimental data at small a and re a turn scattered because of an inappropriate method of measuring and fitting the mean velocity in the buffer and inner layer for instance therefore more works at low a and re a are required to elucidate the fluid dynamic characteristics there is a strong effect of re a on the separation bubble size both x r and x tr declining with increasing re a furthermore more research on the transverse curvature effect on the leading edge flow and on the developing boundary layer flow may elucidate the flow structure development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

a 2 103 was assumed as a threshold to distinguish the two regimes 3 2 relationship between a and re a from the above observation and also from the definitions of a and re a one can expect a good correlation between a and re a in order to find the correlation a data are plotted as a function of re a in fig 5 interestingly the plot demonstrates a linear relationship between them the approximately linear relationship is obtained as 5 a r e a 0 87 6 5 this equation may be very useful to calculate a or friction velocity without doing experiments 3 3 relationship between δ a and re a and their influence on c f the relationship between δ a and re a is found not to be straight forward as that between a and re a nevertheless to explore the relationship between δ a and re a the c f data are plotted as a function of δ a and re a as shown in fig 6 a few data from youssef et al 1998 krane et al 2010 and woods 2006 are excluded due to significant deviations from the majority of the data some interesting observations can be made here firstly δ a and re a are interconnected to each other where an increase in re a is accompanied by a decrease in δ a and vice versa see the trend by the solid line secondly the c f declines with increasing re a or with decreasing δ a thirdly when re a is small say re a 2 103 δ a is typically large the dashed line accompanied by large coherent structures in the boundary layer with the increasing δ a the streaky structures get stronger and transport high velocity fluid near the wall which considerably increases the velocity gradient near the wall hence the friction force coefficient lueptow and haritonidis 1987 the c f profile thus has an escalating tendency for δ a 10 dashed line it can be concluded that at re a 2 103 the c f is largely dependent on δ a while at re a 2 103 the c f is re a dependent keith et al 2009 and keith and cipolla 2010 designed experiments to enable the development of high reynolds number boundary layers that are directly relevant to undersea towed array applications they at high re a 1 21 105 2 95 105 found a more rapid decay of turbulent structures in the cylindrical boundary layer in comparison with the flat plate case as such the correlation between pressure sensors separated by 90 and 180 around the cylinder circumference was low it was further found that the transverse curvature has a significant effect on the mean wall shear stress and streamwise growth of the momentum thickness 3 4 signatures of two flow regimes as pointed out above a threshold value of a 2 5 102 was obtained by afzal and narasimha 1985 for a before the threshold the effect of the curvature on c f is significant while after the threshold a the boundary layer is similar to that on a flat plate the transverse curvature effect at a 2 5 102 being insignificant likewise the near wall streaky structures at re a 2 103 and re a 2 103 are different fewer and larger streaky structures appearing in the former re a regime while more and smaller streaky structures in the latter re a regime jordan 2011b in order to see whether empirical correlations eqs 3 and 4 obtained from figs 3 and 4 echo these thresholds or not the derivatives of c f with respect to a and re a i e dc f da and dc f dre a are illustrated in fig 7 interestingly the dc f da approaches its asymptotic value at a 2 5 102 as does dc f da at re a 2 103 the empirical relations obtained presently indeed reflect the thresholds dashed lines demonstrating the two flow regimes 4 discussion going back to figs 3 and 4 we see that c f data collapse well in the region of large a 103 or re a 104 while substantially scattered for a 103 or re a 104 it can be noted that the tendency is opposite in c f vs δ a plot fig 6 the primary cause of this is that with the cylinder becoming very long and thin i e small a or large δ a it is difficult to obtain accurate measurements of near wall velocity when a is large corresponding to small δ a the friction force coefficient can be measured directly because the cylindrical boundary layer in character is similar to the flat plate case the methods used for the measurements of the planar boundary layer have relatively high accuracy such as preston tubes used by willmarth and yang 1970 willmarth et al 1976 and lueptow and haritonidis 1987 that is the reason why their results collapse well nevertheless for small a i e large δ a the planar law of the wall does not apply to a cylindrical boundary layer especially in the viscous sublayer and preston tubes cannot be used the arguably optimal method is to measure the velocity profile near the wall and calculate the gradient of it unfortunately because of the limitation of the technology seldom measurements at small a have been performed by employing this direct method particularly in the wind tunnel test willmarth et al 1976 indirectly measured the friction force coefficient by using a hotwire to measure the velocity at small a fig 3 they fit the mean velocity data to the buffer and inner layer of the planar law of the wall which leads to much larger values of skin friction than other experimental and numerical results which is also ascribed to heat transfer between the hotwire and the cylinder wall lueptow and haritonidis 1987 tutty 2008 particularly at a 102 103 or re a 103 104 some of the data by youssef et al 1998 are scattered having higher c f values than those by others fig 3 lueptow and haritonidis 1987 revealed that c f may depend on length to radius ratio l a in the experiment by youssef et al 1998 δ a 0 67 1 84 and l a 60 75 2 both are smaller compared to those by others e g δ a 1 6 2 15 l a 320 by willmarth and yang 1970 δ a 1 76 42 5 l a 440 20000 by willmarth et al 1976 δ a 0 6 7 95 l a 262 4 by krane et al 2010 and δ a 1 76 42 5 l a 220 20000 by tutty 2008 youssef et al s data thus may not reflect the effects of transverse curvature it can be noted that the velocity profiles obtained by youssef et al 1998 were actually inconsistent with the planar mean velocity profile especially in wall coordinates for y 20 y yu τ ν where the slope is significantly larger than the planar case krane et al s 2010 two c f data at small a are very small noticeably different fig 3 it should be noted that krane et al performed their experiments in a water tunnel and dpiv was used to measure the velocity field so that the relatively high accuracy of the near wall velocity profile in wall coordinates is expected they gave an explanation for the two low values of c f at small a when a goes below around 20 the arc length close to the cylinder is so small that there may not be enough space to form the near wall turbulent coherent structures however the flow does not become laminar since the reynolds stresses are never zero monte et al 2011 it is of fundamental importance to gain an in depth understanding of the transverse curvature effect on the flow the possible physical aspects of flow are schematically presented in fig 8 with increasing re a the x r x tr δ and c f all drop while the first two parameters are involved in the leading edge flow regime the latter two are in the developed boundary layer flow regime the drop in x r is largely ascribed to an upstream shift in the transition to turbulence in the shear layer for a higher re a 5 conclusions through a combination of nearly all available data the relationship between the skin friction coefficient c f and three key parameters a re a and δ a are studied the c f decreases with a exponentially for a 2 5 102 and asymptotically for a 2 5 102 implying a significant transverse curvature effect for a 2 5 102 the relationship between c f and a is obtained as c f 0 006 a 0 1 0 13 a the c f declines with increasing re a following a similar trend of c f vs re a curve the relationship between a and re a is obtained as a r e a 0 87 6 5 when re a or a is small δ a is typically large the c f is largely dependent on δ a for re a 2 103 and on re a for re a 2 103 the signatures of the thresholds a 2 5 102 and re a 2 103 below which c f is sensitive to a and re a are established the experimental data at small a and re a turn scattered because of an inappropriate method of measuring and fitting the mean velocity in the buffer and inner layer for instance therefore more works at low a and re a are required to elucidate the fluid dynamic characteristics there is a strong effect of re a on the separation bubble size both x r and x tr declining with increasing re a furthermore more research on the transverse curvature effect on the leading edge flow and on the developing boundary layer flow may elucidate the flow structure development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

21291,marine current turbines mcts has progressively attracted wider interest from the industry and many research initiatives due to its potential as a novel world energy resource however several technological issues amongst others fault detection of mct blades still require further progress for their successful implementation indeed power generation is likely to progressively degrade due to blade faults and then causes disruptive disturbance when the marine current generator is connected to the grid fault detection of mct blades still presents several challenges due to the complexity of the underwater environment it appears that attachment like plankton or biofouling may have a considerable influence on the turbine blade as these may be triggering different imbalance faults this survey reviews different blade fault types under the condition of wave and turbulence we also review current blade fault detection methods including multi domain approaches it appears from our study

develop increasing by about 33 by 2040 launch table 1 gives an estimate of the potential marine energy worldwide chen et al 2018a as one of the new electrical energy power generation technologies mcts have attracted worldwide attention khalil et al 2018 lee 2020 different reviews that consider the design of mct have been recently published chen and lam 2015 rodrigo et al 2018 ke et al 2020a specific reviews on fault detection however have not yet explicitly been published although the maritime domain contains endless renewable energy wave and turbulence conditions inevitably disturb turbine operations shear flow is one of the triggers for mct hydro dynamic asymmetry ke et al 2020b meanwhile the growth of marine organisms or marine pollutants may also cause mechanical faults in blades and which consequently generate damages to other components of the mct such as generators whitby and galde loo 2014 duhaney and khoshgoftaar 2010 2012 hu and du 2012 mjit et al 2011a bearing waters et al 2012 2013 and winding s insulation systems wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 blade faults have a crucial impact on the safety and reliability of mct systems amir hossein and bibeau 2016 mohammad and bibeau 2020 rosli 2020 zhang et al 2014 alternatively blade fault detection approaches have been widely applied to gas turbines or wind turbines wts this paper aims to analyze the impact of blade faults and discuss open research issues related to mct blade fault detection fault detection techniques are reviewed from sensor and signal based perspectives we survey fault detection methods based on used measurements and the different techniques used so far the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the root causes of blade fault and models resultant torque imbalance in section 3 the blade fault detection methods are reviewed based on whether they use specific sensors or embedded electrical measurements i e phase currents or voltages section 4 concludes the paper and draws some perspectives for future works 2 blade fault root causes 2 1 effects of the environment on the blades the mct is installed undersea and therefore operates in harsh conditions seawater corrosion mud plankton biofouling etc with variable environmental parameters such as sudden changes in instantaneous flow velocity chen et al 2012 these harsh working conditions malki et al 2013 favour the appearance of faults or failures 2 1 1 blade biofouling a blade is prone to failure due to the exogenous undersea environment and potential threats either mechanical or biological liet al 2016 li et al 2014 for instance collision with small and medium sized marine organisms is a potential threat such as the mud and dirt attached to the blade fig 1 illustrates biofouling phenomena leading to imbalance as species distribution and growth levels of the fouling organisms are fully arbitrary benbouzid and benbouzid 2015 renewable energy for race 2016 2 1 2 wear and crack marine current flow velocity also affects the blade if this velocity is higher than 8 m s cavitation may occur on the surface of the blade pedro and marshall 2014 this wear phenomenon is illustrated in fig 2 as observed on a blade tip li et al 2016 pedro et al studied the collision of aquatic organisms with turbines they evaluated the relationship between the pressure degree and the damage level of the blades lust et al 2013 li et al 2016 in davies et al 2012 b gaurier and his co authors studied the fatigue of blades experimental tests have shown that wave current interactions must be considered in the fatigue analysis of blades as they can cause large additional loading amplitudes compared to currents alone there are many marine objects under the sea such as abundant plankton and fish masses these may continuously hit the mct blades fig 3 shows an example of an mct blade crack during the verdant power company sea trials li et al 2016 2 1 3 operating environment compared with wind turbines wts offshore wind turbines owts and hydro turbines hts the operating conditions of mcts change with the marine current velocity gauriera et al 2013 liu et al 2018 although the structure of the mcts and the wts are similar the prior is more prone to blade fractures because of the seawater characteristics as follows ren et al 2018 barakat et al 2018 a seawater density is higher than air b seawater contains corrosive metallic elements c the condensation rate of water is slower than carbon dioxide the insulation system of the mcts is improved because of those seawater characteristics due to the hermetically sealed characteristics of the mcts some conventional sensor based methods failed to complete the distribution of points and cannot be realized marine currents are subject to instability factors such as marine current movement and offshore wind and transients such transient changes make the marine current power generation systems operating conditions more complex and unstable than wts or hts islam 2004 this frequently changing water flow causes the mechanical constraints to which the blade is subjected to change instantaneously so the blades are prone to deformation and failure here are effects of variable marine current to sum up a higher impact of frequent fluctuations of water b hydraulic failure of the blade c high turbidity of seawater there are many aquatic animals and plants in the ocean the reproduction and habitat of these plants and animals are interfering with the normal operation of the mcts this kind of biofouling fault is a distinct feature of the mcts compared to other types of turbines when the mass of the blades is changed with biofouling this will affect the system s operation which not only degrades the performance but may also significantly damages its structure this has been confirmed with experimental tests carried on with a prototype table 2 compares the characteristics of the different turbines it can be found that the mcts with the marine current environment are most threatened and because of the characteristics of mct blades some sensor based methods are not applicable therefore built in sensor based fault detection methods can be a future trend for the blade fault detection method 2 2 blade fault effect and modelling 2 2 1 blade fault effect analysis as mentioned before the complexity of the ocean constitutes a harsh environment that escalates the occurrence of blade faults kaldellis et al 2016 mérigaud and ringwood 2016 compared to offshore wts one can assume that the immersion in a hostile environment will lead to lower reliability fig 4 displays the measured number of faults per year and the downtime associated with different components of offshore wts leite et al 2017 it can be noticed that the mechanical components fault mainly takes a large part in the wts downtime however the proportion of blade and gearbox faults is relatively apparent in mechanical faults among which about 5800 wts are shut down for nearly 12 h per day due to blade faults however the installation environment of the mcts is more complicated than wts or hts and the corrosion effect of underwater and marine organisms greatly threatens the mechanical components of the mct so the real time fault diagnosis of the mct blades is of great significance because of the harsh environment in which the mct operates all the components particularly the blades are under severe stress therefore they are prone to experience faults or even failures one of the main effects of the blade fault is to create an imbalance between the blades dorrell et al 2013 haneef et al 2017 the consequence is a torque imbalance that in turn produces negative sequence current in the generator windings this will result in higher joule losses which in turn will increase the generator temperature and cause voltage imbalance across the windings that will pollute the grid frost et al 2015 kearney 2013 the torque imbalance can also lead to pitch failures in the variable pitch power generation system mwasilu et al 2012 elosegui and ulazia 2017 the attachment of marine organisms will cause the blades to have different power coefficient cp at the same flow rate making the mct energy conversion efficiency subject to various fouling severities hosna and benbouzid 2017 similarly jessica m has studied the impact of blade roughness and fouling on the power coefficient experimental results show that the maximum cp factor has decreased to 42 3 for the case of roughened blades naca 63 618 jessica 2014 2 2 2 blade fault model fouling changes the mass of the mct blades the blade fouling fault can be equivalent to a virtual mass m on the blade located at a distance r u from the hub as shown in fig 5 li et al 2020 shahriar et al 2015 gong and qiao 2010 when the equivalent additional mass rotates from top to bottom the shaft rotating speed is increased otherwise the speed is reduced the equivalent additional mass m rotates with the blade and the generated torque induces speed fluctuations consequently the mechanical torque t n of the blade is expressed as 1 t n t 0 t n sin ω n t ϕ where t 0 denotes the mechanical torque under healthy condition t im mgr u g the gravitational acceleration ω m is the speed in healthy condition ω m 2πf m f m is the shaft rotating frequency which depends on the marine current velocity and ϕ is the initial phase angle this cycling frequency is equal to the blade frequency gong 2012 the motion equation is modified as 2 j m d ω n d t t n t e where j m is the moment of inertia t e is the electromagnetic torque combining 1 with 2 it can be deduced that the rotor speed ω n when the blade has experienced fault is 3 ω n ω m ω m r cos ω m t ϕ where ω mr m gr u j m ω m combined with the relationship between stator current frequency and rotor speed the stator current can be expressed as follows 4 i t i m cos p ω m t p ω m r cos ω m t ϕ t when the blade fault occurs a sinusoidal component is added to the rotation speed it can be seen from 3 and 4 that the increase or decrease of blade mass will cause different fluctuations in the rotation speed and the stator current its amplitude increases with the mass imbalance and the distance to the hub we can also notice that at high speed the mass imbalance effect will be lower however this imbalance will induce harmonics in the generator stator current spectrum the direction of the marine current will deviate due to the influence of the current movement or shear flow gaurier 2020 moreover pitch angle failure is also one of the triggers for mct hydro dynamic asymmetry fig 6 shows the hydrodynamic imbalance fault caused by the abnormal pitch angle the water flow force on the blade is decomposed into vertical force f v and horizontal force f h when the pitch angle is abnormal the forces f v and f h become unbalanced therefore the marine current turbine accelerates and decelerates every half turn generating a 1 p frequency likewise the asymmetry of water flow dynamics is also responsible of an imbalance in the forces exerted on the blades this imbalance generates a 3 p frequency oscillation in the shaft rotation speed indeed different marine current velocities obey the following equation 5 v h v h r h h r α where v h and v hr are marine current velocities at height h and h r respectively and α is the power law exponent when a single blade of the mct is worn or broken the mass of the blade is reduced in fig 7 it can be considered that the mass of the other two blades has increased the equivalent additional mass m add rotates with the blade and the generated torque induces speed fluctuations consequently likewise the mechanical torque t n of the blade is expressed as 6 t n t 0 t a d d sin ω m t ϕ where t add m add gr u it can be deduced that the rotor speed ωn when the blade has experienced fault is 7 ω n ω m ω a d d cos ω m t ϕ where ω add m add gr u j m ω m it can be seen from 7 that wear or crack fault has the same impact as fouling fault with a 1 p frequency oscillation to summarise blade fault if not detected can not only lead to accelerated wearing of mechanical components generator windings and insulation but also cause grid pollution for a grid connected mct 3 fault detection methods 3 1 specific sensor based fault detection methods in the case of an mct one should implement appropriate sensors to monitor the blade condition this includes pressure sensors i e to evaluate vessel integrity and inspect the surface of the blade tachometers i e to measure the rotational velocity of the blades temperature sensors i e to evaluate if internal blades are overheating compared with other components and strain gauges i e to control if the blades are deformed for example attached by plankton edwards et al 2011 matthew 2017 for the most part these sensors can effectively play a role in the blade status monitoring however more effective sensors or data processing methods are needed for blade fault detection hereafter let us discuss fault detection methods using specific sensors that are optional to the normal operation of the mct such as optical sensor image sensor accelerometer and temperature sensor as few sensors are currently used in mct blade fault detection some fault detection methods applied to wts or other rotating machinery with blades can be used for reference accordingly a few attributes of current references which have been summarized in table 3 among the four sensor based fault detection methods only the image sensor based method can achieve accurate fault location as confirmed by ref zheng et al 2019 vibration sensor based as compared to others is the most popular method and is widely used by wts fault diagnosis however as wts are not completely sealed vibration sensors can be placed on their external surface however marine current movement and current flow greatly affect the vibration amplitude therefore fault detection is an issue for signal processing methods another challenge is the deployment of waterproof vibration sensors currently there is no report of temperature sensor application but in terms of the internal environment of mcts the temperature signal of mcts is more reliable so blade fault detection by processing the temperature is a possibility for further research 3 1 1 optical sensor based methods non contact measurement at blade tips by optical fiber sensing technology has become a promising approach for fault detection hang eun 2018 ye et al 2014 a laser doppler distance sensor ldds capable of measuring the radial blade expansions has been developed and a system for blade fault detection and status monitoring has been presented in neumann et al 2015 a study on marine energy applications using high speed fiber bragg grating sensors has been introduced christopher 2011 a measurement system consisting of four laser doppler sensors to improve the safety and energy efficiency of turbo machines has been studied in dreier et al 2013 blade tip timing btt is another approach that utilizes several optical sensors distributed around the circumference of the rotor accordingly a blade tip timing btt method using four optical fiber sensors has been presented in lin et al 2016 and validated with promising experimental results closely related to this work stefania 2018 has used optical coherence tomography oct imaging as a novel non destructive testing tool to investigate growth marine biofilms it is worthy to point out that the use of optical sensors is a valuable solution as it is contactless however there are three main issues to address before their deployment a the installation and maintenance costs in such a hostile environment b the relevant positioning of the sensors c the adoption of usability conditions i e continuous monitoring or planned maintenance 3 1 2 image sensor based methods let us consider the image sensor as an example wen 2018 the application used to the fault diagnosis of mct blades is satisfactory when mct blades are corroded blade images can be used as valuable fault detection signals detection methods based on sparse self encoder sa and soft maximum regression sr have been applied zheng et al 2019 sa is applied to extract features while sr is used to classify the features a similar method has been used in the field of wt fault detection carr et al 2016 a data driven framework is proposed to automatically detect wind turbine blade surface cracks based on images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles uavs in wang and zhang 2017 therefore this approach can be envisaged for the mct when unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are used in baqersad et al 2012 a three dimensional digital image correlation 3d dic has been applied the results show that the method can identify failure locations and discontinuities in the blade curvature under load xin 2020 considers the mct blade fouling fault and proposes a diagnosis method based on depth wise separable convolutional neural network in order to identify the status through different pixels of fouling and blade overall the application of image sensors to the fault diagnosis of mct blades is relatively successful because the blades are short it is easier to process image data and it is more convenient to segment the blade pixels however this method cannot be used for wts not only it is hard to get blade panorama but also holder the camera is a great challenge the underwater image could monitor the status of the blades to identify location and amount of attachments or any other foreign body that can compromise the normal operation of the mct moreover deploying unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs to inspect the surface condition of mct blades is a trend for future research in this regard the main advantages of applying multi camera measurement or uuvs to detect mct blade faults include a a more frequent and periodical inspection of mct blades b recording mct blade conditions as images video in order to accurately diagnose faults c avoid the risk of staff accidents 3 1 3 accelerometer sensor based methods accelerometers require additional attention these sensors used to detect rotating machinery vibrations are among the most desirable in detecting subtle failures and pre failure wear of different components blade faults can generate abnormal vibrations park et al 2017 the vibration sensor based method has also been widely used in the mcts to monitor mct or determine the mode shapes muhammad 2015 for instance a vibration based real time method has been applied to detect locate and identify blade faults abdeljaber et al 2017 however when considering the mct the information contained in the vibration signal is much more complex to analyze due to significant underwater noise different components of the mct will complete one full cycle of motion at different angle speed due to a variable marine current khan et al 2013 the variable rotation speed often induces different vibration signals to the various components of the mct thus interfering with the final fault feature extraction in liu 2016 an underwater vibration signal pre processing method has been developed pre processing techniques such as sampling data standardization sampling data smoothing processing and a vibration strength method based on pseudo dissipation evaluation platforms have been suggested to detect the shear of vibration signals for underwater equipment a smart vibration monitoring system svms has been introduced in mjit et al 2011b it has been developed as an effective way to reduce equipment losses and enhance the safety and lifetime duration of the mct blades features are extracted from raw vibration signals using a short time wavelet transform with a base lining technique that has been presented in duhaney et al 2012 it is designed to allow for reliable state detection regardless of mct operating conditions in duhaney et al 2011 a high frequency ac104 sensor and four low frequency ac136 1a sensors are used to measure vibration signals to verify the effectiveness of the fault feature extraction algorithm furthermore the accelerometers measure the mechanical vibration whereas the blade imbalance fault directly influences seawater flow despite its potential the utilization of vibration signals for mct blade fault detection is still a perspective so far it is still not entirely conducive for detecting early potential failures of mct 3 1 4 temperature sensor based methods measuring the blade or environment temperature has also been considered to evaluate the mct current condition li 2019 qiu et al 2016 indeed when the blades are under severe stress their inner temperature will increase beyond the usual range therefore blade temperature can be used as a fault feature in nienhaus and hilbert 2012 the temperature data is pre processed and feature extraction has been performed to establish a characteristic model of the blade if the temperature is measured in each blade the distribution should be modeled and analyzed to perform the fault detection in feng et al 2017 the discrete fourier transform has been used to set up the model a support vector machine svm method has also been used in chen and wang 2013 to evaluate the effect of a small sample on learning and local minimization problems the main issues to use the temperature as the fault feature are a the sensors should be sealed and entirely isolated from the environment b the transmission of the information to the processing unit c the correlation between the temperature evolution and its effects on the materials 3 2 built in sensor based fault detection methods for decades phase current and voltage sensors almost always installed in any electrical system are being used to detect and diagnose ac motor faults such as broken bars and rotor eccentricities shi et al 2008 tan et al 2011 rotor imbalance and rotor torsional vibration cai and deng 2017 kim 2009 therefore motor current signal analysis mcsa can also be used for fault detection in this application as far as the electrical signals embed the fault signatures mustapha et al 2011 goktas et al 2016 the fault features can lie in the time frequency or time frequency domain gao et al 2015 for signal processing the mct operates under the condition of wave and turbulence which results in the variation of the mechanical torque and speed consequently there are three issues when built in sensor based fault detection methods are considered 1 the fault characteristics are not clear with restricted information compared with onshore power generation equipment the mcts require protection equipment such as insulation and corrosion resistance for underwater work fewer measurement points can be arranged in actual projects making the monitoring device for mcts limited the time and frequency domain feature information commonly used in fault detection methods is not clear it is challenging to obtain fault features for example the acquisition of signals such as vibration and torque require additional sensors which increases maintenance costs and is more likely to cause sensor failure due to seawater corrosion therefore studying how to deeply mine rich fault features from a small amount of information is the basis for solving the blade fault detection 2 diversified fault characteristics under variable marine current speeds the operating conditions of mcts change with the current flow velocity the current velocity varies within a wide range so that the torque and speed of the turbine will fluctuate besides the mct blades are smaller than wind turbines and the energy density of seawater is high which makes the stator currents more affected by the flow velocity the random marine current velocity changes such as surges and turbulences cause the stator currents to change frequently and the corresponding fault characteristics change accordingly the similar kind of fault has various fault characteristics extracted under different working conditions of the mcts blade which reduces the accuracy of fault diagnosis 3 strong interference from the marine environment and noise compared with wts and hts the instantaneous variable marine current causes the operating parameters of mcts to change accordingly some of the changes in amplitude and frequency are partially or entirely covered when the flow velocity is large mcts will experience higher cavitation at the tip of the blades the relatively high blade tip speed may make it difficult for the blades to avoid the formation of cavities when the bubble disappears a small and powerful pressure wave occurs with noise and vibration due to the conflict in the center therefore an in depth study of the operating mechanism of mcts and improving the accuracy of fault identification under strong interference are important contents of mcts fault detection some attributes of the presented references have been summarized in table 4 many fault detection methods applied to wts blade and other rotating machinery are not suitable for mcts not only because the mct blade structure is quite different but also because the mcts operating environment is harsh in fault detection method based on signal processing the processing cost of time domain signals is lower but it is weak in frequency domain however when the frequency domain information is used to process the stator current the fault features are often submerged in the main frequency and marine noise therefore the time frequency domain is the best choice for fault feature extraction however how to remove the influence of surge and turbulence on stator current is a crucial issue compared with the wts 3 2 1 time domain signal based methods once the variables are measured they are filtered or normalized in the pre processing step if the number of variables is high the dimension reduction can be made before fault extraction using principal component analysis pca or independent component analysis then the fault features are extracted using signal processing techniques these features can be statistical properties or can be related to frequency components in the spectrum the analysis can also be monovariate or multivariate principal component analysis pca and independent component analysis ica have been widely used for blade fault detection in rotating machinery wang et al 2015 chen et al 2018b however those techniques are optimal if the distribution of the variables remains unchanged at fault occurrence ge and song 2010 a model correlation pca method has been proposed in zhang et al 2017a for detecting the mct blade fault the test results using hotelling t2 statistic and spe statistic are shown in fig 8 it was shown that the proposed method was successful in eliminating statistical differences and detecting blade collision fault under the conditions of marine current change and variable load thanks to the multi mode relationship the blade collision fault can be detected effectively by t2 statistic and q statistic it is proved that it is necessary to separate operating points in different marine current modes otherwise the real time fault detection of mct will cause false alarms fusion fault theory and neural network pca method have been used for mct blade faults detection and distinction in zhang et al 2018a this method helps to mitigate the interference due to the flow rate change of the monitored variables in this regard envelope analysis also plays a vital role in motor fault detection compared with statistical analysis and it was reported that the envelopes of the current signal could detect motor eccentricity this method is also worthy of being considered in mct blade fault detection recently several machine learning methods have been applied to detect fault in mct a bidirectional long short term memory network is proposed in david 2018 in tang 2019 the authors have built an mct prediction model for fault detection in haddad and strangas 2016 the authors have proposed a method for diagnosing and classifying mechanical and electrical faults in permanent magnet synchronous generators based on lda in lei et al 2019 the authors have proposed a data dimensionality reduction based on the long short term memory networks method for turbine fault diagnosis a novel fault diagnosis method based on manifold learning and shannon wavelet support vector machine is proposed in tang 2014 similarly a mahalanobis semi supervised mapping mssm manifold learning algorithm was proposed in wang 2020 this method has a significant dimensionality reduction effect on a large amount of scada data and the accuracy of the fault diagnosis classification reaches 100 a hybrid dimensionality reduction strategy was recently proposed and applied to steam turbine data shabnam and montazeri gh 2020 this method retains the fault information to the greatest extent based on reducing the data dimension a variety of dimensionality reduction analysis algorithms are compared to highlight the effectiveness of the method ref malik and mishra 2016 has proposed fuzzy q learning fql based on an adaptive self learning turbine fault diagnostic model using the current flowing into the generator s windings the proposed fql based classifier could serve as an important tool for the turbine machine a method for processing electrical signals using the image analysis method is proposed in chen et al 2019 this method uses the deep train to learn and classify images to diagnose the faults of the turbine blades 3 2 2 frequency domain signal based methods several faults may affect the spectral content of system s variables therefore the stator current frequency could be a relevant feature for blade fault detection in toumi 2016 a method is proposed to find the fault features by calculating the stator electromotive force the method exhibits good detection capability for mcts in matthew 2013 the thrust data has been projected into the frequency domain and the amplitude spectrum is analyzed to check the fault states the bispectrum analysis of the open loop stator current has also been used for mct blade fault detection and the 1 p fault frequency was found in the bispectrum lotfi 2019 in huang et al 2019 authors have used the normalized spectra of the output power signal of an mct to estimate the remaining life likewise the normalized spectra of the mct torque signal are also considered in allmark 2015 recently an imbalance mct blade fault detection method based on data normalization and the combination of power spectral density psd and synchronous sampling algorithm has been proposed in zhang et al 2017b it has successfully extracted the sideband components in faulty conditions however the performances are degraded under the condition of turbulence as shown in fig 9 it can be found from the figure that in the stator current spectrum where the imbalance fault occurs two excitations appear on both sides of the main frequency under different current conditions these two excitations show different shapes the fault characteristics are more obvious in the case and the spectrum of the stator current is messier in the case of turbulence so analysing effects of turbulence is very meaningful as the fault detection in the frequency domain relies on the determination of the sideband frequencies this method will be suitable if a the speed range is wide b the stationary conditions are fulfilled c the time window is large enough to guarantee an accurate frequency resolution 3 2 3 time frequency signal based methods signal estimation and detection theory provide a framework and tools for deriving optimal parameter estimation from a noisy signal under relevant statistical assumptions yan and lu 2014 a fault characteristic analysis method based on stator current instantaneous frequency has been developed using the least squares rotation vector invariant technique tls esprit it estimates stator current frequencies during transients and uses generalized likelihood ratio detection glrt to design the detector zhang et al 2018b experimental results show that this signal processing method is suitable for mct blade fault detection under complex conditions in order to deal with transients and frequency resolution wavelet transforms have been widely used for fault detection in the time frequency domain wavelet transforms retain a non uniform division of time and frequency therefore allowing accurate simultaneous time and frequency resolutions they also have the advantage of multi resolution analysis time frequency localization wavelet transforms can deal with non stationary signals such as generator phase currents wavelet transforms have already been used in the field of mct blade fault detection the author in li 2020 uses the wavelet transforms to denoising the stator current of mct while allmark et al 2015 uses it to extract the time frequency information in feng et al 2016 brittny et al 2019 allmark 2016 three features have been extracted by using time domain analysis and wavelet packet decomposition this method has succeeded in reducing the error rate in turbine blade fault diagnosis hilbert huang transform hht has also been used for turbines fault detection this technique is composed of two steps empirical mode decomposition and hilbert spectrum analysis gu et al 2018 a variety of demodulation algorithms are compared and analyzed with generator data vikas and parey 2019 ref jiang 2019 proposes a coarse to fine decomposing strategy of vmd which further improves the vmd method and is mainly used to extract weak faults ref diahpk 2019 uses the wavelet algorithm to demodulate the stator current signal for the attachment fault of the mct and performs noise reduction processing on the stator current signal and the effect is significant an ieemd method combined with ht is proposed in chen 2017 for extracting incipient fault features of gearboxes the improved vmd and eemd methods are proposed in li 2018 and amirat et al 2018 respectively they performed multi scale demodulation respectively with significant improvement effects in zhang et al 2016 empirical mode decomposition emd and spectrum analysis have been successfully used to extract the mct fault feature and the fault frequency i e shaft rotating frequency stator current and spectrum in wave and turbulence conditions are displayed in fig 10 and fig 11 it can be found that the spectrum of the instantaneous current frequency filtered by the emd filtering method has only a 1 p frequency 1 95 hz excitation the interference terms caused by water flow have been removed by filtering however the method does not explicitly select the appropriate imf components furthermore automatic detection will be the next step when the perfect representation of the fault characteristics is completed very recently a harmonic analysis strategy based on zero crossing estimation and emd filter bank analysis at each time frequency bin is proposed in zhang et al 2019 which can minimize the disturbance of main frequency and improve the performance of the blade imbalance detection ref tang 2020 uses the knn method to classify the fault severities of blade imbalance for mcts and with a success rate of 100 3 3 experimental results a 230 w direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator experimental platform was built in our laboratory the mct prototype the parameters are shown in table 5 is placed in the water flow channel as shown in fig 12 the simulated current flow rate is regulated by the variable frequency regulator of the pump motor and the adjustment range is from 0 7 m s to 1 5 m s the drum motor function is to simulate the waves so that the turbulence of the current in the experiment changes with the same pump flow rate this mct prototype system is also equipped with data acquisition equipment and a state monitoring host computer with a sampling frequency of 1 khz fig 13 shows the image information under different fouling fault severities and we defined different degrees of fouling by segmenting blade area as shown in fig 14 and some methods mentioned before are carried out and evaluated experimental results in table 6 show that several machine learning techniques can efficiently recognize the attachment under turbid submerged conditions in song 2019 an acoustic signal is used to detect underwater propeller failures a dpca based method is proposed to process the signal however this scheme is based on the acoustic emission signal in an absolute noise canceling environment and the acoustic emission signal is not ideal due to the real ocean velocity and environment due to the influence of variable water flow the acoustic signal presents large fluctuations as shown in fig 15 and useful information cannot be extracted in this case as shown in fig 16 the vibration signals under different mass imbalance faults are collected after psd analysis as shown in fig 17 it is found that the vibration sensor is seriously affected by the underwater environment and the fault signature cannot be easily retrieved the expected 1 p excitation does not appear at 1 p frequency this implies that fault detection based on vibration sensors is still a challenging task fig 18 and fig 19 show the stator current and instantaneous power waveforms under different fouling fault severities fig 20 shows the instantaneous frequency of stator current under different fault severities the variations of the amplitude of the 1 p frequency component can be used as a fault indicator fig 21 shows the instantaneous power spectrum under different fault severities and it is obvious to note that there is no excitation at 1 p frequency for the healthy case it is also noted that the amplitude at 1 p frequency increases with the fault level fig 22 shows the spectrum amplitudes for three different signals with resampling methods single current single voltage and instantaneous power under constant marine current velocity for different fault severities all amplitudes are divided by the absolute value of the mass imbalance if any fig 23 displays the spectrum amplitudes for the same three methods for different marine current speeds under a constant additional mass from these two figures three conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the resampled instantaneous power frequency spectrum is much more sensitive to the fault severity 2 all the three methods are rather robust to the variable marine current velocity 3 the resampled instantaneous power method enhances the fault feature extraction 4 perspectives table 7 provides a comprehensive comparison of mct blade fault detection techniques their characteristics such as intrusive complexity and maintenance are respectively addressed and we suggest the following four directions for future research work a a fault model of unstable conditions such as surge and turbulence should be established as mentioned before the frequent occurrence of waves and turbulence causes blade faults this happens randomly and leads to non linear behavior and non gaussian distribution of the fault features the unstable condition also generates transient phenomena b transmission of the measurements in such a hostile environment is a real challenge whatever the sensors because of numerous obstacles and lighting conditions c to obtain high fault detection and diagnosis performances combination of sensors may be relevant then multi sensor information fusion would be of utmost importance d mct blade fault detection performances based on single domain information are relatively weak because of the difficulty for extracting features in noisy environment therefore multi domain feature fusion might be explored and applied to blade fault detection such methods should process information in multiple domains including the time frequency time scale and time frequency domains 5 conclusion the objective of this paper was to give an overview of the existing methods and techniques used for mct blade fault detection the methods have been classified depending on whether the measures are collected using specific sensors e g accelerometers cameras temperature or the built in generator phase currents sensors it appears that specific sensor based methods suitable for fault detection of wts blades are not necessarily suitable for mcts given similar mct and wt the pros cons for blade fault detection techniques are presented in table 8 because of their different environment the maintenance cost of the sensors installed on consideration should be given to the application of built in sensor based methods to mcts meanwhile it is also essential to design more effective noise reduction and filtering methods for the marine noise caused by turbulence and waves altogether the advantages and disadvantages of these methods are presented and evaluated they are acquired using appropriate sensors installed in various mct components for built in sensor based methods the stator phase current or voltage signals are usually processed with the envelope analysis fft frequency analysis and time frequency domain analysis methods using wavelet or hilbert transform alternatively new fault features can be analyzed such as instantaneous power signals torque signals etc furthermore it is also relevant to analyze the features in multiple domains therefore it will be beneficial to combine different sensors and signal based methods to enhance fault detection performance however significant effort is still needed to develop these technologies to achieve a cost effective blade condition monitoring system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

21291,marine current turbines mcts has progressively attracted wider interest from the industry and many research initiatives due to its potential as a novel world energy resource however several technological issues amongst others fault detection of mct blades still require further progress for their successful implementation indeed power generation is likely to progressively degrade due to blade faults and then causes disruptive disturbance when the marine current generator is connected to the grid fault detection of mct blades still presents several challenges due to the complexity of the underwater environment it appears that attachment like plankton or biofouling may have a considerable influence on the turbine blade as these may be triggering different imbalance faults this survey reviews different blade fault types under the condition of wave and turbulence we also review current blade fault detection methods including multi domain approaches it appears from our study that built in sensor based fault detection methods which use phase currents and voltages across the generator windings provide several advantages for mct blade fault detection it also proposes several

their attention to new sources for clean pollution free new energy according to bp world energy outlook 2018 global energy demand growth will slow down in 2018 2040 and renewable energy should rapidly develop increasing by about 33 by 2040 launch table 1 gives an estimate of the potential marine energy worldwide chen et al 2018a as one of the new electrical energy power generation technologies mcts have attracted worldwide attention khalil et al 2018 lee 2020 different reviews that consider the design of mct have been recently published chen and lam 2015 rodrigo et al 2018 ke et al 2020a specific reviews on fault detection however have not yet explicitly been published although the maritime domain contains endless renewable energy wave and turbulence conditions inevitably disturb turbine operations shear flow is one of the triggers for mct hydro dynamic asymmetry ke et al 2020b meanwhile the growth of marine organisms or marine pollutants may also cause mechanical faults in blades and which consequently generate damages to other components of the mct such as generators whitby and galde loo 2014 duhaney and khoshgoftaar 2010 2012 hu and du 2012 mjit et al 2011a bearing waters et al 2012 2013 and winding s insulation systems wang et al 2019 liu et al 2016 blade faults have a crucial impact on the safety and reliability of mct systems amir hossein and bibeau 2016 mohammad and bibeau 2020 rosli 2020 zhang et al 2014 alternatively blade fault detection approaches have been widely applied to gas turbines or wind turbines wts this paper aims to analyze the impact of blade faults and discuss open research issues related to mct blade fault detection fault detection techniques are reviewed from sensor and signal based perspectives we survey fault detection methods based on used measurements and the different techniques used so far the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the root causes of blade fault and models resultant torque imbalance in section 3 the blade fault detection methods are reviewed based on whether they use specific sensors or embedded electrical measurements i e phase currents or voltages section 4 concludes the paper and draws some perspectives for future works 2 blade fault root causes 2 1 effects of the environment on the blades the mct is installed undersea and therefore operates in harsh conditions seawater corrosion mud plankton biofouling etc with variable environmental parameters such as sudden changes in instantaneous flow velocity chen et al 2012 these harsh working conditions malki et al 2013 favour the appearance of faults or failures 2 1 1 blade biofouling a blade is prone to failure due to the exogenous undersea environment and potential threats either mechanical or biological liet al 2016 li et al 2014 for instance collision with small and medium sized marine organisms is a potential threat such as the mud and dirt attached to the blade fig 1 illustrates biofouling phenomena leading to imbalance as species distribution and growth levels of the fouling organisms are fully arbitrary benbouzid and benbouzid 2015 renewable energy for race 2016 2 1 2 wear and crack marine current flow velocity also affects the blade if this velocity is higher than 8 m s cavitation may occur on the surface of the blade pedro and marshall 2014 this wear phenomenon is illustrated in fig 2 as observed on a blade tip li et al 2016 pedro et al studied the collision of aquatic organisms with turbines they evaluated the relationship between the pressure degree and the damage level of the blades lust et al 2013 li et al 2016 in davies et al 2012 b gaurier and his co authors studied the fatigue of blades experimental tests have shown that wave current interactions must be considered in the fatigue analysis of blades as they can cause large additional loading amplitudes compared to currents alone there are many marine objects under the sea such as abundant plankton and fish masses these may continuously hit the mct blades fig 3 shows an example of an mct blade crack during the verdant power company sea trials li et al 2016 2 1 3 operating environment compared with wind turbines wts offshore wind turbines owts and hydro turbines hts the operating conditions of mcts change with the marine current velocity gauriera et al 2013 liu et al 2018 although the structure of the mcts and the wts are similar the prior is more prone to blade fractures because of the seawater characteristics as follows ren et al 2018 barakat et al 2018 a seawater density is higher than air b seawater contains corrosive metallic elements c the condensation rate of water is slower than carbon dioxide the insulation system of the mcts is improved because of those seawater characteristics due to the hermetically sealed characteristics of the mcts some conventional sensor based methods failed to complete the distribution of points and cannot be realized marine currents are subject to instability factors such as marine current movement and offshore wind and transients such transient changes make the marine current power generation systems operating conditions more complex and unstable than wts or hts islam 2004 this frequently changing water flow causes the mechanical constraints to which the blade is subjected to change instantaneously so the blades are prone to deformation and failure here are effects of variable marine current to sum up a higher impact of frequent fluctuations of water b hydraulic failure of the blade c high turbidity of seawater there are many aquatic animals and plants in the ocean the reproduction and habitat of these plants and animals are interfering with the normal operation of the mcts this kind of biofouling fault is a distinct feature of the mcts compared to other types of turbines when the mass of the blades is changed with biofouling this will affect the system s operation which not only degrades the performance but may also significantly damages its structure this has been confirmed with experimental tests carried on with a prototype table 2 compares the characteristics of the different turbines it can be found that the mcts with the marine current environment are most threatened and because of the characteristics of mct blades some sensor based methods are not applicable therefore built in sensor based fault detection methods can be a future trend for the blade fault detection method 2 2 blade fault effect and modelling 2 2 1 blade fault effect analysis as mentioned before the complexity of the ocean constitutes a harsh environment that escalates the occurrence of blade faults kaldellis et al 2016 mérigaud and ringwood 2016 compared to offshore wts one can assume that the immersion in a hostile environment will lead to lower reliability fig 4 displays the measured number of faults per year and the downtime associated with different components of offshore wts leite et al 2017 it can be noticed that the mechanical components fault mainly takes a large part in the wts downtime however the proportion of blade and gearbox faults is relatively apparent in mechanical faults among which about 5800 wts are shut down for nearly 12 h per day due to blade faults however the installation environment of the mcts is more complicated than wts or hts and the corrosion effect of underwater and marine organisms greatly threatens the mechanical components of the mct so the real time fault diagnosis of the mct blades is of great significance because of the harsh environment in which the mct operates all the components particularly the blades are under severe stress therefore they are prone to experience faults or even failures one of the main effects of the blade fault is to create an imbalance between the blades dorrell et al 2013 haneef et al 2017 the consequence is a torque imbalance that in turn produces negative sequence current in the generator windings this will result in higher joule losses which in turn will increase the generator temperature and cause voltage imbalance across the windings that will pollute the grid frost et al 2015 kearney 2013 the torque imbalance can also lead to pitch failures in the variable pitch power generation system mwasilu et al 2012 elosegui and ulazia 2017 the attachment of marine organisms will cause the blades to have different power coefficient cp at the same flow rate making the mct energy conversion efficiency subject to various fouling severities hosna and benbouzid 2017 similarly jessica m has studied the impact of blade roughness and fouling on the power coefficient experimental results show that the maximum cp factor has decreased to 42 3 for the case of roughened blades naca 63 618 jessica 2014 2 2 2 blade fault model fouling changes the mass of the mct blades the blade fouling fault can be equivalent to a virtual mass m on the blade located at a distance r u from the hub as shown in fig 5 li et al 2020 shahriar et al 2015 gong and qiao 2010 when the equivalent additional mass rotates from top to bottom the shaft rotating speed is increased otherwise the speed is reduced the equivalent additional mass m rotates with the blade and the generated torque induces speed fluctuations consequently the mechanical torque t n of the blade is expressed as 1 t n t 0 t n sin ω n t ϕ where t 0 denotes the mechanical torque under healthy condition t im mgr u g the gravitational acceleration ω m is the speed in healthy condition ω m 2πf m f m is the shaft rotating frequency which depends on the marine current velocity and ϕ is the initial phase angle this cycling frequency is equal to the blade frequency gong 2012 the motion equation is modified as 2 j m d ω n d t t n t e where j m is the moment of inertia t e is the electromagnetic torque combining 1 with 2 it can be deduced that the rotor speed ω n when the blade has experienced fault is 3 ω n ω m ω m r cos ω m t ϕ where ω mr m gr u j m ω m combined with the relationship between stator current frequency and rotor speed the stator current can be expressed as follows 4 i t i m cos p ω m t p ω m r cos ω m t ϕ t when the blade fault occurs a sinusoidal component is added to the rotation speed it can be seen from 3 and 4 that the increase or decrease of blade mass will cause different fluctuations in the rotation speed and the stator current its amplitude increases with the mass imbalance and the distance to the hub we can also notice that at high speed the mass imbalance effect will be lower however this imbalance will induce harmonics in the generator stator current spectrum the direction of the marine current will deviate due to the influence of the current movement or shear flow gaurier 2020 moreover pitch angle failure is also one of the triggers for mct hydro dynamic asymmetry fig 6 shows the hydrodynamic imbalance fault caused by the abnormal pitch angle the water flow force on the blade is decomposed into vertical force f v and horizontal force f h when the pitch angle is abnormal the forces f v and f h become unbalanced therefore the marine current turbine accelerates and decelerates every half turn generating a 1 p frequency likewise the asymmetry of water flow dynamics is also responsible of an imbalance in the forces exerted on the blades this imbalance generates a 3 p frequency oscillation in the shaft rotation speed indeed different marine current velocities obey the following equation 5 v h v h r h h r α where v h and v hr are marine current velocities at height h and h r respectively and α is the power law exponent when a single blade of the mct is worn or broken the mass of the blade is reduced in fig 7 it can be considered that the mass of the other two blades has increased the equivalent additional mass m add rotates with the blade and the generated torque induces speed fluctuations consequently likewise the mechanical torque t n of the blade is expressed as 6 t n t 0 t a d d sin ω m t ϕ where t add m add gr u it can be deduced that the rotor speed ωn when the blade has experienced fault is 7 ω n ω m ω a d d cos ω m t ϕ where ω add m add gr u j m ω m it can be seen from 7 that wear or crack fault has the same impact as fouling fault with a 1 p frequency oscillation to summarise blade fault if not detected can not only lead to accelerated wearing of mechanical components generator windings and insulation but also cause grid pollution for a grid connected mct 3 fault detection methods 3 1 specific sensor based fault detection methods in the case of an mct one should implement appropriate sensors to monitor the blade condition this includes pressure sensors i e to evaluate vessel integrity and inspect the surface of the blade tachometers i e to measure the rotational velocity of the blades temperature sensors i e to evaluate if internal blades are overheating compared with other components and strain gauges i e to control if the blades are deformed for example attached by plankton edwards et al 2011 matthew 2017 for the most part these sensors can effectively play a role in the blade status monitoring however more effective sensors or data processing methods are needed for blade fault detection hereafter let us discuss fault detection methods using specific sensors that are optional to the normal operation of the mct such as optical sensor image sensor accelerometer and temperature sensor as few sensors are currently used in mct blade fault detection some fault detection methods applied to wts or other rotating machinery with blades can be used for reference accordingly a few attributes of current references which have been summarized in table 3 among the four sensor based fault detection methods only the image sensor based method can achieve accurate fault location as confirmed by ref zheng et al 2019 vibration sensor based as compared to others is the most popular method and is widely used by wts fault diagnosis however as wts are not completely sealed vibration sensors can be placed on their external surface however marine current movement and current flow greatly affect the vibration amplitude therefore fault detection is an issue for signal processing methods another challenge is the deployment of waterproof vibration sensors currently there is no report of temperature sensor application but in terms of the internal environment of mcts the temperature signal of mcts is more reliable so blade fault detection by processing the temperature is a possibility for further research 3 1 1 optical sensor based methods non contact measurement at blade tips by optical fiber sensing technology has become a promising approach for fault detection hang eun 2018 ye et al 2014 a laser doppler distance sensor ldds capable of measuring the radial blade expansions has been developed and a system for blade fault detection and status monitoring has been presented in neumann et al 2015 a study on marine energy applications using high speed fiber bragg grating sensors has been introduced christopher 2011 a measurement system consisting of four laser doppler sensors to improve the safety and energy efficiency of turbo machines has been studied in dreier et al 2013 blade tip timing btt is another approach that utilizes several optical sensors distributed around the circumference of the rotor accordingly a blade tip timing btt method using four optical fiber sensors has been presented in lin et al 2016 and validated with promising experimental results closely related to this work stefania 2018 has used optical coherence tomography oct imaging as a novel non destructive testing tool to investigate growth marine biofilms it is worthy to point out that the use of optical sensors is a valuable solution as it is contactless however there are three main issues to address before their deployment a the installation and maintenance costs in such a hostile environment b the relevant positioning of the sensors c the adoption of usability conditions i e continuous monitoring or planned maintenance 3 1 2 image sensor based methods let us consider the image sensor as an example wen 2018 the application used to the fault diagnosis of mct blades is satisfactory when mct blades are corroded blade images can be used as valuable fault detection signals detection methods based on sparse self encoder sa and soft maximum regression sr have been applied zheng et al 2019 sa is applied to extract features while sr is used to classify the features a similar method has been used in the field of wt fault detection carr et al 2016 a data driven framework is proposed to automatically detect wind turbine blade surface cracks based on images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles uavs in wang and zhang 2017 therefore this approach can be envisaged for the mct when unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are used in baqersad et al 2012 a three dimensional digital image correlation 3d dic has been applied the results show that the method can identify failure locations and discontinuities in the blade curvature under load xin 2020 considers the mct blade fouling fault and proposes a diagnosis method based on depth wise separable convolutional neural network in order to identify the status through different pixels of fouling and blade overall the application of image sensors to the fault diagnosis of mct blades is relatively successful because the blades are short it is easier to process image data and it is more convenient to segment the blade pixels however this method cannot be used for wts not only it is hard to get blade panorama but also holder the camera is a great challenge the underwater image could monitor the status of the blades to identify location and amount of attachments or any other foreign body that can compromise the normal operation of the mct moreover deploying unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs to inspect the surface condition of mct blades is a trend for future research in this regard the main advantages of applying multi camera measurement or uuvs to detect mct blade faults include a a more frequent and periodical inspection of mct blades b recording mct blade conditions as images video in order to accurately diagnose faults c avoid the risk of staff accidents 3 1 3 accelerometer sensor based methods accelerometers require additional attention these sensors used to detect rotating machinery vibrations are among the most desirable in detecting subtle failures and pre failure wear of different components blade faults can generate abnormal vibrations park et al 2017 the vibration sensor based method has also been widely used in the mcts to monitor mct or determine the mode shapes muhammad 2015 for instance a vibration based real time method has been applied to detect locate and identify blade faults abdeljaber et al 2017 however when considering the mct the information contained in the vibration signal is much more complex to analyze due to significant underwater noise different components of the mct will complete one full cycle of motion at different angle speed due to a variable marine current khan et al 2013 the variable rotation speed often induces different vibration signals to the various components of the mct thus interfering with the final fault feature extraction in liu 2016 an underwater vibration signal pre processing method has been developed pre processing techniques such as sampling data standardization sampling data smoothing processing and a vibration strength method based on pseudo dissipation evaluation platforms have been suggested to detect the shear of vibration signals for underwater equipment a smart vibration monitoring system svms has been introduced in mjit et al 2011b it has been developed as an effective way to reduce equipment losses and enhance the safety and lifetime duration of the mct blades features are extracted from raw vibration signals using a short time wavelet transform with a base lining technique that has been presented in duhaney et al 2012 it is designed to allow for reliable state detection regardless of mct operating conditions in duhaney et al 2011 a high frequency ac104 sensor and four low frequency ac136 1a sensors are used to measure vibration signals to verify the effectiveness of the fault feature extraction algorithm furthermore the accelerometers measure the mechanical vibration whereas the blade imbalance fault directly influences seawater flow despite its potential the utilization of vibration signals for mct blade fault detection is still a perspective so far it is still not entirely conducive for detecting early potential failures of mct 3 1 4 temperature sensor based methods measuring the blade or environment temperature has also been considered to evaluate the mct current condition li 2019 qiu et al 2016 indeed when the blades are under severe stress their inner temperature will increase beyond the usual range therefore blade temperature can be used as a fault feature in nienhaus and hilbert 2012 the temperature data is pre processed and feature extraction has been performed to establish a characteristic model of the blade if the temperature is measured in each blade the distribution should be modeled and analyzed to perform the fault detection in feng et al 2017 the discrete fourier transform has been used to set up the model a support vector machine svm method has also been used in chen and wang 2013 to evaluate the effect of a small sample on learning and local minimization problems the main issues to use the temperature as the fault feature are a the sensors should be sealed and entirely isolated from the environment b the transmission of the information to the processing unit c the correlation between the temperature evolution and its effects on the materials 3 2 built in sensor based fault detection methods for decades phase current and voltage sensors almost always installed in any electrical system are being used to detect and diagnose ac motor faults such as broken bars and rotor eccentricities shi et al 2008 tan et al 2011 rotor imbalance and rotor torsional vibration cai and deng 2017 kim 2009 therefore motor current signal analysis mcsa can also be used for fault detection in this application as far as the electrical signals embed the fault signatures mustapha et al 2011 goktas et al 2016 the fault features can lie in the time frequency or time frequency domain gao et al 2015 for signal processing the mct operates under the condition of wave and turbulence which results in the variation of the mechanical torque and speed consequently there are three issues when built in sensor based fault detection methods are considered 1 the fault characteristics are not clear with restricted information compared with onshore power generation equipment the mcts require protection equipment such as insulation and corrosion resistance for underwater work fewer measurement points can be arranged in actual projects making the monitoring device for mcts limited the time and frequency domain feature information commonly used in fault detection methods is not clear it is challenging to obtain fault features for example the acquisition of signals such as vibration and torque require additional sensors which increases maintenance costs and is more likely to cause sensor failure due to seawater corrosion therefore studying how to deeply mine rich fault features from a small amount of information is the basis for solving the blade fault detection 2 diversified fault characteristics under variable marine current speeds the operating conditions of mcts change with the current flow velocity the current velocity varies within a wide range so that the torque and speed of the turbine will fluctuate besides the mct blades are smaller than wind turbines and the energy density of seawater is high which makes the stator currents more affected by the flow velocity the random marine current velocity changes such as surges and turbulences cause the stator currents to change frequently and the corresponding fault characteristics change accordingly the similar kind of fault has various fault characteristics extracted under different working conditions of the mcts blade which reduces the accuracy of fault diagnosis 3 strong interference from the marine environment and noise compared with wts and hts the instantaneous variable marine current causes the operating parameters of mcts to change accordingly some of the changes in amplitude and frequency are partially or entirely covered when the flow velocity is large mcts will experience higher cavitation at the tip of the blades the relatively high blade tip speed may make it difficult for the blades to avoid the formation of cavities when the bubble disappears a small and powerful pressure wave occurs with noise and vibration due to the conflict in the center therefore an in depth study of the operating mechanism of mcts and improving the accuracy of fault identification under strong interference are important contents of mcts fault detection some attributes of the presented references have been summarized in table 4 many fault detection methods applied to wts blade and other rotating machinery are not suitable for mcts not only because the mct blade structure is quite different but also because the mcts operating environment is harsh in fault detection method based on signal processing the processing cost of time domain signals is lower but it is weak in frequency domain however when the frequency domain information is used to process the stator current the fault features are often submerged in the main frequency and marine noise therefore the time frequency domain is the best choice for fault feature extraction however how to remove the influence of surge and turbulence on stator current is a crucial issue compared with the wts 3 2 1 time domain signal based methods once the variables are measured they are filtered or normalized in the pre processing step if the number of variables is high the dimension reduction can be made before fault extraction using principal component analysis pca or independent component analysis then the fault features are extracted using signal processing techniques these features can be statistical properties or can be related to frequency components in the spectrum the analysis can also be monovariate or multivariate principal component analysis pca and independent component analysis ica have been widely used for blade fault detection in rotating machinery wang et al 2015 chen et al 2018b however those techniques are optimal if the distribution of the variables remains unchanged at fault occurrence ge and song 2010 a model correlation pca method has been proposed in zhang et al 2017a for detecting the mct blade fault the test results using hotelling t2 statistic and spe statistic are shown in fig 8 it was shown that the proposed method was successful in eliminating statistical differences and detecting blade collision fault under the conditions of marine current change and variable load thanks to the multi mode relationship the blade collision fault can be detected effectively by t2 statistic and q statistic it is proved that it is necessary to separate operating points in different marine current modes otherwise the real time fault detection of mct will cause false alarms fusion fault theory and neural network pca method have been used for mct blade faults detection and distinction in zhang et al 2018a this method helps to mitigate the interference due to the flow rate change of the monitored variables in this regard envelope analysis also plays a vital role in motor fault detection compared with statistical analysis and it was reported that the envelopes of the current signal could detect motor eccentricity this method is also worthy of being considered in mct blade fault detection recently several machine learning methods have been applied to detect fault in mct a bidirectional long short term memory network is proposed in david 2018 in tang 2019 the authors have built an mct prediction model for fault detection in haddad and strangas 2016 the authors have proposed a method for diagnosing and classifying mechanical and electrical faults in permanent magnet synchronous generators based on lda in lei et al 2019 the authors have proposed a data dimensionality reduction based on the long short term memory networks method for turbine fault diagnosis a novel fault diagnosis method based on manifold learning and shannon wavelet support vector machine is proposed in tang 2014 similarly a mahalanobis semi supervised mapping mssm manifold learning algorithm was proposed in wang 2020 this method has a significant dimensionality reduction effect on a large amount of scada data and the accuracy of the fault diagnosis classification reaches 100 a hybrid dimensionality reduction strategy was recently proposed and applied to steam turbine data shabnam and montazeri gh 2020 this method retains the fault information to the greatest extent based on reducing the data dimension a variety of dimensionality reduction analysis algorithms are compared to highlight the effectiveness of the method ref malik and mishra 2016 has proposed fuzzy q learning fql based on an adaptive self learning turbine fault diagnostic model using the current flowing into the generator s windings the proposed fql based classifier could serve as an important tool for the turbine machine a method for processing electrical signals using the image analysis method is proposed in chen et al 2019 this method uses the deep train to learn and classify images to diagnose the faults of the turbine blades 3 2 2 frequency domain signal based methods several faults may affect the spectral content of system s variables therefore the stator current frequency could be a relevant feature for blade fault detection in toumi 2016 a method is proposed to find the fault features by calculating the stator electromotive force the method exhibits good detection capability for mcts in matthew 2013 the thrust data has been projected into the frequency domain and the amplitude spectrum is analyzed to check the fault states the bispectrum analysis of the open loop stator current has also been used for mct blade fault detection and the 1 p fault frequency was found in the bispectrum lotfi 2019 in huang et al 2019 authors have used the normalized spectra of the output power signal of an mct to estimate the remaining life likewise the normalized spectra of the mct torque signal are also considered in allmark 2015 recently an imbalance mct blade fault detection method based on data normalization and the combination of power spectral density psd and synchronous sampling algorithm has been proposed in zhang et al 2017b it has successfully extracted the sideband components in faulty conditions however the performances are degraded under the condition of turbulence as shown in fig 9 it can be found from the figure that in the stator current spectrum where the imbalance fault occurs two excitations appear on both sides of the main frequency under different current conditions these two excitations show different shapes the fault characteristics are more obvious in the case and the spectrum of the stator current is messier in the case of turbulence so analysing effects of turbulence is very meaningful as the fault detection in the frequency domain relies on the determination of the sideband frequencies this method will be suitable if a the speed range is wide b the stationary conditions are fulfilled c the time window is large enough to guarantee an accurate frequency resolution 3 2 3 time frequency signal based methods signal estimation and detection theory provide a framework and tools for deriving optimal parameter estimation from a noisy signal under relevant statistical assumptions yan and lu 2014 a fault characteristic analysis method based on stator current instantaneous frequency has been developed using the least squares rotation vector invariant technique tls esprit it estimates stator current frequencies during transients and uses generalized likelihood ratio detection glrt to design the detector zhang et al 2018b experimental results show that this signal processing method is suitable for mct blade fault detection under complex conditions in order to deal with transients and frequency resolution wavelet transforms have been widely used for fault detection in the time frequency domain wavelet transforms retain a non uniform division of time and frequency therefore allowing accurate simultaneous time and frequency resolutions they also have the advantage of multi resolution analysis time frequency localization wavelet transforms can deal with non stationary signals such as generator phase currents wavelet transforms have already been used in the field of mct blade fault detection the author in li 2020 uses the wavelet transforms to denoising the stator current of mct while allmark et al 2015 uses it to extract the time frequency information in feng et al 2016 brittny et al 2019 allmark 2016 three features have been extracted by using time domain analysis and wavelet packet decomposition this method has succeeded in reducing the error rate in turbine blade fault diagnosis hilbert huang transform hht has also been used for turbines fault detection this technique is composed of two steps empirical mode decomposition and hilbert spectrum analysis gu et al 2018 a variety of demodulation algorithms are compared and analyzed with generator data vikas and parey 2019 ref jiang 2019 proposes a coarse to fine decomposing strategy of vmd which further improves the vmd method and is mainly used to extract weak faults ref diahpk 2019 uses the wavelet algorithm to demodulate the stator current signal for the attachment fault of the mct and performs noise reduction processing on the stator current signal and the effect is significant an ieemd method combined with ht is proposed in chen 2017 for extracting incipient fault features of gearboxes the improved vmd and eemd methods are proposed in li 2018 and amirat et al 2018 respectively they performed multi scale demodulation respectively with significant improvement effects in zhang et al 2016 empirical mode decomposition emd and spectrum analysis have been successfully used to extract the mct fault feature and the fault frequency i e shaft rotating frequency stator current and spectrum in wave and turbulence conditions are displayed in fig 10 and fig 11 it can be found that the spectrum of the instantaneous current frequency filtered by the emd filtering method has only a 1 p frequency 1 95 hz excitation the interference terms caused by water flow have been removed by filtering however the method does not explicitly select the appropriate imf components furthermore automatic detection will be the next step when the perfect representation of the fault characteristics is completed very recently a harmonic analysis strategy based on zero crossing estimation and emd filter bank analysis at each time frequency bin is proposed in zhang et al 2019 which can minimize the disturbance of main frequency and improve the performance of the blade imbalance detection ref tang 2020 uses the knn method to classify the fault severities of blade imbalance for mcts and with a success rate of 100 3 3 experimental results a 230 w direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator experimental platform was built in our laboratory the mct prototype the parameters are shown in table 5 is placed in the water flow channel as shown in fig 12 the simulated current flow rate is regulated by the variable frequency regulator of the pump motor and the adjustment range is from 0 7 m s to 1 5 m s the drum motor function is to simulate the waves so that the turbulence of the current in the experiment changes with the same pump flow rate this mct prototype system is also equipped with data acquisition equipment and a state monitoring host computer with a sampling frequency of 1 khz fig 13 shows the image information under different fouling fault severities and we defined different degrees of fouling by segmenting blade area as shown in fig 14 and some methods mentioned before are carried out and evaluated experimental results in table 6 show that several machine learning techniques can efficiently recognize the attachment under turbid submerged conditions in song 2019 an acoustic signal is used to detect underwater propeller failures a dpca based method is proposed to process the signal however this scheme is based on the acoustic emission signal in an absolute noise canceling environment and the acoustic emission signal is not ideal due to the real ocean velocity and environment due to the influence of variable water flow the acoustic signal presents large fluctuations as shown in fig 15 and useful information cannot be extracted in this case as shown in fig 16 the vibration signals under different mass imbalance faults are collected after psd analysis as shown in fig 17 it is found that the vibration sensor is seriously affected by the underwater environment and the fault signature cannot be easily retrieved the expected 1 p excitation does not appear at 1 p frequency this implies that fault detection based on vibration sensors is still a challenging task fig 18 and fig 19 show the stator current and instantaneous power waveforms under different fouling fault severities fig 20 shows the instantaneous frequency of stator current under different fault severities the variations of the amplitude of the 1 p frequency component can be used as a fault indicator fig 21 shows the instantaneous power spectrum under different fault severities and it is obvious to note that there is no excitation at 1 p frequency for the healthy case it is also noted that the amplitude at 1 p frequency increases with the fault level fig 22 shows the spectrum amplitudes for three different signals with resampling methods single current single voltage and instantaneous power under constant marine current velocity for different fault severities all amplitudes are divided by the absolute value of the mass imbalance if any fig 23 displays the spectrum amplitudes for the same three methods for different marine current speeds under a constant additional mass from these two figures three conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the resampled instantaneous power frequency spectrum is much more sensitive to the fault severity 2 all the three methods are rather robust to the variable marine current velocity 3 the resampled instantaneous power method enhances the fault feature extraction 4 perspectives table 7 provides a comprehensive comparison of mct blade fault detection techniques their characteristics such as intrusive complexity and maintenance are respectively addressed and we suggest the following four directions for future research work a a fault model of unstable conditions such as surge and turbulence should be established as mentioned before the frequent occurrence of waves and turbulence causes blade faults this happens randomly and leads to non linear behavior and non gaussian distribution of the fault features the unstable condition also generates transient phenomena b transmission of the measurements in such a hostile environment is a real challenge whatever the sensors because of numerous obstacles and lighting conditions c to obtain high fault detection and diagnosis performances combination of sensors may be relevant then multi sensor information fusion would be of utmost importance d mct blade fault detection performances based on single domain information are relatively weak because of the difficulty for extracting features in noisy environment therefore multi domain feature fusion might be explored and applied to blade fault detection such methods should process information in multiple domains including the time frequency time scale and time frequency domains 5 conclusion the objective of this paper was to give an overview of the existing methods and techniques used for mct blade fault detection the methods have been classified depending on whether the measures are collected using specific sensors e g accelerometers cameras temperature or the built in generator phase currents sensors it appears that specific sensor based methods suitable for fault detection of wts blades are not necessarily suitable for mcts given similar mct and wt the pros cons for blade fault detection techniques are presented in table 8 because of their different environment the maintenance cost of the sensors installed on consideration should be given to the application of built in sensor based methods to mcts meanwhile it is also essential to design more effective noise reduction and filtering methods for the marine noise caused by turbulence and waves altogether the advantages and disadvantages of these methods are presented and evaluated they are acquired using appropriate sensors installed in various mct components for built in sensor based methods the stator phase current or voltage signals are usually processed with the envelope analysis fft frequency analysis and time frequency domain analysis methods using wavelet or hilbert transform alternatively new fault features can be analyzed such as instantaneous power signals torque signals etc furthermore it is also relevant to analyze the features in multiple domains therefore it will be beneficial to combine different sensors and signal based methods to enhance fault detection performance however significant effort is still needed to develop these technologies to achieve a cost effective blade condition monitoring system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

21292,foundations of some structures such as transmission towers mooring systems for ocean surface or submerged platforms tall chimneys jetty structures are subjected to uplift loading in such cases to increase the uplift resistance of piles pile foundations like anchored piles batter piles and micro piles are extensively employed depending on in situ conditions this paper deals with the contribution of pile surface to the uplift capacity and the failure mechanism obtained for the pile groups in sand and the main goal of the study is to investigate the effect of the pile surface roughness on the uplift capacity for different spacing ratios between piles therefore the paper presents some findings of a single pile and pile groups embedded in sand under uplift loading the variables investigated include the pile surface pile embedment ratio and the spacing ratio between piles experiments were conducted to study foregoing parameters and three dimensional analyses were performed using the finite element method to illustrate the failure mechanism of pile groups and the interaction between piles for different spacing ratios between piles the results show that the finite element simulation results indicate good agreement with the experiment results and all variables significantly affect the uplift capacity of piles keywords failure mechanism finite element method laboratory test pile group uplift loading 1 introduction pile foundation is a preferred type of deep foundation in a situation where current ground conditions do not allow the formation of a safe and economical shallow foundation since developed technological opportunities positively affect to the production conditions of pile foundations these kinds of foundations have become widely used in practice and scientific studies by some civil engineers vesić 1969 meyerhof 1976 poulos and davis 1980 prakash and sharma 1990 tomlinson 1994 ismael 2001 salgado 2008 das 2016 tehrani et al 2017 al khazaali and vanapalli 2019 deb and pal 2020 jeong et al 2020 the piles called as the uplift or pullout piles are used in order to increase the stability of structures such as transmission towers mooring systems for ocean surface or submerged platforms tall chimneys jetty structures subject to advanced or excess hydrostatic pressure and torsional moment and to prevent the structure damages stemming from the foregoing reasons i e hydrostatic pressure and torsional moment in addition to this the uplift piles are generally used for decreasing the effect some forces which are presented herein the wind and earthquake forces affecting high rise structures the wave and ship forces affecting docks and coastal structures the lifting force of water affecting offshore drilling platforms and large area structures under the groundwater level le tirant 1992 the pile foundations under the effect of these sorts of forces can be designed different types and dimensions and also designed both as a single pile and a pile group the uplift capacity of a single pile generally consists of pile s own weight friction resistance which occurs along the pile and soil weight which remains in the failure mechanism however pile groups show more different behaviour than that of the single pile since the area affected by the piles in the pile groups has an important role in the pile behaviour when the spacing ratio between piles in the pile group is too small i e the group configuration of the piles in closely spaced it can cause that the uplift capacity of each pile in the pile group may not equal to the uplift capacity of a single pile in this sort of situation pile pile interaction occurs and the situation can be explained with that all piles in the group and the soil surrounding the piles behave like a block i e far from the singularity tomlinson 1994 the failure mechanism of a pile group is affected by some parameters or variables such as soil type and density the length and surface of the pile the spacing ratio between piles and pile configuration layout understanding the pile behaviour and predicting the capacity of piles under uplift loading are important topics in foundation design most of the current design methods used for the pile groups under the uplift forces are based on the experimental knowledge which is obtained from the laboratory model test das et al 1976 o neill et al 1982 das 1983 subba rao and venkatesh 1985 das 1986 levacher and sieffert 1984 chattopadhyay and pise 1986 madhav 1987 das and shin 1992 chattopadhyay 1994 patra and pise 2003 shanker et al 2006 shelke and patra 2008 shanker et al 2009 nasr 2013 gaaver 2013 faizi et al 2015 and galvis castro et al 2019 performed both theoretical and experimental studies on a single pile and pile group embedded in sand so as to investigate the effect of some parameters such as pile surface pile diameter relative density of sand pile embedment ratio and the spacing ratio between piles on the uplift capacity in these studies it was founded that the uplift capacity generally increased linearly with the increase of spacing ratio between piles this conclusion is quite true but not economical for foundation design therefore it is required to be presented an optimum spacing ratio between piles under the effect of different variables the experimental study conducted by emirler et al 2019 indicated that there was not a certain optimum spacing ratio between piles and when any parameters such as the relative density of sand and the pile embedment ratio were changed the spacing ratio had to be determined over again because of the boundary conditions soil pile interaction and pile pile interaction the foregoing literature reviews show that there is still a major lack of comprehensive study i e experimental and particularly numerical on the behaviour of the pile groups embedded in the sand soil in order to determine the optimum spacing ratio between piles for different pile surface in this study therefore the uplift behaviour of smooth and rough single piles and pile groups embedded in dense sand with a relative density of 80 was investigated experimentally and numerically in the experiments and analyses performed for this purpose smooth and rough steel piles with circular geometry were employed the uplift capacity of a single pile and pile group configuration of 2 2 under the effect of various parameters which will be explained in the following sections was studied in detail in the study the effect of the pile surface i e smooth and rough on the spacing ratio between piles was observed by both methods mentioned above afterwards the effect of the pile embedment ratio on the uplift capacity of the pile group by using the optimum spacing ratio value for both pile surfaces was investigated as experimentally and numerically moreover for the different spacing ratios between piles the failure mechanism of group piles and the interaction between piles were illustrated with the help of the numerical part of the study modelling of this kind of a problem in a computer environment is quite difficult owing to the nonlinear soil behaviour and the interaction between soil and pile it is thought therefore the validated numerical part with the experiments gives a unique or novel identity to the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental investigation experiments were performed in the steel frame system which was situated in the laboratory of civil engineering department of cukurova university loading device used in the experiments was specially manufactured and then mounted on the steel frame system the loading device is speed controlled and the loading arm can be moved up and down directions according to the previous studies in which the behaviour of piles subjected to uplift load was investigated both field and laboratory loading experiments were carried out by applying uplift load at a constant velocity the effect of loading velocity on the shear strength was generally investigated with the direct shear tests by selecting different shear velocities the results obtained from the direct shear tests in the literature indicated that the shear strength of sand soil was not significantly affected by different shear velocities in drained conditions and it was also stated that the changes in the shear strength of sand soil were too small to be considered al mhaidib 2006 however the effects of uplift loading velocity on the behaviour of piles embedded in sand soil were studied with the model tests where it was used two different uplift loading velocity i e 1 882 mm min and 9 410 mm min therewithal those velocity values refer to the minimum and maximum values to be able to apply by the test system it has been understood from the test results that the loading velocity does not significantly affect the maximum uplift capacity of piles embedded in the sand and the obtained maximum uplift capacity values for two different velocities are nearly equal nevertheless in order to both save much data and to obtain a more understandable curve the loading velocity was chosen as the value of 1 882 mm min and the experiments were continued up to the displacement value of 5 mm fig 1 a square steel framework test box with inside dimensions of 700 mm length 700 mm width 500 mm depth was employed and the experiments were conducted after the test box was placed to the loading frame system fixed to the laboratory ground or floor the model steel piles in the length of 400 mm and diameter of 25 mm which have two different surfaces i e smooth and rough were used in the experiments fig 2 when the previous studies were investigated various methods such as sandpapering glueing of the sand grains over the pile surface for roughening up the pile surface were encountered it was stated that the ultimate value of the shaft friction was controlled by the behaviour of a thin zone close to the pile surface and its thickness depended on the pile surface roughness and varied between 2 5 d50 for a smooth pile and 10 15 d50 for a rough pile wernick 1978 yoshimi and kishida 1981 boulon 1988 hoteit 1990 d50 refers the mean particle size of the sand fioravante 2002 reported that the roughness should be evaluated with the normalised roughness defined as rn rt d50 where rt is equal to the maximum vertical distance between a peak and a trough over the surface for rn 0 02 the interface is smooth and no dilatancy occurs whereas for rn 0 1 the interface is totally rough and dilatancy occurs in this study the roughness was provided by grooving on the pile surface and the normalised roughness value is greater than 0 1 which shows rough pile surface also in this way the degree of roughness does not change from test to test and the results of the experiments are not affected in other words it is maintained the experiments continuity during the experimental studies electronic load cells were used to read the load values applied to model piles in tests it was aimed that the effect of the pile configuration layout on the uplift capacity was determined by adding the load cells having the capacity of 0 5 kn on each model pile in addition to this an electronic load cell having the capacity of 20 kn was used to determine and validate the uplift load affecting the whole system the displacements occurred as the result of uplifting the model piles were determined by using two displacement transducers lvdts contacting with the plate to which the piles were attached these displacement transducers can measure in the range of 0 50 mm by calculating the average of displacements measured at two different points of equal distance to the centre of the system the displacement occurring in the piled system was obtained for each load stage the load and displacement values obtained by the data logger during the tests were transferred to a computer programme and they were transformed into the numerical values moreover the test apparatus and all relevant attachments are presented in figs 3 and 4 in order to clarify the test setup which consists of the loading system test box model piles load cells displacement transducers and sand soil several methods exist for preparing a sand bed in the laboratory including impact vibration and the raining technique in tests it is important to have a uniform deposit to ensure the repeatability of tests among the mentioned methods the vibration method for the dense sand conditions was chosen to reach a desired relative density of sand so as to achieve desired density the inner surfaces of the test box were marked at 5 cm intervals to make easy the preparation of the sand in layers for dense conditions the amount of sand for each layer was compacted by a hand held vibratory compactor until achieving the required layer height in order to maintain the consistency of in place a relative density of 80 γdry 17 0 kn m3 throughout the test box the same compaction effort was applied on each layer of sand delrin material was also used under the vibratory compactor to ensure uniform compaction and prevent breakage of sand grains finally the model piles were installed before the sand samples with a desired relative density were placed in the test box therefore it was not provided with any improvement around the piles due to compression unlike the method where the piles were driven into the soil and consequently it was obtained a pure uplift capacity sand samples brought from the seyhan riverbed in cukurova region were used they were sieved by washing from sieves number 18 1 mm diameter and 200 0 074 mm diameter according to astm d2487 11 american society for testing and materials and at the end of the sieving process they were dried in an oven sand samples were sieved from a predetermined batch of sieves considering the foregoing standard and grain size distribution was obtained see fig 5 from the grain size distribution curve soil class was identified as poorly graded fine and clean sand sp according to the unified soil classification system uscs test results of sieve analysis were presented in table 1 to determine the angle of internal friction of dense sand used in this study a series of direct shear tests were carried out under the different compressive loads and the angle of internal friction of dense sand with a relative density of 80 was calculated to be 41 5⁰ emirler 2019 lastly in this section it was mentioned the parameters investigated in the experiments for both single pile and group piles while the variables for the single pile was pile surfaces smooth and rough and pile embedment ratios l d 8 12 16 the parameters for the group piles were pile surfaces smooth and rough pile embedment ratios l d 8 12 16 and spacing ratios between piles s d 2 4 6 8 10 the effects of these parameters on the uplift capacity for both single pile and group piles were presented in detail thereafter table 2 2 2 numerical investigation performing an experiment in the laboratory environment in foundation engineering has not only difficult but also a time consuming procedure in addition the operation is quite expensive however the results obtained from this sort of test are the closest to the results acquired from the large scale or field tests therefore to develop a numerical model which is less expensive not time consuming and at the same time in a good agreement with the experimental results can provide a very significant benefit for the geotechnical designers for this purpose a series of three dimensional numerical analyses were performed in order to investigate the uplift load capacity displacement behaviour of piles and to illustrate the failure mechanism of them which consists of the most important part of the study plaxis 3d computer software based on the finite element method was selected because of some advantages of it for the numerical analyses the most important advantages of the program are that it contains different complex material models for modelling soils as well as it contains some special structural elements for piles foundations retaining walls etc when previous numerical studies on this subject were examined the soils were modelled as either linear elastic or nonlinear elastic but the soils generally behave plastically under high loading conditions brown and shie 1990 trochanis et al 1991 wakai et al 1999 chae et al 2004 johnson et al 2006 since using accurate soil model is essential for prediction of soil responses the numerical analyses were carried out employing the mohr coulomb elastoplastic soil constitutive model to reflect the behaviour of sand more realistically moayedi and mosallanezhad 2017 dong et al 2018 li et al 2018 yang et al 2018 ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2019 chen et al 2020 jebur et al 2020 jeong et al 2020 pandey and chauhan 2020 deb and pal 2020 soil behaviour in the analysis of foundation engineering problems can be frequently investigated with the mc model for some reasons to be needed a small number of model parameters the possibility of defining the failure criteria by using simple physical properties like cohesion and internal friction angle and to be obtained easily those parameters with the fundamental soil mechanics laboratory tests for the pile element the software offers a special option called an embedded pile therefore this special option was used while defining the piles in the analyses the embedded pile has been developed to describe the interaction of a pile with its surrounding soil the interaction at the pile skin and at the pile foot is described by means of embedded interface elements the pile is considered as a beam which can cross a 10 node tetrahedral element at any place with any arbitrary orientation in such problems with soil pile interaction the interaction between pile and soil is provided with the interface element however it is not needed any extra effort with the help of the embedded pile option since the option already contains within itself the interaction via some formulations brinkgreve et al 2015 the sand soil parameters with the relative density of 80 for the mohr coulomb elastoplastic soil constitutive model are presented in detail in table 3 moreover the model pile properties supported by previous studies such as laman 1995 karahan 2007 are given in table 4 in the finite element method mesh density is a critical issue which closely relates to the accuracy of the finite element models while it directly determines their complexity level due to its importance in generating finite element models the foremost problem is to choose appropriate elements size so that the created models yield accurate finite element analysis results while saving as much computing time as possible liu and glass 2013 because of those reasons a series of numerical analyses where different mesh densities were considered were performed in order to determine optimum mesh density and afterwards the effect of mesh density on the uplift capacity of the pile was investigated in these analyses while the soil zones were created by using the 10 node tetrahedral elements in the 3d mesh procedure five different mesh densities which were presented by the software from very coarse to very fine sizes were tested when the pile embedment ratio was equal to 8 and the pile was under the effect of the uplift load of 200 n mesh density analyses were performed with the model pile which had steel material properties this applied load value was selected greater than that of the biggest uplift load observed in the experiments furthermore the uplift load value corresponding to the same displacement value was taken into account for all mesh densities since the soil in the analysis performed in very fine mesh density collapsed when the displacement value was equal to 0 40 mm the effect of the number of finite elements the number of nodes and the element size on the uplift capacity of the pile were presented with the numeric values in table 5 according to the results in the table it was understood that the uplift load in a very coarse mesh density was calculated approximately 50 greater than the uplift load in a very fine mesh density for the same displacement value it was observed that there was a significant change in the uplift capacity values of the pile depending on the increase or decrease in the number of element and mesh density was determined to be an effective parameter on the analysis results the closest result to the uplift load value obtained from the test was obtained from the analyses performed with fine and very fine mesh densities since there was no significant difference in the results obtained from fine and very fine mesh densities fine mesh density was chosen to save computer effort and time an example of a three dimensional finite element model established by using a fine mesh density is illustrated in fig 6 as seen in the figure for comparison with the experimental findings similar to the conditions of the tests performed the numerical model was established in three dimensions of 700 mm length 700 mm width 500 mm depth numerical analyses were performed for both single pile and pile group configuration of 2 2 embedded in dense sand with a relative density of 80 in the analyses conducted for the single pile the effect of two parameters i e pile surface and pile embedment ratio on the uplift capacity of the pile was studied on the other hand in the analyses carried out for pile group it was aimed at first to determine optimum spacing ratio value between piles afterwards the effects of both pile surface and pile embedment ratio on the total uplift capacity were investigated at that optimum value and lastly it was illustrated the failure mechanisms of smooth and rough piles for different pile embedment ratios and spacing ratios between piles 3 results and discussion 3 1 findings for single pile experimental and numerical results for the single pile are given in fig 7 in which the influences of pile surface and pile embedment ratio on the uplift capacity of the pile were presented in detail when the foregoing figure was examined firstly it can be observed that the numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental results secondly and more importantly the uplift capacity of the rough pile is greater than that of the smooth pile for the same pile embedment ratios this situation can be explained with the increase of surface resistance which consists of due to the interlocking between pile and sand soil sadrekarimi et al 2009 the uplift capacity difference between rough and smooth piles at l d 8 was nearly 40 while this difference was respectively approximately 50 and 70 at l d 12 and l d 16 therefore the results showed that the pile surface was an important parameter for the uplift capacity finally it was observed from the figure that the pile embedment ratio significantly affected the uplift capacity of piles in other words the uplift capacity increased with the increase in the pile embedment ratio for both pile surfaces the reason for that result can be explained with the increased embedment length of the pile the soil surrounding the pile along the pile length exhibits a more rigid behaviour and indicates greater resistance to the movement of the pile in the uplift direction el sawwaf and nazir 2006 with the increase of the pile embedment ratio the uplift capacity increases approximately 5 5 times in the rough pile whereas that value increases approximately 4 4 times in the smooth pile see fig 8 obtaining of the failure mechanism with an experiment is a quite difficult procedure however obtaining the failure mechanism with the help of validated numerical model as in this study is a much easier method therefore the failure mechanism of a single pile under the effect of two parameters i e pile surface and pile embedment ratio was investigated by the numerical analyses the failure mechanisms obtained from the analyses reflected a good example of the failure mechanisms presented in the previous works such as chattopadhyay and pise 1986 shelke and patra 2008 according to the numerical results when the rough pile was employed the affected area was more extensive than the affected area when the smooth pile was used the reason for the case can be explained with the increase in the surface resistance between the rough pile and sand soil because of more friction compared to the smooth pile in addition to this it was also observed that the affected area also depends on the pile length and the increase in the embedment length of the pile naturally brings about an increase in the affected area since the interaction length between pile and sand soil extends as seen in fig 9 3 2 findings for pile group a pile group generally shows more different behaviour than a single pile because of the effect of the pile influence area on the pile behaviour and that is called group effect the group effect is about pile pile interaction and it is required to determine the minimum i e optimum distance between piles in the pile group in order to perish that interaction when the interaction is eliminated each pile in a group behaves like a single pile which means the group efficiency is equal to 100 for this purpose the effect of the spacing ratio between piles on the total uplift capacity was investigated in the tests for both smooth and rough pile group of 2 2 when the pile embedment ratio is equal to 8 afterwards some numerical analyses at the same conditions with the test were performed to compare the results moreover to determine the uplift capacity of each pile a load cell was connected to each pile in the group thus it was aimed to observe the difference in the uplift load value of each pile because the pile group had a square layout 2 2 the uplift loads each pile in the group had to be almost equal the uplift load displacement behaviours of smooth pile group obtained from the experiments were presented in fig 10 the experiments were conducted in the pile embedment ratio of 8 and for the different spacing ratios between piles changing from 2 to 10 the results indicated that each pile in the group has almost the same curve and therefore it was understood that the experiments were conducted correctly and the sand soil was brought to the desired density homogeneously besides a generally accepted load displacement behaviour for dense sands i e the curve does a peak in the failure point and then it decreases was obtained the same procedure as for smooth piles was applied to the rough piles l d 8 and s d 2 to 10 to determine the optimum spacing ratio between piles the total uplift load values obtained from experiments and analyses for smooth and rough pile groups corresponding to each selected spacing ratio between piles s d 2 4 6 8 10 were presented in fig 11 as shown in the figure both methods offered very consistent results with each other moreover the total uplift capacity of the pile group increased with the increase of the spacing ratio between piles since the pile pile interaction decreased and the group efficiency increased that interaction between piles was disappeared when the spacing ratio was equal to 8 and 10 for the smooth and rough pile groups respectively in other words the pile groups worked with 100 efficiency in these spacing ratios between piles and each pile in the pile groups behaved like a single pile that means each pile has an uplift capacity of a single pile see fig 12 for instance the uplift capacity of a smooth single pile was equal to approximately 0 084 kn whereas that value was equal to 0 045 kn for each pile in the smooth pile group at s d 2 and therefore the group efficiency was estimated to be 60 on the other hand the group efficiency at s d 2 was determined to be 40 for the rough pile group consequently for the same spacing ratios the group efficiency in the rough pile group was obtained lesser than that in the smooth pile group because the rough piles need more distance between them compared to the smooth piles to be able to eliminate the interaction between piles to illustrate the interaction between piles and the effect of spacing ratio on the failure mechanisms of both smooth and rough pile groups some numerical results were presented in the study see figs 13 and 14 thus the pile pile interaction that causes a decrease in the uplift capacity of the piles was clearly observed according to the figures the interaction between piles decreased with the increase of spacing ratios and no interaction observed when the optimum spacing ratio values was reached that means the piles behaved like a single pile at those ratios the optimum spacing ratios between piles can be determined as 8 and 10 for the smooth and rough pile groups respectively provided that the pile embedment ratio is equal to 8 after the optimum spacing ratios for both smooth s d 8 and rough s d 10 pile groups were determined in order to show that suggested optimum spacing ratios were valid for only the pile embedment ratio of 8 a series numerical analyses were performed and then the results were compared with those obtained from experiments see fig 15 the results showed that the total uplift load increased with the increase of the pile embedment ratio for both pile surfaces and the total uplift capacity of rough pile group at l d 8 was nearly 1 3 times greater than that of smooth pile group however the same parameter for the rough pile group compared to the smooth pile group was approximately 1 5 and 1 7 times greater at l d 12 and 16 respectively in addition to this the agreement observed at l d 8 between experiment and finite element method diminished with the increase the pile embedment ratio since the interaction between piles occurred over again in the pile embedment ratios of 12 and 16 to better understand the resulting interaction the pile pile interaction therefore at l d 12 and 16 was clearly illustrated in fig 16 and the failure mechanism obtained is similar to proposed by tomlinson 1994 consequently that result indicated that the optimum spacing ratio should be determined over again to be able to work at 100 efficiency of group piles when any parameters that affect the uplift capacity of pile group finally it is also indicated that the pile surface and pile embedment ratio are highly important variables to provide a greater uplift capacity in the pile groups see fig 17 4 limitations a comprehensive study of a single pile and pile group subjected to uplift loading is presented herein for this purpose both experimental and numerical investigations were performed to determine the optimum spacing ratio value between piles moreover the effects of some parameters such as pile surface and pile embedment ratio were examined even though this is encouraging there are also other parameters i e the relative density of sand soil pile shape in cross section and loading type affecting that value therefore it would be very useful to evaluate those parameters in future studies 5 summary and conclusion this paper presents experimental and numerical results of a single pile and a pile group embedded in dense sand soil with a relative density of 80 subjected to uplift loading the variables investigated in the study include the pile surface pile embedment ratio and the spacing ratio between piles a series of laboratory tests were conducted to study foregoing parameters with the test box and then three dimensional analyses were performed by employing the finite element method the numerical results indicated good agreement with the test results throughout the study the following remarks may be cited as findings 1 to register much data and to obtain a more understandable load displacement curve the loading velocity should be selected as slowly as possible even the loading velocity does not change the maximum uplift load 2 the mesh density analyses are required because the finite element size significantly affects the numerical results 3 the uplift capacity of the rough pile is greater than that of the smooth pile for the same pile embedment ratio 4 when the rough pile is employed the affected area is more extensive than the affected area when the smooth pile is used 5 the total uplift capacity of the pile groups increases with the increase of the spacing ratio between piles since the pile pile interaction decreases and the group efficiency increases that interaction between piles is disappeared when the spacing ratio is equal to 8 and 10 for the smooth and rough pile groups respectively provided that the pile embedment ratio is equal to 8 6 for the same spacing ratios the group efficiency in the rough pile group is obtained lesser than that in the smooth pile group because the rough piles need more distance between them compared to the smooth piles to be able to eliminate the interaction between piles 7 when the pile embedment ratio increases the spacing ratio between piles should be over again determined because the pile pile interaction occurs credit authorship contribution statement buse emirler conceptualization methodology software

21292,foundations of some structures such as transmission towers mooring systems for ocean surface or submerged platforms tall chimneys jetty structures are subjected to uplift loading in such cases to increase the uplift resistance of piles pile foundations like anchored piles batter piles and micro piles are extensively employed depending on in situ conditions this paper deals with the contribution of pile surface to the uplift capacity and the failure mechanism obtained for the pile groups in sand and the main goal of the study is to investigate the effect of the pile surface roughness on the uplift capacity for different spacing ratios between piles therefore the paper presents some findings of a single pile and pile groups embedded in sand under uplift loading the variables investigated include the pile surface pile embedment ratio and the spacing ratio between piles experiments were conducted to study foregoing parameters and three dimensional analyses were performed using the finite element method to illustrate the failure mechanism of pile groups and the interaction between piles for different spacing ratios between piles the results show that the finite element simulation results indicate good agreement with the experiment results and all variables significantly affect the uplift capacity of piles keywords failure mechanism finite element method laboratory test pile group uplift loading 1 introduction pile foundation is a preferred type of deep foundation in a situation where current ground conditions do not allow the formation of a safe and economical shallow foundation since developed technological opportunities positively affect to the production conditions of pile foundations these kinds of foundations have become widely used in practice and scientific studies by some civil engineers vesić 1969 meyerhof 1976 poulos and davis 1980 prakash and sharma 1990 tomlinson 1994 ismael 2001 salgado 2008 das 2016 tehrani et al 2017 al khazaali and vanapalli 2019 deb and pal 2020 jeong et al 2020 the piles called as the uplift or pullout piles are used in order to increase the stability of structures such as transmission towers mooring systems for ocean surface or submerged platforms tall chimneys jetty structures subject to advanced or excess hydrostatic pressure and torsional moment and to prevent the structure damages stemming from the foregoing reasons i e hydrostatic pressure and torsional moment in addition to this the uplift piles are generally used for decreasing the effect some forces which are presented herein the wind and earthquake forces affecting high rise structures the wave and ship forces affecting docks and coastal structures the lifting force of water affecting offshore drilling platforms and large area structures under the groundwater level le tirant 1992 the pile foundations under the effect of these sorts of forces can be designed different types and dimensions and also designed both as a single pile and a pile group the uplift capacity of a single pile generally consists of pile s own weight friction resistance which occurs along the pile and soil weight which remains in the failure mechanism however pile groups show more different behaviour than that of the single pile since the area affected by the piles in the pile groups has an important role in the pile behaviour when the spacing ratio between piles in the pile group is too small i e the group configuration of the piles in closely spaced it can cause that the uplift capacity of each pile in the pile group may not equal to the uplift capacity of a single pile in this sort of situation pile pile interaction occurs and the situation can be explained with that all piles in the group and the soil surrounding the piles behave like a block i e far from the singularity tomlinson 1994 the failure mechanism of a pile group is affected by some parameters or variables such as soil type and density the length and surface of the pile the spacing ratio between piles and pile configuration layout understanding the pile behaviour and predicting the capacity of piles under uplift loading are important topics in foundation design most of the current design methods used for the pile groups under the uplift forces are based on the experimental knowledge which is obtained from the laboratory model test das et al 1976 o neill et al 1982 das 1983 subba rao and venkatesh 1985 das 1986 levacher and sieffert 1984 chattopadhyay and pise 1986 madhav 1987 das and shin 1992 chattopadhyay 1994 patra and pise 2003 shanker et al 2006 shelke and patra 2008 shanker et al 2009 nasr 2013 gaaver 2013 faizi et al 2015 and galvis castro et al 2019 performed both theoretical and experimental studies on a single pile and pile group embedded in sand so as to investigate the effect of some parameters such as pile surface pile diameter relative density of sand pile embedment ratio and the spacing ratio between piles on the uplift capacity in these studies it was founded that the uplift capacity generally increased linearly with the increase of spacing ratio between piles this conclusion is quite true but not economical for foundation design therefore it is required to be presented an optimum spacing ratio between piles under the effect of different variables the experimental study conducted by emirler et al 2019 indicated that there was not a certain optimum spacing ratio between piles and when any parameters such as the relative density of sand and the pile embedment ratio were changed the spacing ratio had to be determined over again because of the boundary conditions soil pile interaction and pile pile interaction the foregoing literature reviews show that there is still a major lack of comprehensive study i e experimental and particularly numerical on the behaviour of the pile groups embedded in the sand soil in order to determine the optimum spacing ratio between piles for different pile surface in this study therefore the uplift behaviour of smooth and rough single piles and pile groups embedded in dense sand with a relative density of 80 was investigated experimentally and numerically in the experiments and analyses performed for this purpose smooth and rough steel piles with circular geometry were employed the uplift capacity of a single pile and pile group configuration of 2 2 under the effect of various parameters which will be explained in the following sections was studied in detail in the study the effect of the pile surface i e smooth and rough on the spacing ratio between piles was observed by both methods mentioned above afterwards the effect of the pile embedment ratio on the uplift capacity of the pile group by using the optimum spacing ratio value for both pile surfaces was investigated as experimentally and numerically moreover for the different spacing ratios between piles the failure mechanism of group piles and the interaction between piles were illustrated with the help of the numerical part of the study modelling of this kind of a problem in a computer environment is quite difficult owing to the nonlinear soil behaviour and the interaction between soil and pile it is thought therefore the validated numerical part with the experiments gives a unique or novel identity to the study 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental investigation experiments were performed in the steel frame system which was situated in the laboratory of civil engineering department of cukurova university loading device used in the experiments was specially manufactured and then mounted on the steel frame system the loading device is speed controlled and the loading arm can be moved up and down directions according to the previous studies in which the behaviour of piles subjected to uplift load was investigated both field and laboratory loading experiments were carried out by applying uplift load at a constant velocity the effect of loading velocity on the shear strength was generally investigated with the direct shear tests by selecting different shear velocities the results obtained from the direct shear tests in the literature indicated that the shear strength of sand soil was not significantly affected by different shear velocities in drained conditions and it was also stated that the changes in the shear strength of sand soil were too small to be considered al mhaidib 2006 however the effects of uplift loading velocity on the behaviour of piles embedded in sand soil were studied with the model tests where it was used two different uplift loading velocity i e 1 882 mm min and 9 410 mm min therewithal those velocity values refer to the minimum and maximum values to be able to apply by the test system it has been understood from the test results that the loading velocity does not significantly affect the maximum uplift capacity of piles embedded in the sand and the obtained maximum uplift capacity values for two different velocities are nearly equal nevertheless in order to both save much data and to obtain a more understandable curve the loading velocity was chosen as the value of 1 882 mm min and the experiments were continued up to the displacement value of 5 mm fig 1 a square steel framework test box with inside dimensions of 700 mm length 700 mm width 500 mm depth was employed and the experiments were conducted after the test box was placed to the loading frame system fixed to the laboratory ground or floor the model steel piles in the length of 400 mm and diameter of 25 mm which have two different surfaces i e smooth and rough were used in the experiments fig 2 when the previous studies were investigated various methods such as sandpapering glueing of the sand grains over the pile surface for roughening up the pile surface were encountered it was stated that the ultimate value of the shaft friction was controlled by the behaviour of a thin zone close to the pile surface and its thickness depended on the pile surface roughness and varied between 2 5 d50 for a smooth pile and 10 15 d50 for a rough pile wernick 1978 yoshimi and kishida 1981 boulon 1988 hoteit 1990 d50 refers the mean particle size of the sand fioravante 2002 reported that the roughness should be evaluated with the normalised roughness defined as rn rt d50 where rt is equal to the maximum vertical distance between a peak and a trough over the surface for rn 0 02 the interface is smooth and no dilatancy occurs whereas for rn 0 1 the interface is totally rough and dilatancy occurs in this study the roughness was provided by grooving on the pile surface and the normalised roughness value is greater than 0 1 which shows rough pile surface also in this way the degree of roughness does not change from test to test and the results of the experiments are not affected in other words it is maintained the experiments continuity during the experimental studies electronic load cells were used to read the load values applied to model piles in tests it was aimed that the effect of the pile configuration layout on the uplift capacity was determined by adding the load cells having the capacity of 0 5 kn on each model pile in addition to this an electronic load cell having the capacity of 20 kn was used to determine and validate the uplift load affecting the whole system the displacements occurred as the result of uplifting the model piles were determined by using two displacement transducers lvdts contacting with the plate to which the piles were attached these displacement transducers can measure in the range of 0 50 mm by calculating the average of displacements measured at two different points of equal distance to the centre of the system the displacement occurring in the piled system was obtained for each load stage the load and displacement values obtained by the data logger during the tests were transferred to a computer programme and they were transformed into the numerical values moreover the test apparatus and all relevant attachments are presented in figs 3 and 4 in order to clarify the test setup which consists of the loading system test box model piles load cells displacement transducers and sand soil several methods exist for preparing a sand bed in the laboratory including impact vibration and the raining technique in tests it is important to have a uniform deposit to ensure the repeatability of tests among the mentioned methods the vibration method for the dense sand conditions was chosen to reach a desired relative density of sand so as to achieve desired density the inner surfaces of the test box were marked at 5 cm intervals to make easy the preparation of the sand in layers for dense conditions the amount of sand for each layer was compacted by a hand held vibratory compactor until achieving the required layer height in order to maintain the consistency of in place a relative density of 80 γdry 17 0 kn m3 throughout the test box the same compaction effort was applied on each layer of sand delrin material was also used under the vibratory compactor to ensure uniform compaction and prevent breakage of sand grains finally the model piles were installed before the sand samples with a desired relative density were placed in the test box therefore it was not provided with any improvement around the piles due to compression unlike the method where the piles were driven into the soil and consequently it was obtained a pure uplift capacity sand samples brought from the seyhan riverbed in cukurova region were used they were sieved by washing from sieves number 18 1 mm diameter and 200 0 074 mm diameter according to astm d2487 11 american society for testing and materials and at the end of the sieving process they were dried in an oven sand samples were sieved from a predetermined batch of sieves considering the foregoing standard and grain size distribution was obtained see fig 5 from the grain size distribution curve soil class was identified as poorly graded fine and clean sand sp according to the unified soil classification system uscs test results of sieve analysis were presented in table 1 to determine the angle of internal friction of dense sand used in this study a series of direct shear tests were carried out under the different compressive loads and the angle of internal friction of dense sand with a relative density of 80 was calculated to be 41 5⁰ emirler 2019 lastly in this section it was mentioned the parameters investigated in the experiments for both single pile and group piles while the variables for the single pile was pile surfaces smooth and rough and pile embedment ratios l d 8 12 16 the parameters for the group piles were pile surfaces smooth and rough pile embedment ratios l d 8 12 16 and spacing ratios between piles s d 2 4 6 8 10 the effects of these parameters on the uplift capacity for both single pile and group piles were presented in detail thereafter table 2 2 2 numerical investigation performing an experiment in the laboratory environment in foundation engineering has not only difficult but also a time consuming procedure in addition the operation is quite expensive however the results obtained from this sort of test are the closest to the results acquired from the large scale or field tests therefore to develop a numerical model which is less expensive not time consuming and at the same time in a good agreement with the experimental results can provide a very significant benefit for the geotechnical designers for this purpose a series of three dimensional numerical analyses were performed in order to investigate the uplift load capacity displacement behaviour of piles and to illustrate the failure mechanism of them which consists of the most important part of the study plaxis 3d computer software based on the finite element method was selected because of some advantages of it for the numerical analyses the most important advantages of the program are that it contains different complex material models for modelling soils as well as it contains some special structural elements for piles foundations retaining walls etc when previous numerical studies on this subject were examined the soils were modelled as either linear elastic or nonlinear elastic but the soils generally behave plastically under high loading conditions brown and shie 1990 trochanis et al 1991 wakai et al 1999 chae et al 2004 johnson et al 2006 since using accurate soil model is essential for prediction of soil responses the numerical analyses were carried out employing the mohr coulomb elastoplastic soil constitutive model to reflect the behaviour of sand more realistically moayedi and mosallanezhad 2017 dong et al 2018 li et al 2018 yang et al 2018 ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2019 chen et al 2020 jebur et al 2020 jeong et al 2020 pandey and chauhan 2020 deb and pal 2020 soil behaviour in the analysis of foundation engineering problems can be frequently investigated with the mc model for some reasons to be needed a small number of model parameters the possibility of defining the failure criteria by using simple physical properties like cohesion and internal friction angle and to be obtained easily those parameters with the fundamental soil mechanics laboratory tests for the pile element the software offers a special option called an embedded pile therefore this special option was used while defining the piles in the analyses the embedded pile has been developed to describe the interaction of a pile with its surrounding soil the interaction at the pile skin and at the pile foot is described by means of embedded interface elements the pile is considered as a beam which can cross a 10 node tetrahedral element at any place with any arbitrary orientation in such problems with soil pile interaction the interaction between pile and soil is provided with the interface element however it is not needed any extra effort with the help of the embedded pile option since the option already contains within itself the interaction via some formulations brinkgreve et al 2015 the sand soil parameters with the relative density of 80 for the mohr coulomb elastoplastic soil constitutive model are presented in detail in table 3 moreover the model pile properties supported by previous studies such as laman 1995 karahan 2007 are given in table 4 in the finite element method mesh density is a critical issue which closely relates to the accuracy of the finite element models while it directly determines their complexity level due to its importance in generating finite element models the foremost problem is to choose appropriate elements size so that the created models yield accurate finite element analysis results while saving as much computing time as possible liu and glass 2013 because of those reasons a series of numerical analyses where different mesh densities were considered were performed in order to determine optimum mesh density and afterwards the effect of mesh density on the uplift capacity of the pile was investigated in these analyses while the soil zones were created by using the 10 node tetrahedral elements in the 3d mesh procedure five different mesh densities which were presented by the software from very coarse to very fine sizes were tested when the pile embedment ratio was equal to 8 and the pile was under the effect of the uplift load of 200 n mesh density analyses were performed with the model pile which had steel material properties this applied load value was selected greater than that of the biggest uplift load observed in the experiments furthermore the uplift load value corresponding to the same displacement value was taken into account for all mesh densities since the soil in the analysis performed in very fine mesh density collapsed when the displacement value was equal to 0 40 mm the effect of the number of finite elements the number of nodes and the element size on the uplift capacity of the pile were presented with the numeric values in table 5 according to the results in the table it was understood that the uplift load in a very coarse mesh density was calculated approximately 50 greater than the uplift load in a very fine mesh density for the same displacement value it was observed that there was a significant change in the uplift capacity values of the pile depending on the increase or decrease in the number of element and mesh density was determined to be an effective parameter on the analysis results the closest result to the uplift load value obtained from the test was obtained from the analyses performed with fine and very fine mesh densities since there was no significant difference in the results obtained from fine and very fine mesh densities fine mesh density was chosen to save computer effort and time an example of a three dimensional finite element model established by using a fine mesh density is illustrated in fig 6 as seen in the figure for comparison with the experimental findings similar to the conditions of the tests performed the numerical model was established in three dimensions of 700 mm length 700 mm width 500 mm depth numerical analyses were performed for both single pile and pile group configuration of 2 2 embedded in dense sand with a relative density of 80 in the analyses conducted for the single pile the effect of two parameters i e pile surface and pile embedment ratio on the uplift capacity of the pile was studied on the other hand in the analyses carried out for pile group it was aimed at first to determine optimum spacing ratio value between piles afterwards the effects of both pile surface and pile embedment ratio on the total uplift capacity were investigated at that optimum value and lastly it was illustrated the failure mechanisms of smooth and rough piles for different pile embedment ratios and spacing ratios between piles 3 results and discussion 3 1 findings for single pile experimental and numerical results for the single pile are given in fig 7 in which the influences of pile surface and pile embedment ratio on the uplift capacity of the pile were presented in detail when the foregoing figure was examined firstly it can be observed that the numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental results secondly and more importantly the uplift capacity of the rough pile is greater than that of the smooth pile for the same pile embedment ratios this situation can be explained with the increase of surface resistance which consists of due to the interlocking between pile and sand soil sadrekarimi et al 2009 the uplift capacity difference between rough and smooth piles at l d 8 was nearly 40 while this difference was respectively approximately 50 and 70 at l d 12 and l d 16 therefore the results showed that the pile surface was an important parameter for the uplift capacity finally it was observed from the figure that the pile embedment ratio significantly affected the uplift capacity of piles in other words the uplift capacity increased with the increase in the pile embedment ratio for both pile surfaces the reason for that result can be explained with the increased embedment length of the pile the soil surrounding the pile along the pile length exhibits a more rigid behaviour and indicates greater resistance to the movement of the pile in the uplift direction el sawwaf and nazir 2006 with the increase of the pile embedment ratio the uplift capacity increases approximately 5 5 times in the rough pile whereas that value increases approximately 4 4 times in the smooth pile see fig 8 obtaining of the failure mechanism with an experiment is a quite difficult procedure however obtaining the failure mechanism with the help of validated numerical model as in this study is a much easier method therefore the failure mechanism of a single pile under the effect of two parameters i e pile surface and pile embedment ratio was investigated by the numerical analyses the failure mechanisms obtained from the analyses reflected a good example of the failure mechanisms presented in the previous works such as chattopadhyay and pise 1986 shelke and patra 2008 according to the numerical results when the rough pile was employed the affected area was more extensive than the affected area when the smooth pile was used the reason for the case can be explained with the increase in the surface resistance between the rough pile and sand soil because of more friction compared to the smooth pile in addition to this it was also observed that the affected area also depends on the pile length and the increase in the embedment length of the pile naturally brings about an increase in the affected area since the interaction length between pile and sand soil extends as seen in fig 9 3 2 findings for pile group a pile group generally shows more different behaviour than a single pile because of the effect of the pile influence area on the pile behaviour and that is called group effect the group effect is about pile pile interaction and it is required to determine the minimum i e optimum distance between piles in the pile group in order to perish that interaction when the interaction is eliminated each pile in a group behaves like a single pile which means the group efficiency is equal to 100 for this purpose the effect of the spacing ratio between piles on the total uplift capacity was investigated in the tests for both smooth and rough pile group of 2 2 when the pile embedment ratio is equal to 8 afterwards some numerical analyses at the same conditions with the test were performed to compare the results moreover to determine the uplift capacity of each pile a load cell was connected to each pile in the group thus it was aimed to observe the difference in the uplift load value of each pile because the pile group had a square layout 2 2 the uplift loads each pile in the group had to be almost equal the uplift load displacement behaviours of smooth pile group obtained from the experiments were presented in fig 10 the experiments were conducted in the pile embedment ratio of 8 and for the different spacing ratios between piles changing from 2 to 10 the results indicated that each pile in the group has almost the same curve and therefore it was understood that the experiments were conducted correctly and the sand soil was brought to the desired density homogeneously besides a generally accepted load displacement behaviour for dense sands i e the curve does a peak in the failure point and then it decreases was obtained the same procedure as for smooth piles was applied to the rough piles l d 8 and s d 2 to 10 to determine the optimum spacing ratio between piles the total uplift load values obtained from experiments and analyses for smooth and rough pile groups corresponding to each selected spacing ratio between piles s d 2 4 6 8 10 were presented in fig 11 as shown in the figure both methods offered very consistent results with each other moreover the total uplift capacity of the pile group increased with the increase of the spacing ratio between piles since the pile pile interaction decreased and the group efficiency increased that interaction between piles was disappeared when the spacing ratio was equal to 8 and 10 for the smooth and rough pile groups respectively in other words the pile groups worked with 100 efficiency in these spacing ratios between piles and each pile in the pile groups behaved like a single pile that means each pile has an uplift capacity of a single pile see fig 12 for instance the uplift capacity of a smooth single pile was equal to approximately 0 084 kn whereas that value was equal to 0 045 kn for each pile in the smooth pile group at s d 2 and therefore the group efficiency was estimated to be 60 on the other hand the group efficiency at s d 2 was determined to be 40 for the rough pile group consequently for the same spacing ratios the group efficiency in the rough pile group was obtained lesser than that in the smooth pile group because the rough piles need more distance between them compared to the smooth piles to be able to eliminate the interaction between piles to illustrate the interaction between piles and the effect of spacing ratio on the failure mechanisms of both smooth and rough pile groups some numerical results were presented in the study see figs 13 and 14 thus the pile pile interaction that causes a decrease in the uplift capacity of the piles was clearly observed according to the figures the interaction between piles decreased with the increase of spacing ratios and no interaction observed when the optimum spacing ratio values was reached that means the piles behaved like a single pile at those ratios the optimum spacing ratios between piles can be determined as 8 and 10 for the smooth and rough pile groups respectively provided that the pile embedment ratio is equal to 8 after the optimum spacing ratios for both smooth s d 8 and rough s d 10 pile groups were determined in order to show that suggested optimum spacing ratios were valid for only the pile embedment ratio of 8 a series numerical analyses were performed and then the results were compared with those obtained from experiments see fig 15 the results showed that the total uplift load increased with the increase of the pile embedment ratio for both pile surfaces and the total uplift capacity of rough pile group at l d 8 was nearly 1 3 times greater than that of smooth pile group however the same parameter for the rough pile group compared to the smooth pile group was approximately 1 5 and 1 7 times greater at l d 12 and 16 respectively in addition to this the agreement observed at l d 8 between experiment and finite element method diminished with the increase the pile embedment ratio since the interaction between piles occurred over again in the pile embedment ratios of 12 and 16 to better understand the resulting interaction the pile pile interaction therefore at l d 12 and 16 was clearly illustrated in fig 16 and the failure mechanism obtained is similar to proposed by tomlinson 1994 consequently that result indicated that the optimum spacing ratio should be determined over again to be able to work at 100 efficiency of group piles when any parameters that affect the uplift capacity of pile group finally it is also indicated that the pile surface and pile embedment ratio are highly important variables to provide a greater uplift capacity in the pile groups see fig 17 4 limitations a comprehensive study of a single pile and pile group subjected to uplift loading is presented herein for this purpose both experimental and numerical investigations were performed to determine the optimum spacing ratio value between piles moreover the effects of some parameters such as pile surface and pile embedment ratio were examined even though this is encouraging there are also other parameters i e the relative density of sand soil pile shape in cross section and loading type affecting that value therefore it would be very useful to evaluate those parameters in future studies 5 summary and conclusion this paper presents experimental and numerical results of a single pile and a pile group embedded in dense sand soil with a relative density of 80 subjected to uplift loading the variables investigated in the study include the pile surface pile embedment ratio and the spacing ratio between piles a series of laboratory tests were conducted to study foregoing parameters with the test box and then three dimensional analyses were performed by employing the finite element method the numerical results indicated good agreement with the test results throughout the study the following remarks may be cited as findings 1 to register much data and to obtain a more understandable load displacement curve the loading velocity should be selected as slowly as possible even the loading velocity does not change the maximum uplift load 2 the mesh density analyses are required because the finite element size significantly affects the numerical results 3 the uplift capacity of the rough pile is greater than that of the smooth pile for the same pile embedment ratio 4 when the rough pile is employed the affected area is more extensive than the affected area when the smooth pile is used 5 the total uplift capacity of the pile groups increases with the increase of the spacing ratio between piles since the pile pile interaction decreases and the group efficiency increases that interaction between piles is disappeared when the spacing ratio is equal to 8 and 10 for the smooth and rough pile groups respectively provided that the pile embedment ratio is equal to 8 6 for the same spacing ratios the group efficiency in the rough pile group is obtained lesser than that in the smooth pile group because the rough piles need more distance between them compared to the smooth piles to be able to eliminate the interaction between piles 7 when the pile embedment ratio increases the spacing ratio between piles should be over again determined because the pile pile interaction occurs credit authorship contribution statement buse emirler conceptualization methodology software

21293,the present study describes a numerical investigation on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the impinging and overtopping by solitary waves on an emerged impermeable trapezoidal seawall on a sloping beach a flow solver of navier stokes equations is employed with the constrained interpolation profile method and a volume of fluid type method to capture the strong nonlinear free surface three typical solitary waves are simulated to validate the capability of the numerical model a favorable agreement between experimental and numerical results reveals that this model can reproduce the nonlinear hydrodynamic features of solitary wave impinging and overtopping involving vortex breaking and impacting furthermore parametric studies are conducted by numerical modeling to examine the effects of wave parameters including water level and wave nonlinearity and leeward slope ratio of the seawall on hydrodynamic stability including sliding and overturning stability and erosion potential vorticity and pressure fields are exhibited to show the dynamic properties of flow separation air entrainment and breaking it is found that the wave parameters and leeward slope ration influence the hydrodynamic stability of the seawall and erosion of the leeward slope in a different way keywords olitary wave emerged structure overtopping stability overturning sliding erosion navier stokes ns equations 1 introduction coastal structures such as emerged composite breakwaters vertical or sloping sea walls are widely built in the nearshore regions to reflect or dissipate wave energy and assure the safety of the coastal zone as waves propagate shoreward they undergo changes in height and velocity caused by the structures and travel with the potential to cause damages to coastal structures or loss of life wave structure interaction becomes a classical issue in coastal engineering but the existing works on this topic have focused on periodic waves and studies on tsunamis storms and extreme waves interaction with coastal structures are limited tsunamis are long waves that are usually generated by seismic events thus it is difficult to furnish a general modeling method solitary waves are likely the largest steadily propagating wave in constant water depth and they have similar hydrodynamic characteristics to tsunami storm and hurricane surge synolakis 2006 therefore the solitary wave is employed as a reference to study hydrodynamic properties of these extreme waves from the view of numerical and experimental models many aspects of the hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves have been well researched the attention has been put on solitary wave run up on a uniform slope lin et al 1999 hsiao et al 2008 transmission and hydrodynamic properties of waves over an abrupt topography liu and cheng 2001 vortex generation evolution and shedding around a submerged obstacle or a bottom cavity chang et al 2001 2012 the kinematics of the solitary wave through porous breakwater or vegetated sloping beach tang et al 2013 wu et al 2014 and the interaction of a solitary wave with an array of surface piercing vertical cylinders zhao et al 2007 nevertheless there are many beachfront houses infrastructures or seawalls built on the slope near the shoreline which will undergo large impinging force and overtopping damage when a storm surge tsunami or extreme wave happens yet only a few studies have focused on the solitary wave impinging and overtopping on this type of structures xiao and huang 2008 used a vof based rans numerical model to evaluate the wave forces and overturning moment of a solitary wave on an idealized house on a slope yet they did not compare their numerical results with the corresponding experimental data hsiao and lin 2010 conducted an experiment to study impingement and overtopping of solitary waves on a seawall upon a sloping beach they also employed a cobras model to simulate the process of the experiment gsell et al 2016 used a coupled vof and ib method to simulate the run up of a breaking solitary wave on a natural beach in which streamlines and bottom stress are analyzed chella et al 2017 utilized a three dimensional cfd model reef3d to simulate the solitary waves breaking over a slope and the associated breaking wave forces on a cylinder they discussed the effect of the relative distance between the cylinder and the breaking point and wave height on the breaking wave forces but did not account the dynamic wave pressure one purpose of this study is to perform a numerical investigation to the solitary wave interactions with a composite structure considering the solitary wave impinging and overtopping with the verification of corresponding experimental studies by hsiao and lin 2010 physical experiments as a traditional approach with appropriate measurement facilities can reveal the real flow property in a certain circumstance yet such approache is costly time consuming and incomprehensive with the development of the computer performance computational fluid dynamics cfd solvers are becoming a promising alternative method to simulate the nonlinear wave structure interactions with the advantage of displaying the details of the flow fields models based on water depth integrated equations such as the laplace equations shallow water equations swe and boussinesq equations have been widely used to study solitary wave propagation the laplace equations are based on potential theory under the assumption of irrotational and inviscid flow and the boundary element methods are the popular numerical technique studies have been done to take account into the vortex shedding and energy dissipation with the combination of a navier stokes solver pringle et al 2016 or vortex methods lin and huang 2010 the shallow water equations and boussinesq equations are based long wave theory by applying shock capturing schemes the shallow water equations give a good description of wave run up and breaking waves li and raichlen 2002 yet the wave profile in the shoaling zone is not predicted precisely the boussinesq equations can describe the wave shoaling before breaking with better dispersive properties madsen et al 2006 however the boussinesq equations become invalid in the surf zone because they do not include the dissipation induced by wave breaking to extend the validity of these equations researchers have developed wave breaking closure strategies by adding additional terms or using hybrid methods filippini et al 2016 in which some parameters need to be calibrated another problem of the boussinesq equations is that the pressure was assumed to be hydrostatic which means that there was no dispersive effect and that the model was restricted to turbulent bores mahdavi and talebbeydokhti 2011 by augmenting dissipation in these models roll waves and classical hydraulic jumps could be correctly described richard and gavrilyuk 2013 depth integrated models are approximate equations of wave motion and contain theoretically a truncation error of some order wei et al 1995 when a wave overturning exists or the fluid is violent with rapid acceleration they may result in inaccuracy simulation or calculation breakdown besides the configurations of coastal structures are depth dependent in most scenarios these models fail to predict the complex wave structure interaction with a bottom of arbitrary shape moreover they lose the ability to model the flow description in vertical which plays an important part in understanding the dynamic interaction between the induced flow and the structure to simulate the interaction with irregularly shaped structures and provide detailed information of the flow characteristics navier stokes ns based solvers are required to solve the navier stokes equations one of the most prominent computational issues is to numerically capture or reconstruct the moving free surface many methods have been successfully used to study the solitary wave interaction with coastal structures such as volume of fluid vof method xiao and huang 2008 hsiao and lin 2010 level set method xie and tao 2000 and the meshless particle methods ketabdari 2015 luo et al 2019 he et al 2020 vof method is usually adopted to treat the wave breaking process and vortex evolutionary behavior on a slope xiao and huang 2008 hsiao and lin 2010 many efforts have been made to improve the accuracy and stability of vof typed method including tangent of hyperbolic interface capturing thinc method xiao et al 2005 weighed line interface calculation wlic yokoi 2007 and thinc sw scheme xiao et al 2011 some of them have been applied in the wave structure interaction problems hu and kashiwagi 2009 developed a flower solver combining a thinc method and cartesian grid based flow solver using a constrained interpolation profile cip method hu and kashiwagi 2009 to predict strongly nonlinear wave structure interactions which can deal with the complicated free surface geometry and wave breaking process zhao and hu 2012 and zhao et al 2014 then developed and applied it to study the extreme wave and freak wave interaction with floating body these studies have demonstrated the performance of the cip based solver in simulating the flow field on a fixed rectangular grid however most studies focus on the ocean engineering problems only a few studies have used this solver to study wave structure interactions in coastal engineering especially between the solitary wave and coastal structure zhao et al 2016 2019 ji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and you et al 2019 applied this numerical model to study solitary waves interaction with a submerged shelf rectangular and trapezoidal breakwater and flat plate and wang et al 2018 applied this numerical model to study solitary waves interaction with a submerged shelf rectangular and trapezoidal breakwater zhao et al 2017 also numerically studied the effects of several factors on tsunami wave impact and run up in the presence of gentle submarine slopes and coastal cliffs these studies focus on the flow characteristics of solitary wave passing over submerged structures or run up on coastal cliffs but they do not include the impinging and overtopping process of solitary waves interacting with an emerged structure on a slope therefore another purpose of this study is to validate the applicability of this flow solver proposed by hu and kashiwagi 2009 to solitary waves interacting with this kind of coastal structure the present study investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves interacting with an emerged structure on a slope with a numerical flow solver proposed by hu and kashiwagi 2009 the numerical results are validated with the experimental data in hsiao and lin 2010 and compared with their numerical results by the cobras model and results of luo et al 2019 with a consistent particle method the effects of breaking characteristics of solitary wave types the relative freeboard and water depth are examined in the view of the flow field the free surface the dynamic pressure and wave force furthermore the influence of wave parameters and seawall sections on the hydraulic stability of the seawall and the erosional potential of the leeward slope of the seawall are evaluated and analyzed additionally vorticity and pressure evolutionary behavior behind the seawall are depicted to address the flow features including vortex breaking and air entrainment the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the numerical model is briefly presented in section 3 the calculation conditions about the solitary wave overtopping on a trapezoidal seawall on a slope are described and grid refinement test is carried out for the numerical wave tank results and comparisons with hsiao and lin s 2010 experimental and numerical results are shown in section 4 further discussion for flow features hydraulic stability and erosional potential are done in section 5 conclusions are given in section 6 2 methods and model 2 1 mathematical equation considering the flow as 2d incompressible viscous fluid in a cartesian grid system it is governed by the continuity and n s equations as the following 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i here the cartesian tensor notation i 1 2 is used x i and u i are the spatial coordinates and velocity of each coordinate in a cartesian grid system ρ is the density p is the global pressure involving hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure μis the viscosity the strain rate tensor s ij is given by s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the last term f i stands for the external body pressure such as gravity etc for complex water air structure interaction problems the model treats it as a multiphase flow problem including water air and solid structure the cartesian grid is fixed and covers the whole computational domain a volume fraction or density function ϕ m m 1 2 and 3 represent water air and solid respectively is introduced to identify different phases and thus define and track the interface these functions are governed by the following advection function 3 ϕ m t u i ϕ m x 0 with ϕ m x y t 1 0 x y ω m e l s e whereω m is the domain occupied by different phases the fluid structure interaction is dealt with one kind of immersed boundary method where the mass density of the structure is set as the same as that of the background fluid the solid structure boundary condition is applied by a force to the momentum equation of the fluid in the original immersed boundary method herein we apply a velocity to a cell containing the solid phase as 4 u u b φ 3 u 1 φ 3 where u b is the local velocity of the body and u is the velocity obtained by eq 2 in the numerical procedure imposing the velocity distribution inside and on the solid boundary is equivalent to applying a forcing term f bi to the momentum equation eq 2 as follows 5a u i n 1 u i n δ t r h s i f b i 5b f b i r h s i u i n 1 u i n δ t where u i n 1 u i n 1 at the fluid structure boundary this method is proposed by hu and kashiwagi 2004 since the seawall structure in our study is fixed and does not move with the fluid ϕ 3 is a set of constants defined at initial and u b 0 this treatment can ensure the computation stability and save the computation time in the model the total volume fraction for water and solid ϕ 13 or air and solid ϕ 23 is solved by eq 3 where ϕ m ϕ 13 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 or ϕ m ϕ 23 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 the volume fraction of water is then calculated by ϕ 1 ϕ 13 ϕ 3 and that of air is calculated by ϕ 2 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 after all volume fractions for different phases have been calculated the physical property λ i e density viscosity etc can be determined by the following equation 6 λ m 1 3 λ m ϕ m 2 2 numerical algorithm the constrained interpolation profile cip method is used to solve the advection term in the n s equations this method was first put forward as a semi lagrangian scheme by takewaki et al 1985 and was then further developed using an eulerian approach to treat multiphase flow with large density ratio by yabe et al 2001 to apply a cip scheme the information of spatial derivatives of x i are required therefore by differentiating eq 2 with respect to x i we obtain eq 7 7 t u j x j u i x i 0 u j x i u i x i x i 1 ρ p x j x i 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i a fractional step method is utilized to solve the governing equations of eqs 2 and 7 which are divided into the following three steps 1 advection step 8a u i t u j u i x j 0 8b t u j x j u i x i 0 applying a cip scheme to these two equations we obtain the solutions of u i and u i x i at the intermediate time 2 non advection step i 9a u i t 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i 9b t u i x i x i 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i a central difference scheme is used for the spatial derivatives and an explicit scheme for the time marching u i and u i x i are updated at the second intermediate time level based on the advection solutions of u i and u i x i 3 non advection step ii 10a u i t 1 ρ p x i 10b t u i x i x i 1 ρ p x j substituting u i n 1 x i 0 of eq 1 we obtain the following poisson type equation for pressure 11 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u i x i we obtain the pressure p at time n 1 by a successive over relaxation sor method which is the most time consuming process then an implicit scheme is used for the time marching of eqs 10a and 10b and the velocity u i and u i x i at time n 1 are solved 2 3 determination of boundaries 2 3 1 free surface capturing the free surface is determined by solving the volume fraction eq 3 with the thinc scheme for a real problem the free surface has no thickness yet during the computation the interface may become defined with finite thickness due to numerical diffusion fortunately owing to the sub cell resolution feature of the thinc scheme the interface gets smeared slowly as the computation proceeds this degree of interface diffusion is considered acceptable for most cases the thinc scheme is also a vof type method with the feature of mass conservation its 1 d equation of volume fraction is rewritten in a conservation form as the following 12 ϕ t u ϕ x ϕ u x by using the finite volume method in eq 12 we obtain the volume fraction ϕ i n 1 based on the information of velocity field u n and volume fraction field ϕ n at time moment n 13 ϕ i n 1 ϕ i n 1 δ x i g i 1 2 g i 1 2 δ t δ x i ϕ i n u i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n where ϕ i n 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 ϕ i x d x is the averaged volume fraction at the cell center x x i and g i 1 2 t n t n 1 u ϕ i 1 2 d t is the volume flux through the cell boundary x x i 1 2 a semi lagrangian procedure is adopted to calculate the flux like the other reconstruction schemes the thinc scheme uses a piecewise hyperbolic tangent function as an interpolation function to reconstruct the profile of ϕ inside a computation cell as the following 14 ϕ i x α 2 1 γ tanh β x x i 1 2 δ x i x i where α β γ are parameters determining the quality of the interface solution α and γ are used to eliminate numerical diffusion which are defined as 15 α ϕ i 1 if ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 otherwise γ 1 if ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 1 o t h e r w i s e β is used to determine the sharpness of the jump of the interpolation function ranging from 0 to 1 a constant β 3 5 is usually used as a result of many computation tests that have been performed more details can be found in xiao et al 2005 2 4 wave generation since solitary waves are associated to quasi vertically uniform horizontal velocity a piston type wave maker seems a suitable generation device the key is that the largest solitary wave outruns the dispersive disturbance and the lower solitary wave far enough considering the fix grid we utilized in the model we use a velocity boundary to represent the moving paddle in our numerical wave tank there are different generation laws of motion for paddle derived from different solitary wave solutions such as boussinesq solution shallow water solution and rayleigh solution here in order to minimize the trailing wave and maintain a stable waveform we use the third order solitary wave solution derived by grimshaw 1971 as the following set of equations 16a η d α s 2 3 4 α

the phase speed 2 5 dissipation zone a dissipation zone is added to damp wave amplitude at the outflow boundary in the dissipation zone the waves are dissipated by a coarse grid and a fictitious damping source term added to the vertical velocity in the momentum equation of eq 2 as the following 19 ν x 1 x 3 α x 1 x 1 s x 1 s x 1 e m 1 x 3 x 3 f x 3 t x 3 b where x 1 s x 1 e and x 3 b x 3 t are the four boundary positions of the dissipation zone and is the averaged free surface position the constants in eq 19 are set as α 0 5 δt m 4 and n 1 recommended by hu and kashiwagi 2009 3 description of the modeling conditions here we utilize our present model to study solitary wave impinging and overtopping on a seawall upon a slope and compare the results with the experimental and numerical results of hsiao and lin 2010 the experiments were performed in a 2 d wave flume and the experimental topography of an emerged trapezoidal seawall on an impermeable aluminum 1 20 slope starting at x 10 0m from the wave maker is shown in fig 1 the seawall was mounted on the slope starting at a distance of 3 6m from the slope toe with a front 1 4 and landward 1 1 8 slopes the free surface elevation of waves was measured by 9 wave gauges the impinging pressure was measured by 12 pressure transducers located upon the seawall see fig 1 b the experimental wave conditions are listed in table 1 three types of solitary wave were used to simulate representative tsunami waves of bore impinging and overtopping cases to save computation time the slope starts at x 7 0m in these calculations and thus the trapezoidal seawall is set at x 10 6m a grid refinement test is done in a numerical wave tank with d 0 22m and h 0 0 0638m before the calculation six variable grids were used in which the grid points were concentrated near the seawall and the free surface and the results are shown in table 2 from the computation time in table 2 we can see that the computation cost increases with the grid numbers fig 2 gives the comparisons of the surface elevation at gauges 1 x 5 9m 3 x 7 6m 22 x 9 64m 38 x 10 46m 39 x 10 73m and 40 x 11 12m for different grids the computed dimensionless surface elevations by six grids are almost the same except that grid 3 and 5 perform better than other grids at the wave peak and the trailing wave i e grid convergence is achieved in order to better describe the seawall and the possible wave breaking phenomenon the grid 5 with a resolution of dx 0 5 cm and dy 0 1 cm in the concerning region was used for the following computations a time step t 10 4s is initially set and dynamically adjusted during the computation 4 results and comparisons 4 1 wave profile and flow field fig 3 presents snapshots of wave profile deformation and flow field of two types of solitary waves type 2 and type 3 and both our numerical results black line and experimental data blue dot are plotted for comparison the propagation evolution of solitary wave can be observed in fig 3 such as shoaling run up breaking impingement and overtopping as we can see in fig 3 the numerical results agree in general with the experimental data also we can observe the flow separation near the seawall and there is air mixing into water accompanied by the interaction of solitary wave and the seawall this demonstrates the capability of our model to reproduce the violent deformed impinging and overtopping wave profiles for type 2 impinging wave the solitary wave runs up and breaks on the forward side of the seawall fig 3 t 7 8s and produces an overtopping flow climbing toward the crown of the seawall and flowing downstream on the backward side of the seawall during the breaking process the wave slams on the seawall with air entrapped which may be the primary factors that cause erosion of the grass or damage of the revetment during the climbing over process there is a splashing jet reflected by the backward slope of the seawall which spills onto the downstream region fig 3 t 7 8 8 0s and disturbs the overtopping flow into a turbulent flow fig 3 t 8 3s for type 3 overtopping wave the solitary wave directly overtops the crown of the seawall and breaks at the backward slope with plenty of air entrapped fig 3 t 7 8s then a vortex is generated upon the backward slope of the seawall fig 3 t 7 9 8 1s details of which will be discussed in the following section 5 2 when the latter overtopped flow falls into the former overtopped flow on the mild slope a reverse flow forms and breaks which makes the flow on the slope turbulent fig 3 t 8 1 8 5s fig 4 shows the wave profile deformation left column and vorticity right column evolution for type 1 a turbulent bore is formed at t 7 2s the water jet occurs and plunges on the wave front at t 7 46s and then an air entrainment takes place below the wave crest our numerical model predicts the process well in agreement with the experimental data at the same time a turbulent is generated near the curved wave front with the vorticity of an order of o 20 to 10s 1 calculated by our numerical model which is coincident with the results by hsiao and lin 2010 but the vorticity near the water air interface is predicted higher which may include the air turbulent motion since this model is a two phase model subsequently the water on the surface is splashed and runs up on the seawall at t 7 58s the vorticity in the vicinity of the air cavity increases to an order of o 40 to 10s 1 implying the intensity of the shear stress is increasing and a cavitation or a sediment suspension may be expected the climbing bore gradually overtops the crown at t 7 76s and the overtopping flow slides down along the backward seawall at t 7 92 8 28s at this stage the vorticity near the air bubbles decreases to an order of o 10s 1 while the vorticity is high to an order of o 50s 1 between the interface of the water structure at t 7 58 7 92s and the lower free surface of the overtopping flow which means the shear rate of the velocity is high but the flow rotation may not be strong because we simply use a velocity shear formula instead of more accurate turbulence model 4 2 free surface elevation for further validation figs 5 7 compare the calculated time history of free surface elevation with the experimental measurements and numerical results by hsiao and lin 2010 good agreement is relative evident except that the model has slightly overestimated the surface elevation spike as the solitary wave climbs up on the seawall and a little underestimated the thickness of the overland flow after the solitary wave overtops the seawall the reason is that the wave breaking in these stages is complex and uncertain with the strong nonlinearity and air entrapped into the water reflection waves by the sea wall are observed at time t 10s see figs 5 7 g3 and its height decreases as the water depth gets increasing this may be explained by that the solitary wave breaks earlier and loses more wave energy as the freeboard gets increasing after the reflection wave travels offshore a small wave trough is observed at time t 10s which means the reflection waves do not strictly conform to the solitary wave shape see fig 5 g22 and fig 6 g15 g22 also a second breaking occurs as the overtopped wave climbs the slope behind the sea wall see fig 7 g38 g40 4 3 dynamic pressure in figs 8 10 the calculated time histories of dynamic pressure are compared with the experimental measurements and numerical results by hsiao and lin 2010 luo et al 2019 and our model at the corresponding pressure measure points in the three cases all the dynamic pressure curves have a sudden spike and gentle decay in the process of wave run up and overtopping the numerical models has predicted this trend adequately except that the three numerical models all underestimates the pressure spike at p12 for type 2 where the impinging water breaks at the offshore side of the seawall that is because the impingement location is sensitive to water velocities that the predicted wave may not directly impinge on the pressure gauge and breaking pressure is complex and difficult to predict at the post breaking stage the pressure spikes fluctuate at a large region including points p1 p8 at the front seawall in type 1 fig 8 p1 p8 whereas the pressure spikes fluctuate at a relative small region including points p3 p6 at the front seawall in type 2 fig 9 p3 p6 these fluctuations are caused by the plunging break process which includes the air water mixed fluid impinging upon the front seawall these peak pressure fluctuations are also observed on the leeward seawall see fig 8 p11 p12 and fig 9 p10 p12 however this fluctuation at the pressure peaks does not occur at the front seawall but takes place at points p11 p12 on the leeward seawall for type 3 fig 10 p11 p12 because the solitary wave straightforwardly overtops the seawall and breaks behind the seawall there is a negative pressure at p1 for type 1 and 2 at t 10s which confirms the mentioned wave trough after reflection wave in section 4 2 for type 3 the dynamic pressure curves at the leeward seawall fig 10 p11 p12 have a sub atmosphere pressure after the main overtopping peak which is predicted well by both models as mentioned by bullock et al 2007 and hsiao and lin 2010 this phenomenon is caused by the high aeration where air is entrapped by the overtopped water and interacts with the water for a long time but both models fail to predict the sub atmosphere pressure before the pressure peaks which may be the result of the entrapped air compressed by the overtopped water before the overtopping water collapses on the backward seawall because the air compressibility is ignored in our model a comparison of the dynamic wave pressure peaks of type 1 2 and 3 indicates that the dynamic wave force could increase when the freeboard decreases to some extent it is noted that the time history curve of dynamic wave pressure has a similar upward and downward trend to that of the free surface deformation 4 4 dynamic force the dynamic wave forces per unit width on the seaward and leeward side are calculated by integrating the simulated dynamic pressure distribution along the seawall surface where the resolution is dx dy 0 5 cm 0 1 cm figs 11 13 give the calculated vertical and horizontal wave forces separately acting on the seaward and leeward side of the seawall compared with the experimental results by hsiao and lin 2010 and the numerical results by luo et al 2019 the positive directions of the vertical and horizontal wave force are downward and onshore in our model but we only show the absolute force in the figures for a good comparison since the force direction is easy to be recognized obviously the dynamic forces on the seaward side predicted by two numerical models agree well with the experimental results by hsiao and lin 2010 while forces on the leeward side have little discrepancies with the experimental data particularly there is a small phase advance of the wave force peak on the leeward side for the cases of type 3 where a considerable air entrainment occurs and the vortex propagates up and down along the slope as described by hsiao and lin 2010 the discrepancies may be brought on by lack of air compressibility in the simulation or absence of the turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation equations in the simulation of a highly turbulent fluid flow as we mentioned in section 4 3 there are some oscillations of the wave pressure in the region where the wave breaking occurs consequently these oscillations are observed around the wave force peaks for the cases of type 1 and 2 in addition for the case of leeward side in type 2 forces calculated by our model shows better agreement with the experiment data than that of luo et al 2019 5 further discussion the seawall model studied by hsiao and lin 2010 is a kind of low crest levee which is usually constructed when partial protection from waves is required landward of the levee these levees are more economical yet the leeside slope of the low crest levee would suffer from erosion induced by overtopping and overflow when storm or typhoon happen previous design for allowable overtopping considers only the average overtopping magnitude and does not recognize the role of erosion recently more attentions have been paid by engineers and researchers to the erodibility against wave overtopping of leeside slopes luo et al 2019 studied the influence of the seaward seawall slope on the volume and kinetic energy of overtopping wave and gave a practical way to estimate the intensity of a real tsunami there have been few studies on the relationship between the leeside levee slope geometry and solitary wave overtopping the hydraulic stability and erosion of the levee are among the most important factors in designing the low crest levee for survival during a particular storm in this section we further investigate hydraulic stability vorticity evolution and erosional potential for various seawall sections in terms of the leeside slope and wave parameters using a series of numerical experiments with the validated numerical model we choose the same cases as those in hsiao and lin 2010 i e ε 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 for the variations of wave nonlinearity and h0 0 20 0 22 0 256m for the variations of water level resulting in 12 groups in total in addition to these wave parameters the seawall section is changed by varying its leeside slope from 1 1 5 1 3 according to the eurotop manual by van der meer et al 2018 as shown in fig 14 the coordinates x1 y1 x2 y2 and x3 y3 are fixed and x4 y4 shifts along the red dash line to get the slopes of s1 1 1 5 s0 1 1 8 the cases presented in section 3 and 4 s2 1 2 and s3 1 3 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the overtopping wave in the 48 cases are investigated the cases are numbered according to the following rule that the first number represents the water case number the second number stands for the wave nonlinearity number and the third number is for the leeside seawall slope ratio number for example case number t110 means the water depth d is 0 2m the wave nonlinearity ε is 0 1 and the leeside seawall slope ratio is 1 1 8 5 1 influence of wave parameters and seawall section on stability in hsiao and lin 2010 the seawall is rigidly mounted on the slope and silicone is filled with the borders between the seawall and slope to prevent fluid infiltration therefore there is no water pressure on the bottom of the seawall in this experiment and thus uplift wave force and moment should not be considered in the analysis although this waterproof technology may function in theoretical and laboratory model tests it is necessary for the seawall design process to consider the cost effectiveness and construction process in which a guarantee of perfect waterproof in service period may be difficult besides the effect of wave impinging and scour might induce fatigue damage on the connection between the seawall and the slope during service period which could cause water infiltration and wave pressure on the bottom of the seawall in view of the forgoing reason the uplift force should be considered in the stability analysis of the seawall under limiting operating condition the uplift wave force and moment at the leeward heel is considered separately in the total wave force and moment according to the professional standard of code of hydrology for harbour and waterway chsh jts 145 2015 ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2015 and yuan and tao 2003 the wave pressure distribution on the bottom of the seawall could be assumed to be linear the total uplift wave force acting on the bottom can be calculated with the following formula 20 f uplift 0 5 p lb p rb b where p lb and p rb represent the wave pressure at the seaward bottom corner and leeward bottom corner of the seawall respectively see fig 15 and b is the distance of the two bottom corners the total uplift wave moment at the leeward heel can be calculated with the following formula 21 m uplift f uplift d where d is the distance between action point of the total uplift force and the leeward bottom corner of the seawall which can be calculated by the formula 22 d 1 3 b 2 p lb p rb p lb p rb the wave force f wave is calculated by summing the numerical wave moment acting on the seaward crown and leeward sides of the seawall and the wave moment m wave is calculated by summing the numerical wave moment acting on the seaward crown and leeward sides of the seawall at the leeward heel of the seawall the clockwise direction of the wave moment is defined as positive in this study the stability condition against overturning may be given by 23 γ q m w m uplift m g m inner where the m uplift is zero when the uplift force is not considered and m inner is the inner force between the connection of the seawall and bottom slope and is zero when the uplift force is considered and γq is the load partial coefficient of the limit state design being set at 1 3 according to design and construction code for gravity quay jts 167 2 2009 ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2009 thus the formula to calculate the safety factor of overturning k r according to eq 23 is 24 k r m g m inner m w m uplift γ q the formula to calculate the safety factor of sliding k s is 25 k s k f z g cos θ f x sin θ f x cos θ f z g sin θ where g is the gravity of the seawall calculated by the formula of g ρgv with ρ 250 kg m3 f x and f z are the wave forces on the horizontal and vertical direction with the positive direction being upward and rightward θis the bottom slope angle and k is the friction coefficient being set at 0 6 according to yuan and tao 2003 for the conditions considering the uplift wave force the total vertical force f z is given by 26 f z f wave z f uplift where the positive direction of f uplift and f z is upward and the positive direction of f wavez is downward 5 1 1 influence of wave parameters and seawall sections on the overturning stability 1 without considering the uplift wave moment fig 16 summarizes the calculated wave moment at the leeward heel on the seawall versus time for the above different cases the gravity moment at the heel is also drawn in the figures we can see that the wave moment is negative for all the cases if the uplift wave moment is not considered in the calculation of overturning stability which means the wave moment is beneficial for the seawall stability rather than overturns it therefore the seawall stability is satisfied as long as there is no uplift wave force on the bottom meaning that the material of seawall and slope is impermeable for the wave parameters influence it is obvious that the absolute maximum value of wave moment rises gradually and the impact duration increases gently with the wave nonlinearity and water depth it should be noted that larger wave moment means that the safety of overturning is increased because negative wave moment will improve anti overturning stability which is different with the basic law that larger wave and higher water levels bring greater threats to the coastal seawall in the view of overtopping volume this unique characteristic belonging to solitary waves may be related with its unique waveform with a tremendous amount of water above the surface and without a trough the maximum wave moment can be used to estimate the solitary intensity but it is also of great importance to study the cumulative energy of the solitary wave which may be useful for the analysis of fatigue damage to learn more about the intensity and energy of the wave moment on the seawall during the wave structure interaction we calculate the impulsive wave moment l which is given by 27 l m t the results of impulsive wave moment l are presented in fig 17 as we mentioned before the water depth has more influence than the leeside slope ratio on the impulsive wave moment it means that decreaing the crest level of the seawall is more effective than alleviating the leeside slope steepness in improving the safety ananist overturning however decreasing the crest level of the seawall may deducing the increase of the overtopping volume luo et al 2019 which may causes greater threats to the leeward area thus there may exist a certain crest level of the seawall to balance the overturning stability and overtopping volume for each wave scenatio and seawall section the impulsive wave moment l is normalized by the impulsive wave moment of s0 as shown in fig 18 generally a more gentle slope bears more impulsive wave moment and hence enhance the overturning stability with a range of 20 the three water groups and four wave nonlinearity factors have almost same changing rate of the impulsive wave moment over leeside slope ratio which means that the influence of the leeside slope ratio on the overturing stibility is not affected by the wave parameters the impulsive wave moment is increased by around 8 and 15 respectively when the leeside slope increases from 1 1 5 s1 to 1 2 0 s2 and 1 2 0 s2 to 1 3 0 s3 this may have a relation to the bottom slope and means that a more gentle leeside slope will significantly enhance the overturning stability where an extreme case steepness of 1 is never going to overturn 2 with considering the uplift wave moment fig 19 shows the wave moment on the seawall versus time considering uplift wave moment two phenomena can be observed 1 for all cases the wave moment has two peaks with a lager positive clockwise and a smaller negative anticlockwise one for ε 0 1 it should be noted that the negative wave moment only means that the wave moment is beneficial for the stability against overturning and the values may be incorrect since the relative overturning point has been changed to the seaward heel of the seawall 2 for group 3 with the zero freeboard the wave moment has two positive peaks and one negative peak and the second positive peak is higher than the first for the cases of ε 0 2 0 3 this may be related with the complex vortex evolution behavior behind the seawall and the corresponding dynamic wave pressure response on the leeward side in the process of the overtopping water interacting with the leeward seawall for the water depth of h 0 0 256m the first positive and negative peak of the wave moment increases as wave nonlinearity increases while for the water depth of h 0 0 20 and 0 22m the first spike increases as wave nonlinearity increases for the cases of ε 0 3 and maintain almost the same value for the cases of ε 0 3 as reported by chella et al 2017 who studied breaking solitary wave force on a vertical cylinder on a slope the forces on the cylinder rise slowly with longer duration for smaller solitary waves we could also conclude that the impact duration decreases slightly and wave force moment peak increases as the wave nonlinearity increases in the same water depth for the same wave nonlinearity the first positive peak of wave moment decreases slightly as water level increases which is evident for the cases of ε 0 2 and h 0 0 256m the plausible reason may be that the first positive peak is produced during the solitary wave approaching to the seaward side of the seawall and the contact surface of the solitary wave front with the seawall decreases as the water level increases or the freeboard decreases therefore the total wave moment acting on the seawall at h 0 0 20m is larger than the corresponding non breaking wave moment at h 0 0 256m this suggests that the overturning risks due to larger water depth rise slowly for longer duration with larger wave moment impulsive in contrast the first negative peak of wave moment gets the biggest at the highest water level of h 0 0 256m the reason is because that the first negative peak occurs after the solitary wave overtops the crown and falls down on the leeward side of the seawall and that the velocity and mass of the overtopped water increases with the water level increases also suction process of the water on the seaward side retreating offshore composes another portion of the negative wave moment according to eq 23 the safety factor of overturning k r with considering the uplift wave moment is 28 k r m g m w m uplift γ q this kind of safety factor may provide a direct and practical way to analyze the potential overturning risk of these structure for designers since wave moment varying with time the safety factor of overturning is a function of time k r t the minimum k r in a certain case means the most dangerous circumstance so we use the minimum k r of each case to analyze the minimum overturning safety of the seawall that it can be assured fig 20 gives the minimum value of k r for the studied wave scenarios and seawall sections generally a more gentle leeside slope bring more safety of overturning because both the gravity of the seawall and the vertical wave force acting on the seawall increases since the projected area in horizontal becomes larger for the cases of wave nonlinearity ε 0 1 and 0 2 t11 t12 t21 t22 t31 t32 all the minimum safety factors k r are bigger than 1 5 which can be recognized as satisfy the design safety requirements with γq 1 3 notably for the cases of larger wave nonlinearity ε 0 3 and 0 4 and steeper leeside slope ratio ss1 and s0 t131 t141 t40 t231 t241 the minimum safety factors k r are smaller than γq 1 3 indicating that the overturning safety may be challenged when the solitary wave height is large notably although the wave forces increase with the water level increases hsiao and lin 2010 which means the wave attack is significant during the high water level the wave moment is not always larger when the water level is higher suggesting that the overturning risk under the extreme water level may be less significant than the other water levels the possible reason may be that there is a phase shift between the maximum total horizontal wave force and the vertical force which is also concluded from a series of numerical computations of wave forces acting on submerged alternately submerged and emerged conditions of the semicircular breakwater by yuan and tao 2003 therefore a certain combination of the water level and the solitary wave shape causes the maximum wave moment as the same method as figs 17 18 without considering unlift wave moment the impulsive wave moment l and normalized value by the impulsive wave moment of s0 are shown in figs 21 22 for each wave scenatio and seawall section to be noted here all the values of l are positive that means wave moment is detrimental to the overturning stability thus larger value means more wave overturning energy and less safety in the overturning same with the cases without considering unlift wave moment in fig 17 impulsive wave moment of group 2 is always larger than group 1 which means increasing crest level of the seawall could effectively improve the overturning stability yet a little difference is that the crest level has not so much more influence than the leeside slope ratio where case slope s3 of group 1 has the same l value with case slope s1 of group 2 another difference is that more gentle leeside slope has more wave moment impulsive energy which may causes greater threats to the seawall generally in the view of impulsive wave moment steeper leeside slope and higher crest level of seawall could reduce wave moment energy special occasion occurs in the case of t34 which has almost the smallest value of all the cases indicating that the impulsive wave moment in the circumstance of higher water depth and strong wave nonlinearity is much less disruptive to the seawall the rational explanation is that the zero freeboad and large wave height induces much water overtopping leeward so that the wave moment on the leeside slope is larger than the seaside slope as shown in fig 19 group3 red line where the negative dynamic wave moment is larger than the positive value fig 22 has a similar trend with fig 18 that is a more gentle slope bears less impulsive moment energy and hence reduce the overturning risk by a range limit of 40 group 3 from s1 to s3 for the studied slope ratios nonetheless the impulsive moment for group 1 group 2 and group 3 is reduced by around 25 30 and 40 respectively when the leeside slope decreases from s1 1 1 5 to s3 1 3 indicating that the influence of the slope ratio on impulsive moment under higher water level is more effective than that of lower water level the above foundings on the wave moment provide a guidance in the design of the seawall section and the safety estimation of the seawall 5 1 2 influence of wave parameters and seawall sections on sliding stability to analyze the stability against sliding the wave forces on the seawall needs to be thoroughly understood in the following the temporal variations of computed horizontal wave force vertical wave force and uplift wave force are demonstrated with an example for the convenience of demonstration cases with leeside slope of s0 and wave nonlinearity of 0 2 for three water groups in table 3 are selected as the example fig 23 shows the variations of the horizontal and vertical wave forces and the uplift wave force it can be seen that there are phase differences between the horizontal and vertical wave force meaning that the force peak cannot be reached at the same time although the phase lag is little for this experimental case and may not have significant influence on the results notably the vertical wave force without uplift wave force is negative which means that the stability against sliding is much better than the circumstance without wave therefore there is no need to check the sliding stability as long as it is stable in calm water hereafter in this section the sliding stability is analyzed considering the uplift wave force the maximum total horizontal wave force f xmax and the maximum vertical wave force f zmax without considering wave uplift force simulated by the numerical model for all cases are systematically summarized in figs 24 25 respectively evidently the horizontal wave force is far much smaller than the vertical force with a percentage of around 20 due to smaller projected area of the seawall in the horizontal direction which once again testifies that the sliding stability is satisfied the water depth and wave nonlinearity have significant influence on the wave forces while the effect of leeside slope ratio on the maximum wave forces is little in comparison the horizontal wave force is increased by 80 and 20 when the water depth increases from group 1 0 20m to group2 0 22m and from group 2 0 22m to group3 0 256m for cases t13 t23 and t33 this implies that as the water depth getting higher increasing the crest level of the seawall in a small certain range may be less effective in reducing the wave force as described in front section of 5 1 the safety factor of sliding k s is primarily influenced by the horizontal f x and vertical f z wave forces traditionally the f xmax and vertical f zmax which are calculated by an empirical formula are utilized simultaneously in the formula since there is a phase difference in the maximum value of f x and f z the coupled wave force of f x and f z are used in the formula of eq 25 here the vertical f z includes the uplift wave force similar with the safety factor of k r the minimum value of k s t are selected to represent the sliding stability of the seawall along the bottom slope as shown in fig 26 as we can see all the k s are bigger than 1 0 indicating that the sliding stability is satisfied the most dangerous circumstance occurs at case t243 group 2 ε 0 4 s3 and t342 group 3 ε 0 4 s2 the k s for cases of higher water depth are always smaller than cases of lower water depth which reveals that increasing crest level will reduce the sliding risk for the reason that the horizonal wave force decreases accordingly another phenomenon is that the k s increases slightly with the leeside slope getting decreased primarily because the gentle slope makes the gravity of the seawall and the vertical force increase slightly this means that decreasing the leeside slope is less effective than the measure of increasing crest level of seawall to enhance the sliding stability as same consideration as the impulsive wave moment in section 5 1 1 to learn more about the energy of the wave force on the seawall impulse of horizontal wave force is calculated by the given formula 29 i x f x t since the horizontal wave force is primarily positive for solitary waves which is harmful to the sliding stability herein we only analyze the impulse of horizontal wave force in positive direction and the results are demonstrated in fig 27 interestingly the impulse of wave force increases 10 50 as the water depth increases from group 1 to group 2 while in contrast it decreases 16 20 as the water depth increases from group 2 to group 3 this means that a certain combination of water depth and crest level of the seawall will deduce the largest wave overtopping momentum with serious destructive power which will definitely provide useful guidance to the seawall crest design in all the wave scenarios the leeside slope has little influence on the impulse of wave force fig 28 gives the normalized impulse of horizontal wave force by the impulse of wave force of s0 for each wave scenarios and leeside slopes for better comparison fig 28 also demonstrates that the effect of leeside slope on the impulse of wave force is very little with a range of 2 and the maximum value occurs at s0 for almost all cases and s3 for weak wave nonlinearity of higher water depth thus in terms of minimizing the impulse of wave force leeside slope of s1 or s2 may be a better choice 5 2 vorticity and pressure evolution fig 29 presents the vorticity evolution behind the seawall calculated by numerical model for the case of h 0 0 256m ε 0 4 obviously as the wave overtops the seawall and collapses on the slope with a significant velocity considerable air is entrapped and a clockwise vortex is generated around the bottom corner of the seawall at t 7 0s the entrapped air is carried up to the crown along with the upstream flow of the vortex and then is separated into two parts by the vortex rotation at t 7 05 7 1s where the vorticity is large after that the right part of the entrapped air propagates downstream through the advection and diffusion induced by the vortex at t 7 1 7 35s whereas the left part is convected upstream and rolls up into small counterclockwise vortices at t 7 15 7 25s then stretched downstream by the upper overtopping flow at t 7 25 7 35s the intensity of the vorticity is of orders of o 70 to 10 s implying that cavitation may occur on the surface of the leeward seawall as reported by hsiao and lin 2010 additionally a flow jet splashed by the overland flow is observed near x 11 3 m at t 7 2s and the front gets steeper and develops into vertical with the decreasing water depth from x 11 3m to x 11 5 m at t 7 2 7 3s eventually the water jet begins to collapse and impacts on the water surface at t 7 3 7 35s the corresponding wave pressure response at breaking and post breaking for this case is also demonstrated in fig 30 at t 7 0s the overtopped plunging jet entrapped with considerable air concentrates on the slope behind the seawall and forms huge pressure with the value up to 2600pa almost triple hydrostatic pressure the pressure distribution around the breaking position shows in arc shape and the downward sides are stretched downstream as the overtopped wave propagates on the slope the huge impact pressure gets to slacken till under 800pa at t 7 05 7 3s meanwhile as the entrapped air is entrained downstream by the vortex the huge impact pressure zone is also pushed slowly downstream by the entrapped air from x 11 08m to x 11 14 m at t 7 05 7 3s eventually the entrapped air overtakes the huge impact pressure zone at t 7 35s note that the pressure of the vortex zone is still higher than the surroundings at t 7 35s where the vortex zone could be recognized in fig 29 at t 7 35s implying that the pressure fields after breaking are of intense oscillation with the existence of the vortex 5 3 erosional potential analysis as we mentioned in the former part of this section present guidance for allowable overtopping levees considers primarily the average overtopping volume luo et al 2019 and does not recognize the role of duration although the prime interest may be in designing the levee for survival during an extreme storm there is also interest in the erosional potential during storms that will cause great damage to represent the level of levee erosion hazard dean et al 2010 develops acceptable equivalences of cumulative combinations of wave overtopping velocity and duration for landward levees with grass cover to define the potential land side levee erosion which includes three indices 1 velocity index 2 shear stress index and 3 work index here we utilize the velocity index as an example to evaluate the potential erosion assuming that the landward side of the levee is covered by good grass in dean et al 2010 the acceptable erosion e u due to an excess velocity over the critical value u c u is given by 30 e u k u u m i u c u t i u m i u c u where u m i and t i are the measured velocities and time duration and e u k u are unknown coefficients the critical velocity u c u is also an unknown eq 30 can be written as 31 e u k u u m i u c u t i u m i u c u where the two unknowns are now e u k u and the critical velocity u c u applying the method of least squares for the case of plain grass good cover based on experimental data dean et al 2010 found u c u 1 93 m s and e u k u 22 1 103 m because the coefficients of e u k u and u c u are determined on the basis of prototype test data scale conversion is needed for the evaluation of cases in this numerical model we assume the length scale λl is 30 and velocity scale λt is 301 2 following the gravity similarity criterion therefore u c u 0 35 m s and e u k u 7 36 102 m is used as the threshold value to estimate the potential erosion of the landward side of the seawall in this model the cumulative of e u k u for one single solitary wave marked as t e u k u are calculated in our numerical model two sets of wave nonlinearity for three groups and four leeside slopes have been presented illustrating application of the methodology in fig 31 generally the cumulative erosional units increase with the wave nonlinearity and water depth much more erosion occurs in larger area if the wave height and water depth is higher the position of large cumulative erosion units moves toward to the leeward slope of the seawall which coincides with the characteristics of overtopping flow on the leeward slope erosion usually starts from one weak point on the slope surface and develops in to a large hole rapidly to measure the erosional intensity of the most possible erosional position on the slope we pick out the maximum of cumulative erosional velocity units of the landward side of the seawall as shown in fig 32 evidently the water depth has the most significant impact on the maximum cumulative erosional units and wave nonlinearity is the second important influencing factor which means storm surge with high level combining large wave will induce serious erosion on the leeward slope the maximum cumulative erosional units are affected weakly by the slope ratio where it increases slightly with the slope ratio decreasing for most cases to be mentioned here although the maximum cumulative erosional units of steep leeward slop s1 s0 is comparative with gentle leeward slope s3 the erosion may not occur on the leeward side of the seawall because the overtopping flow may directly impact on the leeward bottom slope as shown in fig 31 though the cumulative erosional velocity units are more intense in gentle slopes the direct erosion of the slope is only one possible failure mechanism a major failure mechanism on steep leeward slope 1 1 5 is slip failure which may lead directly to a breach the above cumulative erosional units are based on one solitary wave overtopping process with the values of 0 2 1 9m in table 4 which is far less than the erosion limit in reality the storm surge and large waves may last a long time therefore we calculate the maximum duration before the erosion limit is reached assuming a series of solitary waves acting on the seawall the procedure is as following 1 calculate the number of solitary waves n that is needed to reach the erosion limit 2 calculate the represent wave period of the solitary wave t 3 calculate the duration to reach the erosion limit in experimental model scale t n t 4 calculate the duration to reach the erosion limit in prototype scale and change the time using a unit in hours t n t λt 3600 the pressures and results are listed in table 4 from table 4 we can see that the duration of erosion limit varies large with different wave scenarios and little with leeside slopes expect for the cases of t12 for the combination of low water depth and weak wave nonlinearity ε 0 2 the duration decreases rapidly with the water depth increasing in contrast for the combination of low water depth and strong wave nonlinearity ε 0 4 the duration decreases slowly with the water depth increasing while decreases rapidly when the water level is high combing the local design wave climate this method could be used to estimate the erosion potential of the leeside slope and thus provide a reference in the seawall design 6 conclusions the aim of this work is to demonstrate the capability of a cip based solver to accurately reproduce solitary wave impinging and overtopping on a complex shaped bottom the interactions of solitary waves with an emerged structure composed by a trapezoidal seawall on a 1 20 slope have been simulated showing that the model is able to represent some important features of wave structure interaction related to breaking and overtopping such as violent free surface deformation and vortex evolution quantitative comparisons of the free surface elevation dynamic pressure and force with the results of hsiao and lin 2010 suggest that the flow dynamics is well described even if the turbulence model is not included in this model further a series of numerical simulations are performed to investigate the influence of the wave parameters water depth and wave nonlinearity and leeward slope ratio of the seawall on hydrodynamic stability and erosional potential based on the experiment model of hsiao and lin 2010 the wave forces wave moment and impulse of wave force and wave moment acting on the seawall are thoroughly analyzed from the aspects of with and without consideration of wave uplift force and moment to get a clear knowledge about the hydrodynamic stability erosional index is utilized to measure the erosion potential and duration of erosion limit are calculated to estimate the erosion resistance of the seawall we observe that the wave moment acts slightly differently with the wave force behavior 1 the conditions without consideration of the uplift wave force and moment is more stable than that with consideration of these 2 wave moment does not always increase with the water level increasing indicating that a certain combination of the water level and the solitary wave shape causes the maximum wave moment impulsive moment is less with a more gentle leeward slope and the overturning risk becomes low 3 the most dangerous circumstance occurs at case t243 group 2 ε 0 4 s3 and t342 group 3 ε 0 4 s2 implying that increasing crest level the will enhance the sliding stability impulse of wave force is affected significantly by water depth and wave nonlinearity and reach the highest in cases of middle water depth and strong wave nonlinearity which means the most destructive wave momentum does not occur in the highest water depth 4 the position of large cumulative erosion units moves toward to the leeward slope of the seawall as the leeward slope of the seawall decreasing and the maximum of cumulative erosional velocity unit is significantly influenced by the water depth and wave nonlinearity 5 the duration of erosion limit varies large in the combination of low water depth and weak wave nonlinearity and combination of high water level and strong wave nonlinearity and varies little with leeside slopes expect for the cases of t12 additionally the vortex and pressure evolution of one representative dangerous case is numerically simulated it implies that both the vortex rotation combined with entrapped air and pressure concentration due to the overtopping are intense and could be the cause of cavitations behind the seawall although the cases have been simplified the characteristics of the hydrodynamic stability including sliding and overturning stability and erosion potential could be useful in the assessment of potential destructive damage and design of the coastal structures exposed to storm surge or

stokes ns equations 1 introduction coastal structures such as emerged composite breakwaters vertical or sloping sea walls are widely built in the nearshore regions to reflect or dissipate wave energy and assure the safety of the coastal zone as waves propagate shoreward they undergo changes in height and velocity caused by the structures and travel with the potential to cause damages to coastal structures or loss of life wave structure interaction becomes a classical issue in coastal engineering but the existing works on this topic have focused on periodic waves and studies on tsunamis storms and extreme waves interaction with coastal structures are limited tsunamis are long waves that are usually generated by seismic events thus it is difficult to furnish a general modeling method solitary waves are likely the largest steadily propagating wave in constant water depth and they have similar hydrodynamic characteristics to tsunami storm and hurricane surge synolakis 2006 therefore the solitary wave is employed as a reference to study hydrodynamic properties of these extreme waves from the view of numerical and experimental models many aspects of the hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves have been well researched the attention has been put on solitary wave run up on a uniform slope lin et al 1999 hsiao et al 2008 transmission and hydrodynamic properties of waves over an abrupt topography liu and cheng 2001 vortex generation evolution and shedding around a submerged obstacle or a bottom cavity chang et al 2001 2012 the kinematics of the solitary wave through porous breakwater or vegetated sloping beach tang et al 2013 wu et al 2014 and the interaction of a solitary wave with an array of surface piercing vertical cylinders zhao et al 2007 nevertheless there are many beachfront houses infrastructures or seawalls built on the slope near the shoreline which will undergo large impinging force and overtopping damage when a storm surge tsunami or extreme wave happens yet only a few studies have focused on the solitary wave impinging and overtopping on this type of structures xiao and huang 2008 used a vof based rans numerical model to evaluate the wave forces and overturning moment of a solitary wave on an idealized house on a slope yet they did not compare their numerical results with the corresponding experimental data hsiao and lin 2010 conducted an experiment to study impingement and overtopping of solitary waves on a seawall upon a sloping beach they also employed a cobras model to simulate the process of the experiment gsell et al 2016 used a coupled vof and ib method to simulate the run up of a breaking solitary wave on a natural beach in which streamlines and bottom stress are analyzed chella et al 2017 utilized a three dimensional cfd model reef3d to simulate the solitary waves breaking over a slope and the associated breaking wave forces on a cylinder they discussed the effect of the relative distance between the cylinder and the breaking point and wave height on the breaking wave forces but did not account the dynamic wave pressure one purpose of this study is to perform a numerical investigation to the solitary wave interactions with a composite structure considering the solitary wave impinging and overtopping with the verification of corresponding experimental studies by hsiao and lin 2010 physical experiments as a traditional approach with appropriate measurement facilities can reveal the real flow property in a certain circumstance yet such approache is costly time consuming and incomprehensive with the development of the computer performance computational fluid dynamics cfd solvers are becoming a promising alternative method to simulate the nonlinear wave structure interactions with the advantage of displaying the details of the flow fields models based on water depth integrated equations such as the laplace equations shallow water equations swe and boussinesq equations have been widely used to study solitary wave propagation the laplace equations are based on potential theory under the assumption of irrotational and inviscid flow and the boundary element methods are the popular numerical technique studies have been done to take account into the vortex shedding and energy dissipation with the combination of a navier stokes solver pringle et al 2016 or vortex methods lin and huang 2010 the shallow water equations and boussinesq equations are based long wave theory by applying shock capturing schemes the shallow water equations give a good description of wave run up and breaking waves li and raichlen 2002 yet the wave profile in the shoaling zone is not predicted precisely the boussinesq equations can describe the wave shoaling before breaking with better dispersive properties madsen et al 2006 however the boussinesq equations become invalid in the surf zone because they do not include the dissipation induced by wave breaking to extend the validity of these equations researchers have developed wave breaking closure strategies by adding additional terms or using hybrid methods filippini et al 2016 in which some parameters need to be calibrated another problem of the boussinesq equations is that the pressure was assumed to be hydrostatic which means that there was no dispersive effect and that the model was restricted to turbulent bores mahdavi and talebbeydokhti 2011 by augmenting dissipation in these models roll waves and classical hydraulic jumps could be correctly described richard and gavrilyuk 2013 depth integrated models are approximate equations of wave motion and contain theoretically a truncation error of some order wei et al 1995 when a wave overturning exists or the fluid is violent with rapid acceleration they may result in inaccuracy simulation or calculation breakdown besides the configurations of coastal structures are depth dependent in most scenarios these models fail to predict the complex wave structure interaction with a bottom of arbitrary shape moreover they lose the ability to model the flow description in vertical which plays an important part in understanding the dynamic interaction between the induced flow and the structure to simulate the interaction with irregularly shaped structures and provide detailed information of the flow characteristics navier stokes ns based solvers are required to solve the navier stokes equations one of the most prominent computational issues is to numerically capture or reconstruct the moving free surface many methods have been successfully used to study the solitary wave interaction with coastal structures such as volume of fluid vof method xiao and huang 2008 hsiao and lin 2010 level set method xie and tao 2000 and the meshless particle methods ketabdari 2015 luo et al 2019 he et al 2020 vof method is usually adopted to treat the wave breaking process and vortex evolutionary behavior on a slope xiao and huang 2008 hsiao and lin 2010 many efforts have been made to improve the accuracy and stability of vof typed method including tangent of hyperbolic interface capturing thinc method xiao et al 2005 weighed line interface calculation wlic yokoi 2007 and thinc sw scheme xiao et al 2011 some of them have been applied in the wave structure interaction problems hu and kashiwagi 2009 developed a flower solver combining a thinc method and cartesian grid based flow solver using a constrained interpolation profile cip method hu and kashiwagi 2009 to predict strongly nonlinear wave structure interactions which can deal with the complicated free surface geometry and wave breaking process zhao and hu 2012 and zhao et al 2014 then developed and applied it to study the extreme wave and freak wave interaction with floating body these studies have demonstrated the performance of the cip based solver in simulating the flow field on a fixed rectangular grid however most studies focus on the ocean engineering problems only a few studies have used this solver to study wave structure interactions in coastal engineering especially between the solitary wave and coastal structure zhao et al 2016 2019 ji et al 2017 wang et al 2018 and you et al 2019 applied this numerical model to study solitary waves interaction with a submerged shelf rectangular and trapezoidal breakwater and flat plate and wang et al 2018 applied this numerical model to study solitary waves interaction with a submerged shelf rectangular and trapezoidal breakwater zhao et al 2017 also numerically studied the effects of several factors on tsunami wave impact and run up in the presence of gentle submarine slopes and coastal cliffs these studies focus on the flow characteristics of solitary wave passing over submerged structures or run up on coastal cliffs but they do not include the impinging and overtopping process of solitary waves interacting with an emerged structure on a slope therefore another purpose of this study is to validate the applicability of this flow solver proposed by hu and kashiwagi 2009 to solitary waves interacting with this kind of coastal structure the present study investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of solitary waves interacting with an emerged structure on a slope with a numerical flow solver proposed by hu and kashiwagi 2009 the numerical results are validated with the experimental data in hsiao and lin 2010 and compared with their numerical results by the cobras model and results of luo et al 2019 with a consistent particle method the effects of breaking characteristics of solitary wave types the relative freeboard and water depth are examined in the view of the flow field the free surface the dynamic pressure and wave force furthermore the influence of wave parameters and seawall sections on the hydraulic stability of the seawall and the erosional potential of the leeward slope of the seawall are evaluated and analyzed additionally vorticity and pressure evolutionary behavior behind the seawall are depicted to address the flow features including vortex breaking and air entrainment the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the numerical model is briefly presented in section 3 the calculation conditions about the solitary wave overtopping on a trapezoidal seawall on a slope are described and grid refinement test is carried out for the numerical wave tank results and comparisons with hsiao and lin s 2010 experimental and numerical results are shown in section 4 further discussion for flow features hydraulic stability and erosional potential are done in section 5 conclusions are given in section 6 2 methods and model 2 1 mathematical equation considering the flow as 2d incompressible viscous fluid in a cartesian grid system it is governed by the continuity and n s equations as the following 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i here the cartesian tensor notation i 1 2 is used x i and u i are the spatial coordinates and velocity of each coordinate in a cartesian grid system ρ is the density p is the global pressure involving hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure μis the viscosity the strain rate tensor s ij is given by s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the last term f i stands for the external body pressure such as gravity etc for complex water air structure interaction problems the model treats it as a multiphase flow problem including water air and solid structure the cartesian grid is fixed and covers the whole computational domain a volume fraction or density function ϕ m m 1 2 and 3 represent water air and solid respectively is introduced to identify different phases and thus define and track the interface these functions are governed by the following advection function 3 ϕ m t u i ϕ m x 0 with ϕ m x y t 1 0 x y ω m e l s e whereω m is the domain occupied by different phases the fluid structure interaction is dealt with one kind of immersed boundary method where the mass density of the structure is set as the same as that of the background fluid the solid structure boundary condition is applied by a force to the momentum equation of the fluid in the original immersed boundary method herein we apply a velocity to a cell containing the solid phase as 4 u u b φ 3 u 1 φ 3 where u b is the local velocity of the body and u is the velocity obtained by eq 2 in the numerical procedure imposing the velocity distribution inside and on the solid boundary is equivalent to applying a forcing term f bi to the momentum equation eq 2 as follows 5a u i n 1 u i n δ t r h s i f b i 5b f b i r h s i u i n 1 u i n δ t where u i n 1 u i n 1 at the fluid structure boundary this method is proposed by hu and kashiwagi 2004 since the seawall structure in our study is fixed and does not move with the fluid ϕ 3 is a set of constants defined at initial and u b 0 this treatment can ensure the computation stability and save the computation time in the model the total volume fraction for water and solid ϕ 13 or air and solid ϕ 23 is solved by eq 3 where ϕ m ϕ 13 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 or ϕ m ϕ 23 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 the volume fraction of water is then calculated by ϕ 1 ϕ 13 ϕ 3 and that of air is calculated by ϕ 2 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 after all volume fractions for different phases have been calculated the physical property λ i e density viscosity etc can be determined by the following equation 6 λ m 1 3 λ m ϕ m 2 2 numerical algorithm the constrained interpolation profile cip method is used to solve the advection term in the n s equations this method was first put forward as a semi lagrangian scheme by takewaki et al 1985 and was then further developed using an eulerian approach to treat multiphase flow with large density ratio by yabe et al 2001 to apply a cip scheme the information of spatial derivatives of x i are required therefore by differentiating eq 2 with respect to x i we obtain eq 7 7 t u j x j u i x i 0 u j x i u i x i x i 1 ρ p x j x i 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i a fractional step method is utilized to solve the governing equations of eqs 2 and 7 which are divided into the following three steps 1 advection step 8a u i t u j u i x j 0 8b t u j x j u i x i 0 applying a cip scheme to these two equations we obtain the solutions of u i and u i x i at the intermediate time 2 non advection step i 9a u i t 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i 9b t u i x i x i 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i a central difference scheme is used for the spatial derivatives and an explicit scheme for the time marching u i and u i x i are updated at the second intermediate time level based on the advection solutions of u i and u i x i 3 non advection step ii 10a u i t 1 ρ p x i 10b t u i x i x i 1 ρ p x j substituting u i n 1 x i 0 of eq 1 we obtain the following poisson type equation for pressure 11 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u i x i we obtain the pressure p at time n 1 by a successive over relaxation sor method which is the most time consuming process then an implicit scheme is used for the time marching of eqs 10a and 10b and the velocity u i and u i x i at time n 1 are solved 2 3 determination of boundaries 2 3 1 free surface capturing the free surface is determined by solving the volume fraction eq 3 with the thinc scheme for a real problem the free surface has no thickness yet during the computation the interface may become defined with finite thickness due to numerical diffusion fortunately owing to the sub cell resolution feature of the thinc scheme the interface gets smeared slowly as the computation proceeds this degree of interface diffusion is considered acceptable for most cases the thinc scheme is also a vof type method with the feature of mass conservation its 1 d equation of volume fraction is rewritten in a conservation form as the following 12 ϕ t u ϕ x ϕ u x by using the finite volume method in eq 12 we obtain the volume fraction ϕ i n 1 based on the information of velocity field u n and volume fraction field ϕ n at time moment n 13 ϕ i n 1 ϕ i n 1 δ x i g i 1 2 g i 1 2 δ t δ x i ϕ i n u i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n where ϕ i n 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 ϕ i x d x is the averaged volume fraction at the cell center x x i and g i 1 2 t n t n 1 u ϕ i 1 2 d t is the volume flux through the cell boundary x x i 1 2 a semi lagrangian procedure is adopted to calculate the flux like the other reconstruction schemes the thinc scheme uses a piecewise hyperbolic tangent function as an interpolation function to reconstruct the profile of ϕ inside a computation cell as the following 14 ϕ i x α 2 1 γ tanh β x x i 1 2 δ x i x i where α β γ are parameters determining the quality of the interface solution α and γ are used to eliminate numerical diffusion which are defined as 15 α ϕ i 1 if ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 otherwise γ 1 if ϕ i 1 ϕ i 1 1 o t h e r w i s e β is used to determine the sharpness of the jump of the interpolation function ranging from 0 to 1 a constant β 3 5 is usually used as a result of many computation tests that have been performed more details can be found in xiao et al 2005 2 4 wave generation since solitary waves are associated to quasi vertically uniform horizontal velocity a piston type wave maker seems a suitable generation device the key is that the largest solitary wave outruns the dispersive disturbance and the lower solitary wave far enough considering the fix grid we utilized in the model we use a velocity boundary to represent the moving paddle in our numerical wave tank there are different generation laws of motion for paddle derived from different solitary wave solutions such as boussinesq solution shallow water solution and rayleigh solution here in order to minimize the trailing wave and maintain a stable waveform we use the third order solitary wave solution derived by grimshaw 1971 as the following set of equations 16a η d α s 2 3 4 α 2 s 2 t 2 α 3 5 8 s 2 t 2 101 80 s 4 t 2 16b u d α s 2 α 2 3 4 s 2 s 2 t 2 1 z d 2 3 4 s 2 9 4 s 2 t 2 α 3 21 40 s 2 s 2 t 2 6 5 s 4 t 2 1 z d 2 9 4 s 2 15 4 s 2 t 2 15 2 s 4 t 2 1 z d 4 3 8 s 2 45 16

56 α 3 κ κ 0 1 5 8 α 71 128 α 2 where s sech p ψ t tanh p ψ p 2 3 4 d 3 the velocity of the paddle is given by 18 u x t c η x t d η x t where η is the water surface elevation d the mean water depth c the phase speed 2 5 dissipation zone a dissipation zone is added to damp wave amplitude at the outflow boundary in the dissipation zone the waves are dissipated by a coarse grid and a fictitious damping source term added to the vertical velocity in the momentum equation of eq 2 as the following 19 ν x 1 x 3 α x 1 x 1 s x 1 s x 1 e m 1 x 3 x 3 f x 3 t x 3 b where x 1 s x 1 e and x 3 b x 3 t are the four boundary positions of the dissipation zone and is the averaged free surface position the constants in eq 19 are set as α 0 5 δt m 4 and n 1 recommended by hu and kashiwagi 2009 3 description of the modeling conditions here we utilize our present model to study solitary wave impinging and overtopping on a seawall upon a slope and compare the results with the experimental and numerical results of hsiao and lin 2010 the experiments were performed in a 2 d wave flume and the experimental topography of an emerged trapezoidal seawall on an impermeable aluminum 1 20 slope starting at x 10 0m from the wave maker is shown in fig 1 the seawall was mounted on the slope starting at a distance of 3 6m from the slope toe with a front 1 4 and landward 1 1 8 slopes the free surface elevation of waves was measured by 9 wave gauges the impinging pressure was measured by 12 pressure transducers located upon the seawall see fig 1 b the experimental wave conditions are listed in table 1 three types of solitary wave were used to simulate representative tsunami waves of bore impinging and overtopping cases to save computation time the slope starts at x 7 0m in these calculations and thus the trapezoidal seawall is set at x 10 6m a grid refinement test is done in a numerical wave tank with d 0 22m and h 0 0 0638m before the calculation six variable grids were used in which the grid points were concentrated near the seawall and the free surface and the results are shown in table 2 from the computation time in table 2 we can see that the computation cost increases with the grid numbers fig 2 gives the comparisons of the surface elevation at gauges 1 x 5 9m 3 x 7 6m 22 x 9 64m 38 x 10 46m 39 x 10 73m and 40 x 11 12m for different grids the computed dimensionless surface elevations by six grids are almost the same except that grid 3 and 5 perform better than other grids at the wave peak and the trailing wave i e grid convergence is achieved in order to better describe the seawall and the possible wave breaking phenomenon the grid 5 with a resolution of dx 0 5 cm and dy 0 1 cm in the concerning region was used for the following computations a time step t 10 4s is initially set and dynamically adjusted during the computation 4 results and comparisons 4 1 wave profile and flow field fig 3 presents snapshots of wave profile deformation and flow field of two types of solitary waves type 2 and type 3 and both our numerical results black line and experimental data blue dot are plotted for comparison the propagation evolution of solitary wave can be observed in fig 3 such as shoaling run up breaking impingement and overtopping as we can see in fig 3 the numerical results agree in general with the experimental data also we can observe the flow separation near the seawall and there is air mixing into water accompanied by the interaction of solitary wave and the seawall this demonstrates the capability of our model to reproduce the violent deformed impinging and overtopping wave profiles for type 2 impinging wave the solitary wave runs up and breaks on the forward side of the seawall fig 3 t 7 8s and produces an overtopping flow climbing toward the crown of the seawall and flowing downstream on the backward side of the seawall during the breaking process the wave slams on the seawall with air entrapped which may be the primary factors that cause erosion of the grass or damage of the revetment during the climbing over process there is a splashing jet reflected by the backward slope of the seawall which spills onto the downstream region fig 3 t 7 8 8 0s and disturbs the overtopping flow into a turbulent flow fig 3 t 8 3s for type 3 overtopping wave the solitary wave directly overtops the crown of the seawall and breaks at the backward slope with plenty of air entrapped fig 3 t 7 8s then a vortex is generated upon the backward slope of the seawall fig 3 t 7 9 8 1s details of which will be discussed in the following section 5 2 when the latter overtopped flow falls into the former overtopped flow on the mild slope a reverse flow forms and breaks which makes the flow on the slope turbulent fig 3 t 8 1 8 5s fig 4 shows the wave profile deformation left column and vorticity right column evolution for type 1 a turbulent bore is formed at t 7 2s the water jet occurs and plunges on the wave front at t 7 46s and then an air entrainment takes place below the wave crest our numerical model predicts the process well in agreement with the experimental data at the same time a turbulent is generated near the curved wave front with the vorticity of an order of o 20 to 10s 1 calculated by our numerical model which is coincident with the results by hsiao and lin 2010 but the vorticity near the water air interface is predicted higher which may include the air turbulent motion since this model is a two phase model subsequently the water on the surface is splashed and runs up on the seawall at t 7 58s the vorticity in the vicinity of the air cavity increases to an order of o 40 to 10s 1 implying the intensity of the shear stress is increasing and a cavitation or a sediment suspension may be expected the climbing bore gradually overtops the crown at t 7 76s and the overtopping flow slides down along the backward seawall at t 7 92 8 28s at this stage the vorticity near the air bubbles decreases to an order of o 10s 1 while the vorticity is high to an order of o 50s 1 between the interface of the water structure at t 7 58 7 92s and the lower free surface of the overtopping flow which means the shear rate of the velocity is high but the flow rotation may not be strong because we simply use a velocity shear formula instead of more accurate turbulence model 4 2 free surface elevation for further validation figs 5 7 compare the calculated time history of free surface elevation with the experimental measurements and numerical results by hsiao and lin 2010 good agreement is relative evident except that the model has slightly overestimated the surface elevation spike as the solitary wave climbs up on the seawall and a little underestimated the thickness of the overland flow after the solitary wave overtops the seawall the reason is that the wave breaking in these stages is complex and uncertain with the strong nonlinearity and air entrapped into the water reflection waves by the sea wall are observed at time t 10s see figs 5 7 g3 and its height decreases as the water depth gets increasing this may be explained by that the solitary wave breaks earlier and loses more wave energy as the freeboard gets increasing after the reflection wave travels offshore a small wave trough is observed at time t 10s which means the reflection waves do not strictly conform to the solitary wave shape see fig 5 g22 and fig 6 g15 g22 also a second breaking occurs as the overtopped wave climbs the slope behind the sea wall see fig 7 g38 g40 4 3 dynamic pressure in figs 8 10 the calculated time histories of dynamic pressure are compared with the experimental measurements and numerical results by hsiao and lin 2010 luo et al 2019 and our model at the corresponding pressure measure points in the three cases all the dynamic pressure curves have a sudden spike and gentle decay in the process of wave run up and overtopping the numerical models has predicted this trend adequately except that the three numerical models all underestimates the pressure spike at p12 for type 2 where the impinging water breaks at the offshore side of the seawall that is because the impingement location is sensitive to water velocities that the predicted wave may not directly impinge on the pressure gauge and breaking pressure is complex and difficult to predict at the post breaking stage the pressure spikes fluctuate at a large region including points p1 p8 at the front seawall in type 1 fig 8 p1 p8 whereas the pressure spikes fluctuate at a relative small region including points p3 p6 at the front seawall in type 2 fig 9 p3 p6 these fluctuations are caused by the plunging break process which includes the air water mixed fluid impinging upon the front seawall these peak pressure fluctuations are also observed on the leeward seawall see fig 8 p11 p12 and fig 9 p10 p12 however this fluctuation at the pressure peaks does not occur at the front seawall but takes place at points p11 p12 on the leeward seawall for type 3 fig 10 p11 p12 because the solitary wave straightforwardly overtops the seawall and breaks behind the seawall there is a negative pressure at p1 for type 1 and 2 at t 10s which confirms the mentioned wave trough after reflection wave in section 4 2 for type 3 the dynamic pressure curves at the leeward seawall fig 10 p11 p12 have a sub atmosphere pressure after the main overtopping peak which is predicted well by both models as mentioned by bullock et al 2007 and hsiao and lin 2010 this phenomenon is caused by the high aeration where air is entrapped by the overtopped water and interacts with the water for a long time but both models fail to predict the sub atmosphere pressure before the pressure peaks which may be the result of the entrapped air compressed by the overtopped water before the overtopping water collapses on the backward seawall because the air compressibility is ignored in our model a comparison of the dynamic wave pressure peaks of type 1 2 and 3 indicates that the dynamic wave force could increase when the freeboard decreases to some extent it is noted that the time history curve of dynamic wave pressure has a similar upward and downward trend to that of the free surface deformation 4 4 dynamic force the dynamic wave forces per unit width on the seaward and leeward side are calculated by integrating the simulated dynamic pressure distribution along the seawall surface where the resolution is dx dy 0 5 cm 0 1 cm figs 11 13 give the calculated vertical and horizontal wave forces separately acting on the seaward and leeward side of the seawall compared with the experimental results by hsiao and lin 2010 and the numerical results by luo et al 2019 the positive directions of the vertical and horizontal wave force are downward and onshore in our model but we only show the absolute force in the figures for a good comparison since the force direction is easy to be recognized obviously the dynamic forces on the seaward side predicted by two numerical models agree well with the experimental results by hsiao and lin 2010 while forces on the leeward side have little discrepancies with the experimental data particularly there is a small phase advance of the wave force peak on the leeward side for the cases of type 3 where a considerable air entrainment occurs and the vortex propagates up and down along the slope as described by hsiao and lin 2010 the discrepancies may be brought on by lack of air compressibility in the simulation or absence of the turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation equations in the simulation of a highly turbulent fluid flow as we mentioned in section 4 3 there are some oscillations of the wave pressure in the region where the wave breaking occurs consequently these oscillations are observed around the wave force peaks for the cases of type 1 and 2 in addition for the case of leeward side in type 2 forces calculated by our model shows better agreement with the experiment data than that of luo et al 2019 5 further discussion the seawall model studied by hsiao and lin 2010 is a kind of low crest levee which is usually constructed when partial protection from waves is required landward of the levee these levees are more economical yet the leeside slope of the low crest levee would suffer from erosion induced by overtopping and overflow when storm or typhoon happen previous design for allowable overtopping considers only the average overtopping magnitude and does not recognize the role of erosion recently more attentions have been paid by engineers and researchers to the erodibility against wave overtopping of leeside slopes luo et al 2019 studied the influence of the seaward seawall slope on the volume and kinetic energy of overtopping wave and gave a practical way to estimate the intensity of a real tsunami there have been few studies on the relationship between the leeside levee slope geometry and solitary wave overtopping the hydraulic stability and erosion of the levee are among the most important factors in designing the low crest levee for survival during a particular storm in this section we further investigate hydraulic stability vorticity evolution and erosional potential for various seawall sections in terms of the leeside slope and wave parameters using a series of numerical experiments with the validated numerical model we choose the same cases as those in hsiao and lin 2010 i e ε 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 for the variations of wave nonlinearity and h0 0 20 0 22 0 256m for the variations of water level resulting in 12 groups in total in addition to these wave parameters the seawall section is changed by varying its leeside slope from 1 1 5 1 3 according to the eurotop manual by van der meer et al 2018 as shown in fig 14 the coordinates x1 y1 x2 y2 and x3 y3 are fixed and x4 y4 shifts along the red dash line to get the slopes of s1 1 1 5 s0 1 1 8 the cases presented in section 3 and 4 s2 1 2 and s3 1 3 the hydrodynamic characteristics of the overtopping wave in the 48 cases are investigated the cases are numbered according to the following rule that the first number represents the water case number the second number stands for the wave nonlinearity number and the third number is for the leeside seawall slope ratio number for example case number t110 means the water depth d is 0 2m the wave nonlinearity ε is 0 1 and the leeside seawall slope ratio is 1 1 8 5 1 influence of wave parameters and seawall section on stability in hsiao and lin 2010 the seawall is rigidly mounted on the slope and silicone is filled with the borders between the seawall and slope to prevent fluid infiltration therefore there is no water pressure on the bottom of the seawall in this experiment and thus uplift wave force and moment should not be considered in the analysis although this waterproof technology may function in theoretical and laboratory model tests it is necessary for the seawall design process to consider the cost effectiveness and construction process in which a guarantee of perfect waterproof in service period may be difficult besides the effect of wave impinging and scour might induce fatigue damage on the connection between the seawall and the slope during service period which could cause water infiltration and wave pressure on the bottom of the seawall in view of the forgoing reason the uplift force should be considered in the stability analysis of the seawall under limiting operating condition the uplift wave force and moment at the leeward heel is considered separately in the total wave force and moment according to the professional standard of code of hydrology for harbour and waterway chsh jts 145 2015 ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2015 and yuan and tao 2003 the wave pressure distribution on the bottom of the seawall could be assumed to be linear the total uplift wave force acting on the bottom can be calculated with the following formula 20 f uplift 0 5 p lb p rb b where p lb and p rb represent the wave pressure at the seaward bottom corner and leeward bottom corner of the seawall respectively see fig 15 and b is the distance of the two bottom corners the total uplift wave moment at the leeward heel can be calculated with the following formula 21 m uplift f uplift d where d is the distance between action point of the total uplift force and the leeward bottom corner of the seawall which can be calculated by the formula 22 d 1 3 b 2 p lb p rb p lb p rb the wave force f wave is calculated by summing the numerical wave moment acting on the seaward crown and leeward sides of the seawall and the wave moment m wave is calculated by summing the numerical wave moment acting on the seaward crown and leeward sides of the seawall at the leeward heel of the seawall the clockwise direction of the wave moment is defined as positive in this study the stability condition against overturning may be given by 23 γ q m w m uplift m g m inner where the m uplift is zero when the uplift force is not considered and m inner is the inner force between the connection of the seawall and bottom slope and is zero when the uplift force is considered and γq is the load partial coefficient of the limit state design being set at 1 3 according to design and construction code for gravity quay jts 167 2 2009 ministry of transport of the people s republic of china 2009 thus the formula to calculate the safety factor of overturning k r according to eq 23 is 24 k r m g m inner m w m uplift γ q the formula to calculate the safety factor of sliding k s is 25 k s k f z g cos θ f x sin θ f x cos θ f z g sin θ where g is the gravity of the seawall calculated by the formula of g ρgv with ρ 250 kg m3 f x and f z are the wave forces on the horizontal and vertical direction with the positive direction being upward and rightward θis the bottom slope angle and k is the friction coefficient being set at 0 6 according to yuan and tao 2003 for the conditions considering the uplift wave force the total vertical force f z is given by 26 f z f wave z f uplift where the positive direction of f uplift and f z is upward and the positive direction of f wavez is downward 5 1 1 influence of wave parameters and seawall sections on the overturning stability 1 without considering the uplift wave moment fig 16 summarizes the calculated wave moment at the leeward heel on the seawall versus time for the above different cases the gravity moment at the heel is also drawn in the figures we can see that the wave moment is negative for all the cases if the uplift wave moment is not considered in the calculation of overturning stability which means the wave moment is beneficial for the seawall stability rather than overturns it therefore the seawall stability is satisfied as long as there is no uplift wave force on the bottom meaning that the material of seawall and slope is impermeable for the wave parameters influence it is obvious that the absolute maximum value of wave moment rises gradually and the impact duration increases gently with the wave nonlinearity and water depth it should be noted that larger wave moment means that the safety of overturning is increased because negative wave moment will improve anti overturning stability which is different with the basic law that larger wave and higher water levels bring greater threats to the coastal seawall in the view of overtopping volume this unique characteristic belonging to solitary waves may be related with its unique waveform with a tremendous amount of water above the surface and without a trough the maximum wave moment can be used to estimate the solitary intensity but it is also of great importance to study the cumulative energy of the solitary wave which may be useful for the analysis of fatigue damage to learn more about the intensity and energy of the wave moment on the seawall during the wave structure interaction we calculate the impulsive wave moment l which is given by 27 l m t the results of impulsive wave moment l are presented in fig 17 as we mentioned before the water depth has more influence than the leeside slope ratio on the impulsive wave moment it means that decreaing the crest level of the seawall is more effective than alleviating the leeside slope steepness in improving the safety ananist overturning however decreasing the crest level of the seawall may deducing the increase of the overtopping volume luo et al 2019 which may causes greater threats to the leeward area thus there may exist a certain crest level of the seawall to balance the overturning stability and overtopping volume for each wave scenatio and seawall section the impulsive wave moment l is normalized by the impulsive wave moment of s0 as shown in fig 18 generally a more gentle slope bears more impulsive wave moment and hence enhance the overturning stability with a range of 20 the three water groups and four wave nonlinearity factors have almost same changing rate of the impulsive wave moment over leeside slope ratio which means that the influence of the leeside slope ratio on the overturing stibility is not affected by the wave parameters the impulsive wave moment is increased by around 8 and 15 respectively when the leeside slope increases from 1 1 5 s1 to 1 2 0 s2 and 1 2 0 s2 to 1 3 0 s3 this may have a relation to the bottom slope and means that a more gentle leeside slope will significantly enhance the overturning stability where an extreme case steepness of 1 is never going to overturn 2 with considering the uplift wave moment fig 19 shows the wave moment on the seawall versus time considering uplift wave moment two phenomena can be observed 1 for all cases the wave moment has two peaks with a lager positive clockwise and a smaller negative anticlockwise one for ε 0 1 it should be noted that the negative wave moment only means that the wave moment is beneficial for the stability against overturning and the values may be incorrect since the relative overturning point has been changed to the seaward heel of the seawall 2 for group 3 with the zero freeboard the wave moment has two positive peaks and one negative peak and the second positive peak is higher than the first for the cases of ε 0 2 0 3 this may be related with the complex vortex evolution behavior behind the seawall and the corresponding dynamic wave pressure response on the leeward side in the process of the overtopping water interacting with the leeward seawall for the water depth of h 0 0 256m the first positive and negative peak of the wave moment increases as wave nonlinearity increases while for the water depth of h 0 0 20 and 0 22m the first spike increases as wave nonlinearity increases for the cases of ε 0 3 and maintain almost the same value for the cases of ε 0 3 as reported by chella et al 2017 who studied breaking solitary wave force on a vertical cylinder on a slope the forces on the cylinder rise slowly with longer duration for smaller solitary waves we could also conclude that the impact duration decreases slightly and wave force moment peak increases as the wave nonlinearity increases in the same water depth for the same wave nonlinearity the first positive peak of wave moment decreases slightly as water level increases which is evident for the cases of ε 0 2 and h 0 0 256m the plausible reason may be that the first positive peak is produced during the solitary wave approaching to the seaward side of the seawall and the contact surface of the solitary wave front with the seawall decreases as the water level increases or the freeboard decreases therefore the total wave moment acting on the seawall at h 0 0 20m is larger than the corresponding non breaking wave moment at h 0 0 256m this suggests that the overturning risks due to larger water depth rise slowly for longer duration with larger wave moment impulsive in contrast the first negative peak of wave moment gets the biggest at the highest water level of h 0 0 256m the reason is because that the first negative peak occurs after the solitary wave overtops the crown and falls down on the leeward side of the seawall and that the velocity and mass of the overtopped water increases with the water level increases also suction process of the water on the seaward side retreating offshore composes another portion of the negative wave moment according to eq 23 the safety factor of overturning k r with considering the uplift wave moment is 28 k r m g m w m uplift γ q this kind of safety factor may provide a direct and practical way to analyze the potential overturning risk of these structure for designers since wave moment varying with time the safety factor of overturning is a function of time k r t the minimum k r in a certain case means the most dangerous circumstance so we use the minimum k r of each case to analyze the minimum overturning safety of the seawall that it can be assured fig 20 gives the minimum value of k r for the studied wave scenarios and seawall sections generally a more gentle leeside slope bring more safety of overturning because both the gravity of the seawall and the vertical wave force acting on the seawall increases since the projected area in horizontal becomes larger for the cases of wave nonlinearity ε 0 1 and 0 2 t11 t12 t21 t22 t31 t32 all the minimum safety factors k r are bigger than 1 5 which can be recognized as satisfy the design safety requirements with γq 1 3 notably for the cases of larger wave nonlinearity ε 0 3 and 0 4 and steeper leeside slope ratio ss1 and s0 t131 t141 t40 t231 t241 the minimum safety factors k r are smaller than γq 1 3 indicating that the overturning safety may be challenged when the solitary wave height is large notably although the wave forces increase with the water level increases hsiao and lin 2010 which means the wave attack is significant during the high water level the wave moment is not always larger when the water level is higher suggesting that the overturning risk under the extreme water level may be less significant than the other water levels the possible reason may be that there is a phase shift between the maximum total horizontal wave force and the vertical force which is also concluded from a series of numerical computations of wave forces acting on submerged alternately submerged and emerged conditions of the semicircular breakwater by yuan and tao 2003 therefore a certain combination of the water level and the solitary wave shape causes the maximum wave moment as the same method as figs 17 18 without considering unlift wave moment the impulsive wave moment l and normalized value by the impulsive wave moment of s0 are shown in figs 21 22 for each wave scenatio and seawall section to be noted here all the values of l are positive that means wave moment is detrimental to the overturning stability thus larger value means more wave overturning energy and less safety in the overturning same with the cases without considering unlift wave moment in fig 17 impulsive wave moment of group 2 is always larger than group 1 which means increasing crest level of the seawall could effectively improve the overturning stability yet a little difference is that the crest level has not so much more influence than the leeside slope ratio where case slope s3 of group 1 has the same l value with case slope s1 of group 2 another difference is that more gentle leeside slope has more wave moment impulsive energy which may causes greater threats to the seawall generally in the view of impulsive wave moment steeper leeside slope and higher crest level of seawall could reduce wave moment energy special occasion occurs in the case of t34 which has almost the smallest value of all the cases indicating that the impulsive wave moment in the circumstance of higher water depth and strong wave nonlinearity is much less disruptive to the seawall the rational explanation is that the zero freeboad and large wave height induces much water overtopping leeward so that the wave moment on the leeside slope is larger than the seaside slope as shown in fig 19 group3 red line where the negative dynamic wave moment is larger than the positive value fig 22 has a similar trend with fig 18 that is a more gentle slope bears less impulsive moment energy and hence reduce the overturning risk by a range limit of 40 group 3 from s1 to s3 for the studied slope ratios nonetheless the impulsive moment for group 1 group 2 and group 3 is reduced by around 25 30 and 40 respectively when the leeside slope decreases from s1 1 1 5 to s3 1 3 indicating that the influence of the slope ratio on impulsive moment under higher water level is more effective than that of lower water level the above foundings on the wave moment provide a guidance in the design of the seawall section and the safety estimation of the seawall 5 1 2 influence of wave parameters and seawall sections on sliding stability to analyze the stability against sliding the wave forces on the seawall needs to be thoroughly understood in the following the temporal variations of computed horizontal wave force vertical wave force and uplift wave force are demonstrated with an example for the convenience of demonstration cases with leeside slope of s0 and wave nonlinearity of 0 2 for three water groups in table 3 are selected as the example fig 23 shows the variations of the horizontal and vertical wave forces and the uplift wave force it can be seen that there are phase differences between the horizontal and vertical wave force meaning that the force peak cannot be reached at the same time although the phase lag is little for this experimental case and may not have significant influence on the results notably the vertical wave force without uplift wave force is negative which means that the stability against sliding is much better than the circumstance without wave therefore there is no need to check the sliding stability as long as it is stable in calm water hereafter in this section the sliding stability is analyzed considering the uplift wave force the maximum total horizontal wave force f xmax and the maximum vertical wave force f zmax without considering wave uplift force simulated by the numerical model for all cases are systematically summarized in figs 24 25 respectively evidently the horizontal wave force is far much smaller than the vertical force with a percentage of around 20 due to smaller projected area of the seawall in the horizontal direction which once again testifies that the sliding stability is satisfied the water depth and wave nonlinearity have significant influence on the wave forces while the effect of leeside slope ratio on the maximum wave forces is little in comparison the horizontal wave force is increased by 80 and 20 when the water depth increases from group 1 0 20m to group2 0 22m and from group 2 0 22m to group3 0 256m for cases t13 t23 and t33 this implies that as the water depth getting higher increasing the crest level of the seawall in a small certain range may be less effective in reducing the wave force as described in front section of 5 1 the safety factor of sliding k s is primarily influenced by the horizontal f x and vertical f z wave forces traditionally the f xmax and vertical f zmax which are calculated by an empirical formula are utilized simultaneously in the formula since there is a phase difference in the maximum value of f x and f z the coupled wave force of f x and f z are used in the formula of eq 25 here the vertical f z includes the uplift wave force similar with the safety factor of k r the minimum value of k s t are selected to represent the sliding stability of the seawall along the bottom slope as shown in fig 26 as we can see all the k s are bigger than 1 0 indicating that the sliding stability is satisfied the most dangerous circumstance occurs at case t243 group 2 ε 0 4 s3 and t342 group 3 ε 0 4 s2 the k s for cases of higher water depth are always smaller than cases of lower water depth which reveals that increasing crest level will reduce the sliding risk for the reason that the horizonal wave force decreases accordingly another phenomenon is that the k s increases slightly with the leeside slope getting decreased primarily because the gentle slope makes the gravity of the seawall and the vertical force increase slightly this means that decreasing the leeside slope is less effective than the measure of increasing crest level of seawall to enhance the sliding stability as same consideration as the impulsive wave moment in section 5 1 1 to learn more about the energy of the wave force on the seawall impulse of horizontal wave force is calculated by the given formula 29 i x f x t since the horizontal wave force is primarily positive for solitary waves which is harmful to the sliding stability herein we only analyze the impulse of horizontal wave force in positive direction and the results are demonstrated in fig 27 interestingly the impulse of wave force increases 10 50 as the water depth increases from group 1 to group 2 while in contrast it decreases 16 20 as the water depth increases from group 2 to group 3 this means that a certain combination of water depth and crest level of the seawall will deduce the largest wave overtopping momentum with serious destructive power which will definitely provide useful guidance to the seawall crest design in all the wave scenarios the leeside slope has little influence on the impulse of wave force fig 28 gives the normalized impulse of horizontal wave force by the impulse of wave force of s0 for each wave scenarios and leeside slopes for better comparison fig 28 also demonstrates that the effect of leeside slope on the impulse of wave force is very little with a range of 2 and the maximum value occurs at s0 for almost all cases and s3 for weak wave nonlinearity of higher water depth thus in terms of minimizing the impulse of wave force leeside slope of s1 or s2 may be a better choice 5 2 vorticity and pressure evolution fig 29 presents the vorticity evolution behind the seawall calculated by numerical model for the case of h 0 0 256m ε 0 4 obviously as the wave overtops the seawall and collapses on the slope with a significant velocity considerable air is entrapped and a clockwise vortex is generated around the bottom corner of the seawall at t 7 0s the entrapped air is carried up to the crown along with the upstream flow of the vortex and then is separated into two parts by the vortex rotation at t 7 05 7 1s where the vorticity is large after that the right part of the entrapped air propagates downstream through the advection and diffusion induced by the vortex at t 7 1 7 35s whereas the left part is convected upstream and rolls up into small counterclockwise vortices at t 7 15 7 25s then stretched downstream by the upper overtopping flow at t 7 25 7 35s the intensity of the vorticity is of orders of o 70 to 10 s implying that cavitation may occur on the surface of the leeward seawall as reported by hsiao and lin 2010 additionally a flow jet splashed by the overland flow is observed near x 11 3 m at t 7 2s and the front gets steeper and develops into vertical with the decreasing water depth from x 11 3m to x 11 5 m at t 7 2 7 3s eventually the water jet begins to collapse and impacts on the water surface at t 7 3 7 35s the corresponding wave pressure response at breaking and post breaking for this case is also demonstrated in fig 30 at t 7 0s the overtopped plunging jet entrapped with considerable air concentrates on the slope behind the seawall and forms huge pressure with the value up to 2600pa almost triple hydrostatic pressure the pressure distribution around the breaking position shows in arc shape and the downward sides are stretched downstream as the overtopped wave propagates on the slope the huge impact pressure gets to slacken till under 800pa at t 7 05 7 3s meanwhile as the entrapped air is entrained downstream by the vortex the huge impact pressure zone is also pushed slowly downstream by the entrapped air from x 11 08m to x 11 14 m at t 7 05 7 3s eventually the entrapped air overtakes the huge impact pressure zone at t 7 35s note that the pressure of the vortex zone is still higher than the surroundings at t 7 35s where the vortex zone could be recognized in fig 29 at t 7 35s implying that the pressure fields after breaking are of intense oscillation with the existence of the vortex 5 3 erosional potential analysis as we mentioned in the former part of this section present guidance for allowable overtopping levees considers primarily the average overtopping volume luo et al 2019 and does not recognize the role of duration although the prime interest may be in designing the levee for survival during an extreme storm there is also interest in the erosional potential during storms that will cause great damage to represent the level of levee erosion hazard dean et al 2010 develops acceptable equivalences of cumulative combinations of wave overtopping velocity and duration for landward levees with grass cover to define the potential land side levee erosion which includes three indices 1 velocity index 2 shear stress index and 3 work index here we utilize the velocity index as an example to evaluate the potential erosion assuming that the landward side of the levee is covered by good grass in dean et al 2010 the acceptable erosion e u due to an excess velocity over the critical value u c u is given by 30 e u k u u m i u c u t i u m i u c u where u m i and t i are the measured velocities and time duration and e u k u are unknown coefficients the critical velocity u c u is also an unknown eq 30 can be written as 31 e u k u u m i u c u t i u m i u c u where the two unknowns are now e u k u and the critical velocity u c u applying the method of least squares for the case of plain grass good cover based on experimental data dean et al 2010 found u c u 1 93 m s and e u k u 22 1 103 m because the coefficients of e u k u and u c u are determined on the basis of prototype test data scale conversion is needed for the evaluation of cases in this numerical model we assume the length scale λl is 30 and velocity scale λt is 301 2 following the gravity similarity criterion therefore u c u 0 35 m s and e u k u 7 36 102 m is used as the threshold value to estimate the potential erosion of the landward side of the seawall in this model the cumulative of e u k u for one single solitary wave marked as t e u k u are calculated in our numerical model two sets of wave nonlinearity for three groups and four leeside slopes have been presented illustrating application of the methodology in fig 31 generally the cumulative erosional units increase with the wave nonlinearity and water depth much more erosion occurs in larger area if the wave height and water depth is higher the position of large cumulative erosion units moves toward to the leeward slope of the seawall which coincides with the characteristics of overtopping flow on the leeward slope erosion usually starts from one weak point on the slope surface and develops in to a large hole rapidly to measure the erosional intensity of the most possible erosional position on the slope we pick out the maximum of cumulative erosional velocity units of the landward side of the seawall as shown in fig 32 evidently the water depth has the most significant impact on the maximum cumulative erosional units and wave nonlinearity is the second important influencing factor which means storm surge with high level combining large wave will induce serious erosion on the leeward slope the maximum cumulative erosional units are affected weakly by the slope ratio where it increases slightly with the slope ratio decreasing for most cases to be mentioned here although the maximum cumulative erosional units of steep leeward slop s1 s0 is comparative with gentle leeward slope s3 the erosion may not occur on the leeward side of the seawall because the overtopping flow may directly impact on the leeward bottom slope as shown in fig 31 though the cumulative erosional velocity units are more intense in gentle slopes the direct erosion of the slope is only one possible failure mechanism a major failure mechanism on steep leeward slope 1 1 5 is slip failure which may lead directly to a breach the above cumulative erosional units are based on one solitary wave overtopping process with the values of 0 2 1 9m in table 4 which is far less than the erosion limit in reality the storm surge and large waves may last a long time therefore we calculate the maximum duration before the erosion limit is reached assuming a series of solitary waves acting on the seawall the procedure is as following 1 calculate the number of solitary waves n that is needed to reach the erosion limit 2 calculate the represent wave period of the solitary wave t 3 calculate the duration to reach the erosion limit in experimental model scale t n t 4 calculate the duration to reach the erosion limit in prototype scale and change the time using a unit in hours t n t λt 3600 the pressures and results are listed in table 4 from table 4 we can see that the duration of erosion limit varies large with different wave scenarios and little with leeside slopes expect for the cases of t12 for the combination of low water depth and weak wave nonlinearity ε 0 2 the duration decreases rapidly with the water depth increasing in contrast for the combination of low water depth and strong wave nonlinearity ε 0 4 the duration decreases slowly with the water depth increasing while decreases rapidly when the water level is high combing the local design wave climate this method could be used to estimate the erosion potential of the leeside slope and thus provide a reference in the seawall design 6 conclusions the aim of this work is to demonstrate the capability of a cip based solver to accurately reproduce solitary wave impinging and overtopping on a complex shaped bottom the interactions of solitary waves with an emerged structure composed by a trapezoidal seawall on a 1 20 slope have been simulated showing that the model is able to represent some important features of wave structure interaction related to breaking and overtopping such as violent free surface deformation and vortex evolution quantitative comparisons of the free surface elevation dynamic pressure and force with the results of hsiao and lin 2010 suggest that the flow dynamics is well described even if the turbulence model is not included in this model further a series of numerical simulations are performed to investigate the influence of the wave parameters water depth and wave nonlinearity and leeward slope ratio of the seawall on hydrodynamic stability and erosional potential based on the experiment model of hsiao and lin 2010 the wave forces wave moment and impulse of wave force and wave moment acting on the seawall are thoroughly analyzed from the aspects of with and without consideration of wave uplift force and moment to get a clear knowledge about the hydrodynamic stability erosional index is utilized to measure the erosion potential and duration of erosion limit are calculated to estimate the erosion resistance of the seawall we observe that the wave moment acts slightly differently with the wave force behavior 1 the conditions without consideration of the uplift wave force and moment is more stable than that with consideration of these 2 wave moment does not always increase with the water level increasing indicating that a certain combination of the water level and the solitary wave shape causes the maximum wave moment impulsive moment is less with a more gentle leeward slope and the overturning risk becomes low 3 the most dangerous circumstance occurs at case t243 group 2 ε 0 4 s3 and t342 group 3 ε 0 4 s2 implying that increasing crest level the will enhance the sliding stability impulse of wave force is affected significantly by water depth and wave nonlinearity and reach the highest in cases of middle water depth and strong wave nonlinearity which means the most destructive wave momentum does not occur in the highest water depth 4 the position of large cumulative erosion units moves toward to the leeward slope of the seawall as the leeward slope of the seawall decreasing and the maximum of cumulative erosional velocity unit is significantly influenced by the water depth and wave nonlinearity 5 the duration of erosion limit varies large in the combination of low water depth and weak wave nonlinearity and combination of high water level and strong wave nonlinearity and varies little with leeside slopes expect for the cases of t12 additionally the vortex and pressure evolution of one representative dangerous case is numerically simulated it implies that both the vortex rotation combined with entrapped air and pressure concentration due to the overtopping are intense and could be the cause of cavitations behind the seawall although the cases have been simplified the characteristics of the hydrodynamic stability including sliding and overturning stability and erosion potential could be useful in the assessment of potential destructive damage and design of the coastal structures exposed to storm surge or

21294,this paper presents a probabilistic framework for the assessment of ship survivability following bottom grounding and side grounding contact accidents with specific attention to passenger ships the proposed framework provides attained subdivision indices for each type of accident for harmonization reasons and to leverage on the experience of present designers the proposed approach is consistent with existing solas probabilistic regulations for damaged ship survivability assessment following a collision in the presented framework the probability of flooding a group of compartment s i e the so called p factor associated to each damage case is determined using an automatic flexible and easily updatable non zonal approach based on monte carlo generation of hull breaches according to the underlying geometrical and probabilistic models of damage the conditional ship survivability metric is assumed to be provided by the solas s factor results from three example applications are reported and discussed the information provided in the paper are at a level of detail allowing the implementation of the proposed approach the obtained results indicate the potential practical applicability of the proposed approach and the benefits of considering different types of damage for a safety oriented design and for a proper assessment of stability related risk control options keywords damage stability grounding contact non zonal approach passenger ships solas 1 introduction present solas damage stability regulations for passenger and dry cargo vessels address ship survivability following a flooding due to collision accidents in a probabilistic framework see chapter ii 1 in solas imo 2019a the essence of the approach in present solas dates back to the work of wendel 1960 1961 1968 with subsequent main regulatory evolutions which can be identified in a 265 viii for passenger ships imco 1973 and in solas 90 for cargo vessels imo 1990 present solas originally entered into force as the so called solas2009 imo 2006 with recent amendments leading to the so called solas2020 imo 2017a the original background research and development work regarding models of distributions of collision damage characteristics to be embedded in solas regulations was carried out within the harder project lützen 2001 2002 imo 2002a 2003a papanikolaou and eliopoulou 2008 subsequent discussion took place at the international maritime organization imo imo 2005 which led to some modifications of the original harder proposal and eventually to the final version of solas2009 probabilistic damage stability regulations imo 2006 a statistical re analysis of collision accidents data was also presented by bulian and francescutto 2005 who discussed on the obtained results in view of those obtained by the harder project the solas probabilistic framework considers only collision accident damages occurring to the side of the vessel however the safety of the ship can be jeopardized also by accidents due to grounding or contact with breaches occurring to the bottom or to the side of the vessel this is particularly true when speaking of passenger vessels for which the risk to be accounted for is the potential loss of life papanikolaou et al 2004 emsa 2008 mcib 2013 zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 in the framework of present solas ship protection with respect to bottom grounding damages is governed by regulation solas ii 1 b 2 9 which provides requirements concerning the minimum height of double bottom as well as alternative equivalent deterministic damage stability requirements in case of vessels featuring so called unusual double bottom arrangements also the original background of solas ii 1 b 2 9 can be traced back to the statistical analysis of accidents data collected within the harder project imo 2004a a further analysis regarding the effectiveness of solas double bottom requirements was carried out in the framework of the goalds project using an updated database of accidents data imo 2012 papanikolaou et al 2011 there is therefore an evident dichotomy in present solas framework where survivability in case of collision is addressed through a more advanced probabilistic approach with some additional deterministic requirements whereas the protection with respect to grounding is addressed by means of deterministic provisions in addition to this present regulation solas ii 1 b 2 9 only deals with grounding damages occurring to the bottom of the vessel therefore the solas framework does not address side damages due to accidents other than collision it is however interesting to note that a particular type of side damages due to grounding i e raking damages is considered by the imo hsc code imo 2019b although this is done in a deterministic framework furthermore additional deterministic so called minor damage requirements are also present in solas regulation solas ii 1 b 1 8 these deterministic requirements have been included on top of the probabilistic regulations for passenger ships to avoid ships being designed with what might be perceived as unacceptably vulnerable spots in some part of their length imo 2008 2017b the discussion at imo on the introduction of minor damage requirements can be traced back to slf 42 and even before imo 1998 and it continued within the relevant slf agenda item until basically slf 47 when the text of solas ii 1 b 1 8 was essentially finalised imo 2004b according to imo 1998 minor damage requirements have been introduced in order to replicate a sort of two compartment standard requirement for passenger ships carrying a large number of persons from a regulatory perspective the present situation regarding the solas framework is therefore associated with two evident shortcomings first the present solas damage stability regulatory framework is not harmonised as probabilistic and deterministic requirements are applied alongside and the application of deterministic approaches cannot be considered in line with present best practice in rule development and risk assessment second the present solas probabilistic damage stability regulations do not account for damages due to accidents other than collision despite historical data zaraphonitis et al 2015 indicate that such accidents represent a hazard that should be more properly accounted for this has also a consequence directly related to the design of vessels and in particular passenger vessels as this is the focus of the present paper in fact presently designers do not have at their disposal a common rational probabilistic framework for assessing the effectiveness of stability related risk control options aimed at protecting the vessel from bottom and side damages not related to collision accidents the consequence of this situation is that the ship subdivision layout and possible design modifications are governed and assessed by the ship response to collision accidents whereas the performance of the vessel in case of different types of accident is not explicitly considered since the characteristics of damages are different depending on the type of accident the assessment of different subdivision layouts considering only collision damages may lead to a partial at best or misleading at worst assessment of design alternatives research and development work aimed at filling the identified gaps was carried out in the framework of the emsa 3 project see zaraphonitis et al 2015 and bulian et al 2016 more recently the activities within the esafe joint industry project have further developed the approaches from emsa 3 with a view towards practical application to cruise ships see zaraphonitis et al 2017 luhmann et al 2018 and bulian et al 2019a the present paper leveraging on the outcomes from the two mentioned projects presents a probabilistic framework for the assessment of ship survivability following bottom grounding and side grounding contact accidents with specific attention to passenger ships the approach presented herein follows and expands the approach reported by bulian et al 2016 which was limited to the case of bottom grounding damages the emphasis of this paper is on the description of the approach and on providing example applications for harmonization reasons and to leverage on the experience of present designers the proposed approach is conceptually consistent with existing solas probabilistic regulations for damaged ship survivability assessment following collision accidents and combines the probability of flooding of each group of compartment s with an associated conditional ship survivability metric differently from solas which is based on a zonal approach lützen 2001 2002 pawłowski 2004 in the framework presented herein the probability of flooding a group of compartment s i e the so called p factor associated to each damage case is determined using an automatic flexible and easily updatable non zonal approach based on monte carlo generation of hull breaches according to the underlying geometrical and probabilistic models of damage zaraphonitis et al 2015 2017 bulian et al 2016 2019a luhmann et al 2018 for each damage case the corresponding conditional ship survivability metric is assumed to be provided by the solas s factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 the use of monte carlo approaches for assessing ship performance in case of hull breach is not new and the idea has been used in the past for different purposes in different frameworks in the non zonal approach the monte carlo generation is used with the sole purpose of determining damage cases and their associated probabilities of flooding zaraphonitis et al 2015 2017 bulian et al 2016 2019a luhmann et al 2018 while the conditional survivability metric is determined from the residual static ship stability in damaged condition for each damage case the idea of determining damage cases and associated probability of flooding through monte carlo generation of breaches was used by kehren and krüger 2007 krüger et al 2008 and krüger and dankowski 2009 2019 considering ship performance in terms of damaged ship stability and or oil outflow following marpol zaraphonitis et al 2015 imo 2003b 2019c earlier developments in a similar direction can also be found in the work by tellkamp and cramer 2002 although the assessment of ship performance by tellkamp and cramer 2002 was setup using a breach by breach approach making use of random generation of sea states at the moment of damage and of static equivalent method imo 2002b pawłowski 2004 a similar approach was also used by santos and guedes soares 2005 monte carlo methods based on a breach by breach approach for the assessment of ship performance are actually the typically applied methodology when the ship behaviour in time domain following a hull breach is assessed by more advanced and also more computationally expensive time domain ship motion and flooding simulation tools e g vassalos et al 2008 spanos and papanikolaou 2014 ruponen et al 2019 and atzampos et al 2019 the paper is organised as follows firstly the general approach is described afterwards a description is given of the geometrical and probabilistic models for the considered types of damage implemented in the non zonal approach the paper then focuses on providing and discussing results from three example applications some overall conclusions are finally reported 2 description of the approach for damaged ship survivability assessment the assessment procedure described in the following is aimed at determining relevant attained subdivision indices which can be considered to be representative metrics of ship survivability in damaged condition considering bottom grounding accidents and side grounding contact accidents moreover the assessment is devised to be in line with present solas probabilistic damage stability regulations addressing ship survivability in case of collision accidents imo 2019a the applied methodology is an extension of the approach presented by bulian et al 2016 for the sole case of bottom grounding an attained subdivision index is defined for each type of accident namely a g r b for damages due to bottom grounding accidents and a g r s for damages due to side grounding contact accidents details regarding the characteristics of breaches which are taken into account for the determination of indices a g r b and a g r s are provided hereinafter in section 3 1 and section 3 2 respectively indices a g r b and a g r s are defined to be in line as far as practicable with the procedure outlined in solas for the probabilistic assessment of ship survivability following a side damage due to collision it is noted that although also solas collision accidents result in breaches to the side of the vessel the attained subdivision index a g r s is not to be confused with the solas attained subdivision index for collision because the two indices are associated with different types of accident and the corresponding breaches are therefore associated with different geometrical and probabilistic models accordingly the two indices a g r b and a g r s are to be intended as complementary safety metrics with respect to the attained index determined for the case of collision accidents according to the solas framework three calculation draughts are considered i e the deepest subdivision draught d s the partial subdivision draught d p and the light service draught d l the attained subdivision index for each type of damage is determined using weighting factors for each draught in accordance with solas as follows 1 α j 0 4 a j s 0 4 a j p 0 2 a j l j g r b g r s in equation 1 the index j is used to identify the type of damage with j g r b indicating bottom grounding damages and j g r s indicating side grounding contact damages indices a j s a j p and a j l in 1 are the so called partial indices at the three reference draughts d s d p and d l respectively each partial index is a representative measure of the ship survivability conditional to the occurrence of the corresponding accident type at the specific draught and it is given by the summation of contributions from all damage cases to be taken into consideration 2 a j c i p j i c s i c c s p l j g r b g r s the index i in 2 corresponds to each group of compartment s under consideration the so called damage cases at the considered draught for the considered type of damage the term p j i c is the probability that only the group of compartment s under consideration may be flooded in the event of a damage of the considered type at the considered draught i e p j i c is the probability of occurrence of the damage case under consideration finally s i c is the conditional ship survivability metric associated with the flooding of the group of compartment s under consideration at the specified draught it is noted that the survivability metric s i c does not contain the index j representing the type of damage this is because in the methodology presented herein the conditional survivability metric depends only on the damage case index i and on the considered loading condition index c since the formulation used herein for determining s i c does not depend on the type of damage although in principle the summation in 2 could be considered to extend to all possible combinations of compartments assumed to be flooded in practice as usual it extends only to those combinations associated with non zero probability of occurrence i e to those damage cases for which p j i c 0 in the considered assessment approach the survivability metrics s i c are determined in accordance with the solas s factor which is based on the analysis of the properties of the residual righting lever in flooded condition solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 on the other hand the probabilities of flooding p j i c are determined by means of the non zonal approach the general logic of the non zonal approach in case of bottom grounding was extensively described by bulian et al 2016 and references therein and it is summarised in the following it is also worth underlining that the non zonal approach is in line with the logic of assessment described by kehren and krüger 2007 krüger et al 2008 and krüger and dankowski 2009 2019 in the non zonal approach a sufficiently large number of breaches are generated by a monte carlo procedure on the basis of a specified geometrical and probabilistic model for the damage for each breach the corresponding group of compartment s which become open to the sea directly due to the breach is identified then all breaches leading to the flooding of the same group of compartment s i e to the same damage case are grouped for estimating the p factor p j i c associated with the corresponding damage case in the computation of p factors only generated breaches which actually get in contact with the hull are considered and this guarantees that estimated p factors p j i c are such that i p j i c 1 bulian et al 2016 for a generic h th repetition of the monte carlo procedure the p factor p j i c can therefore be estimated as follows 3 p j i c h n j i c n j c h where n j i c is the number of generated breaches leading to the i th damage case at the c th considered loading condition for the j th type of damage and n j c is the total number of generated breaches getting in contact with the hull at the c th considered loading condition for the j th type of damage in the works of zaraphonitis et al 2015 and bulian et al 2016 for reasons associated with computational time the determination of p factors was carried out only at the deepest subdivision draught and the same damage cases and corresponding p factors were then used in the calculations for the other two calculation draughts in this work that approximation has been abandoned and the generation of breaches with corresponding identification of damage cases along with their associated p factors for each type of damage is carried out separately for each calculation draught according to a full application of the non zonal procedure the non zonal approach leads to the fully automatic determination of damage cases with associated estimated flooding probabilities p j i c and the procedure does not need the preparatory zonification process which is required when using analytical p factors for zonal solas calculations since the outcome from the non zonal approach is affected by sampling uncertainty the number of generated breaches must be large enough to achieve an acceptable convergence of the attained subdivision index and results should be reported with associated confidence intervals this aspect is addressed hereinafter in the section containing the example applications in this work attained subdivision indices associated with different types of accident will be considered separately it is however noted that methods for combining different attained indices into a single summarising safety metric on the basis of either the relative frequency of different types of accident or the relative contribution to risk from different types of accident have been addressed by zaraphonitis et al 2015 2017 vassalos et al 2016 luhmann et al 2018 and bulian et al 2019a 3 modelling of damage in order to apply the described non zonal approach it is first necessary to provide a clearly defined unambiguous geometrical model for each considered damage type this is necessary for a proper geometrical generation of the damage given the corresponding damage characteristics the geometrical model of damage is then to be supplemented by a probabilistic model for the damage characteristics the combination of these two fundamental elements provides a full probabilistic model for each damage type which can be implemented in the non zonal framework herein two types of damage are considered namely bottom damages and side damages the probabilistic model for bottom damages is associated with grounding accidents while the probabilistic model for side damages is associated with grounding and contact accidents 3 1 bottom grounding damages bottom damages considered in this work correspond to damages penetrating the bottom of the vessel in principally vertical direction see fig 1 the geometrical and probabilistic modelling for this type of damage was presented by zaraphonitis et al 2015 and bulian et al 2016 and it is primarily intended for application in case of passenger ships for the sake of completeness the modelling is outlined in appendix a and corresponding bottom damages are conventionally referred to as damages of type b00 appendix b reports summary information regarding the accidents database which was used for the development of the model the naming convention b00 is used to provide a simple and quick way to refer to the used geometrical and probabilistic model with flexibility for possible future modifications the letter b is used to indicate damages with geometrical model of bottom type the index 00 refers to the probabilistic model of damage characteristics future alternatives sharing the same geometrical model but using different probabilistic models for damage characteristics may therefore be conveniently referred to as b01 b02 etc 3 2 side grounding contact damages in this section side damages i e damages penetrating the side of the vessel in principally horizontal direction are considered such type of damages is herein conventionally referred to as type s00 a sketch of this type of damages is shown in fig 2 a detailed geometrical characterisation of the damage followed by a complete description of the probabilistic model for the damage characteristics are reported in the following sections in accordance with the background information from zaraphonitis et al 2015 appendix b reports summary information regarding the accidents database which was used for the development of the model the naming convention s00 follows the same principle described for the case of bottom damages the letter s is used to indicate damages with geometrical model of side type the index 00 refers to the probabilistic model of damage characteristics future alternatives sharing the same geometrical model but using different probabilistic models for damage characteristics may therefore be conveniently referred to as s01 s02 etc 3 2 1 geometrical model of side damage a detailed representation of the damage geometry and of the corresponding defining parameters is shown in figs 3 5 while three dimensional views of an example side damage are shown in fig 6 in providing the geometrical characterisation of damage the ship fixed coordinate system is assumed to be right handed the presented side damage has horizontal penetration the penetration is defined to be orthogonal to the centreplane of the vessel and it is measured inboard along a waterline which is specified by the defining geometrical characteristics of the damage see variable z described hereinafter the damage is intended to be a potential damage meaning that the damage can partially extend outside the vessel furthermore the damage is defined in such a way that it can extend partially above and partially below or totally above or totally below the inner bottom of the vessel in case of side damages the possibility of using a simple box shaped modelling is precluded by the general curved shape of the waterlines combined with the possibly large longitudinal extent of the damage as a result it is necessary to consider a geometrical model which while remaining sufficiently simple for practical applications is able to adapt to the shape of the vessel and which is also representative of the physical phenomenon to be described i e a damage due to a side grounding or contact with reference to figs 3 5 the defining parameters for the damage are the indicator for the side of damage i n d s i d e 1 port side 1 starboard side the longitudinal position of forward end of damage x f m the longitudinal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage length l x p m the transversal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage penetration l y p m the vertical position of lower limit of potential damage z l l p m the vertical extent of potential damage above its lower limit i e the height of potential damage above its lower limit h p m the vertical position of the waterline for the determination of the damage penetration surface z m given the actual values of the geometrical parameters characterising the damage the generation of the solid representing the potential damage can be carried out according to the following procedure at first the damage side of the hull is determined according to the value of the variable i n d s i d e afterwards starting from the hull geometry for each longitudinal position x in the range of damage x f l x p x x f the outermost transversal coordinate of the hull shell y e x t x at a waterline z z is determined at the appropriate side of the vessel then the transversal coordinate y i n t l i m x of the inboard limit of the damage solid is defined as follows 4 y i n t l i m x y e x t x l y p for port side damage i n d s i d e 1 y e x t x l y p for starboard side damage i n d s i d e 1 for x f l x p x x f there are situations where the quantity y e x t x cannot be obtained due to the lack of intersection of the hull at the generic coordinates x and z z this might happen when for instance the damage starts in the very forward or very aft part of the vessel or when the damage extends aft of the aft limit of the vessel at a vertical coordinate z in such cases y e x t x can be conventionally set to y e x t x 0 in doing so however care should be exercised in avoiding spurious fictitious contacts with the hull this can occur for instance in case of long potential damages extending aft of a transom stern in such cases the potential damage can be either longitudinally cut at the extreme end of the vessel at z z or the damage can be extended aft of the aft end of the vessel by fixing y e x t x to a value corresponding to the extreme value at the aftermost available position at a waterline z z in those cases where multiple transversal coordinates of the shell are found at a generic section x and waterline z then y e x t x is set as the outermost maximum for port side damages minimum for starboard damages y coordinate of the shell at section x and waterline at z z for the setting of the vertical coordinate z of the waterline used for the transversal positioning of damage there are in principle different possibilities and the positioning reported in fig 3 is a generic one in the range z l l p z l l p h p in the modelling presented herein it has been decided to set z corresponding to the upper limit of the damage however there are cases where the upper limit of the side damage can extend above the top of the hull which is used for the geometrical generation of the damage in order to handle these cases and assuming the referred upper limit of the hull is identified by the vertical coordinate z t o p the vertical coordinate z is defined as follows 5 z min z l l p h p z t o p 3 2 2 probabilistic model of side damage characteristics similarly to the case of bottom damages see zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 and appendix a the primary interest of this study is to provide a methodology suitable in particular for the survivability assessment of passenger vessels with this objective in mind the probabilistic model presented herein for the geometrical characteristics of side damages has been derived from the statistical analysis zaraphonitis et al 2015 of a database of grounding and contact accidents occurred to passenger and container vessels pagiaziti et al 2015 and by introducing some assumptions concerning the potential occurrence of water ingress zaraphonitis et al 2015 the resulting probabilistic model is eventually intended to describe side damages which can lead to water ingress in addition to grounding accidents contact accidents were also included in the analysis because they are associated with hull breaches at the side of the ship which are of particular interest for the present study regarding the use of combined data from passenger vessels and from container vessels this was on the one hand a necessity dictated by the limited availability of data specific to passenger vessels and on the other hand such merging of data was considered to be acceptable considering the outcomes from the goalds project indeed the analysis of bottom grounding accidents data carried out in the goalds project bulian and francescutto 2011 papanikolaou et al 2011 imo 2012 indicated that passenger and container vessels categorised as non full vessels were sharing similar distributions of damage characteristics and that such distributions were different compared to those observed for full vessels tankers and bulk carriers in the framework of the present study the comparisons between the behaviour of data for passenger vessels and for container vessels in case of side damages due to grounding contact confirmed the outcomes from the goalds project and eventually justified the merging of passenger vessels and container vessels into a single category also in case of side grounding contact damages zaraphonitis et al 2015 as a basis the probabilistic model for damage position and extent was developed from the abovementioned accidents database zaraphonitis et al 2015 however it was realised that damages starting too high above the waterline although present in the accidents database could have led to a breach in the hull without subsequent water ingress or with very low probability of subsequent water ingress it was therefore decided to develop a derived probabilistic modelling of damage characteristics by conditioning to the event of occurrence of water ingress zaraphonitis et al 2015 of course from a theoretical perspective a deterministic limit separating cases with water ingress from cases without water ingress cannot be uniquely identified due to the inherent stochastic nature of environmental conditions and resulting ship motions as well as due to the simplifications involved in the basic modelling however for practical applications it was considered acceptable to assume as a simplification that water ingress can occur only when the lower limit of damage z l l p does not exceed a specified threshold z l l p w i in order to specify a practical value for this threshold reference was made to the stability assessment according to the stockholm agreement imo 1995 in the stockholm agreement accumulation of water due to wave effects is not to be taken into account on the ro ro deck whenever the residual freeboard is larger than a specified value which is taken as 2 m in the framework of stockholm agreement where damages are considered to be due to collision and they are therefore assumed to always extend below the waterline the 2 m residual freeboard threshold applies to the ship after flooding of the damaged compartments without accounting for water possibly accumulated on the ro ro deck however in the present context the issue of whether water ingress may occur or not applies to damages due to grounding contact extending entirely above the waterline as result the 2 m distance specified by the stockholm agreement has been assumed to be measured from the intact waterline to the lowermost point of damage setting eventually z l l p w i 2 m similarly to the case of bottom grounding damages see zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 and appendix a also in case of side grounding contact damages the probabilistic model represents an equivalent damage such equivalent damage in case of multiple breaches occurring for the same accident is meant to represent the envelope of the group of individual breaches and not the extent of each single breach bearing in mind the overall complexity of the problem such approach is considered to be an acceptable equivalent simplification for the determination of the probability of flooding of different compartments at the same time the approach is considered to be an acceptable equivalent simplification when static ship stability is considered in the development of the probabilistic model of damage characteristics on the basis of available data zaraphonitis et al 2015 some simplifying assumptions are used regarding the statistical dependence of the involved random variables this is done in order to allow the development of a relatively simple model for practical applications and also as a consequence of the limited sample of data which prevents a robust development of more detailed and complex models in particular on the one hand the following damage characteristics are considered to be statistically independent the indicator for the side of damage i n d s i d e the longitudinal position of forward end of damage x f the longitudinal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage length l x p the transversal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage penetration l y p on the other hand the following two random variables are considered to be statistically dependent on each other but statistically independent from the previous ones the vertical position of lower limit of potential damage z l l p the vertical extent of potential damage above its lower limit i e the height of potential damage above its lower limit h p as a result for i n d s i d e x f l x p and l y p it is sufficient to provide the corresponding marginal distributions instead for the variables z l l p and h p it is necessary to provide a modelling of the joint probability density function to this end the modelling is provided by specifying the marginal distribution of z l l p and the conditional distribution of h p given z l l p such a description is indeed sufficient because the joint probability density function of z l l p and h p can be obtained by multiplying the marginal probability density function of z l l p by the conditional probability density function of h p the conditioning to the occurrence of water ingress is directly embedded in the modelling of the marginal distribution of z l l p through the parameter z l l p w i the distributions for the different damage characteristics as obtained from the analysis of the accidents database are reported analytically in tables 1 5 details of the statistical analysis and of the modelling and fitting of the distributions of damage characteristics have been reported by zaraphonitis et al 2015 similarly to the case of bottom damages described in appendix a also in case of side damages it is suggested to set the reference ship length l s h i p in accordance with the international convention on load lines imo 2019d with x m i n and x m a x corresponding to the longitudinal coordinates of aft and forward extremities of l s h i p respectively with reference to the presented models some relevant comments are worth being made as reported in the following it can be noticed that the modelling of the distribution for x f see table 2 and the graphical representation in fig 7 is the same as that used for the same variable in case of bottom damages see table a 1 and fig a 5 bulian et al 2016 and zaraphonitis et al 2015 in fact accidents data indicate that the probabilistic modelling for bottom grounding damages from goalds was able to represent also the distribution of forward end of damage in case of side grounding contact damages zaraphonitis et al 2015 the distribution of the longitudinal extent of potential damage l x p see table 3 and the graphical representation in fig 8 is characterised by the same functional form as that used in case of bottom damages see table a 3 and fig a 7 bulian et al 2016 and zaraphonitis et al 2015 however the characterising parameters are different in particular side damages are characterised by shorter lengths compared to bottom damages this difference could be partly attributed to the fact that the modelling of side damages was based on a database of accidents containing not only groundings as in case of bottom damages but also contacts zaraphonitis et al 2015 the distribution of the potential damage penetration l y p see table 4 and the graphical representation in fig 9 is characterised by a quite simple modelling this is a consequence of the limited availability of accident reports providing quantitative indications regarding the damage penetration which prevented the possibility of developing more advanced models zaraphonitis et al 2015 finally table 5 presents the model for the joint distribution of z l l p and h p and it is important to underline that this joint distribution is provided as a distribution conditional to the occurrence of water ingress event e w i such modelling is more complex in comparison with the models for the other random variables as it embeds the statistical dependence between z l l p and h p therefore it is worth providing some additional explanation first of all the modelling assumes that damages leading to water ingress can have a lower limit z l l p positioned from the ship bottom up to a maximum limit equal to z l l p u l such maximum limit is governed by a combination of two conceptually different limitations firstly the maximum z l l p is limited by the quantity z l l p max which comes directly from the analysis of the accidents database zaraphonitis et al 2015 in particular z l l p max limits z l l p up to 1 4 t where t is the intact ship draught see β 1 ζ in table 5 or up to t 3 2 m see β 2 ζ in table 5 whichever is smaller on top of this limitation the maximum z l l p is also limited by the maximum vertical position specified by the threshold z l l p w i which represents the maximum vertical position of the lowermost damage point above which it has been assumed that there is no water ingress imo 1995 zaraphonitis et al 2015 as described before z l l p w i is assumed to be positioned 2 m above the intact waterline see β 3 ζ in table 5 in principle the parameters z l l p max and z l l p w i could be reduced to a single limitation keeping only the minimum between the parameters β 2 ζ and β 3 ζ however it has been decided to keep them separate in reporting and describing the modelling in order to give an explicit evidence of their different source i e the analysis of the database for z l l p max and the possible occurrence of water ingress e w i based on stockholm agreement for z l l p w i moreover keeping β 2 ζ and β 3 ζ as separate variables makes it also easier to update the model in case different values for β 3 ζ are selected the marginal distribution for z l l p is modelled as uniform within the support 0 z l l p u l see table 5 and fig 10 regarding the vertical extent of potential damage h p it is assumed to be distributed between zero and a maximum vertical extent h p m a x the conditional probability density function of the dimensionless variable h p h p m a x is triangular with maximum at zero because β 1 h in table 5 is equal to 1 3 and the corresponding cumulative distribution is therefore parabolic see table 5 and fig 11 the maximum vertical extent of the potential damage h p m a x is governed by two limitations which have been derived from the analysis of the accidents database zaraphonitis et al 2015 one limitation for h p is an absolute maximum value of 7 5 m see h a m in table 5 in addition the maximum vertical extent of the damage is further limited by requiring that damages cannot vertically extend more than 6 6 m above the intact waterline see h u l in table 5 the result of this combination of two limitations is that h p m a x depends on both the ship draught t and on the vertical position of the lower limit of potential damage z l l p see the definition of h p m a x in table 5 a graphical representation of the support for the distribution of the random vector z l l p h p is shown in fig 12 for different representative values of the ship draught it can be noticed that for sufficiently small values of z l l p h p m a x is fixed at the value h a m then h p m a x starts decreasing when the limitation based on h u l becomes effective which happens for larger values of z l l p i e for damages which have a lower limit high above the ship bottom 4 example applications the developed non zonal approach for bottom grounding and side grounding contact accidents is herein applied to three example cases the first example case is a box shaped barge which is included with the main aim of providing a simple reference case with a set of calculation results to be used for potential comparison benchmarking the second example application is carried out on a realistic large passenger ship with the aim of providing realistic figures of attained subdivision indices for different types of damage in addition the second example also describes a practical approach for dealing with the collapse sequence of a class boundaries finally the third example is carried out on a panamax passenger ship design the third example application aims to explore how the developed approach assesses two design variants with respect to a reference design in each design variant a double hull of different longitudinal extent is introduced to protect the vessel from raking damages while each example application has its own peculiarities as described in the following corresponding sections there are some common aspects in the calculation methodology which for the sake of compactness are reported in this introductory section in all example applications the non zonal approach for bottom grounding damages and side grounding contact damages is applied by randomly generating breaches separately for each calculation draught three calculation draughts are considered in accordance with existing solas as described in section 2 in all cases a total of 10 000 breaches are randomly generated for each calculation draught in accordance with the relevant geometrical and probabilistic model and a total of 20 independent repetitions are carried out for each case partial a indices are then calculated for each draught according to the non zonal approach and the global a index is determined for each repetition according to 1 letting now x h be the generic partial or global attained index for the generic h th repetition the true value of the attained index is estimated by the mean index across n r e p repetitions as follows 6 x 1 n r e p h 1 n r e p x h for the example applications presented hereinafter n r e p 20 in order to reflect the uncertainty in the estimated index due to random sampling the mean index x is reported with an associated confidence interval x l b x u b with bounds depending on a specified confidence level c the lower x l b and upper x u b boundaries of the confidence interval are determined as 7 x u b x t s x n r e p x l b x t s x n r e p where s x is the sample standard deviation for the attained index x across repetitions calculated as 8 s x 1 n r e p 1 h 1 n r e p x h x 2 the factor t is obtained from the inverse of the cumulative student s t distribution indicated as i c d f t in the following with n r e p 1 degrees of freedom d f considering the specified confidence level c i e 9 t i c d f t 1 1 c 2 d f n r e p 1 in the examples reported hereinafter 95 confidence intervals will be considered i e c 0 95 for n r e p 20 it is therefore t 2 093 it is underlined that the same number of breaches for each repetition 10 000 and the same total number of independent repetitions for each case n r e p 20 have been used for all example application cases in order to allow a comparison in terms of width of confidence intervals for the estimated attained indices from the non zonal approach also across different examples moreover the combination 20x10k repetitions has been selected in order to balance two competing objectives reducing the computational time and reducing the width of the confidence intervals for the attained indices estimated by the non zonal approach in fact on the one hand the computational time increases as the number of generated breaches and or the number of repetitions increases on the other hand an increase in the number of generated breaches and or repetitions leads to a reduction in the width of the confidence interval of the attained indices determined from the non zonal approach in addition to non zonal a indices for bottom grounding and for side grounding contact all application examples will report also the collision attained subdivision indices calculated in accordance with solas probabilistic damage stability regulations imo 2019a of course solas attained indices are not associated with random sampling uncertainty as they are determined with the standard zonal approach and they are therefore reported without any confidence interval or equivalently with a zero width confidence interval at the same time it should be recalled that results of standard solas zonal calculations depend in general on the zonification which is used for the analytical calculation of factors p r and v solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 for typical and particularly for complex ship geometries and subdivision layouts the zonification process introduces a certain level of subjective judgement by the designer associated with the positioning of virtual subdivision boundaries in the zonification as a result the resulting a indices from solas zonal calculations are influenced to a certain extent by the selected zonification solas indices are representative of survivability in case of flooding due to collision accidents where the considered vessel is the struck vessel it is important to stress that although solas collision damages correspond to breaches on the side of the vessel the underlying distributions related to damage location and extent are different from those associated with side grounding contact damages presented herein see e g lützen 2001 2002 and the discussion by bulian et al 2019a it is also important to underline that attained indices determined according to solas embed the use of the worst case approach also known as damages of lesser extent in case of presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below waterline solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 as a result the solas attained indices represent a systematically conservative estimation of the indices which could potentially be obtained by removing the worst case approach and implementing any general probabilistic model for the vertical position of the lower limit of damage below the waterline bulian et al 2019a b this limitation of the present solas approach is to be borne in mind when looking at the results reported for the following example applications and solas attained indices reported in the following examples are to be considered only as customary reference design values 4 1 reference calculations for a box shaped barge in this example application a box shaped barge is considered which was also used in previous studies related to bottom grounding bulian et al 2016 the main aim of this example application is to provide a set of reproducible reference data on a simple and fully described geometry which could be potentially used for comparison purposes in case of implementation of the described non zonal approach a detailed description of the considered barge was given by bulian et al 2016 and a summary description is reported herein for the sake of completeness the main characteristics of the barge are reported in table 6 and its layout is shown in fig 13 the loading conditions considered in the calculations are reported in table 7 in all calculations the permeability μ was considered the same for all compartments however two sets of calculations have been carried out assuming two different values of permeability i e μ 0 95 and μ 1 00 it is noted that while a permeability of 95 is more in line with regulatory standards calculations based on an assumed 100 permeability of compartments may represent an easier reference for comparison purposes the s factor has been calculated in accordance with solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 considering only the final stage of flooding no heeling moment was considered in the calculations carried out herein and this was done with the intention of keeping this calculation case as simple as possible it is noted that although the main deck of the reported example barge resembles a ro ro deck calculations of s f i n a l have been carried out herein using standard parameters t g z m a x 0 12 m t r a n g e 16 deg without the special consideration which is given by solas2020 imo 2017a to damage cases involving ro ro spaces in ro ro passenger ships the subdivision length for solas zonal calculations corresponds to the overall length while the length used for non zonal calculations regarding bottom and side damages corresponds to the length between perpendiculars as specified in table 6 each room in the double bottom is associated with an unprotected opening and these openings are indicated by square markers in fig 13 the vertical position of all the openings is 7 5 m from the ship bottom corresponding to 1 5 m above the bulkhead deck for wing compartments in the double bottom openings are transversally positioned at 0 5 m from the relevant ship side whereas openings are transversally positioned at the centreline for central double bottom compartments and for extreme aft and extreme forward double bottom compartments extending from side to side in the longitudinal direction openings are positioned in the middle of the relevant compartments more information are given by bulian et al 2016 as previously stressed in general a indices from zonal calculations depend to a certain extent on arbitrary choices regarding the positioning of virtual subdivision boundaries used in the zonification however for this specific example application this is not really the case because the hull is box shaped as well as all compartments and all compartments have limiting surfaces which are all parallel to xy xz or yz planes it is therefore possible to setup a zonification leading to exact results when using solas analytical formulae for factors p r and v this is achieved by simply and naturally positioning the subdivision boundaries used in the zonification in correspondence to the physical watertight boundaries this is in fact how the zonification was setup for the calculations presented herein for calculations with permeability 95 the obtained a indices are reported in table 8 and graphically in fig 14 for calculations with permeability 100 results are reported in table 9 and fig 15 the reported attained indices as obtained from the non zonal approach correspond to the mean value across the 20x10k repetitions see 6 and each mean attained index is reported together with the associated 95 confidence interval see 7 in order to facilitate the re use of data reported in this section the geometrical model of the barge is provided as supplementary material to the paper see appendix c a direct comparison between the attained indices derived by the non zonal approach and solas might be useful however it should be kept in mind that different types of damage are considered by each approach bottom grounding and side grounding contact are investigated by the non zonal approach while solas results refer to collision incidents having said this some remarks can be derived from such a comparison the non zonal approach for bottom grounding and side grounding contact systematically yields a higher attained index value compared to collisions according to solas starting with a comparison between the bottom grounding attained index and the solas index it must be noted that there are significant differences in the assumed damage geometry as well as in the means of protection against each type of accident bottom groundings are damages penetrating the hull bottom in a vertical direction while solas damages are penetrating in a horizontal direction from the side of the ship for the barge under investigation an inner bottom is fitted at a position corresponding to approximately 40 of the deepest subdivision draft consequently in most bottom grounding cases about 90 the inner bottom is not penetrated and the flooding of the double bottom compartments leads to lower k g values while the reserve of buoyancy is enough to balance the floodwater and to provide also some reserve of stability therefore the high double bottom combined with the available reserve of buoyancy provide effective protection against bottom grounding which is reflected in the obtained high attained index side grounding damages resemble more the collision damages in terms of position and penetration direction but the assumptions regarding the distributions of damage characteristics are significantly different leading to different p factors even in cases where the same compartments are damaged on top of that it should be noted that in case of side grounding the herein adopted procedure accounts for the existence of the double bottom in a consistent way whereas solas adopts the worst case approach resulting in an inherent conservative determination of the attained index in case of collision in this respect bulian et al 2019a b presented quantitative results on the effect of the worst case approach on the attained index in case of collision accidents finally the observed differences between the attained indices for bottom and side groundings are once again mainly attributed to the protection offered by the double bottom in the former case 4 2 example results for a large passenger ship this example application is intended to provide realistic figures of attained subdivision indices for different types of damage in case of a realistic large passenger ship to this end calculations were carried out for a 125000 gt large passenger ship design originally developed within the eu fp7 project floodstand kujanpää and routi 2009 the main characteristics of the ship are reported in table 10 the original floodstand ship model however has been updated for the calculations presented herein in fact the calculation accounting for grounding damages requires a more detailed ship model compared to what is needed when dealing only with collision damages as in solas the reason for this is that in case of grounding damages all up flooding routes need also to be accounted for therefore all vertical connections between the decks such as staircases and lift trunks were modelled as separate rooms allowing both up and down flooding cross flooding ducts were modelled in the double bottom as illustrated in fig 16 overall the buoyant part of the hull extends two deck heights above the bulkhead deck level as shown in fig 16 calculations of the s factor have been carried out in accordance with present solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 taking into account all relevant heeling moments however solas explanatory notes imo 2008 2017b state that the effect of sufficiently strong non watertight boundaries typically a class fire rated structures which are inside watertight compartments should be considered the current practice for this is to calculate all possible combinations of collapsed and intact boundaries this is a very conservative approach and it can also lead to non realistic combinations in addition for passenger ships with dense internal non watertight subdivision the number of combinations can be extremely large which makes the process extremely laborious this is particularly evident for extensive damage cases that involve several watertight compartments as discussed by ruponen and lindroth 2016 ruponen et al 2018 and karolius et al 2019 in case of complex layouts and detailed modelling the approach can even become practically inapplicable due to the too large number of possible combinations and consequent too large computational time in this context the full scale experiments and dedicated fem calculations within the eu fp7 project floodstand demonstrated that typical a class fire rated doors leak significantly and eventually collapse under an effective pressure head of between 1 0 m and 3 5 m depending on the type of the structure jalonen et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable to assume that floodwater progresses through the a class boundaries through doors from this consideration it has been assumed that a simplified approach as illustrated in fig 17 could be used in this approach in each new calculation stage all neighbouring rooms are flooded until all boundaries are breached and the whole compartment is flooded hence the short naming nei approach used herein thus a sequence of intermediate stages representing the flooding progression is calculated instead of dealing with all the alternative combinations of collapsed and intact boundaries it should be noted that the nei approach is not intended as a substitute for direct physics based time domain progressive flooding simulations e g spanos et al 1997 santos and guedes soares 2001 jasionowski 2001 palazzi and de kat 2004 ruponen et al 2007 2019 vassalos et al 2008 schreuder et al 2011 ruponen and lindroth 2016 dankowski and krüger 2013 spanos and papanikolaou 2014 lindroth et al 2018 atzampos et al 2019 gao et al 2019 and see also relevant references in the reviews by bačkalov et al 2016 and by manderbacka et al 2019 nevertheless in practical regulatory calculations the nei approach is believed to provide more realistic results compared to the approach based on the consideration of all combinations of collapsed and intact boundaries and it also allows to significantly reduce the computational time in case of complex ship layouts the loading conditions considered in the calculations are reported in table 11 and the corresponding indices are reported in table 12 with a graphical representation shown in fig 18 also in this case the reported attained indices as obtained from the non zonal approach correspond to the mean value across the 20x10k repetitions see 6 and each mean attained index is reported together with the associated 95 confidence interval see 7 results in table 12 and fig 18 show that for the considered example large passenger ship the attained indices associated with bottom grounding damages are the largest with very limited dependence on the ship draught differences of a indices are of the order of the width of confidence intervals the loss of index in case of bottom grounding is generally due to lack of reserve of buoyancy as a consequence of large damage extents second largest indices are those obtained for side grounding contact damages with a tendency towards an increase of index as the calculation draught increases however it shall be recalled that for the considered loading conditions see table 11 the intact metacentric height increases as the draught increases and this influences the final outcomes the smallest indices are obtained for all draughts from the application of solas differences between solas indices and indices associated with other types of damage are in general a natural consequence of the differences in the underlying damage models this is a very important factor because the underlying damage models govern the probability of occurrence i e the p factor associated with each possible damage case however in addition to this it is also important to remember that as already discussed a direct comparison between solas attained indices and indices obtained from the application of the non zonal approach is unfair and solas attained indices are to be considered only as customary reference design values this is because solas uses the worst case approach to deal with horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 and therefore it systematically underestimates the attained index whereas the non zonal approach consistently accounts for all details of the ship subdivision layout some analyses on the impact of the worst case approach in the evaluation of the attained subdivision index for collision have been reported by bulian et al 2019a b 4 3 assessment of design variants for a panamax passenger ship in this example application a reference design has been considered corresponding to a panamax cruise ship having length of about 240 m breadth of about 32 m deepest subdivision draught of about 7 5 m and addressing solas2020 requirements imo 2017a as is typical in cruise ships the reference design is characterised by the absence of longitudinal bulkheads close to the ship shell and c shaped void spaces are present in the double bottom which help in reducing asymmetric flooding in damaged condition along with the reference design two design variants have been considered which are both aimed at protecting the vessel from side raking damages the first design variant hereinafter indicated as b30 s corresponds to the fitting of a longitudinal bulkhead only in way of machinery spaces at a distance of b 30 from the ship shell it is noted that for side grounding contact damages a penetration of b 30 corresponds to a cumulative distribution of 0 90 see table 4 and fig 9 this value corresponds also to the width of double hull for engine room compartments as suggested by the cruise ship safety forum cssf 2019 i e max b 30 1 m a representative horizontal section for the design variant b30 s is shown in fig 19 the second design variant hereinafter indicated as b30 l is characterised by the fitting of a longitudinal bulkhead at a distance of b 30 from the ship shell in way of machinery spaces as in the case b30 s with a further extension of the additional longitudinal bulkhead also in the region forward of machinery spaces a representative horizontal section for the design variant b30 l is shown in fig 20 both designs b30 s and b30 l are therefore characterised by the presence of a double hull in a certain portion of the ship length the double hull region is shorter for b30 s and longer for b30 l in order to reduce asymmetric heeling in case of flooding of the double hull a port starboard connection is created through the void spaces in the double bottom as shown in fig 21 calculations of a indices have then been carried out for the reference design and for the two design variants calculation draughts and metacentric heights have been kept the same for all the three cases and correspond to those of the reference design metacentric heights at the three calculation draughts correspond to those on the limit curve according to standard solas for the reference design using as target solas2020 requirements for the attained indices imo 2017a as a result the global solas attained index for the considered vessel and loading conditions corresponds to the solas2020 required index in the determination of the s factor for each damage case a class boundaries bulkheads and decks are dealt with by using the nei approach as described in section 4 2 and all heeling moments according to solas have been accounted for as the decks above the double bottom are fire resistant but not watertight a class connections have been added to allow up flooding in case of grounding damages cross flooding is accounted for following imo 2017b with the determination of the equalization time in accordance with imo 2013 attained indices are reported in fig 22 reference design fig 23 design b30 s and fig 24 design b30 l for each design attained indices are normalized by dividing them by the corresponding global solas attained index the reported attained indices as obtained from the non zonal approach correspond to the mean value across the 20x10k repetitions see 6 and the 95 confidence interval for each mean attained index is also indicated see 7 for the reference design fig 22 the global solas attained index associated with collision damages is very close to the global attained index as obtained from the non zonal approach for side grounding contact instead the attained indices in case of bottom grounding are systematically larger than the other a indices the addition of the b 30 longitudinal bulkhead in the machinery spaces starts changing the picture in fact for the design b30 s fig 23 attained indices in case of side grounding contact are now systematically larger than those obtained according to solas similarly to the reference design also for b30 s attained indices in case of bottom grounding are the largest but the ratio with respect to the global solas attained index is slightly smaller compared to the reference design for all draughts this is mainly a consequence of the fact that for design b30 s bottom grounding damages not penetrating the inner bottom can lead to the flooding of larger volumes comprising the double hull region whereas for the reference design bottom damages not penetrating the inner bottom can flood only the double bottom when the longitudinal bulkhead is extended also forward of the machinery spaces in design b30 l fig 24 the trend previously observed for design b30 s is confirmed and more pronounced in fact for the design b30 l normalized attained indices obtained for side grounding contact are further increased and are now in line with those obtained for bottom grounding this is mainly a consequence of the cross connection between port and starboard side double hull through the double bottom thanks to such connection side grounding contact breaches which are not penetrating the b 30 longitudinal bulkhead lead to damage cases involving also double bottom voids and such damage cases are associated with large s factors similar damage cases with and without involvement of central double bottom tanks are also obtained although with different probabilities p factors in case of bottom grounding which are not penetrating the inner bottom it is further noted that the introduction of double hull leads to an increase of cross flooding time for relevant damage cases compared to the reference design as a consequence of the increase of the volume to be equalized this effect is consistently taken into account in the performed calculations for the reference design and for the two considered design variants as the intermediate stage after 60s and the final stage after 600s have been calculated according to imo 2013 2017b this consequently reflects on the relevant s factors nevertheless it can be seen from the obtained a indices that the overall effect of the introduction of the double hull is beneficial despite the increase of cross flooding time for some damage cases still in general the design of the cross flooding devices needs to be carefully considered with double hull designs in order to provide a direct mutual comparison among different design variants fig 25 reports calculated attained indices for all cases normalized by the same index corresponding to the global solas a index of the reference design to further facilitate the comparison fig 26 reports only global normalized indices from fig 25 but grouped in accordance to the type of damage data in figs 25 and 26 show that the fitting of the b 30 longitudinal bulkhead significantly increases the attained indices in case of side grounding contact the solas a index is also positively affected but differences with respect to the reference design are much smaller and basically negligible from a design perspective it is however to be noted that this result should be taken with caution as it may not hold for loading conditions characterised by smaller metacentric heights where the asymmetries in the intermediate stages of flooding can have a stronger effect on the determination of the s factor in case of bottom grounding the introduction of the b 30 longitudinal bulkhead generally leads to some reduction in the attained indices compared to the reference design but the variations of indices are very small and basically negligible from a design perspective the variations in solas a indices are negligible due to the fact that the distribution of collision penetrations as embedded in present solas is characterised by deep breaches with a maximum penetration of b 2 as a result the relatively shallow double hull introduced in b30 s and b30 l does not have significant effects the situation is different in case of side grounding contact damages which are characterised by much shallower penetrations max penetration b 10 see table 4 and fig 9 and for which the b 30 double hull offers a significant protection it is important to underline that for the considered example application the existing solas framework which is based on distributions of damage characteristics typical of collision damages is not very sensitive to the introduction of a design variant such as the considered b 30 double hull which is clearly aimed at protecting the vessel from raking damages instead the attained index obtained from the non zonal approach for side grounding contact damages clearly shows the effect of the introduction of the double hull it is also necessary to underline that the obtained results are intended to provide a representative example but they cannot be generalised to ships which are significantly different in terms of e g dimensions or subdivision layout 5 conclusions solas subdivision and damage stability regulations address collision damages in a probabilistic framework instead ship protection with respect to bottom grounding damages is governed by minimum double bottom height requirements or by deterministic damage stability requirements in case of so called unusual double bottom arrangements moreover solas regulations do not provide requirements regarding side damages due to accidents other than collision nevertheless historical data and experience indicate that damages due to accidents other than collision may also jeopardize ship safety recognising the importance of properly addressing damages due to accidents other than collision and stimulated by the limitations of the present regulatory framework this paper has provided a methodology addressing bottom grounding and side grounding contact damages the presented methodology is intended for design applications and the essence of the approach is in line with the existing solas probabilistic framework for collision damages the presented approach allows to determine attained subdivision indices for the two considered types of damage combining the probabilities of flooding of groups of compartment s and the corresponding conditional survivability metric the probabilities of flooding for the different damage cases are determined using the non zonal approach while the survivability metrics are determined by using the standard solas formulation for the s factor the probabilistic models for bottom grounding and side grounding contact damages embedded in the presented approach have been developed for application to passenger ships the details of the approach have been described and three example applications have been reported and discussed in each example application attained indices associated with bottom grounding and side grounding contact have been calculated with the presented methodology based on the non zonal approach in addition attained indices according to standard solas regulations concerning collision damages have been calculated as well as customary reference design values the first example application addressed a box shaped barge considering the simplicity of the geometry results obtained for this application can be conveniently used for comparison purposes to facilitate possible comparisons the geometry of the barge and its compartments have been provided as supplementary material to the paper results for the second example case namely a realistic large passenger ship have been provided with the intention of showing realistic figures of attained subdivision indices for different types of damage within the second example application a practical approach for dealing with the collapse sequence of a class boundaries was also described the third example application was meant to show how the described approach can provide useful information for assessing alternative subdivision layouts at design stage to this end a panamax cruise ship was taken as basis and two design modifications were considered the two design variants were characterised by a double hull with different longitudinal extents the double hull was meant to protect the vessel from long and shallow side damages raking damages the example application showed that the effect of the double hull was clearly reflected by the attained index for side grounding contact damages instead the solas attained index which is based on side damages due to collision with deeper penetration compared to side grounding contact damages was not very sensitive to the introduced double hull the index associated with bottom grounding damages was negligibly affected by the introduction of the double hull from a development perspective the information provided in the paper is at a level of detail allowing the implementation of the proposed approach consisting of two specific geometrical and probabilistic models of damage related to bottom grounding and side grounding contacts however the presented approach is very flexible and can be easily updated and customized different geometrical models for the breach and or different probabilistic models for the damage characteristics can be directly embedded without modifying the overall framework and the essence of the software implementation from an application perspective the experience gained from the implementation and testing of the approach as well as the obtained results indicate that the proposed methodology could be practically applicable to realistic design cases the present design practice which is based on solas requirements is inherently focussed on guaranteeing a minimum level of ship survivability in case of accidents due to collision although this is a valuable objective the lack of explicit assessment of ship survivability in case of other types of accident leads to a partial view on the safety performance of the vessel indeed focussing only on accidents due to collision leads in general to a biased estimation of the global level of ship survivability in damaged condition this has a direct consequence on ship design because design choices for increasing ship survivability are inherently driven by survivability to collision accidents without assessing the indirect impact on survivability in case of other types of accident such a partial assessment can lead to the risk of missing potentially critical damage conditions or conversely it can lead to the underestimation of the survivability of the vessel the results obtained in the present study indicate that compared to the present design practice of using only the solas collision attained index the consideration of damages associated also with different types of accident can provide important and more complete information for a safety oriented design and for a proper assessment of stability related risk control options in this respect fundamental objective of the present work is to provide tools that can be used in practice for a rational assessment of ship survivability in damaged condition furthermore the presented methodologies can potentially be used also for quantification of risk in a wider more comprehensive risk analysis framework the availability of these tools allows designers to use them for the development and assessment of a variety of technical solutions aimed at increasing ship survivability in damaged condition to an extent which at the present stage is yet to be fully explored more application is necessary in order to devise how to effectively embed such additional information in the actual design practice and to assess how such additional information could potentially influence design decisions related to ship survivability in damaged condition from a regulatory perspective the probabilistic models presented herein have in principle a potential for complementing the solas framework the implementation of the presented models would allow for the quantification of ship safety metrics addressing also accidents other than collision which is now missing in solas this may also potentially reduce the need for additional deterministic requirements within the solas damage stability framework however further application is necessary in order to have a more extensive view of the impact and effectiveness of the use of the presented approaches in ship design credit authorship

et al 2016 the modelling is reported again herein for the sake of completeness and ease of reference providing also some additional information for consistency with the model for side grounding contact damages presented in section 3 2 the probabilistic modelling for bottom grounding damages is reported in the following using analytical expressions in dimensional form whereas zaraphonitis et al 2015 and bulian et al 2016 reported the probabilistic model using a dimensionless approach for the distributions of all damage characteristics with the exception of the damage penetration the described type of bottom damages is conventionally referred to as type b00 zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 a 1 geometrical model of bottom damage a detailed representation of the damage geometry and corresponding defining parameters is shown in fig a 1 to fig a 3 while three dimensional views of an example bottom damage are shown in fig a 4 in providing the geometrical characterisation of the damage the ship fixed coordinate system is assumed to be right handed the damage is assumed to be box shaped moreover the damage is assumed to be a potential damage i e a damage which can also partially extend in some cases outside the vessel there are some main reasons for modelling the shape of the damage using a box in case of bottom damages the first reason is that significantly more complex shape modelling could not be sufficiently supported by the limited available information from accidents secondly a box shaped damage has favourable geometrical characteristics from the computational perspective finally a box shaped damage is more conservative from the point of view of stability assessment compared to other possible typical choices such as e g triangular or parabolic penetrations with reference to fig a 1 to fig a 3 the defining parameters for the damage are the longitudinal position of forward end of damage x f m the transversal dimensionless position of centre of measured damage η d a m y d a m b x f z the longitudinal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage length l x p m the transversal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage width l y p m the vertical extent of potential damage i e the potential damage penetration l z p m the vertical position to be used for the transversal positioning of damage z m in the definition of η d a m the quantity y d a m m is the dimensional transversal position of the centre of the measured damage not to be confused with the transversal position of the centre of potential damage y d a m p m which is described hereinafter the quantity b x f z m is the breadth of the vessel at a longitudinal position corresponding to the forward end of damage x f and vertical position z defining y s b x f z and y p s x f z as the coordinates of the starboard and port side limits of b x f z respectively the quantity y d a m is determined as a 1 y d a m y c x f z η d a m b x f z y c x f z y p s x f z y s b x f z 2 b x f z y p s x f z y s b x f z for symmetric hulls with centreplane at y 0 it is y s b x f z y p s x f z hence y c x f z 0 the quantity y d a m p is defined as a 2 y d a m p y d a m s i g n δ 2 max l y p l y l i m 0 where δ y d a m y c x f z l y l i m min 2 y p s x f z y d a m 2 y d a m y s b x f z note s i g n δ 0 1 s i g n δ 0 0 s i g n δ 0 1 the transversal position of the centre of potential damage y d a m p is set by equation a 2 in such a way that the transversal position of the centre of measured damage at x x f and z z corresponds to the required value y d a m see a 1 also in those cases when the potential damage has a transversal extent in excess of the limit value specified by l y l i m see a 2 to this end when the width of the potential damage l y p exceeds the limit value l y l i m the potential damage is properly extended outboard to port or starboard side according to the sign of δ in a 2 affecting the value of y d a m p if an intersection with the hull at x x f and z z is not obtained as could happen for instance for x f in the very forward or very aft part of the vessel and for small values of z then the limits y s b x f z and y p s x f z are to be set equal to zero which is assumed to correspond to the ship centreline in case multiple intersections are found then y p s x f z is set as the maximum y coordinate among the intersections and y s b x f z is set as the minimum y coordinate among the intersections in such a way that b x f z represents the maximum breadth at x x f and z z regarding the setting of the vertical coordinate z of the waterline used for the transversal positioning of damage although different choices are in principle possible herein it has been decided to set z corresponding to the upper limit of the damage this means that if z b o t t o m is assumed to be the vertical coordinate for the ship bottom then a 3 z z b o t t o m l z p the above mentioned geometrical characterisation in particular the transversal positioning of the damage has been devised with the intention of reducing the occurrence of non contact cases i e generated breaches which eventually do not get in

developed considering damage statistics for non full vessels bulian and francescutto 2011 papanikolaou et al 2011 imo 2012 zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 in case of accidents resulting in multiple breaches the damage characteristics of the probabilistic model correspond to an equivalent damage providing an envelope of the individual breaches papanikolaou et al 2011 imo 2012 zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 the considered distributions for the damage characteristics are reported analytically in table a 1 table a 5 graphical representations of the corresponding cumulative distributions and probability density functions are reported in figs a 5 a 9 the reported distributions and associated parameters for the characteristics of damage are the result of an initial exploratory data analysis see in particular annex 2 in imo 2012 followed by the modelling and fitting of the distributions see in particular bulian and francescutto 2011 which were carried out during the goalds project damages are assumed to be generated in such a way that the forward end of the damage x f is distributed between x m i n and x m a x x m i n l s h i p for application to real vessels and in order to reduce the fraction of non contact cases it is suggested to set x m i n and x m a x at the extremities of the freeboard length of the vessel as specified by the international convention on load lines imo 2019d for simplicity of notation in specifying the distribution for x f see table a 1 it is assumed that the aft extremity is conventionally set at x m i n 0 in addition for simplicity of notation in specifying the distribution for the damage penetration see table a 5 the vertical position of the ship bottom is assumed to be conventionally positioned at z b o t t o m 0 all damage characteristics are assumed to be independent random variables in the framework of a regulatory assessment this is considered to be an acceptable approximation although it can lead with low probability to the occurrence of damage boxes with high aspect ratios it is however easy to introduce limitations in this respect if deemed necessary table a 1 bottom damage distribution of

from baseline ship size dependent model fig a 9 appendix b this appendix provides some summary information regarding the characteristics of the accidents databases that were used for the development of the bottom grounding and of the side grounding contact models described in the paper with reference to bottom grounding damages the development of the model described in the paper was originally carried out during the goalds project bulian and francescutto 2011 papanikolaou et al 2011 and imo 2012 provided details regarding the goalds accidents database and the statistical analysis that led to the development of the probabilistic models for the geometrical characteristics of bottom grounding damage furthermore zaraphonitis et al 2015 provided a detailed summary of the goalds bottom grounding model because the model was later used in the framework of the emsa 3 project taking into account the indications from bulian and francescutto 2012 regarding the transversal positioning of the damage the goalds database was created by extending the original harder project database see lützen 2001 through collection of additional casualty data see papanikolaou et al 2011 the full goalds database covered casualties that occurred worldwide over the period 1944 2009 and contained information on damage characteristics for both grounding and collision accidents the bottom grounding model intended for use for passenger ships described in the paper was developed by using a subset of data from the full goalds database in particular the model was developed by considering grounding accidents occurred to non full ships i e all vessels in the goalds database excluding tankers and bulk carriers full ships as indicated by bulian and francescutto 2011 papanikolaou et al 2011 and imo 2012 the dataset used for the development of the bottom grounding model for non full ships eventually comprised a total of 221 accidents with 22 accidents related to passenger ships for this dataset in most of the cases about 70 for which the accident area was reported the casualty occurred in coastal waters it should be noted however that not all breach data were available for each accident in the dataset this means that the number of available samples for the statistical analysis of each damage characteristic was in general smaller than the total size of the database details in this respect are given by bulian and francescutto 2011 and imo 2012 the side grounding contact model described in the paper was instead developed during the emsa 3 project which started after the end of the goalds project detailed descriptions of the background database and of the statistical analysis that led to the development of the probabilistic models for the geometrical characteristics of side grounding contact damage are provided by pagiaziti et al 2015 and by zaraphonitis et al 2015 the full emsa 3 database was intended for both the development of risk models as well as for the development of probabilistic models of side grounding contact damage characteristics with specific attention to passenger ships as a result the full emsa 3 database comprised information for a large number of accidents but only a subset of data contained sufficient information regarding the breach location and extent for effective use in the development of probabilistic models of side grounding contact damage characteristics as described by pagiaziti et al 2015 and by zaraphonitis et al 2015 the full emsa 3 database was created starting from data from the goalds project and the contiopt project eliopoulou et al 2013 the original datasets were extended in emsa 3 and already available data were revisited and when possible supplemented with additional information further data were gathered from databases sea web ihs markit 2020 and imo gisis imo 2020 from emsa 3 project partners from flag administrations and from other possible sources including an extensive internet search an effort was made to collect and analyse also relevant accidents investigation reports from a number of organizations collected casualty data for passenger and containerships in the emsa 3 database covered a casualty period from 1990 to 2012 considering vessels built on 1982 or later with at least 1 000 gross tonnage in case of passenger vessels ships with a length below 80 m were excluded furthermore passenger ships with froude number above 0 5 were also excluded to eliminate high speed craft the full emsa 3 database covered casualties that occurred worldwide the subset of data from the full emsa 3 database that was used for the development of the probabilistic models of side grounding contact damage characteristics for passenger ships comprised passenger ships and also container vessels the two types of ship were combined together in the statistical analysis in order to increase the number of available samples this was decided taking into account the results from the goalds project where passenger ships were shown to share a similar behaviour regarding grounding damage characteristics as the broader category of non full ships pagiaziti et al 2015 zaraphonitis et al 2015 the dataset used for the development of the side grounding contact model for non full ships eventually comprised a total of 63 accidents with 36 accidents related to passenger ships for this dataset in most of the cases about 65 for which the accident area was reported the casualty occurred in terminal areas it should be noted however that similarly to the case of the goalds database also in case of the emsa 3 database for side grounding contact damages not all breach data were available for each accident in the dataset this means that the number of available samples for the statistical analysis of each damage characteristic was in general smaller than the total size of the database details in this respect are given by pagiaziti et al 2015 and zaraphonitis et al 2015 appendix c

21294,this paper presents a probabilistic framework for the assessment of ship survivability following bottom grounding and side grounding contact accidents with specific attention to passenger ships the proposed framework provides attained subdivision indices for each type of accident for harmonization reasons and to leverage on the experience of present designers the proposed approach is consistent with existing solas probabilistic regulations for damaged ship survivability assessment following a collision in the presented framework the probability of flooding a group of compartment s

to the underlying geometrical and probabilistic models of damage the conditional ship survivability metric is assumed to be provided by the solas s factor results from three example applications are

applicability of the proposed approach and the benefits of considering different types of damage for a safety oriented design and for a proper assessment of stability related risk control options keywords damage stability grounding contact non zonal approach passenger ships solas 1 introduction present solas damage stability regulations for passenger and dry cargo vessels address ship survivability following a flooding due to collision accidents in a probabilistic framework see chapter ii 1 in solas imo 2019a the essence of the approach in present solas dates back to the work of wendel 1960 1961 1968 with subsequent main regulatory evolutions which can be identified in a 265 viii for passenger ships imco 1973 and in solas 90 for cargo vessels imo 1990 present solas originally entered into force as the so called solas2009 imo 2006 with recent amendments leading to the so called solas2020 imo 2017a the original background research and development work regarding models of distributions of collision damage characteristics to be embedded in solas regulations was carried out within the harder project lützen 2001 2002 imo 2002a 2003a papanikolaou and eliopoulou 2008 subsequent discussion took place at the international maritime organization imo imo 2005 which led to some modifications of the original harder proposal and eventually to the final version of solas2009 probabilistic damage stability regulations imo 2006 a statistical re analysis of collision accidents data was also presented by bulian and francescutto 2005 who discussed on the obtained results in view of those obtained by the harder project the solas probabilistic framework considers only collision accident damages occurring to the side of the vessel however the safety of the ship can be jeopardized also by accidents due to grounding or contact with breaches occurring to the bottom or to the side of the vessel this is particularly true when speaking of passenger vessels for which the risk to be accounted for is the potential loss of life papanikolaou et al 2004 emsa 2008 mcib 2013 zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 in the framework of present solas ship protection with respect to bottom grounding damages is governed by regulation solas ii 1 b 2 9 which provides requirements concerning the minimum height of double bottom as well as alternative equivalent deterministic damage stability requirements in case of vessels featuring so called unusual double bottom arrangements also the original background of solas ii 1 b 2 9 can be traced back to the statistical analysis of accidents data collected within the harder project imo 2004a a further analysis regarding the effectiveness of solas double bottom requirements was carried out in the framework of the goalds project using an updated database of accidents data imo 2012 papanikolaou et al 2011 there is therefore an evident dichotomy in present solas framework where survivability in case of collision is addressed through a more advanced probabilistic approach with some additional deterministic requirements whereas the protection with respect to grounding is addressed by means of deterministic provisions in addition to this present regulation solas ii 1 b 2 9 only deals with grounding damages occurring to the bottom of the vessel therefore the solas framework does not address side damages due to accidents other than collision it is however interesting to note that a particular type of side damages due to grounding i e raking damages is considered by the imo hsc code imo 2019b although this is done in a deterministic framework furthermore additional deterministic so called minor damage requirements are also present in solas regulation solas ii 1 b 1 8 these deterministic requirements have been included on top of the probabilistic regulations for passenger ships to avoid ships being designed with what might be perceived as unacceptably vulnerable spots in some part of their length imo 2008 2017b the discussion at imo on the introduction of minor damage requirements can be traced back to slf 42 and even before imo 1998 and it continued within the relevant slf agenda item until basically slf 47 when the text of solas ii 1 b 1 8 was essentially finalised imo 2004b according to imo 1998 minor damage requirements have been introduced in order to replicate a sort of two compartment standard requirement for passenger ships carrying a large number of persons from a regulatory perspective the present situation regarding the solas framework is therefore associated with two evident shortcomings first the present solas damage stability regulatory framework is not harmonised as probabilistic and deterministic requirements are applied alongside and the application of deterministic approaches cannot be considered in line with present best practice in rule development and risk assessment second the present solas probabilistic damage stability regulations do not account for damages due to accidents other than collision despite historical data zaraphonitis et al 2015 indicate that such accidents represent a hazard that should be more properly accounted for this has also a consequence directly related to the design of vessels and in particular passenger vessels as this is the focus of the present paper in fact presently designers do not have at their disposal a common rational probabilistic framework for assessing the effectiveness of stability related risk control options aimed at protecting the vessel from bottom and side damages not related to collision accidents the consequence of this situation is that the ship subdivision layout and possible design modifications are governed and assessed by the ship response to collision accidents whereas the performance of the vessel in case of different types of accident is not explicitly considered since the characteristics of damages are different depending on the type of accident the assessment of different subdivision layouts considering only collision damages may lead to a partial at best or misleading at worst assessment of design alternatives research and development work aimed at filling the identified gaps was carried out in the framework of the emsa 3 project see zaraphonitis et al 2015 and bulian et al 2016 more recently the activities within the esafe joint industry project have further developed the approaches from emsa 3 with a view towards practical application to cruise ships see zaraphonitis et al 2017 luhmann et al 2018 and bulian et al 2019a the present paper leveraging on the outcomes from the two mentioned projects presents a probabilistic framework for the assessment of ship survivability following bottom grounding and side grounding contact accidents with specific attention to passenger ships the approach presented herein follows and expands the approach reported by bulian et al 2016 which was limited to the case of bottom grounding damages the emphasis of this paper is on the description of the approach and on providing example applications for harmonization reasons and to leverage on the experience of present designers the proposed approach is conceptually consistent with existing solas probabilistic regulations for damaged ship survivability assessment following collision accidents and combines the probability of flooding of each group of compartment s with an associated conditional ship survivability metric differently from solas which is based on a zonal approach lützen 2001 2002 pawłowski 2004 in the framework presented herein the probability of flooding a group of compartment s i e the so called p factor associated to each damage case is determined using an automatic flexible and easily updatable non zonal approach based on monte carlo generation of hull breaches according to the underlying geometrical and probabilistic models of damage zaraphonitis et al 2015 2017 bulian et al 2016 2019a luhmann et al 2018 for each damage case the corresponding conditional ship survivability metric is assumed to be provided by the solas s factor solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 the use of monte carlo approaches for assessing ship performance in case of hull breach is not new and the idea has been used in the past for different purposes in different frameworks in the non zonal approach the monte carlo generation is used with the sole purpose of determining damage cases and their associated probabilities of flooding zaraphonitis et al 2015 2017 bulian et al 2016 2019a luhmann et al 2018 while the conditional survivability metric is determined from the residual static ship stability in damaged condition for each damage case the idea of determining damage cases and associated probability of flooding through monte carlo generation of breaches was used by kehren and krüger 2007 krüger et al 2008 and krüger and dankowski 2009 2019 considering ship performance in terms of damaged ship stability and or oil outflow following marpol zaraphonitis et al 2015 imo 2003b 2019c earlier developments in a similar direction can also be found in the work by tellkamp and cramer 2002 although the assessment of ship performance by tellkamp and cramer 2002 was setup using a breach by breach approach making use of random generation of sea states at the moment of damage and of static equivalent method imo 2002b pawłowski 2004 a similar approach was also used by santos and guedes soares 2005 monte carlo methods based on a breach by breach approach for the assessment of ship performance are actually the typically applied methodology when the ship behaviour in time domain following a hull breach is assessed by more advanced and also more computationally expensive time domain ship motion and flooding simulation tools e g vassalos et al 2008 spanos and papanikolaou 2014 ruponen et al 2019 and atzampos et al 2019 the paper is organised as follows firstly the general approach is described afterwards a description is given of the geometrical and probabilistic models for the considered types of damage implemented in the non zonal approach the paper then focuses on providing and discussing results from three example applications some overall conclusions are finally reported 2 description of the approach for damaged ship survivability assessment the assessment procedure described in the following is aimed at determining relevant attained subdivision indices which can be considered to be representative metrics of ship survivability in damaged condition considering bottom grounding accidents and side grounding contact accidents moreover the assessment is devised to be in line with present solas probabilistic damage stability regulations addressing ship survivability in case of collision accidents imo 2019a the applied methodology is an extension of the approach presented by bulian et al 2016 for the sole case of bottom grounding an attained subdivision index is defined for each type of accident namely a g r b for damages due to bottom grounding accidents and a g r s for damages due to side grounding contact accidents details regarding the characteristics of breaches which are taken into account for the determination of indices a g r b and a g r s are provided hereinafter in section 3 1 and section 3 2 respectively indices a g r b and a g r s are defined to be in line as far as practicable with the procedure outlined in solas for the probabilistic assessment of ship survivability following a side damage due to collision it is noted that although also solas collision accidents result in breaches to the side of the vessel the attained subdivision index a g r s is not to be confused with the solas attained subdivision index for collision because the two indices are associated with different types of accident and the corresponding breaches are therefore associated with different geometrical and probabilistic models accordingly the two indices a g r b and a g r s are to be intended as complementary safety metrics with respect to the attained index determined for the case of collision accidents according to the solas framework three calculation draughts are considered i e the deepest subdivision draught d s the partial subdivision draught d p and the light service draught d l the attained subdivision index for each type of damage is determined using weighting factors for each draught in accordance with solas as follows 1 α j 0 4 a j s 0 4 a j p 0 2 a j l j g r b g r s in equation 1 the index j is used to identify the type of damage with j g r b indicating bottom grounding damages and j g r s indicating side grounding contact damages indices a j s a j p and a j l in 1 are the so called partial indices at the three reference draughts d s d p and d l respectively each partial index is a representative measure of the ship survivability conditional to the occurrence of the corresponding accident type at the specific draught and it is given by the summation of contributions from all damage cases to be taken into consideration 2 a j c i p j i c s i c c s p l j g r b g r s the index i in 2 corresponds to each group of compartment s under consideration the so called damage cases at the considered draught for the considered type of damage the term p j i c is the probability that only the group of compartment s under consideration may be flooded in the event of a damage of the considered type at the considered draught i e p j i c is the probability of occurrence of the damage case under consideration finally s i c is the conditional ship survivability metric associated with the flooding of the group of compartment s under consideration at the specified draught it is noted that the survivability metric s i c does not contain the index j representing the type of damage this is because in the methodology presented herein the conditional survivability metric depends only on the damage case index i and on the considered loading condition index c since the formulation used herein for determining s i c does not depend on the type of damage although in principle the summation in 2 could be considered to extend to all possible combinations of compartments assumed to be flooded in practice as usual it extends only to those combinations associated with non zero probability of occurrence i e to those damage cases for which p j i c 0 in the considered assessment approach the survivability metrics s i c are determined in accordance with the solas s factor which is based on the analysis of the properties of the residual righting lever in flooded condition solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 on the other hand the probabilities of flooding p j i c are determined by means of the non zonal approach the general logic of the non zonal approach in case of bottom grounding was extensively described by bulian et al 2016 and references therein and it is summarised in the following it is also worth underlining that the non zonal approach is in line with the logic of assessment described by kehren and krüger 2007 krüger et al 2008 and krüger and dankowski 2009 2019 in the non zonal approach a sufficiently large number of breaches are generated by a monte carlo procedure on the basis of a specified geometrical and probabilistic model for the damage for each breach the corresponding group of compartment s which become open to the sea directly due to the breach is identified then all breaches leading to the flooding of the same group of compartment s i e to the same damage case are grouped for estimating the p factor p j i c associated with the corresponding damage case in the computation of p factors only generated breaches which actually get in contact with the hull are considered and this guarantees that estimated p factors p j i c are such that i p j i c 1 bulian et al 2016 for a generic h th repetition of the monte carlo procedure the p factor p j i c can therefore be estimated as follows 3 p j i c h n j i c n j c h where n j i c is the number of generated breaches leading to the i th damage case at the c th considered loading condition for the j th type of damage and n j c is the total number of generated breaches getting in contact with the hull at the c th considered loading condition for the j th type of damage in the works of zaraphonitis et al 2015 and bulian et al 2016 for reasons associated with computational time the determination of p factors was carried out only at the deepest subdivision draught and the same damage cases and corresponding p factors were then used in the calculations for the other two calculation draughts in this work that approximation has been abandoned and the generation of breaches with corresponding identification of damage cases along with their associated p factors for each type of damage is carried out separately for each calculation draught according to a full application of the non zonal procedure the non zonal approach leads to the fully automatic determination of damage cases with associated estimated flooding probabilities p j i c and the procedure does not need the preparatory zonification process which is required when using analytical p factors for zonal solas calculations since the outcome from the non zonal approach is affected by sampling uncertainty the number of generated breaches must be large enough to achieve an acceptable convergence of the attained subdivision index and results should be reported with associated confidence intervals this aspect is addressed hereinafter in the section containing the example applications in this work attained subdivision indices associated with different types of accident will be considered separately it is however noted that methods for combining different attained indices into a single summarising safety metric on the basis of either the relative frequency of different types of accident or the relative contribution to risk from different types of accident have been addressed by zaraphonitis et al 2015 2017 vassalos et al 2016 luhmann et al 2018 and bulian et al 2019a 3 modelling of damage in order to apply the described non zonal approach it is first necessary to provide a clearly defined unambiguous geometrical model for each considered damage type this is necessary for a proper geometrical generation of the damage given the corresponding damage characteristics the geometrical model of damage is then to be supplemented by a probabilistic model for the damage characteristics the combination of these two fundamental elements provides a full probabilistic model for each damage type which can be implemented in the non zonal framework herein two types of damage are considered namely bottom damages and side damages the probabilistic model for bottom damages is associated with grounding accidents while the probabilistic model for side damages is associated with grounding and contact accidents 3 1 bottom grounding damages bottom damages considered in this work correspond to damages penetrating the bottom of the vessel in principally vertical direction see fig 1 the geometrical and probabilistic modelling for this type of damage was presented by zaraphonitis et al 2015 and bulian et al 2016 and it is primarily intended for application in case of passenger ships for the sake of completeness the modelling is outlined in appendix a and corresponding bottom damages are conventionally referred to as damages of type b00 appendix b reports summary information regarding the accidents database which was used for the development of the model the naming convention b00 is used to provide a simple and quick way to refer to the used geometrical and probabilistic model with flexibility for possible future modifications the letter b is used to indicate damages with geometrical model of bottom type the index 00 refers to the probabilistic model of damage characteristics future alternatives sharing the same geometrical model but using different probabilistic models for damage characteristics may therefore be conveniently referred to as b01 b02 etc 3 2 side grounding contact damages in this section side damages i e damages penetrating the side of the vessel in principally horizontal direction are considered such type of damages is herein conventionally referred to as type s00 a sketch of this type of damages is shown in fig 2 a detailed geometrical characterisation of the damage followed by a complete description of the probabilistic model for the damage characteristics are reported in the following sections in accordance with the background information from zaraphonitis et al 2015 appendix b reports summary information regarding the accidents database which was used for the development of the model the naming convention s00 follows the same principle described for the case of bottom damages the letter s is used to indicate damages with geometrical model of side type the index 00 refers to the probabilistic model of damage characteristics future alternatives sharing the same geometrical model but using different probabilistic models for damage characteristics may therefore be conveniently referred to as s01 s02 etc 3 2 1 geometrical model of side damage a detailed representation of the damage geometry and of the corresponding defining parameters is shown in figs 3 5 while three dimensional views of an example side damage are shown in fig 6 in providing the geometrical characterisation of damage the ship fixed coordinate system is assumed to be right handed the presented side damage has horizontal penetration the penetration is defined to be orthogonal to the centreplane of the vessel and it is measured inboard along a waterline which is specified by the defining geometrical characteristics of the damage see variable z described hereinafter the damage is intended to be a potential damage meaning that the damage can partially extend outside the vessel furthermore the damage is defined in such a way that it can extend partially above and partially below or totally above or totally below the inner bottom of the vessel in case of side damages the possibility of using a simple box shaped modelling is precluded by the general curved shape of the waterlines combined with the possibly large longitudinal extent of the damage as a result it is necessary to consider a geometrical model which while remaining sufficiently simple for practical applications is able to adapt to the shape of the vessel and which is also representative of the physical phenomenon to be described i e a damage due to a side grounding or contact with reference to figs 3 5 the defining parameters for the damage are the indicator for the side of damage i n d s i d e 1 port side 1 starboard side the longitudinal position of forward end of damage x f m the longitudinal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage length l x p m the transversal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage penetration l y p m the vertical position of lower limit of potential damage z l l p m the vertical extent of potential damage above its lower limit i e the height of potential damage above its lower limit h p m the vertical position of the waterline for the determination of the damage penetration surface z m given the actual values of the geometrical parameters characterising the damage the generation of the solid representing the potential damage can be carried out according to the following procedure at first the damage side of the hull is determined according to the value of the variable i n d s i d e afterwards starting from the hull geometry for each longitudinal position x in the range of damage x f l x p x x f the outermost transversal coordinate of the hull shell y e x t x at a waterline z z is determined at the appropriate side of the vessel then the transversal coordinate y i n t l i m x of the inboard limit of the damage solid is defined as follows 4 y i n t l i m x y e x t x l y p for port side damage i n d s i d e 1 y e x t x l y p for starboard side damage i n d s i d e 1 for x f l x p x x f there are situations where the quantity y e x t x cannot be obtained due to the lack of intersection of the hull at the generic coordinates x and z z this might happen when for instance the damage starts in the very forward or very aft part of the vessel or when the damage extends aft of the aft limit of the vessel at a vertical coordinate z in such cases y e x t x can be conventionally set to y e x t x 0 in doing so however care should be exercised in avoiding spurious fictitious contacts with the hull this can occur for instance in case of long potential damages extending aft of a transom stern in such cases the potential damage can be either longitudinally cut at the extreme end of the vessel at z z or the damage can be extended aft of the aft end of the vessel by fixing y e x t x to a value corresponding to the extreme value at the aftermost available position at a waterline z z in those cases where multiple transversal coordinates of the shell are found at a generic section x and waterline z then y e x t x is set as the outermost maximum for port side damages minimum for starboard damages y coordinate of the shell at section x and waterline at z z for the setting of the vertical coordinate z of the waterline used for the transversal positioning of damage there are in principle different possibilities and the positioning reported in fig 3 is a generic one in the range z l l p z l l p h p in the modelling presented herein it has been decided to set z corresponding to the upper limit of the damage however there are cases where the upper limit of the side damage can extend above the top of the hull which is used for the geometrical generation of the damage in order to handle these cases and assuming the referred upper limit of the hull is identified by the vertical coordinate z t o p the vertical coordinate z is defined as follows 5 z min z l l p h p z t o p 3 2 2 probabilistic model of side damage characteristics similarly to the case of bottom damages see zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 and appendix a the primary interest of this study is to provide a methodology suitable in particular for the survivability assessment of passenger vessels with this objective in mind the probabilistic model presented herein for the geometrical characteristics of side damages has been derived from the statistical analysis zaraphonitis et al 2015 of a database of grounding and contact accidents occurred to passenger and container vessels pagiaziti et al 2015 and by introducing some assumptions concerning the potential occurrence of water ingress zaraphonitis et al 2015 the resulting probabilistic model is eventually intended to describe side damages which can lead to water ingress in addition to grounding accidents contact accidents were also included in the analysis because they are associated with hull breaches at the side of the ship which are of particular interest for the present study regarding the use of combined data from passenger vessels and from container vessels this was on the one hand a necessity dictated by the limited availability of data specific to passenger vessels and on the other hand such merging of data was considered to be acceptable considering the outcomes from the goalds project indeed the analysis of bottom grounding accidents data carried out in the goalds project bulian and francescutto 2011 papanikolaou et al 2011 imo 2012 indicated that passenger and container vessels categorised as non full vessels were sharing similar distributions of damage characteristics and that such distributions were different compared to those observed for full vessels tankers and bulk carriers in the framework of the present study the comparisons between the behaviour of data for passenger vessels and for container vessels in case of side damages due to grounding contact confirmed the outcomes from the goalds project and eventually justified the merging of passenger vessels and container vessels into a single category also in case of side grounding contact damages zaraphonitis et al 2015 as a basis the probabilistic model for damage position and extent was developed from the abovementioned accidents database zaraphonitis et al 2015 however it was realised that damages starting too high above the waterline although present in the accidents database could have led to a breach in the hull without subsequent water ingress or with very low probability of subsequent water ingress it was therefore decided to develop a derived probabilistic modelling of damage characteristics by conditioning to the event of occurrence of water ingress zaraphonitis et al 2015 of course from a theoretical perspective a deterministic limit separating cases with water ingress from cases without water ingress cannot be uniquely identified due to the inherent stochastic nature of environmental conditions and resulting ship motions as well as due to the simplifications involved in the basic modelling however for practical applications it was considered acceptable to assume as a simplification that water ingress can occur only when the lower limit of damage z l l p does not exceed a specified threshold z l l p w i in order to specify a practical value for this threshold reference was made to the stability assessment according to the stockholm agreement imo 1995 in the stockholm agreement accumulation of water due to wave effects is not to be taken into account on the ro ro deck whenever the residual freeboard is larger than a specified value which is taken as 2 m in the framework of stockholm agreement where damages are considered to be due to collision and they are therefore assumed to always extend below the waterline the 2 m residual freeboard threshold applies to the ship after flooding of the damaged compartments without accounting for water possibly accumulated on the ro ro deck however in the present context the issue of whether water ingress may occur or not applies to damages due to grounding contact extending entirely above the waterline as result the 2 m distance specified by the stockholm agreement has been assumed to be measured from the intact waterline to the lowermost point of damage setting eventually z l l p w i 2 m similarly to the case of bottom grounding damages see zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 and appendix a also in case of side grounding contact damages the probabilistic model represents an equivalent damage such equivalent damage in case of multiple breaches occurring for the same accident is meant to represent the envelope of the group of individual breaches and not the extent of each single breach bearing in mind the overall complexity of the problem such approach is considered to be an acceptable equivalent simplification for the determination of the probability of flooding of different compartments at the same time the approach is considered to be an acceptable equivalent simplification when static ship stability is considered in the development of the probabilistic model of damage characteristics on the basis of available data zaraphonitis et al 2015 some simplifying assumptions are used regarding the statistical dependence of the involved random variables this is done in order to allow the development of a relatively simple model for practical applications and also as a consequence of the limited sample of data which prevents a robust development of more detailed and complex models in particular on the one hand the following damage characteristics are considered to be statistically independent the indicator for the side of damage i n d s i d e the longitudinal position of forward end of damage x f the longitudinal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage length l x p the transversal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage penetration l y p on the other hand the following two random variables are considered to be statistically dependent on each other but statistically independent from the previous ones the vertical position of lower limit of potential damage z l l p the vertical extent of potential damage above its lower limit i e the height of potential damage above its lower limit h p as a result for i n d s i d e x f l x p and l y p it is sufficient to provide the corresponding marginal distributions instead for the variables z l l p and h p it is necessary to provide a modelling of the joint probability density function to this end the modelling is provided by specifying the marginal distribution of z l l p and the conditional distribution of h p given z l l p such a description is indeed sufficient because the joint probability density function of z l l p and h p can be obtained by multiplying the marginal probability density function of z l l p by the conditional probability density function of h p the conditioning to the occurrence of water ingress is directly embedded in the modelling of the marginal distribution of z l l p through the parameter z l l p w i the distributions for the different damage characteristics as obtained from the analysis of the accidents database are reported analytically in tables 1 5 details of the statistical analysis and of the modelling and fitting of the distributions of damage characteristics have been reported by zaraphonitis et al 2015 similarly to the case of bottom damages described in appendix a also in case of side damages it is suggested to set the reference ship length l s h i p in accordance with the international convention on load lines imo 2019d with x m i n and x m a x corresponding to the longitudinal coordinates of aft and forward extremities of l s h i p respectively with reference to the presented models some relevant comments are worth being made as reported in the following it can be noticed that the modelling of the distribution for x f see table 2 and the graphical representation in fig 7 is the same as that used for the same variable in case of bottom damages see table a 1 and fig a 5 bulian et al 2016 and zaraphonitis et al 2015 in fact accidents data indicate that the probabilistic modelling for bottom grounding damages from goalds was able to represent also the distribution of forward end of damage in case of side grounding contact damages zaraphonitis et al 2015 the distribution of the longitudinal extent of potential damage l x p see table 3 and the graphical representation in fig 8 is characterised by the same functional form as that used in case of bottom damages see table a 3 and fig a 7 bulian et al 2016 and zaraphonitis et al 2015 however the characterising parameters are different in particular side damages are characterised by shorter lengths compared to bottom damages this difference could be partly attributed to the fact that the modelling of side damages was based on a database of accidents containing not only groundings as in case of bottom damages but also contacts zaraphonitis et al 2015 the distribution of the potential damage penetration l y p see table 4 and the graphical representation in fig 9 is characterised by a quite simple modelling this is a consequence of the limited availability of accident reports providing quantitative indications regarding the damage penetration which prevented the possibility of developing more advanced models zaraphonitis et al 2015 finally table 5 presents the model for the joint distribution of z l l p and h p and it is important to underline that this joint distribution is provided as a distribution conditional to the occurrence of water ingress event e w i such modelling is more complex in comparison with the models for the other random variables as it embeds the statistical dependence between z l l p and h p therefore it is worth providing some additional explanation first of all the modelling assumes that damages leading to water ingress can have a lower limit z l l p positioned from the ship bottom up to a maximum limit equal to z l l p u l such maximum limit is governed by a combination of two conceptually different limitations firstly the maximum z l l p is limited by the quantity z l l p max which comes directly from the analysis of the accidents database zaraphonitis et al 2015 in particular z l l p max limits z l l p up to 1 4 t where t is the intact ship draught see β 1 ζ in table 5 or up to t 3 2 m see β 2 ζ in table 5 whichever is smaller on top of this limitation the maximum z l l p is also limited by the maximum vertical position specified by the threshold z l l p w i which represents the maximum vertical position of the lowermost damage point above which it has been assumed that there is no water ingress imo 1995 zaraphonitis et al 2015 as described before z l l p w i is assumed to be positioned 2 m above the intact waterline see β 3 ζ in table 5 in principle the parameters z l l p max and z l l p w i could be reduced to a single limitation keeping only the minimum between the parameters β 2 ζ and β 3 ζ however it has been decided to keep them separate in reporting and describing the modelling in order to give an explicit evidence of their different source i e the analysis of the database for z l l p max and the possible occurrence of water ingress e w i based on stockholm agreement for z l l p w i moreover keeping β 2 ζ and β 3 ζ as separate variables makes it also easier to update the model in case different values for β 3 ζ are selected the marginal distribution for z l l p is modelled as uniform within the support 0 z l l p u l see table 5 and fig 10 regarding the vertical extent of potential damage h p it is assumed to be distributed between zero and a maximum vertical extent h p m a x the conditional probability density function of the dimensionless variable h p h p m a x is triangular with maximum at zero because β 1 h in table 5 is equal to 1 3 and the corresponding cumulative distribution is therefore parabolic see table 5 and fig 11 the maximum vertical extent of the potential damage h p m a x is governed by two limitations which have been derived from the analysis of the accidents database zaraphonitis et al 2015 one limitation for h p is an absolute maximum value of 7 5 m see h a m in table 5 in addition the maximum vertical extent of the damage is further limited by requiring that damages cannot vertically extend more than 6 6 m above the intact waterline see h u l in table 5 the result of this combination of two limitations is that h p m a x depends on both the ship draught t and on the vertical position of the lower limit of potential damage z l l p see the definition of h p m a x in table 5 a graphical representation of the support for the distribution of the random vector z l l p h p is shown in fig 12 for different representative values of the ship draught it can be noticed that for sufficiently small values of z l l p h p m a x is fixed at the value h a m then h p m a x starts decreasing when the limitation based on h u l becomes effective which happens for larger values of z l l p i e for damages which have a lower limit high above the ship bottom 4 example applications the developed non zonal approach for bottom grounding and side grounding contact accidents is herein applied to three example cases the first example case is a box shaped barge which is included with the main aim of providing a simple reference case with a set of calculation results to be used for potential comparison benchmarking the second example application is carried out on a realistic large passenger ship with the aim of providing realistic figures of attained subdivision indices for different types of damage in addition the second example also describes a practical approach for dealing with the collapse sequence of a class boundaries finally the third example is carried out on a panamax passenger ship design the third example application aims to explore how the developed approach assesses two design variants with respect to a reference design in each design variant a double hull of different longitudinal extent is introduced to protect the vessel from raking damages while each example application has its own peculiarities as described in the following corresponding sections there are some common aspects in the calculation methodology which for the sake of compactness are reported in this introductory section in all example applications the non zonal approach for bottom grounding damages and side grounding contact damages is applied by randomly generating breaches separately for each calculation draught three calculation draughts are considered in accordance with existing solas as described in section 2 in all cases a total of 10 000 breaches are randomly generated for each calculation draught in accordance with the relevant geometrical and probabilistic model and a total of 20 independent repetitions are carried out for each case partial a indices are then calculated for each draught according to the non zonal approach and the global a index is determined for each repetition according to 1 letting now x h be the generic partial or global attained index for the generic h th repetition the true value of the attained index is estimated by the mean index across n r e p repetitions as follows 6 x 1 n r e p h 1 n r e p x h for the example applications presented hereinafter n r e p 20 in order to reflect the uncertainty in the estimated index due to random sampling the mean index x is reported with an associated confidence interval x l b x u b with bounds depending on a specified confidence level c the lower x l b and upper x u b boundaries of the confidence interval are determined as 7 x u b x t s x n r e p x l b x t s x n r e p where s x is the sample standard deviation for the attained index x across repetitions calculated as 8 s x 1 n r e p 1 h 1 n r e p x h x 2 the factor t is obtained from the inverse of the cumulative student s t distribution indicated as i c d f t in the following with n r e p 1 degrees of freedom d f considering the specified confidence level c i e 9 t i c d f t 1 1 c 2 d f n r e p 1 in the examples reported hereinafter 95 confidence intervals will be considered i e c 0 95 for n r e p 20 it is therefore t 2 093 it is underlined that the same number of breaches for each repetition 10 000 and the same total number of independent repetitions for each case n r e p 20 have been used for all example application cases in order to allow a comparison in terms of width of confidence intervals for the estimated attained indices from the non zonal approach also across different examples moreover the combination 20x10k repetitions has been selected in order to balance two competing objectives reducing the computational time and reducing the width of the confidence intervals for the attained indices estimated by the non zonal approach in fact on the one hand the computational time increases as the number of generated breaches and or the number of repetitions increases on the other hand an increase in the number of generated breaches and or repetitions leads to a reduction in the width of the confidence interval of the attained indices determined from the non zonal approach in addition to non zonal a indices for bottom grounding and for side grounding contact all application examples will report also the collision attained subdivision indices calculated in accordance with solas probabilistic damage stability regulations imo 2019a of course solas attained indices are not associated with random sampling uncertainty as they are determined with the standard zonal approach and they are therefore reported without any confidence interval or equivalently with a zero width confidence interval at the same time it should be recalled that results of standard solas zonal calculations depend in general on the zonification which is used for the analytical calculation of factors p r and v solas ii 1 b 1 7 1 solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 for typical and particularly for complex ship geometries and subdivision layouts the zonification process introduces a certain level of subjective judgement by the designer associated with the positioning of virtual subdivision boundaries in the zonification as a result the resulting a indices from solas zonal calculations are influenced to a certain extent by the selected zonification solas indices are representative of survivability in case of flooding due to collision accidents where the considered vessel is the struck vessel it is important to stress that although solas collision damages correspond to breaches on the side of the vessel the underlying distributions related to damage location and extent are different from those associated with side grounding contact damages presented herein see e g lützen 2001 2002 and the discussion by bulian et al 2019a it is also important to underline that attained indices determined according to solas embed the use of the worst case approach also known as damages of lesser extent in case of presence of horizontal subdivision boundaries below waterline solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 as a result the solas attained indices represent a systematically conservative estimation of the indices which could potentially be obtained by removing the worst case approach and implementing any general probabilistic model for the vertical position of the lower limit of damage below the waterline bulian et al 2019a b this limitation of the present solas approach is to be borne in mind when looking at the results reported for the following example applications and solas attained indices reported in the following examples are to be considered only as customary reference design values 4 1 reference calculations for a box shaped barge in this example application a box shaped barge is considered which was also used in previous studies related to bottom grounding bulian et al 2016 the main aim of this example application is to provide a set of reproducible reference data on a simple and fully described geometry which could be potentially used for comparison purposes in case of implementation of the described non zonal approach a detailed description of the considered barge was given by bulian et al 2016 and a summary description is reported herein for the sake of completeness the main characteristics of the barge are reported in table 6 and its layout is shown in fig 13 the loading conditions considered in the calculations are reported in table 7 in all calculations the permeability μ was considered the same for all compartments however two sets of calculations have been carried out assuming two different values of permeability i e μ 0 95 and μ 1 00 it is noted that while a permeability of 95 is more in line with regulatory standards calculations based on an assumed 100 permeability of compartments may represent an easier reference for comparison purposes the s factor has been calculated in accordance with solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 considering only the final stage of flooding no heeling moment was considered in the calculations carried out herein and this was done with the intention of keeping this calculation case as simple as possible it is noted that although the main deck of the reported example barge resembles a ro ro deck calculations of s f i n a l have been carried out herein using standard parameters t g z m a x 0 12 m t r a n g e 16 deg without the special consideration which is given by solas2020 imo 2017a to damage cases involving ro ro spaces in ro ro passenger ships the subdivision length for solas zonal calculations corresponds to the overall length while the length used for non zonal calculations regarding bottom and side damages corresponds to the length between perpendiculars as specified in table 6 each room in the double bottom is associated with an unprotected opening and these openings are indicated by square markers in fig 13 the vertical position of all the openings is 7 5 m from the ship bottom corresponding to 1 5 m above the bulkhead deck for wing compartments in the double bottom openings are transversally positioned at 0 5 m from the relevant ship side whereas openings are transversally positioned at the centreline for central double bottom compartments and for extreme aft and extreme forward double bottom compartments extending from side to side in the longitudinal direction openings are positioned in the middle of the relevant compartments more information are given by bulian et al 2016 as previously stressed in general a indices from zonal calculations depend to a certain extent on arbitrary choices regarding the positioning of virtual subdivision boundaries used in the zonification however for this specific example application this is not really the case because the hull is box shaped as well as all compartments and all compartments have limiting surfaces which are all parallel to xy xz or yz planes it is therefore possible to setup a zonification leading to exact results when using solas analytical formulae for factors p r and v this is achieved by simply and naturally positioning the subdivision boundaries used in the zonification in correspondence to the physical watertight boundaries this is in fact how the zonification was setup for the calculations presented herein for calculations with permeability 95 the obtained a indices are reported in table 8 and graphically in fig 14 for calculations with permeability 100 results are reported in table 9 and fig 15 the reported attained indices as obtained from the non zonal approach correspond to the mean value across the 20x10k repetitions see 6 and each mean attained index is reported together with the associated 95 confidence interval see 7 in order to facilitate the re use of data reported in this section the geometrical model of the barge is provided as supplementary material to the paper see appendix c a direct comparison between the attained indices derived by the non zonal approach and solas might be useful however it should be kept in mind that different types of damage are considered by each approach bottom grounding and side grounding contact are investigated by the non zonal approach while solas results refer to collision incidents having said this some remarks can be derived from such a comparison the non zonal approach for bottom grounding and side grounding contact systematically yields a higher attained index value compared to collisions according to solas starting with a comparison between the bottom grounding attained index and the solas index it must be noted that there are significant differences in the assumed damage geometry as well as in the means of protection against each type of accident bottom groundings are damages penetrating the hull bottom in a vertical direction while solas damages are penetrating in a horizontal direction from the side of the ship for the barge under investigation an inner bottom is fitted at a position corresponding to approximately 40 of the deepest subdivision draft consequently in most bottom grounding cases about 90 the inner bottom is not penetrated and the flooding of the double bottom compartments leads to lower k g values while the reserve of buoyancy is enough to balance the floodwater and to provide also some reserve of stability therefore the high double bottom combined with the available reserve of buoyancy provide effective protection against bottom grounding which is reflected in the obtained high attained index side grounding damages resemble more the collision damages in terms of position and penetration direction but the assumptions regarding the distributions of damage characteristics are significantly different leading to different p factors even in cases where the same compartments are damaged on top of that it should be noted that in case of side grounding the herein adopted procedure accounts for the existence of the double bottom in a consistent way whereas solas adopts the worst case approach resulting in an inherent conservative determination of the attained index in case of collision in this respect bulian et al 2019a b presented quantitative results on the effect of the worst case approach on the attained index in case of collision accidents finally the observed differences between the attained indices for bottom and side groundings are once again mainly attributed to the protection offered by the double bottom in the former case 4 2 example results for a large passenger ship this example application is intended to provide realistic figures of attained subdivision indices for different types of damage in case of a realistic large passenger ship to this end calculations were carried out for a 125000 gt large passenger ship design originally developed within the eu fp7 project floodstand kujanpää and routi 2009 the main characteristics of the ship are reported in table 10 the original floodstand ship model however has been updated for the calculations presented herein in fact the calculation accounting for grounding damages requires a more detailed ship model compared to what is needed when dealing only with collision damages as in solas the reason for this is that in case of grounding damages all up flooding routes need also to be accounted for therefore all vertical connections between the decks such as staircases and lift trunks were modelled as separate rooms allowing both up and down flooding cross flooding ducts were modelled in the double bottom as illustrated in fig 16 overall the buoyant part of the hull extends two deck heights above the bulkhead deck level as shown in fig 16 calculations of the s factor have been carried out in accordance with present solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 taking into account all relevant heeling moments however solas explanatory notes imo 2008 2017b state that the effect of sufficiently strong non watertight boundaries typically a class fire rated structures which are inside watertight compartments should be considered the current practice for this is to calculate all possible combinations of collapsed and intact boundaries this is a very conservative approach and it can also lead to non realistic combinations in addition for passenger ships with dense internal non watertight subdivision the number of combinations can be extremely large which makes the process extremely laborious this is particularly evident for extensive damage cases that involve several watertight compartments as discussed by ruponen and lindroth 2016 ruponen et al 2018 and karolius et al 2019 in case of complex layouts and detailed modelling the approach can even become practically inapplicable due to the too large number of possible combinations and consequent too large computational time in this context the full scale experiments and dedicated fem calculations within the eu fp7 project floodstand demonstrated that typical a class fire rated doors leak significantly and eventually collapse under an effective pressure head of between 1 0 m and 3 5 m depending on the type of the structure jalonen et al 2017 therefore it is reasonable to assume that floodwater progresses through the a class boundaries through doors from this consideration it has been assumed that a simplified approach as illustrated in fig 17 could be used in this approach in each new calculation stage all neighbouring rooms are flooded until all boundaries are breached and the whole compartment is flooded hence the short naming nei approach used herein thus a sequence of intermediate stages representing the flooding progression is calculated instead of dealing with all the alternative combinations of collapsed and intact boundaries it should be noted that the nei approach is not intended as a substitute for direct physics based time domain progressive flooding simulations e g spanos et al 1997 santos and guedes soares 2001 jasionowski 2001 palazzi and de kat 2004 ruponen et al 2007 2019 vassalos et al 2008 schreuder et al 2011 ruponen and lindroth 2016 dankowski and krüger 2013 spanos and papanikolaou 2014 lindroth et al 2018 atzampos et al 2019 gao et al 2019 and see also relevant references in the reviews by bačkalov et al 2016 and by manderbacka et al 2019 nevertheless in practical regulatory calculations the nei approach is believed to provide more realistic results compared to the approach based on the consideration of all combinations of collapsed and intact boundaries and it also allows to significantly reduce the computational time in case of complex ship layouts the loading conditions considered in the calculations are reported in table 11 and the corresponding indices are reported in table 12 with a graphical representation shown in fig 18 also in this case the reported attained indices as obtained from the non zonal approach correspond to the mean value across the 20x10k repetitions see 6 and each mean attained index is reported together with the associated 95 confidence interval see 7 results in table 12 and fig 18 show that for the considered example large passenger ship the attained indices associated with bottom grounding damages are the largest with very limited dependence on the ship draught differences of a indices are of the order of the width of confidence intervals the loss of index in case of bottom grounding is generally due to lack of reserve of buoyancy as a consequence of large damage extents second largest indices are those obtained for side grounding contact damages with a tendency towards an increase of index as the calculation draught increases however it shall be recalled that for the considered loading conditions see table 11 the intact metacentric height increases as the draught increases and this influences the final outcomes the smallest indices are obtained for all draughts from the application of solas differences between solas indices and indices associated with other types of damage are in general a natural consequence of the differences in the underlying damage models this is a very important factor because the underlying damage models govern the probability of occurrence i e the p factor associated with each possible damage case however in addition to this it is also important to remember that as already discussed a direct comparison between solas attained indices and indices obtained from the application of the non zonal approach is unfair and solas attained indices are to be considered only as customary reference design values this is because solas uses the worst case approach to deal with horizontal subdivision boundaries below the waterline solas ii 1 b 1 7 2 6 2 and therefore it systematically underestimates the attained index whereas the non zonal approach consistently accounts for all details of the ship subdivision layout some analyses on the impact of the worst case approach in the evaluation of the attained subdivision index for collision have been reported by bulian et al 2019a b 4 3 assessment of design variants for a panamax passenger ship in this example application a reference design has been considered corresponding to a panamax cruise ship having length of about 240 m breadth of about 32 m deepest subdivision draught of about 7 5 m and addressing solas2020 requirements imo 2017a as is typical in cruise ships the reference design is characterised by the absence of longitudinal bulkheads close to the ship shell and c shaped void spaces are present in the double bottom which help in reducing asymmetric flooding in damaged condition along with the reference design two design variants have been considered which are both aimed at protecting the vessel from side raking damages the first design variant hereinafter indicated as b30 s corresponds to the fitting of a longitudinal bulkhead only in way of machinery spaces at a distance of b 30 from the ship shell it is noted that for side grounding contact damages a penetration of b 30 corresponds to a cumulative distribution of 0 90 see table 4 and fig 9 this value corresponds also to the width of double hull for engine room compartments as suggested by the cruise ship safety forum cssf 2019 i e max b 30 1 m a representative horizontal section for the design variant b30 s is shown in fig 19 the second design variant hereinafter indicated as b30 l is characterised by the fitting of a longitudinal bulkhead at a distance of b 30 from the ship shell in way of machinery spaces as in the case b30 s with a further extension of the additional longitudinal bulkhead also in the region forward of machinery spaces a representative horizontal section for the design variant b30 l is shown in fig 20 both designs b30 s and b30 l are therefore characterised by the presence of a double hull in a certain portion of the ship length the double hull region is shorter for b30 s and longer for b30 l in order to reduce asymmetric heeling in case of flooding of the double hull a port starboard connection is created through the void spaces in the double bottom as shown in fig 21 calculations of a indices have then been carried out for the reference design and for the two design variants calculation draughts and metacentric heights have been kept the same for all the three cases and correspond to those of the reference design metacentric heights at the three calculation draughts correspond to those on the limit curve according to standard solas for the reference design using as target solas2020 requirements for the attained indices imo 2017a as a result the global solas attained index for the considered vessel and loading conditions corresponds to the solas2020 required index in the determination of the s factor for each damage case a class boundaries bulkheads and decks are dealt with by using the nei approach as described in section 4 2 and all heeling moments according to solas have been accounted for as the decks above the double bottom are fire resistant but not watertight a class connections have been added to allow up flooding in case of grounding damages cross flooding is accounted for following imo 2017b with the determination of the equalization time in accordance with imo 2013 attained indices are reported in fig 22 reference design fig 23 design b30 s and fig 24 design b30 l for each design attained indices are normalized by dividing them by the corresponding global solas attained index the reported attained indices as obtained from the non zonal approach correspond to the mean value across the 20x10k repetitions see 6 and the 95 confidence interval for each mean attained index is also indicated see 7 for the reference design fig 22 the global solas attained index associated with collision damages is very close to the global attained index as obtained from the non zonal approach for side grounding contact instead the attained indices in case of bottom grounding are systematically larger than the other a indices the addition of the b 30 longitudinal bulkhead in the machinery spaces starts changing the picture in fact for the design b30 s fig 23 attained indices in case of side grounding contact are now systematically larger than those obtained according to solas similarly to the reference design also for b30 s attained indices in case of bottom grounding are the largest but the ratio with respect to the global solas attained index is slightly smaller compared to the reference design for all draughts this is mainly a consequence of the fact that for design b30 s bottom grounding damages not penetrating the inner bottom can lead to the flooding of larger volumes comprising the double hull region whereas for the reference design bottom damages not penetrating the inner bottom can flood only the double bottom when the longitudinal bulkhead is extended also forward of the machinery spaces in design b30 l fig 24 the trend previously observed for design b30 s is confirmed and more pronounced in fact for the design b30 l normalized attained indices obtained for side grounding contact are further increased and are now in line with those obtained for bottom grounding this is mainly a consequence of the cross connection between port and starboard side double hull through the double bottom thanks to such connection side grounding contact breaches which are not penetrating the b 30 longitudinal bulkhead lead to damage cases involving also double bottom voids and such damage cases are associated with large s factors similar damage cases with and without involvement of central double bottom tanks are also obtained although with different probabilities p factors in case of bottom grounding which are not penetrating the inner bottom it is further noted that the introduction of double hull leads to an increase of cross flooding time for relevant damage cases compared to the reference design as a consequence of the increase of the volume to be equalized this effect is consistently taken into account in the performed calculations for the reference design and for the two considered design variants as the intermediate stage after 60s and the final stage after 600s have been calculated according to imo 2013 2017b this consequently reflects on the relevant s factors nevertheless it can be seen from the obtained a indices that the overall effect of the introduction of the double hull is beneficial despite the increase of cross flooding time for some damage cases still in general the design of the cross flooding devices needs to be carefully considered with double hull designs in order to provide a direct mutual comparison among different design variants fig 25 reports calculated attained indices for all cases normalized by the same index corresponding to the global solas a index of the reference design to further facilitate the comparison fig 26 reports only global normalized indices from fig 25 but grouped in accordance to the type of damage data in figs 25 and 26 show that the fitting of the b 30 longitudinal bulkhead significantly increases the attained indices in case of side grounding contact the solas a index is also positively affected but differences with respect to the reference design are much smaller and basically negligible from a design perspective it is however to be noted that this result should be taken with caution as it may not hold for loading conditions characterised by smaller metacentric heights where the asymmetries in the intermediate stages of flooding can have a stronger effect on the determination of the s factor in case of bottom grounding the introduction of the b 30 longitudinal bulkhead generally leads to some reduction in the attained indices compared to the reference design but the variations of indices are very small and basically negligible from a design perspective the variations in solas a indices are negligible due to the fact that the distribution of collision penetrations as embedded in present solas is characterised by deep breaches with a maximum penetration of b 2 as a result the relatively shallow double hull introduced in b30 s and b30 l does not have significant effects the situation is different in case of side grounding contact damages which are characterised by much shallower penetrations max penetration b 10 see table 4 and fig 9 and for which the b 30 double hull offers a significant protection it is important to underline that for the considered example application the existing solas framework which is based on distributions of damage characteristics typical of collision damages is not very sensitive to the introduction of a design variant such as the considered b 30 double hull which is clearly aimed at protecting the vessel from raking damages instead the attained index obtained from the non zonal approach for side grounding contact damages clearly shows the effect of the introduction of the double hull it is also necessary to underline that the obtained results are intended to provide a representative example but they cannot be generalised to ships which are significantly different in terms of e g dimensions or subdivision layout 5 conclusions solas subdivision and damage stability regulations address collision damages in a probabilistic framework instead ship protection with respect to bottom grounding damages is governed by minimum double bottom height requirements or by deterministic damage stability requirements in case of so called unusual double bottom arrangements moreover solas regulations do not provide requirements regarding side damages due to accidents other than collision nevertheless historical data and experience indicate that damages due to accidents other than collision may also jeopardize ship safety recognising the importance of properly addressing damages due to accidents other than collision and stimulated by the limitations of the present regulatory framework this paper has provided a methodology addressing bottom grounding and side grounding contact damages the presented methodology is intended for design applications and the essence of the approach is in line with the existing solas probabilistic framework for collision damages the presented approach allows to determine attained subdivision indices for the two considered types of damage combining the probabilities of flooding of groups of compartment s and the corresponding conditional survivability metric the probabilities of flooding for the different damage cases are determined using the non zonal approach while the survivability metrics are determined by using the standard solas formulation for the s factor the probabilistic models for bottom grounding and side grounding contact damages embedded in the presented approach have been developed for application to passenger ships the details of the approach have been described and three example applications have been reported and discussed in each example application attained indices associated with bottom grounding and side grounding contact have been calculated with the presented methodology based on the non zonal approach in addition attained indices according to standard solas regulations concerning collision damages have been calculated as well as customary reference design values the first example application addressed a box shaped barge considering the simplicity of the geometry results obtained for this application can be conveniently used for comparison purposes to facilitate possible comparisons the geometry of the barge and its compartments have been provided as supplementary material to the paper results for the second example case namely a realistic large passenger ship have been provided with the intention of showing realistic figures of attained subdivision indices for different types of damage within the second example application a practical approach for dealing with the collapse sequence of a class boundaries was also described the third example application was meant to show how the described approach can provide useful information for assessing alternative subdivision layouts at design stage to this end a panamax cruise ship was taken as basis and two design modifications were considered the two design variants were characterised by a double hull with different longitudinal extents the double hull was meant to protect the vessel from long and shallow side damages raking damages the example application showed that the effect of the double hull was clearly reflected by the attained index for side grounding contact damages instead the solas attained index which is based on side damages due to collision with deeper penetration compared to side grounding contact damages was not very sensitive to the introduced double hull the index associated with bottom grounding damages was negligibly affected by the introduction of the double hull from a development perspective the information provided in the paper is at a level of detail allowing the implementation of the proposed approach consisting of two specific geometrical and probabilistic models of damage related to bottom grounding and side grounding contacts however the presented approach is very flexible and can be easily updated and customized different geometrical models for the breach and or different probabilistic models for the damage characteristics can be directly embedded without modifying the overall framework and the essence of the software implementation from an application perspective the experience gained from the implementation and testing of the approach as well as the obtained results indicate that the proposed methodology could be practically applicable to realistic design cases the present design practice which is based on solas requirements is inherently focussed on guaranteeing a minimum level of ship survivability in case of accidents due to collision although this is a valuable objective the lack of explicit assessment of ship survivability in case of other types of accident leads to a partial view on the safety performance of the vessel indeed focussing only on accidents due to collision leads in general to a biased estimation of the global level of ship survivability in damaged condition this has a direct consequence on ship design because design choices for increasing ship survivability are inherently driven by survivability to collision accidents without assessing the indirect impact on survivability in case of other types of accident such a partial assessment can lead to the risk of missing potentially critical damage conditions or conversely it can lead to the underestimation of the survivability of the vessel the results obtained in the present study indicate that compared to the present design practice of using only the solas collision attained index the consideration of damages associated also with different types of accident can provide important and more complete information for a safety oriented design and for a proper assessment of stability related risk control options in this respect fundamental objective of the present work is to provide tools that can be used in practice for a rational assessment of ship survivability in damaged condition furthermore the presented methodologies can potentially be used also for quantification of risk in a wider more comprehensive risk analysis framework the availability of these tools allows designers to use them for the development and assessment of a variety of technical solutions aimed at increasing ship survivability in damaged condition to an extent which at the present stage is yet to be fully explored more application is necessary in order to devise how to effectively embed such additional information in the actual design practice and to assess how such additional information could potentially influence design decisions related to ship survivability in damaged condition from a regulatory perspective the probabilistic models presented herein have in principle a potential for complementing the solas framework the implementation of the presented models would allow for the quantification of ship safety metrics addressing also accidents other than collision which is now missing in solas this may also potentially reduce the need for additional deterministic requirements within the solas damage stability framework however further application is necessary in order to have a more extensive view of the impact and effectiveness of the use of the presented approaches in ship design credit authorship

et al 2016 the modelling is reported again herein for the sake of completeness and ease of reference providing also some additional information for consistency with the model for side grounding contact damages presented in section 3 2 the probabilistic modelling for bottom grounding damages is reported in the following using analytical expressions in dimensional form whereas zaraphonitis et al 2015 and bulian et al 2016 reported the probabilistic model using a dimensionless approach for the distributions of all damage characteristics with the exception of the damage penetration the described type of bottom damages is conventionally referred to as type b00 zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 a 1 geometrical model of bottom damage a detailed representation of the damage geometry and corresponding defining parameters is shown in fig a 1 to fig a 3 while three dimensional views of an example bottom damage are shown in fig a 4 in providing the geometrical characterisation of the damage the ship fixed coordinate system is assumed to be right handed the damage is assumed to be box shaped moreover the damage is assumed to be a potential damage i e a damage which can also partially extend in some cases outside the vessel there are some main reasons for modelling the shape of the damage using a box in case of bottom damages the first reason is that significantly more complex shape modelling could not be sufficiently supported by the limited available information from accidents secondly a box shaped damage has favourable geometrical characteristics from the computational perspective finally a box shaped damage is more conservative from the point of view of stability assessment compared to other possible typical choices such as e g triangular or parabolic penetrations with reference to fig a 1 to fig a 3 the defining parameters for the damage are the longitudinal position of forward end of damage x f m the transversal dimensionless position of centre of measured damage η d a m y d a m b x f z the longitudinal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage length l x p m the transversal extent of potential damage i e the potential damage width l y p m the vertical extent of potential damage i e the potential damage penetration l z p m the vertical position to be used for the transversal positioning of damage z m in the definition of η d a m the quantity y d a m m is the dimensional transversal position of the centre of the measured damage not to be confused with the transversal position of the centre of potential damage y d a m p m which is described hereinafter the quantity b x f z m is the breadth of the vessel at a longitudinal position corresponding to the forward end of damage x f and vertical position z defining y s b x f z and y p s x f z as the coordinates of the starboard and port side limits of b x f z respectively the quantity y d a m is determined as a 1 y d a m y c x f z η d a m b x f z y c x f z y p s x f z y s b x f z 2 b x f z y p s x f z y s b x f z for symmetric hulls with centreplane at y 0 it is y s b x f z y p s x f z hence y c x f z 0 the quantity y d a m p is defined as a 2 y d a m p y d a m s i g n δ 2 max l y p l y l i m 0 where δ y d a m y c x f z l y l i m min 2 y p s x f z y d a m 2 y d a m y s b x f z note s i g n δ 0 1 s i g n δ 0 0 s i g n δ 0 1 the transversal position of the centre of potential damage y d a m p is set by equation a 2 in such a way that the transversal position of the centre of measured damage at x x f and z z corresponds to the required value y d a m see a 1 also in those cases when the potential damage has a transversal extent in excess of the limit value specified by l y l i m see a 2 to this end when the width of the potential damage l y p exceeds the limit value l y l i m the potential damage is properly extended outboard to port or starboard side according to the sign of δ in a 2 affecting the value of y d a m p if an intersection with the hull at x x f and z z is not obtained as could happen for instance for x f in the very forward or very aft part of the vessel and for small values of z then the limits y s b x f z and y p s x f z are to be set equal to zero which is assumed to correspond to the ship centreline in case multiple intersections are found then y p s x f z is set as the maximum y coordinate among the intersections and y s b x f z is set as the minimum y coordinate among the intersections in such a way that b x f z represents the maximum breadth at x x f and z z regarding the setting of the vertical coordinate z of the waterline used for the transversal positioning of damage although different choices are in principle possible herein it has been decided to set z corresponding to the upper limit of the damage this means that if z b o t t o m is assumed to be the vertical coordinate for the ship bottom then a 3 z z b o t t o m l z p the above mentioned geometrical characterisation in particular the transversal positioning of the damage has been devised with the intention of reducing the occurrence of non contact cases i e generated breaches which eventually do not get in contact with the hull of the vessel fig a 1 geometrical parameters characterising bottom damages transversal yz view looking to the aft fig a 1 fig a 2 geometrical parameters characterising bottom

developed considering damage statistics for non full vessels bulian and francescutto 2011 papanikolaou et al 2011 imo 2012 zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 in case of accidents resulting in multiple breaches the damage characteristics of the probabilistic model correspond to an equivalent damage providing an envelope of the individual breaches papanikolaou et al 2011 imo 2012 zaraphonitis et al 2015 bulian et al 2016 the considered distributions for the damage characteristics are reported analytically in table a 1 table a 5 graphical representations of the corresponding cumulative distributions and probability density functions are reported in figs a 5 a 9 the reported distributions and associated parameters for the characteristics of damage are the result of an initial exploratory data analysis see in particular annex 2 in imo 2012 followed by the modelling and fitting of the distributions see in particular bulian and francescutto 2011 which were carried out during the goalds project damages are assumed to be generated in such a way that the forward end of the damage x f is distributed between x m i n and x m a x x m i n l s h i p for application to real vessels and in order to reduce the fraction of non contact cases it is suggested to set x m i n and x m a x at the extremities of the freeboard length of the vessel as specified by the international convention on load lines imo 2019d for simplicity of notation in specifying the distribution for x f see table a 1 it is assumed that the aft extremity is conventionally set at x m i n 0 in addition for simplicity of notation in specifying the distribution for the damage penetration see table a 5 the vertical position of the ship bottom is assumed to be conventionally positioned at z b o t t o m 0 all damage characteristics are assumed to be independent random variables in the framework of a regulatory assessment this is considered to be an acceptable approximation although it can lead with low probability to the occurrence of damage boxes with high aspect ratios it is however easy to introduce limitations in this respect if deemed necessary table a 1 bottom damage distribution of

from baseline ship size dependent model fig a 9 appendix b this appendix provides some summary information regarding the characteristics of the accidents databases that were used for the development of the bottom grounding and of the side grounding contact models described in the paper with reference to bottom grounding damages the development of the model described in the paper was originally carried out during the goalds project bulian and francescutto 2011 papanikolaou et al 2011 and imo 2012 provided details regarding the goalds accidents database and the statistical analysis that led to the development of the probabilistic models for the geometrical characteristics of bottom grounding damage furthermore zaraphonitis et al 2015 provided a detailed summary of the goalds bottom grounding model because the model was later used in the framework of the emsa 3 project taking into account the indications from bulian and francescutto 2012 regarding the transversal positioning of the damage the goalds database was created by extending the original harder project database see lützen 2001 through collection of additional casualty data see papanikolaou et al 2011 the full goalds database covered casualties that occurred worldwide over the period 1944 2009 and contained information on damage characteristics for both grounding and collision accidents the bottom grounding model intended for use for passenger ships described in the paper was developed by using a subset of data from the full goalds database in particular the model was developed by considering grounding accidents occurred to non full ships i e all vessels in the goalds database excluding tankers and bulk carriers full ships as indicated by bulian and francescutto 2011 papanikolaou et al 2011 and imo 2012 the dataset used for the development of the bottom grounding model for non full ships eventually comprised a total of 221 accidents with 22 accidents related to passenger ships for this dataset in most of the cases about 70 for which the accident area was reported the casualty occurred in coastal waters it should be noted however that not all breach data were available for each accident in the dataset this means that the number of available samples for the statistical analysis of each damage characteristic was in general smaller than the total size of the database details in this respect are given by bulian and francescutto 2011 and imo 2012 the side grounding contact model described in the paper was instead developed during the emsa 3 project which started after the end of the goalds project detailed descriptions of the background database and of the statistical analysis that led to the development of the probabilistic models for the geometrical characteristics of side grounding contact damage are provided by pagiaziti et al 2015 and by zaraphonitis et al 2015 the full emsa 3 database was intended for both the development of risk models as well as for the development of probabilistic models of side grounding contact damage characteristics with specific attention to passenger ships as a result the full emsa 3 database comprised information for a large number of accidents but only a subset of data contained sufficient information regarding the breach location and extent for effective use in the development of probabilistic models of side grounding contact damage characteristics as described by pagiaziti et al 2015 and by zaraphonitis et al 2015 the full emsa 3 database was created starting from data from the goalds project and the contiopt project eliopoulou et al 2013 the original datasets were extended in emsa 3 and already available data were revisited and when possible supplemented with additional information further data were gathered from databases sea web ihs markit 2020 and imo gisis imo 2020 from emsa 3 project partners from flag administrations and from other possible sources including an extensive internet search an effort was made to collect and analyse also relevant accidents investigation reports from a number of organizations collected casualty data for passenger and containerships in the emsa 3 database covered a casualty period from 1990 to 2012 considering vessels built on 1982 or later with at least 1 000 gross tonnage in case of passenger vessels ships with a length below 80 m were excluded furthermore passenger ships with froude number above 0 5 were also excluded to eliminate high speed craft the full emsa 3 database covered casualties that occurred worldwide the subset of data from the full emsa 3 database that was used for the development of the probabilistic models of side grounding contact damage characteristics for passenger ships comprised passenger ships and also container vessels the two types of ship were combined together in the statistical analysis in order to increase the number of available samples this was decided taking into account the results from the goalds project where passenger ships were shown to share a similar behaviour regarding grounding damage characteristics as the broader category of non full ships pagiaziti et al 2015 zaraphonitis et al 2015 the dataset used for the development of the side grounding contact model for non full ships eventually comprised a total of 63 accidents with 36 accidents related to passenger ships for this dataset in most of the cases about 65 for which the accident area was reported the casualty occurred in terminal areas it should be noted however that similarly to the case of the goalds database also in case of the emsa 3 database for side grounding contact damages not all breach data were available for each accident in the dataset this means that the number of available samples for the statistical analysis of each damage characteristic was in general smaller than the total size of the database details in this respect are given by pagiaziti et al 2015 and zaraphonitis et al 2015 appendix c
