22305,this study considers the effects of steady flow approximation in the analysis of ship maneuvering in waves to this end the ship motion due to waves is analyzed using the three dimensional time domain rankine panel method and the wave drift forces acting on a ship are calculated by applying the near field method to directly integrate the pressure on the hull surface in this seakeeping analysis the steady flow induced by the operation velocity of the ship is approximated by a uniform flow or double body flow the ship maneuvering in waves not only advances forward but also drifts and rotates hence it can be regarded as a lifting body therefore the vortex flow generated at the sharp end of the hull is also modeled and reflected in the steady flow approximation in order to investigate how the seakeeping performance is determined according to the approximation method ship motions and drift forces induced by waves are computed for the ship moving forward or obliquely lastly the numerical simulation for the turning test in a regular wave is performed based on the time domain direct coupling method based on the accuracies of computation results compared with existing experimental data the steady flow induced coupling effects between seakeeping and maneuvering quantities are discussed keywords ship maneuvering turning in waves steady flow approximation rankine panel method wave drift force 1 introduction in general the maneuvering performance of a ship in calm water has been a major concern in the ship design however since the ship is operated in real sea conditions with environmental loads it is necessary to analyze its maneuverability in waves in particular the marine environmental protection committee mepc a specialized committee of the international maritime organization imo proposed international regulations for the minimum power capability of ships in harsh environmental conditions imo 2015 to this end recently in the eu funded project energy efficient safe ship operation shopera and the joint r d project led by the japanese group many organizations have collaborated to conduct international studies on the ship s operation performance in actual sea conditions in particular in the shopera project comparative studies on computations of wave drift force and simulations for maneuvering tests in waves were carried out shigunov et al 2018 based on the comparison of results various analysis techniques from around the world for predicting the maneuverability of ship in waves were evaluated in addition the assessment procedure for the operation performance of ship in adverse ocean conditions was developed and the criteria for required propulsion and steering systems was established shigunov and papanikoloau 2015 for the problem of ship maneuvering in waves the low frequency maneuvering motion induced by propulsion and steering and the high frequency seakeeping motion induced by waves occur simultaneously in the past the seakeeping and maneuvering performance of ships was independently evaluated through a model test or numerical computation however in order to accurately predict the ship s operation in waves a unified analysis that considers the interaction between the two motions should be carried out the free running model test is the most reliable method to simulate the navigation of a ship in waves however it is not only costly to perform but there are also many uncertainties in the implementation of waves propulsion and steering in the experiment the discrepancies due to the scale effect between real and model ships could also be a problem on the other hand computational fluid dynamics cfd can be applied for evaluating the maneuverability of ships in waves a cfd based simulation has the advantage of directly considering the effect of fluid viscosity and the nonlinearities of wave and ship motion however a free running simulation based on cfd is still not in a mature status and still inefficient to be performed at the design stage owing to large computational costs therefore numerical simulation techniques are required to efficiently and accurately combine seakeeping and maneuvering performance the two time scale model is one of the most widely used methods for analyzing ship maneuvering in waves skejic and faltinsen 2008 yasukawa and nakayama 2009 the technique considers the effect of waves on the maneuverability of the ship by introducing a pre computed database of wave drift forces to a maneuvering equation of motion in this approach based on the assumption that the characteristic time scales of seakeeping and maneuvering motions are different δt maneuvering δt seakeeping the two types of motions are solved independently in separate equations of motion using the two time scale model the ship s operation performance in waves can be simulated efficiently however it is difficult to construct a database which considers all the parameters such as amplitude frequency incident wave direction and velocities of the ship forward slip and rotation speeds that determine seakeeping quantities in previous studies the database was simplified by assuming that the effects of slip and rotation speeds on wave drift force were negligible on the other hand there have been approaches describing ship motion in a single equation of motion to integrate both seakeeping and maneuvering performance bailey et al 1997 fossen 2005 in this approach which can be called a hybrid approach the equation of motion is expressed by hydrodynamic coefficients the seakeeping related coefficients are computed by the strip theory in frequency domain while the maneuvering related coefficients are obtained by model test results or empirical formulas in order to consider the memory effect of ship navigation on seakeeping quantities the retardation function was adopted based on the convolution integral however the seakeeping related hydrodynamic coefficient is a function of not only the resultant encounter wave frequency but also the steady velocity of the ship and the incident wave direction for the ship drifting and rotating by steering there are limitations in the construction of the retardation function that account for the memory effect induced by time varying parameters in addition the wave drift force which plays the most important role in the maneuverability of ships in waves was missing from previous studies in summary the coupling effects between seakeeping and maneuvering quantities cannot be fully taken into account in both the two time scale model and hybrid approach in particular the changes in seakeeping performance in accordance with steady flow maneuvering seakeeping coupling effect were not considered adnan and yasukawa 2008 conducted a model test for an obliquely moving containership and examined the effects of the hull drift angle on motion responses and wave drift forces also a numerical approach based on the strip theory was developed for the analysis on wave induced motions on a laterally drifting ship yasukawa et al 2010 therefore since the drift force can inversely affect the maneuverability of ships seakeeping maneuvering coupling effect the change in seakeeping quantities according to the maneuvering motion should also be considered for ships maneuvering in waves seo and kim 2011 proposed a time domain direct coupling method to overcome the limitations of previous approaches in their study the three dimensional rankine panel method rpm was applied to compute ship motions and wave drift forces and the resultant quantities were reflected in the maneuvering modeling group mmg based maneuvering equation in the seakeeping computation the steady flow due to time varying operation speeds was approximated as a uniform flow neumann kelvin nk linearization using a similar approach yen et al 2010 conducted maneuvering analysis of a ship in waves considering the nonlinear motion induced by hull geometry by extension zheng et al 2017 solved the boundary value problem bvp for seakeeping quantities by approximating steady flow as a double body db flow db linearization a vortex sheet was also introduced to analyze the db flow for a ship in maneuvering motions in the time domain direct coupling method since the seakeeping quantities computed by considering the operation velocity at a specific instant are reflected in the maneuvering motion the direct integration of the two motions is possible in addition there is an advantage in that memory effects such as the time evolution of disturbed waves around the ship can be strictly accounted for through time integration of free surface boundary conditions in the present study the effects of steady flow approximation on the analysis of ship maneuvering in waves are investigated the seakeeping quantities are computed by applying the time domain b spline based rpm the near field method i e the direct pressure integration method is used to calculate the wave drift force on the ship in this seakeeping analysis the steady flow induced by the ship s operation velocity is approximated by uniform flow or db flow when the db linearization is adopted a vortex sheet is introduced to model the vortex flow generated at the sharp corners of the hull for the different approximations of steady flow the influence of the hull drift angle on ship motions and drift forces induced by waves is examined based on the computation results for the ship moving forward or obliquely lastly the numerical simulation for the turning test in a regular wave is carried out based on the time domain direct coupling method of seo and kim 2011 the computed turning trajectories are validated by comparison with existing model test results based on the accuracy of simulation results relative to the experimental data the coupling effects of the approximated steady flow on the seakeeping and maneuvering quantities of the ship in turning test in waves are discussed 2 theoretical backgrounds 2 1 seakeeping analysis for ship in waves 2 1 1 boundary value problem in the present study in order to describe the ship motion due to waves three kinds of coordinate systems are adopted as shown in fig 1 the first is the earth fixed coordinate system o xyz and the second is the inertial coordinate system o x y z which moves with the steady velocity of a ship the last is the body fixed coordinate system o xyz that follows the wave induced ship motion the operation steady velocity is defined in the inertial coordinate system according to only the 3 degrees of freedom 3 dof speeds of ship forward u 0 slip v 0 and yaw rotation r 0 speeds as u 0 u 0 y r 0 v 0 x r 0 0 the effects of other dof speeds in heave roll and pitch directions assumed to be negligible here the problem domain is consists of the body and free surfaces s b and s f for an incident wave a ω and χ denote the amplitude frequency and incident direction respectively if the ship is assumed to be a rigid body then 6 dof motions are induced by waves translation ξ t ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 surge sway heave and rotation ξ r ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 roll pitch yaw according to the ship motion defined in the inertial coordinate system the linear displacement can be defined as δ x t δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 ξ t t ξ r t x in the seakeeping analysis a bvp can be defined according to the linear potential theory based on the assumption of irrotational flow with incompressible and inviscid fluid the velocity potential φ satisfies the following governing equation and boundary conditions in the inertial coordinate system 1 2 φ 0 in fluid domain 2 φ n u 0 n δ t n on s b 3 d d t φ z ζ x y t 0 on z ζ x y t 4 d φ d t g ζ 1 2 φ φ on z ζ x y t where ζ and n denote the wave elevation at the free surface and normal vector for the body surface respectively for the linearization of bvp the total velocity potential and wave elevation are decomposed as follows 5 φ x t φ x φ i x t φ d x t 6 ζ x t ζ i x t ζ d x t where ф is the steady potential induced by the operation velocity in the linear analysis the steady flow related components are assumed to be in the order of o 1 zeroth order component on the other hand the subscripts i and d denote the components related to incident and disturbed waves respectively the order of these wave components is o ε in the boundary value problem all linear quantities are assumed proportional to the amplitude of incident wave the value of ε indicates a same order magnitude compared to a in other words linear quantities are assumed to be smaller than the zeroth order component and the order of ε represents the order of variables first order linear and second order components etc then by substituting eqs 5 and 6 into eqs 2 4 the boundary conditions can be linearized in the present study the linearization was performed with respect to the body fixed coordinate system o xyz considering wave induced ship motion and velocity in the boundary conditions which was originally proposed by hachmann 1991 details of the linear seakeeping and added resistance analysis by means of body fixed coordinate system can be found in shao and faltinsen 2012 according to how the steady potential is approximated the linearization methods can be classified as listed in table 1 here s b and n 0 denote the surface and normal vector for the mean body respectively also u 1 is the first order linear velocity of ship which includes changes in the angle of attack due to rotational motion in the nk linearization the steady flow is assumed to be a uniform flow which is appropriate for a high speed slender body because of the simple approximation the actual trend of steady flow is not reflected in the boundary conditions especially in free surface boundary conditions all the steady flow induced coupling effects are represented only by the galilean transform d d t t u on the other hand in the db linearization the steady flow is regarded as a db flow which is suitable for a low speed blunt ship unlike uniform flow the flow has a tendency of steady flow along the hull geometry as shown in fig 2 therefore in the linearized boundary conditions all the coupling effects of steady flow are represented by the spatial derivatives of db potential the greatest advantage of linearization with respect to the body fixed coordinate system is that the second derivatives of steady potential do not exist in the body boundary condition since the well known m j term which represents the coupling effects between the steady flow and radiation components of unsteady solution in the inertial coordinate system includes the second derivatives it is difficult to evaluate the term accurately in numerical computation without considerations for the m j term the reliable numerical analysis can be performed in the body fixed coordinate system however there is a 2φ z2 related term in the free surface boundary condition which denotes the effect of steady flow on the distribution of disturbed waves the term should be evaluated in detail for the accurate seakeeping computations of ships moving at a certain steady velocity the effect of steady flow approximation on seakeeping analysis can be found in lee et al 2017 to solve the derived bvp green s second identity is applied as follows 7 φ d s b φ d g n d s s f φ d n g d s s b g φ d n d s s f φ d g n d s the rankine sources g 1 r are distributed to the discretized body and free surfaces then eq 7 can be converted into an algebraic equation for unknown strengths of the source and dipole velocity potential and its normal flux by adopting time integration to the free surface boundary conditions the instantaneous wave elevation and velocity potential at the free surface can be computed in the present time domain rpm these variables are evaluated based on the b spline basis function to enhance the accuracy of the numerical solution details of the present rankine panel method can be found in kim et al 2011 2 1 2 equation of seakeeping motion the ship motions due to waves can be computed by solving the following 6 dof equations of motion 8 m ξ f f k f res f h d where m is the mass matrix of the ship f f k and f res are the froude krylov and restoring forces respectively and f h d denotes the hydrodynamic force due to disturbed wave and ship motion the forces acting on the ship are computed by the integration of pressure along the mean body surface first the hydrodynamic force can be obtained by integrating the pressure induced by disturbed wave which is the solution of linearized bvp as follows 9 f h d j ρ s b φ d t u 0 φ φ d u 1 φ n j 0 d s ρ s b φ t u 0 1 2 φ φ n j 1 d s for j 1 2 6 here n j 1 indicate the first order linear normal vector due to rotational motion such that 10 n j 1 ξ r n 0 j for j 1 2 3 ξ r x n 0 j 3 for j 4 5 6 it should be noted that the terms of steady potential along with ship motion represent the steady flow induced coupling effects on the radiation force the effects of m j term on the hydrodynamic force in the inertial coordinate system those effects are neglected in the nk linearization in the same way the froude krylov force can be evaluated for the mean body surface by integration of the pressure due to incident wave as follows 11 f f k j ρ s b φ i t u 0 φ φ i n j 0 d s for j 1 2 6 also the restoring force is obtained by integrating the hydrostatic pressure gz which can be expressed by the linear restoring coefficient f res j c j k ξ k 2 1 3 prediction for wave drift force the near field method is applied for the prediction of the wave drift force in which the second order force is obtained by the direct integration of second order pressure along the body surface the second order pressure can be derived by the perturbation of physical and geometrical variables with respect to the mean body the resultant pressure is expressed by the quadratic components of linear variables like in bvp and the computation of linear hydrodynamic force the body fixed coordinate system is applied for the evaluation of wave drift force the derived total force can be expressed by components as follows 12 f wave j i i i i i i i v for j 1 2 6 where i ρ g 2 w l ζ δ 3 2 n j 0 sin α d l ρ g w l ζ 0 ζ δ 3 n j 1 sin α d l i i ρ s b 1 2 φ i φ d φ i φ d n j 0 d s i i i ρ s b t u 0 φ φ i φ d u 1 φ g

indicates the incline angle which is the angle between hull surface and mean free surface by introducing the correction based on the angle 1 sinα the force induced by the variation of the wetted surface in waves is considered more accurately it should be noted that there are no terms in this formula that are expressed by the second derivatives of steady or unsteady potentials unlike the near field method for the inertial coordinate system kim and kim 2011 therefore it is possible to evaluate the wave drift force numerically stable the temporal mean of the second order force denotes the drift force induced by waves 2 2 maneuvering analysis for ship in waves 2 2 1 equation of maneuvering motion in general in order to describe the maneuvering motion of the ship both the space fixed coordinate system o xyz and the body fixed coordinate system o xyz are used as shown in fig 3 the relation between the two coordinate systems can be expressed as follows 13 x x cos ψ 0 t y sin ψ 0 t x 0 t y x sin ψ 0 t y cos ψ 0 t y 0 t z z where x 0 t and y 0 t represent the global position of ship at time t the yaw angle ψ 0 indicates the angle between the two coordinates and the rudder angle δ for portside turning z direction is defined as a positive value the incident wave direction is defined as χ in the space fixed coordinate system the modular type 4 dof equations of motion is adopted to compute the maneuvering motion of the ship as follows 14 m u 0 v 0 r 0 x h x p x r x linear x w m v 0 u 0 r 0 y h y r y linear y w i x x p 0 k h k r k linear k w i z z r 0 n h n r k linear k w where m i xx and i zz denote the mass and moments of inertias in the x and z directions respectively x and y are the forces in surge and sway directions and k and n are the moments in roll and yaw directions respectively the subscripts h p and r indicate the hydrodynamic force due to hull propulsion and steering respectively the wave induced force is decomposed of the first order linear and second order w forces a brief description for each force component is given below 2 2 1 1 hull hydrodynamic force the hull hydrodynamic force can be expressed using hydrodynamic coefficients as follows 15 x h r u 0 x u u 0 x v v v 0 2 x v r y v v 0 r 0 x r r r 0 2 y h y v v 0 y v v 0 y r x u u 0 r 0 y v v v v 0 3 y v v r v 0 2 r 0 y v r r v 0 r 0 2 y r r r r 0 3 k h z h y h n h n r r 0 n v v 0 n r r 0 n v v v v 0 3 n v v r v 0 2 r 0 n v r r v 0 r 0 2 n r r r r 0 3 the terms are divided into two components potential flow induced components wave making related term and viscous flow induced components viscous resistance lift force etc it is difficult to numerically calculate the wave making components accurately at a relatively low operation velocity owing the very short steady waves therefore for hull hydrodynamic forces such as calm water resistance r and maneuvering derivatives y v y r n v n r and the nonlinear components the total values are estimated based on the existing mmg model yasukawa and nakayama 2009 without dividing the two components 2 2 1 2 propulsion and steering forces the propulsion and steering forces are also estimated using the mmg model in which the two forces are modeled independently the hydrodynamic force by propeller can be obtained as 16 x p 1 t p ρ n p 2 d p 4 k t where k t j p j t 0 j t 1 j p j t 2 j p 2 here t p n p and d p indicate the thrust deduction factor revolution speed and diameter of the propeller respectively the thrust coefficient k t is approximated by second order polynomials with respect to the advance ratio j p u 0 1 w p n p d p also the effective wake fraction w p is modeled by the wake fraction for a ship moving in a straight line w p0 and the drift angle at the location of the propeller β p β 0 x p r 0 the hydrodynamic force due to steering is expressed as 17 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ k r z r y r n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where x r and z r denote the coordinates of the rudder center in the x and z directions respectively t r a h and x h are the coefficients to model the interaction between the hull and rudder f n indicates the rudder normal force expressed as 18 f n 1 2 ρ a r u r 2 6 13 λ r λ r 2 25 sin α r where a r and λ r are the profile area and aspect ratio of rudder and u r and α r are the total speed and direction of flow into the rudder respectively the inflow velocity is estimated by considering the characteristics of the wake near the rudder and the flow straightening phenomena due to the presence of the hull and propeller slip stream more details on the modeling of propulsion and steering forces can be found in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 2 2 1 3 wave induced force the wave induced linear force in eqs 9 and 11 and the second order force in eq 12 obtained through the seakeeping computation are adopted for the maneuvering equation in particular by introducing the linear wave induced force the oscillatory operation velocity of ship with high frequency can be directly computed and the oscillatory behaviors can be reflected into the boundary value problem of seakeeping analysis it is important in the seakeeping maneuvering coupling method that the linear wave induced force and maneuvering force in eq 15 should not overlap in other words since the hull hydrodynamic force obtained by the mmg model already includes the wave making related component the steady force should be neglected in the linear force from the seakeeping computation for this purpose when solving the bvp the terms related to steady flow of o 1 zeroth order analysis φ t u 0 1 2 φ φ are excluded from the dynamic free surface boundary condition in table 1 in this way only the unsteady wave induced force can be introduced into the equation for maneuvering motion 2 2 2 seakeeping maneuvering coupling analysis in the present study the high frequency wave induced motion and low frequency maneuvering motion directly interact in the time domain according to the coupling method proposed by seo and kim 2011 the two kinds of motions were obtained by solving the equations of motion in the seakeeping and maneuvering modules as summarized in fig 4 the explanations for each module and the coupling effect on the other modules are given below 2 2 2 1 seakeeping module the linearized bvp is defined for the operation velocity of the ship by applying rpm the bvp is solved to obtain the wave induced motion and force then the seakeeping quantities are transferred to the maneuvering module the time evolution of disturbed waves is considered through the time integration of free surface boundary conditions in other words the memory effect induced by the seakeeping performance of the ship is considered in the time domain and reflected to the resultant seakeeping quantities then the wave induced force is adopted into the maneuvering equation to evaluate the drift effect on the maneuverability of the ship in waves seakeeping maneuvering coupling effect 2 2 2 2 maneuvering module in the maneuvering module the global position and steady velocity of the ship are calculated by solving the 4 dof motion equations considering external forces including the wave force the bvp in the seakeeping module is redefined according to the changed operation velocity the effect of steady flow on the unsteady flow is also re analyzed in other words all the terms related to steady potential in the boundary conditions and in the equations for wave force varied depending on the steady velocity therefore the wave induced motion and force are affected by the changes in steady flow induced coupling effects maneuvering seakeeping coupling effect this coupling procedure is continuously repeated in the time domain so that the seakeeping and maneuvering quantities are directly integrated however since the time scale of the maneuvering motion is generally larger than that of the seakeeping motion the analysis of steady flow is performed at a certain time interval to reduce computational costs 2 2 3 steady flow analysis for a ship maneuvering in waves the steady flow should be analyzed considering the time varying operation velocity in the nk linearization the approximation of steady flow is quite simple since only the steady velocity in the boundary conditions needs to be updated in the time domain on the other hand in the db linearization the db flow should be computed repeatedly according to the following boundary conditions 19 φ n u 0 n on s b 20 φ z 0 on z 0 it is important to note that the ship in maneuvering motion is a lifting body not only with forward speed but also with slip and rotation speeds therefore at the sharp ends of the bow and stern regions vortex flows occur in the opposite direction of flow along the hull as shown in fig 5 thus it is necessary to reflect the characteristics of vortex flow in the steady flow approximation to realize the vortex flow in potential based computation a singularity should be adopted to model of the rotational flow around the ship in this study the mixed source and dipole method of morino and kuo 1974 was adopted to analyze the db flow as follows 21 φ s b φ n g φ g n d s s w δ φ g n d s where g is the sum of the rankine source and its image source g 1 r 1 r in addition to the dipole flow in which strength is defined by the db potential an additional dipole flow was modeled by introducing the vortex sheet s w to satisfy the kutta condition the strength of the dipole flow δφ can be defined as 22 δ φ φ u φ l as shown in fig 5 φu and φl indicate the potentials at the end panels of the pressure side and suction side respectively in other words over the vortex sheet the dipole strength is determined by the potential jump φu φl based on kelvin s theorem details on the panel method for vortex flow analysis can be found in lee 1987 3 analysis results 3 1 ship model the s175 containership was chosen as the ship model for numerical computations the principal dimensions of the model are listed in table 2 for applications of the rankine panel method quadrilateral panels were distributed for the body surface approximately 2 000 panels and the free surface 6 000 panels as shown in fig 6 also an o type free surface panels were applied to take into account the various directions of incident wave during maneuvering simulation the radius of entire problem domain is five times the wavelength and the outer region for twice the wavelength was set as the artificial damping zone to satisfy the radiation condition it should be noted that the water plane has sharp edges at the bow and stern regions and also a bilge vortex can be generated at the sharp keel therefore in order to model the vortex flows at the tips an additional vortex sheets were applied as shown in fig 7 especially for the vortex sheet of the trailing edge the sheet distribution was determined based on the quasi steady assumption that vortex shedding occurs following a certain angle θ wake matsui et al 1994 defined the vortex distribution angle by the steady velocity of the ship as follows 23 θ wake tan 1 v 0 r 0 x u 0 r 0 y 3 2 analysis on steady flow and its coupling effects 3 2 1 double body flow first the steady flow which will be the basis of seakeeping computation was analyzed fig 8 shows the db flow used to approximate the steady flow in the db linearization when the ship moves in a straight line with only the forward speed the db flow is symmetrical with respect to the centerline on the other hand when the ship moves obliquely with a certain drift angle β 0 tan 1 v 0 u 0 the potential value asymmetric owing to the slip speed and rotational flows occur in the direction of incidence along the hull at the bow and stern tips if the db flow is computed without introducing an additional vortex sheet the stagnation point is located not on the end of hull but on the opposite side of the flow inlet where the streamlines are concentrated this tendency intensified at the bow region the position of the stagnation point is different from the actual phenomenon where the viscosity of fluid exists which means that the rotational flow at the tips is excessively evaluated the divergent corner flow behavior physically owing to the fluid viscosity the vortex flow occurs in the direction of suppressing the incident rotational flow by adopting the vortex sheet to model these characteristics of actual flow it can be seen that the stagnation point moves to the tip of the hull the severe rotational flow is attenuated and the value of the db potential is reduced compared with the case without the vortex sheet in other words the db flow for the linearization of bvp is stabilized by considering the vortex flow actually by using the potential theory based approach the portion of calm water maneuvering force such as a wave making component can be computed also many researchers insisted that the calm water sway force and yaw moment acting on the ship in maneuvering motions can be calculated through the modeling of vortex flow based on the 3d panel method matsui et al 1994 greeley and willemann 2013 however the strong sensitivity with respect to the shape and distribution of vortex sheets were confirmed also it was difficult to accurately obtain the higher order maneuvering derivatives for large drift angles or rotation speeds in order to verify the accuracy of calm water maneuvering forces computed by the present double body flow based modeling the computation results for static drift test were compared with those obtained from the existing mmg model which was established based on the captive model test yasukawa and nakayama 2009 as shown in fig 9 the sway force computed by the double body flow model showed similar tendencies with those obtained by the mmg model however as the drift angle increases the discrepancies between the two results intensified since the double body flow model cannot account the nonlinear characteristics of calm water force accurately on the other hand the yaw moment of which the nonlinearities with respect to drift angle is not significant for the present ship model showed large discrepancies even for a small drift angle this is because the sway force is determined by the overall trend of steady flow while the yaw moment is greatly affected by the local vortex flow which is difficult to be evaluated strictly in the potential theory based computations as mentioned in sec 2 2 1 therefore in the present study the total calm water force was not computed from the double body flow model but obtained from the existing mmg model because of inaccuracies of the 3d panel method for the present ship model the purpose of introducing the vortex sheet in this study is to improve the reliability and accuracy of seakeeping computations instead of calculating the maneuvering derivatives through the modeling of the influences of fluid viscosity the coupling effect of steady flow on the unsteady solution is valid only in the vicinity of the hull hence the analysis of vortex shedding is not important the dipole flow 1 r n decreased sharply as the distance from the hull increased as shown in fig 8 the nonphysical stagnation points and severe rotational flow are located at a distance of l 32 from the end of the bow therefore if the length of the vortex sheet is greater than l 32 then the db flow is sufficiently stabilized in conclusion since the sensitivity of numerical solutions to sheet length is very low the sheet in the range of l 16 l 4 is introduced 3 2 2 effects of steady velocity on seakeeping quantities the effects of steady velocity on seakeeping quantities are summarized in fig 10 first the resonance region of ship motion is determined by the incident wave encounter frequency depending on the operation velocity of the ship and incident wave direction furthermore owing to the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force represented by the steady potential in eq 9 equivalent to the effect of m j term in the inertia coordinate system the ship motion is affected by the steady velocity according to the resultant ship motion the distribution of the disturbed wave and wave drift force are also varied this hydrodynamic force reflected along with the motion response first order velocity of ship is effective in the resonance and long wave regions where the ship motion significantly occurs however the drift force can be also varied according to the steady velocity even in the short wave region where the ship motion is negligible the waterline integral term i of eq 12 which is the main component of the wave drift force depends on the elevation of the disturbed wave along the hull the magnitude of the disturbed wave around the hull is affected by distribution of the second derivative of the steady potential according to the free surface boundary condition it should be noted that the 2φ z 2 related term is reflected along with the incident and disturbed waves into the kinematic free surface b c in table 1 therefore this steady flow induced coupling effect is valid for the entire wavelength region fig 11 shows the distribution of the second order derivative in the z direction similar to the db potential the derivative is also symmetrical when the ship moves forward case 1 while asymmetric distribution is confirmed when the ship drifts case 2 according to the free surface boundary condition in the region where 2φ z 2 has a positive value the disturbed wave intensifies while the wave is attenuated in the region of negative value when ship moves straight in a head wave the disturbed bow wave occurs strongly and the stern wave is reduced owing to the forward speed which results in an increase in added resistance wave drift surge force in a beam wave the yaw drift moment acting on the bow of the ship in clockwise direction increases owing to the intensified bow wave while the counterclockwise moment on the stern decreases owing to the attenuated stern wave as a result the clockwise drift moment acts more strongly compared with the zero speed case on the other hand when the ship moves obliquely with a certain negative drift angle it can be seen that the positive 2φ z 2 value is widely distributed near the portside of the ship even in the head wave condition therefore the clockwise yaw moment could act on the ship because the disturbed wave is generated strongly near the portside of the bow region for a beam wave when the ship drifts toward the incident wave according to the slip speed as shown in b of fig 11 the drift sway force in y direction increases this can also be explained through the intensified disturbed waves at the portside these steady flow induced coupling effects on the wave drift force can be considered when db linearization method is applied while the effects are ignored in the nk linearization if the boundary value problem is linearized with respect to the steady ship wave the coupling effects can be captured more accurately 3 3 seakeeping analysis results in order to examine the effect of operation velocity on seakeeping quantities the seakeeping computation was performed for the ship moving not only forward but also obliquely as summarized in table 3 in the simulation the steady velocity of the ship and incident wave direction were kept constant 3 3 1 motion response fig 12 shows the computation results of the motion response induced by a regular wave ω n in the figure is the natural frequency of each motion ω n c m a where c m and a denote the restoring mass and added mass coefficients of the degree also its location indicates the wavelength ratio where the natural frequency is equal to the encounter wave frequency ω e ω k u o c o s χ k v o sin χ for the ship moving forward fn 0 15 and β 0 0 0 therefore a resonance of each motion occurs near the corresponding wavelength ratio when the ship moves obliquely at a certain drift angle 6 dof motions occurs even in a head wave owing to the asymmetric properties of steady flow the vertical motions obtained based on the nk linearization were significantly overestimated near the resonance regions for degrees of heave and pitch compared with those from the db linearization this is because the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force is neglected without considering the tendencies of steady flow near the bow and stern regions therefore inaccurate hydrodynamic coefficients and resultant motion responses are provided in the nk linearization kim and shin 2007 the influence of the drift angle slip speed on vertical motion is not significant in both linearization schemes on the other hand the roll motion generated by asymmetric steady flow becomes larger as the drift angle increases in nk linearization the asymmetric coupling effect was approximated simply based on uniform flow so that the roll motion was underestimated compared with that from the db linearization in addition when db linearization was applied the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force varied depending on whether the vortex sheet was introduced or not therefore the predicted results for roll motion are also slightly different in a beam wave not only the roll motion but also the heave and pitch motions varied according to the drift angle this is because the incident wave encounter frequency changes owing to the slip speed the ship under a negative drift angle travels toward the incident wave thus increasing the encounter frequency therefore it can be confirmed that resonant heave and pitch motions occur for a longer wave in the case of roll motion the response to a short wave increases slightly owing to the asymmetric property of steady flow however in a long wave the motion is reduced for a larger drift angle because the resonance region for a roll degree shifts to the longer wave region λ l for ω n ω e 2 90 3 12 when β 0 0 0 10 0 the discrepancies in motion responses between the two linearization methods can be also seen in the beam wave condition owing to the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force however the modeling of vortex flow does not cause a significant difference because the effect of the incident wave itself on the side of the ship is more dominant than those of the asymmetric steady flow in conclusion it can be confirmed that the motion response is determined according to the operation velocity because of not only the influence of encounter wave frequency but also the steady flow flow induced coupling effects 3 3 2 wave drift force next the computation results for the wave drift force acting on the ship in regular head waves are compared according to the operation velocity and linearization method as shown in fig 13 the forward speed greatly influences the wave drift surge force that is the added resistance due to the wave since the heave and pitch motions in the resonance region are opposite in phase to the incident wave the waterline integral term i which depends on the relative wave elevation is increased by the resonant motions at faster forward speed the resonant motions are greater compared with the zero speed case so that the added resistance also increases based on the db linearization the added resistance also increased owing to the forward speed because of the effect of the 2φ z 2 related term in the free surface b c on disturbed waves as explained in sec 3 2 2 as with vertical motion the asymmetric steady flow due to the drift angle has no significant effect on the added resistance also computation results of the different linearization methods were similar on the other hand the wave drift sway force and yaw moment of the existing seakeeping model test for an obliquely moving ship adnan and yasukawa 2008 increased for a larger drift angle when the nk linearization was applied the computed drift force and moment were significantly underestimated compared to the experiment since the coupling effects induced by asymmetrical steady flow was not strictly taken into account the results of the db linearization techniques were also quite small but the tendency to increase with the drift angle was similar to the experimental data as explained in sec 3 2 2 when a ship moves obliquely with a negative drift angle it is physically evident that the negative yaw moment acted on the ship in the head wave condition in addition the values of drift force and moment slightly increased when the modeling for the vortex flow generated at the sharp tips of ship was adopted however there were limitations in computations of wave drift force based on the double body flow linearization therefore the linearization based on the nonlinear steady flow and the modeling of vortex flow in free surface will be required to consider the steady flow induced coupling effects more strictly in the future greely and willemann 2013 as shown in fig 14 when the ship moves forward in a beam wave condition the positive added resistance acts on the ship in a short wave due to the intensified disturbed waves at the bow region however when the nk linearization technique was applied the added resistance was extremely underestimated the negative force that pushes the ship forward this is because the coupling effect of steady flow was missing and the disturbed wave around the hull was inaccurately predicted this tendency intensified when the ship moves obliquely on the other hand the differences of computation results according to the drift angle were very small in both the experimental data and those of the db linearization technique the forward speed also affected the wave drift yaw moment compared with the case of zero speed the disturbed bow waves on the portside increased and the resultant negative moment acted on the ship this tendency can be clearly confirmed in results of the db linearization which accounts for the steady flow induced coupling effect more strictly in the both linearization methods however the wave drift yaw moments were underestimated compared to the experimental data this is because neither method accurately reflected the tendency of local steady flow near the bow region which can significantly affect the overall value of the yaw moment for the wave drift sway force when the nk linearization was introduced the computed force was also inaccurate for a short wave in particular since the ship drifts toward the incident wave the magnitude of the sway force should increase compared with the case with only the forward speed however it was confirmed that the magnitude decreased as the slip speed increased this nonphysical prediction was also resulted from the inaccurate evaluation of disturbed waves around the hull on the other hand the tendency to increase for a larger drift angle can be seen both in the experimental data and the results of db linearization because the disturbed waves on the portside increase according to the distribution of 2φ z2 however under the beam wave condition since the influence of the wave itself acting on the side of the vessel was dominant rather than the asymmetry of steady flow the introduction of the vortex sheets did not have much effect on the computation results overall it was confirmed that the db linearization method which consider the characteristics of steady flow of the drifting ship more strictly rather than the nk linearization showed similar tendencies with the model tests results in addition the modeling for vortex flow from sharp tips of a hull is related to stability of numerical solutions fig 15 shows the seakeeping computation result based on the double body linearization without introducing a vortex sheet for a relatively large drift angle β 0 20 0 it can be confirmed that the disturbed wave near the bow region is overestimated the location of the divergent wave is the same as the non physical stagnation point of double body flow computed without the vortex flow modeling in other words when the linearization of boundary value problem based on the rapidly rotating basis flow was performed the unsteady solutions diverged due to unstable coupling effects of steady flow therefore the considerations for vortex flow was necessary for a stable numerical analysis on the seakeeping performance of the ship under large maneuvering motions 3 4 maneuvering analysis results the numerical turning test in regular waves was performed by applying the time domain maneuvering seakeeping direct coupling method the maneuvering equation of motion was established based on the mmg model constructed by existing research yasukawa and nakayama 2009 in previous work a free running experiment in calm water was carried out for a turning test under a certain rudder angle δ 35 0 and the maneuvering coefficients and modeling for propulsion and steering in the mmg model were verified by comparing the trajectories of the model test and numerical simulation as shown in fig 16 it was confirmed that the result of the present coupling method based on the same mmg model is quite similar to that obtained by solving only the maneuvering equation this indicates that the components related to the wave making resistance do not overlap between the seakeeping module and the mmg model therefore when the coupling method is applied for the simulation in waves the wave effects on the maneuverability of the ship can be evaluated in comparison with the calm water case table 4 lists the simulation conditions for the ship maneuvering in regular waves in the simulations the revolution speed of the propeller was set to a value that can achieve the reference speed v ref fn 0 150 in calm water as in the previous model test the steering starts when a wave trough is located at midship in addition the convergent speed and attitude of the ship in the course keeping model test in the previous study were introduced as the initial condition to exclude transient effects before the steering begins in other words in a head wave the initial speed was determined by considering the speed loss due to the added resistance in a beam wave the convergent drift angle and yaw angle to maintain the straight path were also reflected in the initial condition in fig 17 the simulation results are compared with existing model test results overall the trajectories of the experiment and computation results are in good agreement in the present numerical simulations based on the direct coupling method the time evolution of disturbed waves can be captured through the time integration of free surface boundary conditions as shown in fig 18 however it can be seen that the turning radius obtained from the simulation is slightly smaller this trend can be also confirmed in the calm water case fig 15 which seems to be maintained in the trajectories in waves for a shorter wave λ l 0 7 all steady flow approximation methods yielded similar turning trajectories while the discrepancies between the trajectories intensified for longer waves as examined in sec 3 2 the coupling effect of steady flow such as steady flow induced hydrodynamic force and 2φ z 2 related term in free surface b c are strongly reflected into seakeeping quantities for the wave condition where large ship motion and disturbed wave occur therefore according to how the steady flow was approximated the differences between the maneuvering quantities were also confirmed for longer waves especially in beam and following waves since the wave drift force and moment acting on the ship moving obliquely and rotating are significantly different between the linearization techniques the discrepancies intensified as turning proceeded in fig 19 for the wave condition of λ l 1 0 where the greatest discrepancies between the results of different steady flow approximations the time series of operation velocity wave induced motion and wave drift force are compared as the portside turning progresses the drift angle and rotating speed show the oscillatory behaviors caused by the wave force and the amplitude of ship motion varies over time according to the change in the steady velocity of ship and incident wave direction when comparing the results of the nk and db linearization methods it can be seen that there exists a slight phase difference between the time series this phase lag intensifies over time because the simulations progress for the different resultant operation velocities owing to different wave drifts force and moments in order to clarify the reasons for discrepancies between turning trajectories the time series of linear wave induced force of eqs 9 and 11 and wave drift force of eq 12 were investigated according to the linearization methods in the maneuvering test since the temporal mean of the wave force continuously varies according to the operation velocity of the ship and the incident wave direction the drift force was evaluated by the interval mean of the second order wave force for 10 wave periods it should be noted that the linear wave induced force which is obtained by solving the re defined bvp according to the oscillatory time varying operation velocity of ship has a non zero temporal mean therefore the effects of linear force were also evaluated by the interval mean like those of wave drift force in the case of linear wave force the amplitude is very large so even after the interval mean is applied the force signal shows the oscillatory behaviors with the wave period in the case of surge drift force all linearization methods produced similar results while the sway force and yaw moment were different in the nk linearization method for slip and rotation speeds the force and moment were underestimated owing to the simple approximation of steady flow on the other hand in the db linearization the introduction of the vortex sheet does not have much effect on the wave drift force and moment however for the linear wave induced sway force and yaw moment non zero mean values varied greatly depending on the steady flow approximation method this phenomena denote that the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force can cause the wave drift effects owing to the time varying operation velocity of ship this tendency intensified for the yaw moment because the disturbed wave and resultant wave forces at the hull end varied according to the modeling of local vortex flow finally the maneuvering indices in the turning test were observed in this study the advance ad value of x when the yaw angle is 90 0 and tactical diameter td value of y when the yaw angle is 180 0 were evaluated also in order to assess how much the ship is drifted by a wave during the turning the drifting distance d drift was also computed the drifting distance can be defined as follows 24 d drift 1 2 x 450 x 90 2 y 450 y 90 2 x 540 x 180 2 y 540 y 180 2 here the subscript of position variable indicates the yaw angle of the ship as shown in fig 20 generally as the wavelength becomes longer for a certain wave height the wave drift sway force and yaw moment are reduced so that the drifting distance also decreases the maneuvering indices and the drifting distance in turning test were compared in fig 21 in the portside turning test the negative yaw moment acted on ship owing to the operation velocity which suppressed the turning however in the present numerical computation based on the rankine panel method the rotation was less delayed owing to the underestimated yaw moment therefore the advance and tactical diameter were underestimated this tendency intensified for initial beam waves in the initial speed is relatively fast due to the small added resistance and speed loss in other word the above errors occurred since the steady flow induced coupling effects on the drift yaw moment were not strictly considered in the future the research is required to enhance the accuracy of the drift moment prediction for a variety of operation velocities of ship and incident wave directions furthermore the drifting distance varied according to the steady flow approximations especially when the double body flow is accounted for more strictly by the modeling for local vortex flow the drifting distance increases during the delayed turning owing to the negative moment in conclusion the predictability of how much the ship in the turning was drifted by waves was determined by accuracies of the evaluation of steady flow induced coupling effects and resultant seakeeping quantities such as the wave drift force 4 conclusions in this study the coupling effects of steady flow on the seakeeping and maneuvering quantities of the ship under steering in waves were investigated to this end the seakeeping analysis was carried out for the ship moving forward or obliquely numerical simulations were also performed for the turning test in regular waves based on the computation results the following conclusions are made it was confirmed that seakeeping quantities such as ship motion and wave drift force varied according to not only the forward speed but also the slip speed because of the asymmetric coupling effects of steady flow in the nk linearization the influence of the asymmetric steady flow induced by the hull drift angle is approximated by a uniform flow in which the resultant asymmetric seakeeping quantities such as roll motion wave drift sway force and yaw moment are underestimated when the double body flow which was stabilized by the modeling of vortex flow at the hull end was used for a basis flow more reliable and accurate computations for wave drift force and moment can be made compared to the case of nk linearization the accuracy of turning simulation results compared with the experimental data is closely related to the prediction for wave drift forces in particular reliable computations of yaw moment are required to accurately predict the shape of the turning trajectory and the drifting distance by waves in the future the computation of wave drift force should be validated for various operation velocities of the ship and incident wave directions by comparison with model tests results in order to consider the steady flow induced coupling effect in more detail more advanced linearization techniques with respect to the nonlinear steady flow or the incident wave weak scatter model are required also the enhanced modellings of vortex flows generated in the unsteady solutions induced by waves and ship motions as well as in the free surface of steady flow should be considered lastly in addition to the seakeeping maneuvering coupling effects considered in this study the propulsion and steering performance of ship can also be changed owing to the effects of wave and ship motion therefore the mmg model should be improved for applications in wave conditions considering those coupling effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

22305,this study considers the effects of steady flow approximation in the analysis of ship maneuvering in waves to this end the ship motion due to waves is analyzed using the three dimensional time domain rankine panel method and the wave drift forces acting on a ship are calculated by applying the near field method to directly integrate the pressure on the hull surface in this seakeeping analysis the steady flow induced by the operation velocity of the ship is approximated by a uniform flow or double body flow the ship maneuvering in waves not only advances forward but also drifts and rotates hence it can be regarded as a lifting body therefore the vortex flow generated at the sharp end of the hull is also modeled and reflected in the steady flow approximation in order to investigate how the seakeeping performance is determined according to the approximation method ship motions and drift forces induced by waves are computed for the ship moving forward or obliquely lastly the numerical simulation for the turning test in a regular wave is performed based on the time domain direct coupling method based on the accuracies of computation results compared with existing experimental data the steady flow induced coupling effects between seakeeping and maneuvering quantities are discussed keywords ship maneuvering turning in waves steady flow approximation rankine panel method wave drift force 1 introduction in general the maneuvering performance of a ship in calm water has been a major concern in the ship design however since the ship is operated in real sea conditions with environmental loads it is necessary to analyze its maneuverability in waves in particular the marine environmental protection committee mepc a specialized committee of the international maritime organization imo proposed international regulations for the minimum power capability of ships in harsh environmental conditions imo 2015 to this end recently in the eu funded project energy efficient safe ship operation shopera and the joint r d project led by the japanese group many organizations have collaborated to conduct international studies on the ship s operation performance in actual sea conditions in particular in the shopera project comparative studies on computations of wave drift force and simulations for maneuvering tests in waves were carried out shigunov et al 2018 based on the comparison of results various analysis techniques from around the world for predicting the maneuverability of ship in waves were evaluated in addition the assessment procedure for the operation performance of ship in adverse ocean conditions was developed and the criteria for required propulsion and steering systems was established shigunov and papanikoloau 2015 for the problem of ship maneuvering in waves the low frequency maneuvering motion induced by propulsion and steering and the high frequency seakeeping motion induced by waves occur simultaneously in the past the seakeeping and maneuvering performance of ships was independently evaluated through a model test or numerical computation however in order to accurately predict the ship s operation in waves a unified analysis that considers the interaction between the two motions should be carried out the free running model test is the most reliable method to simulate the navigation of a ship in waves however it is not only costly to perform but there are also many uncertainties in the implementation of waves propulsion and steering in the experiment the discrepancies due to the scale effect between real and model ships could also be a problem on the other hand computational fluid dynamics cfd can be applied for evaluating the maneuverability of ships in waves a cfd based simulation has the advantage of directly considering the effect of fluid viscosity and the nonlinearities of wave and ship motion however a free running simulation based on cfd is still not in a mature status and still inefficient to be performed at the design stage owing to large computational costs therefore numerical simulation techniques are required to efficiently and accurately combine seakeeping and maneuvering performance the two time scale model is one of the most widely used methods for analyzing ship maneuvering in waves skejic and faltinsen 2008 yasukawa and nakayama 2009 the technique considers the effect of waves on the maneuverability of the ship by introducing a pre computed database of wave drift forces to a maneuvering equation of motion in this approach based on the assumption that the characteristic time scales of seakeeping and maneuvering motions are different δt maneuvering δt seakeeping the two types of motions are solved independently in separate equations of motion using the two time scale model the ship s operation performance in waves can be simulated efficiently however it is difficult to construct a database which considers all the parameters such as amplitude frequency incident wave direction and velocities of the ship forward slip and rotation speeds that determine seakeeping quantities in previous studies the database was simplified by assuming that the effects of slip and rotation speeds on wave drift force were negligible on the other hand there have been approaches describing ship motion in a single equation of motion to integrate both seakeeping and maneuvering performance bailey et al 1997 fossen 2005 in this approach which can be called a hybrid approach the equation of motion is expressed by hydrodynamic coefficients the seakeeping related coefficients are computed by the strip theory in frequency domain while the maneuvering related coefficients are obtained by model test results or empirical formulas in order to consider the memory effect of ship navigation on seakeeping quantities the retardation function was adopted based on the convolution integral however the seakeeping related hydrodynamic coefficient is a function of not only the resultant encounter wave frequency but also the steady velocity of the ship and the incident wave direction for the ship drifting and rotating by steering there are limitations in the construction of the retardation function that account for the memory effect induced by time varying parameters in addition the wave drift force which plays the most important role in the maneuverability of ships in waves was missing from previous studies in summary the coupling effects between seakeeping and maneuvering quantities cannot be fully taken into account in both the two time scale model and hybrid approach in particular the changes in seakeeping performance in accordance with steady flow maneuvering seakeeping coupling effect were not considered adnan and yasukawa 2008 conducted a model test for an obliquely moving containership and examined the effects of the hull drift angle on motion responses and wave drift forces also a numerical approach based on the strip theory was developed for the analysis on wave induced motions on a laterally drifting ship yasukawa et al 2010 therefore since the drift force can inversely affect the maneuverability of ships seakeeping maneuvering coupling effect the change in seakeeping quantities according to the maneuvering motion should also be considered for ships maneuvering in waves seo and kim 2011 proposed a time domain direct coupling method to overcome the limitations of previous approaches in their study the three dimensional rankine panel method rpm was applied to compute ship motions and wave drift forces and the resultant quantities were reflected in the maneuvering modeling group mmg based maneuvering equation in the seakeeping computation the steady flow due to time varying operation speeds was approximated as a uniform flow neumann kelvin nk linearization using a similar approach yen et al 2010 conducted maneuvering analysis of a ship in waves considering the nonlinear motion induced by hull geometry by extension zheng et al 2017 solved the boundary value problem bvp for seakeeping quantities by approximating steady flow as a double body db flow db linearization a vortex sheet was also introduced to analyze the db flow for a ship in maneuvering motions in the time domain direct coupling method since the seakeeping quantities computed by considering the operation velocity at a specific instant are reflected in the maneuvering motion the direct integration of the two motions is possible in addition there is an advantage in that memory effects such as the time evolution of disturbed waves around the ship can be strictly accounted for through time integration of free surface boundary conditions in the present study the effects of steady flow approximation on the analysis of ship maneuvering in waves are investigated the seakeeping quantities are computed by applying the time domain b spline based rpm the near field method i e the direct pressure integration method is used to calculate the wave drift force on the ship in this seakeeping analysis the steady flow induced by the ship s operation velocity is approximated by uniform flow or db flow when the db linearization is adopted a vortex sheet is introduced to model the vortex flow generated at the sharp corners of the hull for the different approximations of steady flow the influence of the hull drift angle on ship motions and drift forces induced by waves is examined based on the computation results for the ship moving forward or obliquely lastly the numerical simulation for the turning test in a regular wave is carried out based on the time domain direct coupling method of seo and kim 2011 the computed turning trajectories are validated by comparison with existing model test results based on the accuracy of simulation results relative to the experimental data the coupling effects of the approximated steady flow on the seakeeping and maneuvering quantities of the ship in turning test in waves are discussed 2 theoretical backgrounds 2 1 seakeeping analysis for ship in waves 2 1 1 boundary value problem in the present study in order to describe the ship motion due to waves three kinds of coordinate systems are adopted as shown in fig 1 the first is the earth fixed coordinate system o xyz and the second is the inertial coordinate system o x y z which moves with the steady velocity of a ship the last is the body fixed coordinate system o xyz that follows the wave induced ship motion the operation steady velocity is defined in the inertial coordinate system according to only the 3 degrees of freedom 3 dof speeds of ship forward u 0 slip v 0 and yaw rotation r 0 speeds as u 0 u 0 y r 0 v 0 x r 0 0 the effects of other dof speeds in heave roll and pitch directions assumed to be negligible here the problem domain is consists of the body and free surfaces s b and s f for an incident wave a ω and χ denote the amplitude frequency and incident direction respectively if the ship is assumed to be a rigid body then 6 dof motions are induced by waves translation ξ t ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 surge sway heave and rotation ξ r ξ 4 ξ 5 ξ 6 roll pitch yaw according to the ship motion defined in the inertial coordinate system the linear displacement can be defined as δ x t δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 ξ t t ξ r t x in the seakeeping analysis a bvp can be defined according to the linear potential theory based on the assumption of irrotational flow with incompressible and inviscid fluid the velocity potential φ satisfies the following governing equation and boundary conditions in the inertial coordinate system 1 2 φ 0 in fluid domain 2 φ n u 0 n δ t n on s b 3 d d t φ z ζ x y t 0 on z ζ x y t 4 d φ d t g ζ 1 2 φ φ on z ζ x y t where ζ and n denote the wave elevation at the free surface and normal vector for the body surface respectively for the linearization of bvp the total velocity potential and wave elevation are decomposed as follows 5 φ x t φ x φ i x t φ d x t 6 ζ x t ζ i x t ζ d x t where ф is the steady potential induced by the operation velocity in the linear analysis the steady flow related components are assumed to be in the order of o 1 zeroth order component on the other hand the subscripts i and d denote the components related to incident and disturbed waves respectively the order of these wave components is o ε in the boundary value problem all linear quantities are assumed proportional to the amplitude of incident wave the value of ε indicates a same order magnitude compared to a in other words linear quantities are assumed to be smaller than the zeroth order component and the order of ε represents the order of variables first order linear and second order components etc then by substituting eqs 5 and 6 into eqs 2 4 the boundary conditions can be linearized in the present study the linearization was performed with respect to the body fixed coordinate system o xyz considering wave induced ship motion and velocity in the boundary conditions which was originally proposed by hachmann 1991 details of the linear seakeeping and added resistance analysis by means of body fixed coordinate system can be found in shao and faltinsen 2012 according to how the steady potential is approximated the linearization methods can be classified as listed in table 1 here s b and n 0 denote the surface and normal vector for the mean body respectively also u 1 is the first order linear velocity of ship which includes changes in the angle of attack due to rotational motion in the nk linearization the steady flow is assumed to be a uniform flow which is appropriate for a high speed slender body because of the simple approximation the actual trend of steady flow is not reflected in the boundary conditions especially in free surface boundary conditions all the steady flow induced coupling effects are represented only by the galilean transform d d t t u on the other hand in the db linearization the steady flow is regarded as a db flow which is suitable for a low speed blunt ship unlike uniform flow the flow has a tendency of steady flow along the hull geometry as shown in fig 2 therefore in the linearized boundary conditions all the coupling effects of steady flow are represented by the spatial derivatives of db potential the greatest advantage of linearization with respect to the body fixed coordinate system is that the second derivatives of steady potential do not exist in the body boundary condition since the well known m j term which represents the coupling effects between the steady flow and radiation components of unsteady solution in the inertial coordinate system includes the second derivatives it is difficult to evaluate the term accurately in numerical computation without considerations for the m j term the reliable numerical analysis can be performed in the body fixed coordinate system however there is a 2φ z2 related term in the free surface boundary condition which denotes the effect of steady flow on the distribution of disturbed waves the term should be evaluated in detail for the accurate seakeeping computations of ships moving at a certain steady velocity the effect of steady flow approximation on seakeeping analysis can be found in lee et al 2017 to solve the derived bvp green s second identity is applied as follows 7 φ d s b φ d g n d s s f φ d n g d s s b g φ d n d s s f φ d g n d s the rankine sources g 1 r are distributed to the discretized body and free surfaces then eq 7 can be converted into an algebraic equation for unknown strengths of the source and dipole velocity potential and its normal flux by adopting time integration to the free surface boundary conditions the instantaneous wave elevation and velocity potential at the free surface can be computed in the present time domain rpm these variables are evaluated based on the b spline basis function to enhance the accuracy of the numerical solution details of the present rankine panel method can be found in kim et al 2011 2 1 2 equation of seakeeping motion the ship motions due to waves can be computed by solving the following 6 dof equations of motion 8 m ξ f f k f res f h d where m is the mass matrix of the ship f f k and f res are the froude krylov and restoring forces respectively and f h d denotes the hydrodynamic force due to disturbed wave and ship motion the forces acting on the ship are computed by the integration of pressure along the mean body surface first the hydrodynamic force can be obtained by integrating the pressure induced by disturbed wave which is the solution of linearized bvp as follows 9 f h d j ρ s b φ d t u 0 φ φ d u 1 φ n j 0 d s ρ s b φ t u 0 1 2 φ φ n j 1 d s for j 1 2 6 here n j 1 indicate the first order linear normal vector due to rotational motion such that 10 n j 1 ξ r n 0 j for j 1 2 3 ξ r x n 0 j 3 for j 4 5 6 it should be noted that the terms of steady potential along with ship motion represent the steady flow induced coupling effects on the radiation force the effects of m j term on the hydrodynamic force in the inertial coordinate system those effects are neglected in the nk linearization in the same way the froude krylov force can be evaluated for the mean body surface by integration of the pressure due to incident wave as follows 11 f f k j ρ s b φ i t u 0 φ φ i n j 0 d s for j 1 2 6 also the restoring force is obtained by integrating the hydrostatic pressure gz which can be expressed by the linear restoring coefficient f res j c j k ξ k 2 1 3 prediction for wave drift force the near field method is applied for the prediction of the wave drift force in which the second order force is obtained by the direct integration of second order pressure along the body surface the second order pressure can be derived by the perturbation of physical and geometrical variables with respect to the mean body the resultant pressure is expressed by the quadratic components of linear variables like in bvp and the computation of linear hydrodynamic force the body fixed coordinate system is applied for the evaluation of wave drift force the derived total force can be expressed by components as follows 12 f wave j i i i i i i i v for j 1 2 6 where i ρ g 2 w l ζ δ 3 2 n j 0 sin α d l ρ g w l ζ 0 ζ δ 3 n j 1 sin α d l i i ρ s b 1 2 φ i φ d φ i φ d n j 0 d s i i i ρ s b t u 0 φ φ i φ d u 1 φ g

indicates the incline angle which is the angle between hull surface and mean free surface by introducing the correction based on the angle 1 sinα the force induced by the variation of the wetted surface in waves is considered more accurately it should be noted that there are no terms in this formula that are expressed by the second derivatives of steady or unsteady potentials unlike the near field method for the inertial coordinate system kim and kim 2011 therefore it is possible to evaluate the wave drift force numerically stable the temporal mean of the second order force denotes the drift force induced by waves 2 2 maneuvering analysis for ship in waves 2 2 1 equation of maneuvering motion in general in order to describe the maneuvering motion of the ship both the space fixed coordinate system o xyz and the body fixed coordinate system o xyz are used as shown in fig 3 the relation between the two coordinate systems can be expressed as follows 13 x x cos ψ 0 t y sin ψ 0 t x 0 t y x sin ψ 0 t y cos ψ 0 t y 0 t z z where x 0 t and y 0 t represent the global position of ship at time t the yaw angle ψ 0 indicates the angle between the two coordinates and the rudder angle δ for portside turning z direction is defined as a positive value the incident wave direction is defined as χ in the space fixed coordinate system the modular type 4 dof equations of motion is adopted to compute the maneuvering motion of the ship as follows 14 m u 0 v 0 r 0 x h x p x r x linear x w m v 0 u 0 r 0 y h y r y linear y w i x x p 0 k h k r k linear k w i z z r 0 n h n r k linear k w where m i xx and i zz denote the mass and moments of inertias in the x and z directions respectively x and y are the forces in surge and sway directions and k and n are the moments in roll and yaw directions respectively the subscripts h p and r indicate the hydrodynamic force due to hull propulsion and steering respectively the wave induced force is decomposed of the first order linear and second order w forces a brief description for each force component is given below 2 2 1 1 hull hydrodynamic force the hull hydrodynamic force can be expressed using hydrodynamic coefficients as follows 15 x h r u 0 x u u 0 x v v v 0 2 x v r y v v 0 r 0 x r r r 0 2 y h y v v 0 y v v 0 y r x u u 0 r 0 y v v v v 0 3 y v v r v 0 2 r 0 y v r r v 0 r 0 2 y r r r r 0 3 k h z h y h n h n r r 0 n v v 0 n r r 0 n v v v v 0 3 n v v r v 0 2 r 0 n v r r v 0 r 0 2 n r r r r 0 3 the terms are divided into two components potential flow induced components wave making related term and viscous flow induced components viscous resistance lift force etc it is difficult to numerically calculate the wave making components accurately at a relatively low operation velocity owing the very short steady waves therefore for hull hydrodynamic forces such as calm water resistance r and maneuvering derivatives y v y r n v n r and the nonlinear components the total values are estimated based on the existing mmg model yasukawa and nakayama 2009 without dividing the two components 2 2 1 2 propulsion and steering forces the propulsion and steering forces are also estimated using the mmg model in which the two forces are modeled independently the hydrodynamic force by propeller can be obtained as 16 x p 1 t p ρ n p 2 d p 4 k t where k t j p j t 0 j t 1 j p j t 2 j p 2 here t p n p and d p indicate the thrust deduction factor revolution speed and diameter of the propeller respectively the thrust coefficient k t is approximated by second order polynomials with respect to the advance ratio j p u 0 1 w p n p d p also the effective wake fraction w p is modeled by the wake fraction for a ship moving in a straight line w p0 and the drift angle at the location of the propeller β p β 0 x p r 0 the hydrodynamic force due to steering is expressed as 17 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ k r z r y r n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where x r and z r denote the coordinates of the rudder center in the x and z directions respectively t r a h and x h are the coefficients to model the interaction between the hull and rudder f n indicates the rudder normal force expressed as 18 f n 1 2 ρ a r u r 2 6 13 λ r λ r 2 25 sin α r where a r and λ r are the profile area and aspect ratio of rudder and u r and α r are the total speed and direction of flow into the rudder respectively the inflow velocity is estimated by considering the characteristics of the wake near the rudder and the flow straightening phenomena due to the presence of the hull and propeller slip stream more details on the modeling of propulsion and steering forces can be found in yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 2 2 1 3 wave induced force the wave induced linear force in eqs 9 and 11 and the second order force in eq 12 obtained through the seakeeping computation are adopted for the maneuvering equation in particular by introducing the linear wave induced force the oscillatory operation velocity of ship with high frequency can be directly computed and the oscillatory behaviors can be reflected into the boundary value problem of seakeeping analysis it is important in the seakeeping maneuvering coupling method that the linear wave induced force and maneuvering force in eq 15 should not overlap in other words since the hull hydrodynamic force obtained by the mmg model already includes the wave making related component the steady force should be neglected in the linear force from the seakeeping computation for this purpose when solving the bvp the terms related to steady flow of o 1 zeroth order analysis φ t u 0 1 2 φ φ are excluded from the dynamic free surface boundary condition in table 1 in this way only the unsteady wave induced force can be introduced into the equation for maneuvering motion 2 2 2 seakeeping maneuvering coupling analysis in the present study the high frequency wave induced motion and low frequency maneuvering motion directly interact in the time domain according to the coupling method proposed by seo and kim 2011 the two kinds of motions were obtained by solving the equations of motion in the seakeeping and maneuvering modules as summarized in fig 4 the explanations for each module and the coupling effect on the other modules are given below 2 2 2 1 seakeeping module the linearized bvp is defined for the operation velocity of the ship by applying rpm the bvp is solved to obtain the wave induced motion and force then the seakeeping quantities are transferred to the maneuvering module the time evolution of disturbed waves is considered through the time integration of free surface boundary conditions in other words the memory effect induced by the seakeeping performance of the ship is considered in the time domain and reflected to the resultant seakeeping quantities then the wave induced force is adopted into the maneuvering equation to evaluate the drift effect on the maneuverability of the ship in waves seakeeping maneuvering coupling effect 2 2 2 2 maneuvering module in the maneuvering module the global position and steady velocity of the ship are calculated by solving the 4 dof motion equations considering external forces including the wave force the bvp in the seakeeping module is redefined according to the changed operation velocity the effect of steady flow on the unsteady flow is also re analyzed in other words all the terms related to steady potential in the boundary conditions and in the equations for wave force varied depending on the steady velocity therefore the wave induced motion and force are affected by the changes in steady flow induced coupling effects maneuvering seakeeping coupling effect this coupling procedure is continuously repeated in the time domain so that the seakeeping and maneuvering quantities are directly integrated however since the time scale of the maneuvering motion is generally larger than that of the seakeeping motion the analysis of steady flow is performed at a certain time interval to reduce computational costs 2 2 3 steady flow analysis for a ship maneuvering in waves the steady flow should be analyzed considering the time varying operation velocity in the nk linearization the approximation of steady flow is quite simple since only the steady velocity in the boundary conditions needs to be updated in the time domain on the other hand in the db linearization the db flow should be computed repeatedly according to the following boundary conditions 19 φ n u 0 n on s b 20 φ z 0 on z 0 it is important to note that the ship in maneuvering motion is a lifting body not only with forward speed but also with slip and rotation speeds therefore at the sharp ends of the bow and stern regions vortex flows occur in the opposite direction of flow along the hull as shown in fig 5 thus it is necessary to reflect the characteristics of vortex flow in the steady flow approximation to realize the vortex flow in potential based computation a singularity should be adopted to model of the rotational flow around the ship in this study the mixed source and dipole method of morino and kuo 1974 was adopted to analyze the db flow as follows 21 φ s b φ n g φ g n d s s w δ φ g n d s where g is the sum of the rankine source and its image source g 1 r 1 r in addition to the dipole flow in which strength is defined by the db potential an additional dipole flow was modeled by introducing the vortex sheet s w to satisfy the kutta condition the strength of the dipole flow δφ can be defined as 22 δ φ φ u φ l as shown in fig 5 φu and φl indicate the potentials at the end panels of the pressure side and suction side respectively in other words over the vortex sheet the dipole strength is determined by the potential jump φu φl based on kelvin s theorem details on the panel method for vortex flow analysis can be found in lee 1987 3 analysis results 3 1 ship model the s175 containership was chosen as the ship model for numerical computations the principal dimensions of the model are listed in table 2 for applications of the rankine panel method quadrilateral panels were distributed for the body surface approximately 2 000 panels and the free surface 6 000 panels as shown in fig 6 also an o type free surface panels were applied to take into account the various directions of incident wave during maneuvering simulation the radius of entire problem domain is five times the wavelength and the outer region for twice the wavelength was set as the artificial damping zone to satisfy the radiation condition it should be noted that the water plane has sharp edges at the bow and stern regions and also a bilge vortex can be generated at the sharp keel therefore in order to model the vortex flows at the tips an additional vortex sheets were applied as shown in fig 7 especially for the vortex sheet of the trailing edge the sheet distribution was determined based on the quasi steady assumption that vortex shedding occurs following a certain angle θ wake matsui et al 1994 defined the vortex distribution angle by the steady velocity of the ship as follows 23 θ wake tan 1 v 0 r 0 x u 0 r 0 y 3 2 analysis on steady flow and its coupling effects 3 2 1 double body flow first the steady flow which will be the basis of seakeeping computation was analyzed fig 8 shows the db flow used to approximate the steady flow in the db linearization when the ship moves in a straight line with only the forward speed the db flow is symmetrical with respect to the centerline on the other hand when the ship moves obliquely with a certain drift angle β 0 tan 1 v 0 u 0 the potential value asymmetric owing to the slip speed and rotational flows occur in the direction of incidence along the hull at the bow and stern tips if the db flow is computed without introducing an additional vortex sheet the stagnation point is located not on the end of hull but on the opposite side of the flow inlet where the streamlines are concentrated this tendency intensified at the bow region the position of the stagnation point is different from the actual phenomenon where the viscosity of fluid exists which means that the rotational flow at the tips is excessively evaluated the divergent corner flow behavior physically owing to the fluid viscosity the vortex flow occurs in the direction of suppressing the incident rotational flow by adopting the vortex sheet to model these characteristics of actual flow it can be seen that the stagnation point moves to the tip of the hull the severe rotational flow is attenuated and the value of the db potential is reduced compared with the case without the vortex sheet in other words the db flow for the linearization of bvp is stabilized by considering the vortex flow actually by using the potential theory based approach the portion of calm water maneuvering force such as a wave making component can be computed also many researchers insisted that the calm water sway force and yaw moment acting on the ship in maneuvering motions can be calculated through the modeling of vortex flow based on the 3d panel method matsui et al 1994 greeley and willemann 2013 however the strong sensitivity with respect to the shape and distribution of vortex sheets were confirmed also it was difficult to accurately obtain the higher order maneuvering derivatives for large drift angles or rotation speeds in order to verify the accuracy of calm water maneuvering forces computed by the present double body flow based modeling the computation results for static drift test were compared with those obtained from the existing mmg model which was established based on the captive model test yasukawa and nakayama 2009 as shown in fig 9 the sway force computed by the double body flow model showed similar tendencies with those obtained by the mmg model however as the drift angle increases the discrepancies between the two results intensified since the double body flow model cannot account the nonlinear characteristics of calm water force accurately on the other hand the yaw moment of which the nonlinearities with respect to drift angle is not significant for the present ship model showed large discrepancies even for a small drift angle this is because the sway force is determined by the overall trend of steady flow while the yaw moment is greatly affected by the local vortex flow which is difficult to be evaluated strictly in the potential theory based computations as mentioned in sec 2 2 1 therefore in the present study the total calm water force was not computed from the double body flow model but obtained from the existing mmg model because of inaccuracies of the 3d panel method for the present ship model the purpose of introducing the vortex sheet in this study is to improve the reliability and accuracy of seakeeping computations instead of calculating the maneuvering derivatives through the modeling of the influences of fluid viscosity the coupling effect of steady flow on the unsteady solution is valid only in the vicinity of the hull hence the analysis of vortex shedding is not important the dipole flow 1 r n decreased sharply as the distance from the hull increased as shown in fig 8 the nonphysical stagnation points and severe rotational flow are located at a distance of l 32 from the end of the bow therefore if the length of the vortex sheet is greater than l 32 then the db flow is sufficiently stabilized in conclusion since the sensitivity of numerical solutions to sheet length is very low the sheet in the range of l 16 l 4 is introduced 3 2 2 effects of steady velocity on seakeeping quantities the effects of steady velocity on seakeeping quantities are summarized in fig 10 first the resonance region of ship motion is determined by the incident wave encounter frequency depending on the operation velocity of the ship and incident wave direction furthermore owing to the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force represented by the steady potential in eq 9 equivalent to the effect of m j term in the inertia coordinate system the ship motion is affected by the steady velocity according to the resultant ship motion the distribution of the disturbed wave and wave drift force are also varied this hydrodynamic force reflected along with the motion response first order velocity of ship is effective in the resonance and long wave regions where the ship motion significantly occurs however the drift force can be also varied according to the steady velocity even in the short wave region where the ship motion is negligible the waterline integral term i of eq 12 which is the main component of the wave drift force depends on the elevation of the disturbed wave along the hull the magnitude of the disturbed wave around the hull is affected by distribution of the second derivative of the steady potential according to the free surface boundary condition it should be noted that the 2φ z 2 related term is reflected along with the incident and disturbed waves into the kinematic free surface b c in table 1 therefore this steady flow induced coupling effect is valid for the entire wavelength region fig 11 shows the distribution of the second order derivative in the z direction similar to the db potential the derivative is also symmetrical when the ship moves forward case 1 while asymmetric distribution is confirmed when the ship drifts case 2 according to the free surface boundary condition in the region where 2φ z 2 has a positive value the disturbed wave intensifies while the wave is attenuated in the region of negative value when ship moves straight in a head wave the disturbed bow wave occurs strongly and the stern wave is reduced owing to the forward speed which results in an increase in added resistance wave drift surge force in a beam wave the yaw drift moment acting on the bow of the ship in clockwise direction increases owing to the intensified bow wave while the counterclockwise moment on the stern decreases owing to the attenuated stern wave as a result the clockwise drift moment acts more strongly compared with the zero speed case on the other hand when the ship moves obliquely with a certain negative drift angle it can be seen that the positive 2φ z 2 value is widely distributed near the portside of the ship even in the head wave condition therefore the clockwise yaw moment could act on the ship because the disturbed wave is generated strongly near the portside of the bow region for a beam wave when the ship drifts toward the incident wave according to the slip speed as shown in b of fig 11 the drift sway force in y direction increases this can also be explained through the intensified disturbed waves at the portside these steady flow induced coupling effects on the wave drift force can be considered when db linearization method is applied while the effects are ignored in the nk linearization if the boundary value problem is linearized with respect to the steady ship wave the coupling effects can be captured more accurately 3 3 seakeeping analysis results in order to examine the effect of operation velocity on seakeeping quantities the seakeeping computation was performed for the ship moving not only forward but also obliquely as summarized in table 3 in the simulation the steady velocity of the ship and incident wave direction were kept constant 3 3 1 motion response fig 12 shows the computation results of the motion response induced by a regular wave ω n in the figure is the natural frequency of each motion ω n c m a where c m and a denote the restoring mass and added mass coefficients of the degree also its location indicates the wavelength ratio where the natural frequency is equal to the encounter wave frequency ω e ω k u o c o s χ k v o sin χ for the ship moving forward fn 0 15 and β 0 0 0 therefore a resonance of each motion occurs near the corresponding wavelength ratio when the ship moves obliquely at a certain drift angle 6 dof motions occurs even in a head wave owing to the asymmetric properties of steady flow the vertical motions obtained based on the nk linearization were significantly overestimated near the resonance regions for degrees of heave and pitch compared with those from the db linearization this is because the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force is neglected without considering the tendencies of steady flow near the bow and stern regions therefore inaccurate hydrodynamic coefficients and resultant motion responses are provided in the nk linearization kim and shin 2007 the influence of the drift angle slip speed on vertical motion is not significant in both linearization schemes on the other hand the roll motion generated by asymmetric steady flow becomes larger as the drift angle increases in nk linearization the asymmetric coupling effect was approximated simply based on uniform flow so that the roll motion was underestimated compared with that from the db linearization in addition when db linearization was applied the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force varied depending on whether the vortex sheet was introduced or not therefore the predicted results for roll motion are also slightly different in a beam wave not only the roll motion but also the heave and pitch motions varied according to the drift angle this is because the incident wave encounter frequency changes owing to the slip speed the ship under a negative drift angle travels toward the incident wave thus increasing the encounter frequency therefore it can be confirmed that resonant heave and pitch motions occur for a longer wave in the case of roll motion the response to a short wave increases slightly owing to the asymmetric property of steady flow however in a long wave the motion is reduced for a larger drift angle because the resonance region for a roll degree shifts to the longer wave region λ l for ω n ω e 2 90 3 12 when β 0 0 0 10 0 the discrepancies in motion responses between the two linearization methods can be also seen in the beam wave condition owing to the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force however the modeling of vortex flow does not cause a significant difference because the effect of the incident wave itself on the side of the ship is more dominant than those of the asymmetric steady flow in conclusion it can be confirmed that the motion response is determined according to the operation velocity because of not only the influence of encounter wave frequency but also the steady flow flow induced coupling effects 3 3 2 wave drift force next the computation results for the wave drift force acting on the ship in regular head waves are compared according to the operation velocity and linearization method as shown in fig 13 the forward speed greatly influences the wave drift surge force that is the added resistance due to the wave since the heave and pitch motions in the resonance region are opposite in phase to the incident wave the waterline integral term i which depends on the relative wave elevation is increased by the resonant motions at faster forward speed the resonant motions are greater compared with the zero speed case so that the added resistance also increases based on the db linearization the added resistance also increased owing to the forward speed because of the effect of the 2φ z 2 related term in the free surface b c on disturbed waves as explained in sec 3 2 2 as with vertical motion the asymmetric steady flow due to the drift angle has no significant effect on the added resistance also computation results of the different linearization methods were similar on the other hand the wave drift sway force and yaw moment of the existing seakeeping model test for an obliquely moving ship adnan and yasukawa 2008 increased for a larger drift angle when the nk linearization was applied the computed drift force and moment were significantly underestimated compared to the experiment since the coupling effects induced by asymmetrical steady flow was not strictly taken into account the results of the db linearization techniques were also quite small but the tendency to increase with the drift angle was similar to the experimental data as explained in sec 3 2 2 when a ship moves obliquely with a negative drift angle it is physically evident that the negative yaw moment acted on the ship in the head wave condition in addition the values of drift force and moment slightly increased when the modeling for the vortex flow generated at the sharp tips of ship was adopted however there were limitations in computations of wave drift force based on the double body flow linearization therefore the linearization based on the nonlinear steady flow and the modeling of vortex flow in free surface will be required to consider the steady flow induced coupling effects more strictly in the future greely and willemann 2013 as shown in fig 14 when the ship moves forward in a beam wave condition the positive added resistance acts on the ship in a short wave due to the intensified disturbed waves at the bow region however when the nk linearization technique was applied the added resistance was extremely underestimated the negative force that pushes the ship forward this is because the coupling effect of steady flow was missing and the disturbed wave around the hull was inaccurately predicted this tendency intensified when the ship moves obliquely on the other hand the differences of computation results according to the drift angle were very small in both the experimental data and those of the db linearization technique the forward speed also affected the wave drift yaw moment compared with the case of zero speed the disturbed bow waves on the portside increased and the resultant negative moment acted on the ship this tendency can be clearly confirmed in results of the db linearization which accounts for the steady flow induced coupling effect more strictly in the both linearization methods however the wave drift yaw moments were underestimated compared to the experimental data this is because neither method accurately reflected the tendency of local steady flow near the bow region which can significantly affect the overall value of the yaw moment for the wave drift sway force when the nk linearization was introduced the computed force was also inaccurate for a short wave in particular since the ship drifts toward the incident wave the magnitude of the sway force should increase compared with the case with only the forward speed however it was confirmed that the magnitude decreased as the slip speed increased this nonphysical prediction was also resulted from the inaccurate evaluation of disturbed waves around the hull on the other hand the tendency to increase for a larger drift angle can be seen both in the experimental data and the results of db linearization because the disturbed waves on the portside increase according to the distribution of 2φ z2 however under the beam wave condition since the influence of the wave itself acting on the side of the vessel was dominant rather than the asymmetry of steady flow the introduction of the vortex sheets did not have much effect on the computation results overall it was confirmed that the db linearization method which consider the characteristics of steady flow of the drifting ship more strictly rather than the nk linearization showed similar tendencies with the model tests results in addition the modeling for vortex flow from sharp tips of a hull is related to stability of numerical solutions fig 15 shows the seakeeping computation result based on the double body linearization without introducing a vortex sheet for a relatively large drift angle β 0 20 0 it can be confirmed that the disturbed wave near the bow region is overestimated the location of the divergent wave is the same as the non physical stagnation point of double body flow computed without the vortex flow modeling in other words when the linearization of boundary value problem based on the rapidly rotating basis flow was performed the unsteady solutions diverged due to unstable coupling effects of steady flow therefore the considerations for vortex flow was necessary for a stable numerical analysis on the seakeeping performance of the ship under large maneuvering motions 3 4 maneuvering analysis results the numerical turning test in regular waves was performed by applying the time domain maneuvering seakeeping direct coupling method the maneuvering equation of motion was established based on the mmg model constructed by existing research yasukawa and nakayama 2009 in previous work a free running experiment in calm water was carried out for a turning test under a certain rudder angle δ 35 0 and the maneuvering coefficients and modeling for propulsion and steering in the mmg model were verified by comparing the trajectories of the model test and numerical simulation as shown in fig 16 it was confirmed that the result of the present coupling method based on the same mmg model is quite similar to that obtained by solving only the maneuvering equation this indicates that the components related to the wave making resistance do not overlap between the seakeeping module and the mmg model therefore when the coupling method is applied for the simulation in waves the wave effects on the maneuverability of the ship can be evaluated in comparison with the calm water case table 4 lists the simulation conditions for the ship maneuvering in regular waves in the simulations the revolution speed of the propeller was set to a value that can achieve the reference speed v ref fn 0 150 in calm water as in the previous model test the steering starts when a wave trough is located at midship in addition the convergent speed and attitude of the ship in the course keeping model test in the previous study were introduced as the initial condition to exclude transient effects before the steering begins in other words in a head wave the initial speed was determined by considering the speed loss due to the added resistance in a beam wave the convergent drift angle and yaw angle to maintain the straight path were also reflected in the initial condition in fig 17 the simulation results are compared with existing model test results overall the trajectories of the experiment and computation results are in good agreement in the present numerical simulations based on the direct coupling method the time evolution of disturbed waves can be captured through the time integration of free surface boundary conditions as shown in fig 18 however it can be seen that the turning radius obtained from the simulation is slightly smaller this trend can be also confirmed in the calm water case fig 15 which seems to be maintained in the trajectories in waves for a shorter wave λ l 0 7 all steady flow approximation methods yielded similar turning trajectories while the discrepancies between the trajectories intensified for longer waves as examined in sec 3 2 the coupling effect of steady flow such as steady flow induced hydrodynamic force and 2φ z 2 related term in free surface b c are strongly reflected into seakeeping quantities for the wave condition where large ship motion and disturbed wave occur therefore according to how the steady flow was approximated the differences between the maneuvering quantities were also confirmed for longer waves especially in beam and following waves since the wave drift force and moment acting on the ship moving obliquely and rotating are significantly different between the linearization techniques the discrepancies intensified as turning proceeded in fig 19 for the wave condition of λ l 1 0 where the greatest discrepancies between the results of different steady flow approximations the time series of operation velocity wave induced motion and wave drift force are compared as the portside turning progresses the drift angle and rotating speed show the oscillatory behaviors caused by the wave force and the amplitude of ship motion varies over time according to the change in the steady velocity of ship and incident wave direction when comparing the results of the nk and db linearization methods it can be seen that there exists a slight phase difference between the time series this phase lag intensifies over time because the simulations progress for the different resultant operation velocities owing to different wave drifts force and moments in order to clarify the reasons for discrepancies between turning trajectories the time series of linear wave induced force of eqs 9 and 11 and wave drift force of eq 12 were investigated according to the linearization methods in the maneuvering test since the temporal mean of the wave force continuously varies according to the operation velocity of the ship and the incident wave direction the drift force was evaluated by the interval mean of the second order wave force for 10 wave periods it should be noted that the linear wave induced force which is obtained by solving the re defined bvp according to the oscillatory time varying operation velocity of ship has a non zero temporal mean therefore the effects of linear force were also evaluated by the interval mean like those of wave drift force in the case of linear wave force the amplitude is very large so even after the interval mean is applied the force signal shows the oscillatory behaviors with the wave period in the case of surge drift force all linearization methods produced similar results while the sway force and yaw moment were different in the nk linearization method for slip and rotation speeds the force and moment were underestimated owing to the simple approximation of steady flow on the other hand in the db linearization the introduction of the vortex sheet does not have much effect on the wave drift force and moment however for the linear wave induced sway force and yaw moment non zero mean values varied greatly depending on the steady flow approximation method this phenomena denote that the steady flow induced hydrodynamic force can cause the wave drift effects owing to the time varying operation velocity of ship this tendency intensified for the yaw moment because the disturbed wave and resultant wave forces at the hull end varied according to the modeling of local vortex flow finally the maneuvering indices in the turning test were observed in this study the advance ad value of x when the yaw angle is 90 0 and tactical diameter td value of y when the yaw angle is 180 0 were evaluated also in order to assess how much the ship is drifted by a wave during the turning the drifting distance d drift was also computed the drifting distance can be defined as follows 24 d drift 1 2 x 450 x 90 2 y 450 y 90 2 x 540 x 180 2 y 540 y 180 2 here the subscript of position variable indicates the yaw angle of the ship as shown in fig 20 generally as the wavelength becomes longer for a certain wave height the wave drift sway force and yaw moment are reduced so that the drifting distance also decreases the maneuvering indices and the drifting distance in turning test were compared in fig 21 in the portside turning test the negative yaw moment acted on ship owing to the operation velocity which suppressed the turning however in the present numerical computation based on the rankine panel method the rotation was less delayed owing to the underestimated yaw moment therefore the advance and tactical diameter were underestimated this tendency intensified for initial beam waves in the initial speed is relatively fast due to the small added resistance and speed loss in other word the above errors occurred since the steady flow induced coupling effects on the drift yaw moment were not strictly considered in the future the research is required to enhance the accuracy of the drift moment prediction for a variety of operation velocities of ship and incident wave directions furthermore the drifting distance varied according to the steady flow approximations especially when the double body flow is accounted for more strictly by the modeling for local vortex flow the drifting distance increases during the delayed turning owing to the negative moment in conclusion the predictability of how much the ship in the turning was drifted by waves was determined by accuracies of the evaluation of steady flow induced coupling effects and resultant seakeeping quantities such as the wave drift force 4 conclusions in this study the coupling effects of steady flow on the seakeeping and maneuvering quantities of the ship under steering in waves were investigated to this end the seakeeping analysis was carried out for the ship moving forward or obliquely numerical simulations were also performed for the turning test in regular waves based on the computation results the following conclusions are made it was confirmed that seakeeping quantities such as ship motion and wave drift force varied according to not only the forward speed but also the slip speed because of the asymmetric coupling effects of steady flow in the nk linearization the influence of the asymmetric steady flow induced by the hull drift angle is approximated by a uniform flow in which the resultant asymmetric seakeeping quantities such as roll motion wave drift sway force and yaw moment are underestimated when the double body flow which was stabilized by the modeling of vortex flow at the hull end was used for a basis flow more reliable and accurate computations for wave drift force and moment can be made compared to the case of nk linearization the accuracy of turning simulation results compared with the experimental data is closely related to the prediction for wave drift forces in particular reliable computations of yaw moment are required to accurately predict the shape of the turning trajectory and the drifting distance by waves in the future the computation of wave drift force should be validated for various operation velocities of the ship and incident wave directions by comparison with model tests results in order to consider the steady flow induced coupling effect in more detail more advanced linearization techniques with respect to the nonlinear steady flow or the incident wave weak scatter model are required also the enhanced modellings of vortex flows generated in the unsteady solutions induced by waves and ship motions as well as in the free surface of steady flow should be considered lastly in addition to the seakeeping maneuvering coupling effects considered in this study the propulsion and steering performance of ship can also be changed owing to the effects of wave and ship motion therefore the mmg model should be improved for applications in wave conditions considering those coupling effects declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

22306,in engineering design it is often necessary to calculate cyclonic extremes such as winds and waves associated with certain exceedance probabilities estimation is difficult however for at least two reasons the first is related to recorded data mainly referring to previous decades the estimate of extremes over very long periods is heavily influenced by the small number of severe events that have occurred in recent history the second concerns the spatial variability of recorded cyclone tracks because of the low frequency of cyclone occurrence estimates of extremes made from a limited database can vary substantially over relatively small distances even within a spatially limited region where it would be reasonable to expect homogeneous values statistical uncertainty grows exponentially moving toward cyclonic peripheral areas affected very unfrequently by cyclone passages the commonly used methods to account for this uncertainty are historical track shifting and deductive approaches but a certain degree of subjectivity is intrinsic in these approaches for this reason the aim of this paper is to build a more proper statistical methodology to account for cyclone spatial variability on extreme evaluations it is based on the inverse first order reliability method iform used to determine the bivariate exceedance probability of the wind speed track distance for cyclonic events in any selected location by means of numerical modelling namely simulating waves nearshore swan the proposed approach through a logical sequence predicts the cyclonic track characteristics for a certain return period which at the selected location induce the worst conditions in terms of maximum sea state during a cyclonic event compared with the historical methods which consider the effects of all the cyclones occurring in the area the method is able to account for spatial variability even within regions with a very low cyclonic risk the methodology produces consistent results avoiding spurious discontinuities between contiguous locations which presumably have very similar vulnerability to cyclones keywords cyclone statistics extremes iform swan 1 introduction in regions exposed to cyclonic phenomena one fundamental task for engineering design is the estimation of extreme winds and associated waves to be expected during the lifetime of the facility cyclonic phenomena are very complex being characterised by a large variability in track direction intensity velocity pressure and radius following offshore engineering best practices it is common to provide the expected extreme wind and waves associated with cyclonic events for some relevant return periods i e exceedance probability as low as 10 2 or less per year long term historical databases are required to estimate these rare occurrences this poses two basic problems 1 developing a sufficient long term historical database and 2 interpreting the database to provide a reliable estimation the former can be solved by hindcast models it is currently quite common to use cyclone database covering the last 50 60 years the goal of the latter is to find the most appropriate method for determining the cumulative probability distribution function for the largest wind and waves that could occur in the future several studies have investigated tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere see haring and heideman 1980 ward et al 1979 wen and banon 1991 and huang et al 2013 among others contrarily considerably less attention has been paid to the study of the behaviour of tropical cyclones in the southern hemisphere particularly over the south indian ocean ramsay et al 2012 investigated various aspects of tropical cyclone tracks in the southern hemisphere for the period 1969 2008 they conclude that tracks forming west east of about 140 e tend to move westward eastward being relatively straight track with a notable lack of recurvature at present studies dedicated to the probabilistic assessment of cyclonic wind and associated wave height in the southern hemisphere coast are still lacking the commonly adopted approach for the determination of the extreme values associated with cyclonic events for a certain site considers the local effect of a certain number of cyclones and statistically extrapolates the extreme values this can be misleading as the results can be affected by the stochastic passage of cyclone tracks which can differently affect two contiguous sites with the same cyclonic vulnerability the rare nature and the large spatial gradient of cyclonic phenomenon could provide different results for sites as inhomogeneous consequences are experienced in contiguous areas moreover moving towards the peripheral part of areas affected by cyclones increasingly infrequent cyclone passages make the statistic very unreliable to the point of hindering any possible statistical treatment for locations affected only by one or a few cyclones in the last 50 years in a preliminary study the present writers introduced a probabilistic method based on inverse first order reliability method iform to determine the cyclonic waves expected for a certain return period at different locations along the southern coast of east africa de masi et al 2015 this method is based on a bivariate distribution of joint wind speed and distance from the location of interest and produces iso probability curves i e with the same return period of wind speed distance combination in the present paper the methodology has been refined and detailed providing a rigorous framework based on several sensitivity analyses of the main critical parameters a comparison of the proposed probabilistic method and historical track method i e probabilistic assessment based on all the historical cyclones occurring in the area has been performed moreover relevant changes in the hydrodynamic simulations have been introduced in its original form the bulk formula wu 1982 does not cap the value of drag cd at high wind speed u10 7 5 m s whereas the present study used an upper limit of cd 2 5 a logical procedure is outlined based on the statistical results of the iform approach to build for any selected location a cyclonic synthetic track which is considered to be representative of the extreme conditions associated with the desired return period this allows the construction of a statistic which intrinsically tends to provide homogeneous cyclonic severity for contiguous areas and to extrapolate it also at peripheral areas rarely affected by the passage of cyclones the present approach has been applied at five different locations offshore mozambique it provides evidence of the proposed approach overcomes the drawbacks of historical traditional methods which does not account to spatial variability and improves consistency and reliability of extremes evaluation in cyclonic areas 2 statistical methods for extreme assessment 2 1 review of existing design methods for assessing cyclonic wind and wave extremes the estimate of cyclonic extremes at very long periods i e annual exceedance probability as low as 10 2 or less is heavily influenced by a small number of severe events occurring in recent history because of the low frequency of cyclone occurrence estimates of extremes made from a limited e g up to 50 60 years database can vary substantially over relatively small distances this is due to the actual tracks of observed cyclones which sensibly affect the extremes producing high extremes in the areas where cyclone passed in the past and low extremes in the areas where they did not pass even if areas are contiguous and belong to a region that would be expected on the basis of physical interpretation to be statistically homogeneous these results are not reliable because there are no physical reasons to explain such discontinuities commonly used approaches for the prediction of rare cyclonic events are i historical methods and ii deductive methods the former is typically used to determine the 100 year events used in traditional engineering practice on this approach the goal is to fit a probability distribution to the historical records the latter rather than using historical model output at a selected grid point develop probability distribution of cyclone properties from the best track parameters and then use a probabilistic method such as monte carlo or form first order reliability method in historical methods when dealing with very low probability e g 10 3 or less the extrapolation of historical hindcast could lead to large statistical uncertainty generally some means of smoothing site specific conditions estimated from a limited database accounting for track variability should be used commonly used methods include simple spatial smoothing of site specific estimates track shifting and grid point pooling smoothing simply applies a spatial filter over bands of reasonably constant characteristics the main concern with the use of smoothing is the filter length scales to be chosen so as not to overly smooth spatial variations that are thought to be real haring and heideman 1980 proposed a different approach based on pooling in principle for a number of grid point hindcasts storm peaks within a homogeneous region were combined into a cluster before determining a probability distribution function which was then assumed to apply to any random location within the region more recently heideman and mitchell 2009 presented a simplified mathematical interpretation of grid point pooling the main concern with this method is how to select the spacing between grid points that are included in the pool the recommendation for the gulf of mexico is that the distance over which pooling is performed should generally not be less than 150 km or greater than 300 km wide and should be selected with a focus on local water depth fetch limitations orientation of major storm tracks and other local effects api bullettin 2int met 2007 in the track shifting method each historical storm is simulated multiple times the main question is how to shift the tracks the storm central pressure and the radius however the advantage of this method is that no smoothing is required the grid pooling and track shifting methods are similar the frequency of the storm is preserved so the empirical distribution of pooled storm peaks appears to increase the length of history for a specific site by a factor equal to the number of grid points pooled or the number of times that each storm is simulated heideman and mitchell 2009 a somewhat different method was taken by vickery et al 2000 who used statistical properties of historical tracks and intensities to generate a large number of synthetic storms a similar approach was taken by casson and coles 2000 though they generated synthetic tracks by randomly perturbing historical track and simulated intensity along each track by drawing randomly from the sole connection of historical track kerry and jagger 2011 proposed an innovative approach using a markov chain a sequence of random values whose probabilities at a time interval depend upon the value of the number at the previous time they also proposed a different approach which generates storms as a random draw from the collection of historical genesis points moving the storm according to a weighted average of the ambient flow plus a constant beta drift correction deductive methods on the other hand decompose the problem in different physical elements i it fits probability distribution to those elements ii it combines this distribution in a manner consistent with their physical relationship and iii it obtains the probability distribution of the quantity of interest for a fixed platform in the gulf of mexico wen and banon 1991 used a poisson distribution for the hurricane occurrence the track direction relative to depth contour line was modelled by a unimodal four parameter beta distribution whereas pressure differences translation speed and the radius of maximum winds were modelled by a joint lognormal distribution the maximum values of wind wave and current were calculated numerically and then approximated by simple analytical expression via a nonlinear regression procedure e g envelope functions the method can also be applied without using the envelope functions toro et al 2004 compared historical and deductive approaches for the calculation of low probability sea states in the gulf of mexico the results indicate that the deductive method exhibits similar statistical uncertainties to the historical method provided that the latter uses pooling of data the deductive method shows lower overall uncertainties ward et al 1979 developed a probability distribution for extreme individual wave height conditioned on distance of the site from the hurricane track the model begins by considering a distribution function for the largest wave height occurring in a hurricane they then calculate the distribution function for the largest wave height occurring at a site during a specific hurricane and successively the distribution function for the largest wave height during a storm of random intensity at a site located at a random distance from the hurricane by integrating over the range of track distances the model obtains the probability distribution for extreme individual wave height for a random site in this paper a multivariate frequency analysis based on the inverse first order reliability method iform is presented in particular this method is based on a bivariate distribution of joint wind speed and distance from the location of interest after a preliminary analysis of cyclonic tracks a marginal distribution of cyclone distance from the site is previously identified subsequently the best conditioned distributions of wind speed for each distance class are obtained for relevant return periods the corresponding iso probability curves of wind speed distance pairs are outlined 2 2 extreme value approach and inverse first order reliability method the purpose of extreme value analysis is to build a relationship between severe events and the probabilities of their exceedance non exceedance the probability of exceedance of a certain event is usually expressed in terms of the return period or recurrence interval i e the average duration of time during which extreme events exceeding a certain threshold value would occur once for example considering as a variable of interest the wind speed here denoted as ws the main problem is determining the probabilistic distribution f ws that controls the long term trend of observed values the most commonly used distributions are known as the gumbel or type i frechet tippett or type ii and weibull or type iii distributions the distribution parameters are determined from site specific data by fitting technique in the context of offshore hazard for which the environmental factors contribute simultaneously to extreme events a multivariate extreme value distribution which provides the joint distribution of two or more random variables is more relevant when compared to generalised extreme value distribution for univariate random variables one model for creating a joint distribution of two random variables and associating them with a return period is the so called iform model which approximates the joint probability density function of random variables xi and xj based on a marginal distribution of one and the conditional probability density of the other the model originally developed by winterstein et al 1993 is based on the concept of environmental contour which determines combinations of joint random variables that have an identical return period the model is based on a transformation between the original correlated variables in uncorrelated variables vi and vj whose joint density is assumed to be multi dimensional gaussian with standard normal marginal distributions the random variables are transformed from the gaussian space to the original space as per the following equations 1 x i f x i 1 ϕ v i v i g v i 2 x j f x j 1 ϕ v j v j g v j where ϕ v i is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and f x i 1 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of x i the joint environmental model of the variables of interest is finally 3 f xi xj f x i x i f xj xi x j x i the mean return period n associated with each contour is calculated as 4 n 1 1 ϕ β in which β is the radius of the circle in standard uncorrelated normal space from which the considered contour was transformed 3 numerical modelling approach 3 1 swan model the modeling system for the present study is a third generation simulating waves nearshore swan model the following dynamic interactions are considered 1 wave refraction over a bottom of variable depth 2 depth and current induced shoaling 3 wave generation by wind 4 dissipation by whitecapping 5 dissipation by depth induced breaking 6 dissipation due to bottom friction and 7 nonlinear wave wave interactions the interaction with current and astronomical tide is crucial when dealing with cyclonic events the physical manifestation of pressure gradient causes the rise and fall of the mean sea level also known as wave set up and wave set down especially during severe cyclones the radiation stress is quite important in storm surge applications as wave set up increases the water level along the coast causing widespread damage associated with coastal inundation brown et al 2011 in the present study the goal is to reconstruct the wave field under cyclonic conditions in deep water so that the hydrodynamic effect can be considered negligible the swan simulating waves nearshore model is used to predict the evolution of waves in geographical space and time based on wave action density spectrum it models the relative frequency σ and wave direction θ based on the governing action balance equation booij et al 1999 represented as 5 n t x c g u n c θ n θ c σ n σ s t o t σ the first two terms on the left hand side of eq 5 represent the rate of change of wave action in time and the propagation of wave action in geographical space respectively where x is the gradient operator in geographic space c θ is the wave group velocity and u is the ambient current vector respectively the water depth and current induced refraction have a propagation velocity of c θ and variations in mean current and depth have propagation velocity of c σ the source term stot represents the cumulative effects from wave growth by wind action balance due to white capping dissipation surf breaking and bottom friction and the action balance exchanged between spectral components in deep and shallow waters due to nonlinear wave wave interaction effects 3 2 modelling of wind fields the wind fields are derived using the holland 1980 formulation with the best track data as explained above the model estimates cyclone wind fields based on the gradient between the atmospheric pressure at the centre of a cyclone and the ambient pressure based on 6 v g a b p n p c exp a r b ρ r b r 2 f 2 4 0 5 r f 2 where p is the pressure at radius r p c the central pressure p n the ambient pressure ρ the air density f is the coriolis parameter and a b scaling parameters physically b defines the shape of the profile and a determines its location relative to the origin two relations are considered between a b rmw radial distance from the eye of cyclone where maximum winds are observed 7 r mw a 1 b 8 v max b ρe p n p c assumed rmw a and b are derived straightforwardly the computed winds are then adjusted to account for the asymmetry introduced by the interaction of the cyclone with the steering flow chan and gray 1982 by adding the translatory movement of the cyclone to the existing wind field in the northern hemisphere this vectorial addition increases the winds on the right hand side of the direction of the cyclone movement and reduces those on the left hand side and vice versa in the southern hemisphere 3 3 wind input parameterisation the effects of wind input parameterisation on wave estimation under cyclonic conditions have been examined by many authors huang et al 2013 murty et al 2014 and zijlema et al 2012 among others the source term for energy input by wind is driven by the friction wind velocity u since the wind fields are formulated in terms of wind speed at 10m elevation u10 swan requires transformation from u10 to u this transformation is carried out with the conventional expression 9 u c d u 10 2 the value of the wind drag coefficient c d in swan is due to two different formulations those of wu 1982 10 c d 1 2875 10 3 f o r u 10 7 5 m s 0 8 0 065 u 10 10 3 f o r u 10 7 5 m s and that of zijlema et al 2012 11 c d 0 55 2 97 u ˇ 1 49 u ˇ 2 10 3 in which u ˇ u 10 u r e f with u r e f is the reference wind at which c d attains its maximum value i e 31 5 m s by comparing both formulations it was found that c d values are lower than in the expression of wu 1982 by 10 30 for high wind speed 15 u 10 7 5 m s and over 30 for hurricane wind speeds u 10 32 6 m s many observers powell et al 2003 2007a 2007b black et al 2007 smith and banke 1975 and jarosz et al 2007 show that c d increases almost linearly with wind speed up to 20 m s then almost levels off at wind speeds of 35 m s and finally decreases at very high wind speeds i e higher than 40 m s this is only qualitatively supported by field data moreover zijlema et al 2012 stated that the validation of the wind drag at high wind speed was beyond the scope of their study the main concern with the formulation of zijlema et al 2012 is that when dealing with cyclones of category 5 the estimated energy transferred to waves would be close to zero in the present study the formulation of wu 1982 is preferred to that of zijlema et al 2012 the over estimation of the wind drag coefficient at high wind speed i e u 10 20 m s in the wu 1982 formulation has been remedied by capping the c d value at the limiting value of 2 5 10 3 as in the csowm wave model khandekar et al 1994 see fig 1 4 the synthetic track approach in this section the synthetic track approach to reconstruct the extreme cyclonic sea state with defined probability of exceedance is presented the identification of the cyclone track associated with a specified return period i e wind speed vs distance is performed according to the following methodology see fig 2 5 case study the mozambique channel the south indian ocean cyclonic area has been selected as a test case in particular the east african coast of the mozambique channel has been considered and the analysis has focused on the 5 locations listed in table 1 spanning the whole cyclonic area from north to south the locations have been selected on account of their being characterised by different cyclonic occurrences higher for the central portion of mozambique tropical cyclone data were obtained from the joint typhoon warning centre best track data jtwc jtwc adheres to the world meteorological organization wmo though jtwc data starts in 1945 for the southern hemisphere only the data from 1980 onwards were used owing to questionable data quality during the pre satellite era the dataset includes i position in latitude and longitude ii maximum sustained winds knots and iii central pressure in the cyclone eye mbar in the present analysis tracks within the region 5 s to 35 s and 30 e to 60 e and falling inside a radius of 500 km from each of the points listed in table 1 are considered a total of 64 cyclones and tropical storms have been considered in relation to the last 35 years see fig 3 they represent the most significate amount of cyclones occurring in the area the track from e has been selected since it is the most representative table 2 shows the total cyclone duration the mean and maximum forward speed maximum wind speed pressure drop and direction in which the selected cyclones move the iform approach has been applied to maximum wind speed and distance from the site of interest associated with that return period the marginal variable is the distance of cyclone from the site while the wind speed is assumed conditional on the distance variable a marginal distribution of distances for all points of the tracks is computed by fitting a 3p weibull distribution on classed distance values table 3 the same has been applied for the wind speed which is assumed conditional on the distance the iform contours are computed by 3 for different n year return periods it should be noted how fast the wind speed decreases on approaching the 0 distance see fig 4 as regards the model set up the bathymetric data for the study was obtained from gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans http www gebco net which has a grid spacing of 30 arc sec and is maintained by the british oceanographic data centre bodc the structured mesh covers the entire east coast of mozambique from tanzania to south africa the grid covers an offshore distance of approximately 20 the grid resolution is uniform in the overall domain the possibility of variable grid resolution has been evaluated but in order to optimise the computational time and due to the fact that shallow water effects with complex bathymetry are of no interest this approach was abandoned under this consideration grid spacing was specified as 10 km a time step of 5 min was selected in order to resolve the equations accurately the swan model was implemented in stationary and non stationary mode the numerical model has been calibrated with local measurements the quantile quantile qq plot in fig 5 shows the hs from swan model vs local measurements considering the overlapping period of 1 year model parameter settings are here described frequency and directional domains have been discretized with 36 directional and 50 frequency bins respectively the logarithmic frequency bins ranged from 0 025 to 0 5 hz whereas the wave directions had an angular resolution of 10 the non linear wave wave interaction in deep water is the quadruplet wave wave interaction it is computed using the discrete interaction approximation dia technique proposed by hasselmann et al 1985 and adapted in the swan model the jonswap model has been selected for swan simulation the default parameters for peak enhancement factor 3 3 has been used the bottom friction formulation proposed by madsen et al 1988 has been used in swan simulations in the presented case studies its effects is negligible however considering wave propagation to shore which is part of sensitivity analysis not presented in this paper bottom friction was used to calibrate the model value equal to 0 0500 the white capping formulation of komen et al 1984 is chosen the coefficient for determining the rate of whitecapping dissipation has been set to 2 36e 5 whereas the value of the wave steepness equal to 3 02e 3 the swan stationary run is computed by generating an artificial track characterised by distance from site and wind intensity with all possible cyclone conditions along the n years iform curve fig 4 for the sake of simplicity only the 100 years event has been considered due to the rapid decrease of the wind speed when the distance approaches 0 i e when the track passes directly over the site it is likely that the most impacting condition is located at a certain distance with a much larger wind speed rmw is chosen following eq 7 the track is then shifted by rmw in order to have a conservative estimate of the maximum wind speed at the site of interest the wind field is generated by the holland 1980 model fig 6 shows the results of the stationary runs which identify the wind speed distance combination selected along the iso probability contour wind speed is the maximum cyclone wind at the correlated distance abscissa scale while hs and tp are the resulting local conditions the green point identifies the conditions for which hs reaches its maximum and corresponds to the wind speed distance combination along the iform selected as representative of the 100 year return period conditions the stationary run performed does not give a real representation of the waves generated by a cyclone mainly because the phenomenon cannot be considered stationary hence a non stationary run must be carried out which takes into account the energy accumulation due to the previous phases of the cyclone and or the time necessary to reach stationarity which could lead respectively to larger or lower hs with respect to the stationary case for non stationary runs the selection of the most appropriate spin up time is a crucial issue because of the large impact this could have on final generated waves and extremes to face this relevant issue the following sensitivity methodology is proposed new cyclone tracks have been generated for non stationary simulations with different time lags 9 12 15 18 and 24 h as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 the spin up time for non stationary simulations to reach the hs saturation at the selected location is intended as the time the cyclone is at its hs maximum the track then moves along the iform the spin up time has been evaluated moving towards the point of interest in two different ways with constant wind speed option a shown in fig 7 or along the iform option b shown in fig 8 this allows observers to understand which kind of track could provide the largest effects currently the use of option b would imply a possible decrease of exceedance probability i e an increase in the return period as an additional constraint which correlates points along the iform curve not used in the iform statistic is applied at any rate no significant differences can be observed in the resulting maximum hs using option a or option b moreover about 9 h of maximum wind speed not lower than the one for which the maximum hs is achieved option a are sufficient for arriving at saturation point this is a very plausible wind speed persistence time for cyclonic conditions which it is possible to see exploring some real tracks hence it is assumed that a track moving for at least 9 h towards the location at constant wind speed is representative of the selected return period and conservative this approach is used to build the 100 year return period synthetic tracks for all the five locations considered the swan non stationary run is computed with the newest track the maximum resulting hs during the cyclone time history is assumed to be the cyclonic n year return period extreme for the considered location results are shown in fig 9 for the 100 year return period beira case 6 historical track approach the results derived from the proposed synthetic track approach have been compared with the cyclonic probabilistic assessment obtained from the historical track approach this implies modelling all the real historical track and obtaining the cyclonic condition for a defined exceedance of probability in a certain location analogously to the previous approach the historical tracks considered are those that fall inside a radius of 500 km from each of the points listed in table 1 tracks have been considered with their own entire length a sketch of simulated tracks is shown in fig 3 right panel the wind field has been generated by holland 1980 and wave modelling has been performed by non stationary swan simulations as an example three historical cyclones are shown in fig 10 the first track refers to cyclone doaza on january 1988 the second to atang tropical depression on november 2002 and the last to cyclone jokwe in march 2008 the 100 years return period extremes derived from a statistical analysis of wave generated by real cyclones are calculated for the entire domain in particular gumbell distribution has been selected to facilitate proper fitting of the hs maxima generated by all observed cyclones at each of the five locations fig 11 clearly shows the consequences of applying a methodology based on hindcasting of real events and on statistical treatment of the resulting values at a certain location in fact there are contiguous areas with very large differences in the resulting estimated extremes with strong gradients in rather short spatial ranges it is currently evident that this behaviour is induced by the stochastic passage of cyclone tracks which being very rapidly variable in space induces strong spatial gradient of effects larger in winds than in waves areas where a severe cyclone track actually passed present much larger extreme values with respect to nearby areas with potentially similar cyclone vulnerability where due to the rare occurrence of cyclones a similar cyclone track has not passed this becomes increasingly true the more one moves towards areas where the occurrence of cyclones is less frequent in our test case peripheral areas north and south of madagascar 7 discussion the extreme of 100 year return period significant wave height hs m obtained by the proposed methodology has been considered the basis for the comparison of the proposed method with traditional historical track methods the extreme value analysis eva calculated at each of the five locations is available in table 4 the wind speed distance combinations along the iform iso probability curves which provide the local maximum sea states i e those which are the base for the construction of the synthetic tracks are also given in a similar way fig 12 shows the eva results for i hs maxima from historical track methods squares ii 100 year return period hs maxima obtained from historical track method stars iii the gumbell fits lines and iv 100 year return period hs by the proposed approach based on iform approach circles looking to the traditional method it can be observed that the eva by maxima is sensitive to few events that passed or not at the location of interest considering an area with homogeneous cyclonic vulnerability such as locations of pemba angoche and beira which are in the neighborhood of a distance of 900 km there is apparently no reason why the extreme values deviate for more than 25 respect to the expected i e pemba hs 100yrs 11 8m angoche hs 100yrs 19 8m beira hs 100yrs 14 8m expected mean hs 100yrs 15 4m also for mtwara and maputo that are peripheral sites of cyclone activity a large inconsistency is found mtwara hs 100yrs 9 9m whereas maputo hs 100yrs 14 9m the extreme found for maputo appears dubious it is much larger than pemba and almost equal to beira locations which are more internal to the cyclone activity area furthermore the angoche extreme seems to be much too large with respect to the others especially if compared to pemba the reason for such differences is due to the fact that a single large event caused by the passage of an intense track at the considered location significantly affects the fitting and the final extreme evaluation in particular locations where a cyclone track has passed tend to overestimate the extreme extrapolation with respect to sites where the track has not passed despite the fact that the passage was casual and not more probable in one location than in another for example the cyclone track that passed very close to angoche see fig 9c is the reason for such increase in extreme estimation by the historical track method on the other hand endeavours to improve consistency by eliminating one or more maxima that appear to be out of the statistic would result in an arbitrary operation significantly affecting the statistical approach in light of the already few available events this makes the results obtained with the historical track method quite uncertain the differences on eva results obtained by the traditional historical track and our method is shown in table 4 the percentage variation δ ranges from 20 to 36 the proposed synthetic tracks approach is found effectively in avoiding inexplicable jumps due to spatial variability in central locations cyclonic extreme range from hs 100yrs 14 4 m pemba to hs 100yrs 15 4m beira whereas at peripherical areas mtwara and maputo results are very similar by the proposed method the passage of a particular track at a certain location is statistically considered and tends to be weighted in the same way for two nearby locations either the track passes over it or it does not 8 conclusions the assessment of extreme waves generated by cyclones for long return periods is fundamental for a safe design of coastal and offshore installations in many oceanic areas cyclones are relatively non frequent events with a strong variability on a relatively short spatial scale this implies that standard statistical methods applied to wind and waves measured or hindcasted at a certain location could lead to uncertain or too approximate results actually the probability of having extreme conditions at a certain location is the result of the combination of the probability of occurrence of a cyclone of a certain intensity combined with the probability of track passing at a certain distance from the considered location it is evident that in areas where cyclones seldom arrive the combined effect of these two probabilities can be barely estimated with a large degree of uncertainty considering only the cyclone s effects at the location under examination this fact may considerably impact on design criteria practically if classical statistics of the local values is applied larger extreme values would result for locations where a strong event track actually passed with respect to nearby locations with the same potential cyclonic vulnerability where a track of a cyclone with the same intensity has not passed this is producing unreliable conclusions with strong discontinuities on the extreme value analysis in contiguous areas a methodology to overcome this issue is proposed considering the global combined statistic of the cyclones affecting the area in terms of intensity and distance i e iform method based on this statistics a synthetic cyclone track representative of the conditions of the selected return period can be generated and simulated to provide the resulting wind and wave extremes the proposed methodology allows statistical evaluation of cyclonic extremes not affected by the actual observation of a very specific track but assuming a bi variate distribution of wind speed with distance suitable for any point of interest it produces consistent results avoiding spurious effect due to spatial variability whatever the area of interest would be either in the most central part of cyclonic activity or peripherical the main advantage while using this method is that it solves the un consistency of traditional method that tends to overestimate the extreme events at locations where a cyclone track has already passed with respect to sites where the track has not passed but with a similar vulnerability to cyclone occurrence declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
22306,in engineering design it is often necessary to calculate cyclonic extremes such as winds and waves associated with certain exceedance probabilities estimation is difficult however for at least two reasons the first is related to recorded data mainly referring to previous decades the estimate of extremes over very long periods is heavily influenced by the small number of severe events that have occurred in recent history the second concerns the spatial variability of recorded cyclone tracks because of the low frequency of cyclone occurrence estimates of extremes made from a limited database can vary substantially over relatively small distances even within a spatially limited region where it would be reasonable to expect homogeneous values statistical uncertainty grows exponentially moving toward cyclonic peripheral areas affected very unfrequently by cyclone passages the commonly used methods to account for this uncertainty are historical track shifting and deductive approaches but a certain degree of subjectivity is intrinsic in these approaches for this reason the aim of this paper is to build a more proper statistical methodology to account for cyclone spatial variability on extreme evaluations it is based on the inverse first order reliability method iform used to determine the bivariate exceedance probability of the wind speed track distance for cyclonic events in any selected location by means of numerical modelling namely simulating waves nearshore swan the proposed approach through a logical sequence predicts the cyclonic track characteristics for a certain return period which at the selected location induce the worst conditions in terms of maximum sea state during a cyclonic event compared with the historical methods which consider the effects of all the cyclones occurring in the area the method is able to account for spatial variability even within regions with a very low cyclonic risk the methodology produces consistent results avoiding spurious discontinuities between contiguous locations which presumably have very similar vulnerability to cyclones keywords cyclone statistics extremes iform swan 1 introduction in regions exposed to cyclonic phenomena one fundamental task for engineering design is the estimation of extreme winds and associated waves to be expected during the lifetime of the facility cyclonic phenomena are very complex being characterised by a large variability in track direction intensity velocity pressure and radius following offshore engineering best practices it is common to provide the expected extreme wind and waves associated with cyclonic events for some relevant return periods i e exceedance probability as low as 10 2 or less per year long term historical databases are required to estimate these rare occurrences this poses two basic problems 1 developing a sufficient long term historical database and 2 interpreting the database to provide a reliable estimation the former can be solved by hindcast models it is currently quite common to use cyclone database covering the last 50 60 years the goal of the latter is to find the most appropriate method for determining the cumulative probability distribution function for the largest wind and waves that could occur in the future several studies have investigated tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere see haring and heideman 1980 ward et al 1979 wen and banon 1991 and huang et al 2013 among others contrarily considerably less attention has been paid to the study of the behaviour of tropical cyclones in the southern hemisphere particularly over the south indian ocean ramsay et al 2012 investigated various aspects of tropical cyclone tracks in the southern hemisphere for the period 1969 2008 they conclude that tracks forming west east of about 140 e tend to move westward eastward being relatively straight track with a notable lack of recurvature at present studies dedicated to the probabilistic assessment of cyclonic wind and associated wave height in the southern hemisphere coast are still lacking the commonly adopted approach for the determination of the extreme values associated with cyclonic events for a certain site considers the local effect of a certain number of cyclones and statistically extrapolates the extreme values this can be misleading as the results can be affected by the stochastic passage of cyclone tracks which can differently affect two contiguous sites with the same cyclonic vulnerability the rare nature and the large spatial gradient of cyclonic phenomenon could provide different results for sites as inhomogeneous consequences are experienced in contiguous areas moreover moving towards the peripheral part of areas affected by cyclones increasingly infrequent cyclone passages make the statistic very unreliable to the point of hindering any possible statistical treatment for locations affected only by one or a few cyclones in the last 50 years in a preliminary study the present writers introduced a probabilistic method based on inverse first order reliability method iform to determine the cyclonic waves expected for a certain return period at different locations along the southern coast of east africa de masi et al 2015 this method is based on a bivariate distribution of joint wind speed and distance from the location of interest and produces iso probability curves i e with the same return period of wind speed distance combination in the present paper the methodology has been refined and detailed providing a rigorous framework based on several sensitivity analyses of the main critical parameters a comparison of the proposed probabilistic method and historical track method i e probabilistic assessment based on all the historical cyclones occurring in the area has been performed moreover relevant changes in the hydrodynamic simulations have been introduced in its original form the bulk formula wu 1982 does not cap the value of drag cd at high wind speed u10 7 5 m s whereas the present study used an upper limit of cd 2 5 a logical procedure is outlined based on the statistical results of the iform approach to build for any selected location a cyclonic synthetic track which is considered to be representative of the extreme conditions associated with the desired return period this allows the construction of a statistic which intrinsically tends to provide homogeneous cyclonic severity for contiguous areas and to extrapolate it also at peripheral areas rarely affected by the passage of cyclones the present approach has been applied at five different locations offshore mozambique it provides evidence of the proposed approach overcomes the drawbacks of historical traditional methods which does not account to spatial variability and improves consistency and reliability of extremes evaluation in cyclonic areas 2 statistical methods for extreme assessment 2 1 review of existing design methods for assessing cyclonic wind and wave extremes the estimate of cyclonic extremes at very long periods i e annual exceedance probability as low as 10 2 or less is heavily influenced by a small number of severe events occurring in recent history because of the low frequency of cyclone occurrence estimates of extremes made from a limited e g up to 50 60 years database can vary substantially over relatively small distances this is due to the actual tracks of observed cyclones which sensibly affect the extremes producing high extremes in the areas where cyclone passed in the past and low extremes in the areas where they did not pass even if areas are contiguous and belong to a region that would be expected on the basis of physical interpretation to be statistically homogeneous these results are not reliable because there are no physical reasons to explain such discontinuities commonly used approaches for the prediction of rare cyclonic events are i historical methods and ii deductive methods the former is typically used to determine the 100 year events used in traditional engineering practice on this approach the goal is to fit a probability distribution to the historical records the latter rather than using historical model output at a selected grid point develop probability distribution of cyclone properties from the best track parameters and then use a probabilistic method such as monte carlo or form first order reliability method in historical methods when dealing with very low probability e g 10 3 or less the extrapolation of historical hindcast could lead to large statistical uncertainty generally some means of smoothing site specific conditions estimated from a limited database accounting for track variability should be used commonly used methods include simple spatial smoothing of site specific estimates track shifting and grid point pooling smoothing simply applies a spatial filter over bands of reasonably constant characteristics the main concern with the use of smoothing is the filter length scales to be chosen so as not to overly smooth spatial variations that are thought to be real haring and heideman 1980 proposed a different approach based on pooling in principle for a number of grid point hindcasts storm peaks within a homogeneous region were combined into a cluster before determining a probability distribution function which was then assumed to apply to any random location within the region more recently heideman and mitchell 2009 presented a simplified mathematical interpretation of grid point pooling the main concern with this method is how to select the spacing between grid points that are included in the pool the recommendation for the gulf of mexico is that the distance over which pooling is performed should generally not be less than 150 km or greater than 300 km wide and should be selected with a focus on local water depth fetch limitations orientation of major storm tracks and other local effects api bullettin 2int met 2007 in the track shifting method each historical storm is simulated multiple times the main question is how to shift the tracks the storm central pressure and the radius however the advantage of this method is that no smoothing is required the grid pooling and track shifting methods are similar the frequency of the storm is preserved so the empirical distribution of pooled storm peaks appears to increase the length of history for a specific site by a factor equal to the number of grid points pooled or the number of times that each storm is simulated heideman and mitchell 2009 a somewhat different method was taken by vickery et al 2000 who used statistical properties of historical tracks and intensities to generate a large number of synthetic storms a similar approach was taken by casson and coles 2000 though they generated synthetic tracks by randomly perturbing historical track and simulated intensity along each track by drawing randomly from the sole connection of historical track kerry and jagger 2011 proposed an innovative approach using a markov chain a sequence of random values whose probabilities at a time interval depend upon the value of the number at the previous time they also proposed a different approach which generates storms as a random draw from the collection of historical genesis points moving the storm according to a weighted average of the ambient flow plus a constant beta drift correction deductive methods on the other hand decompose the problem in different physical elements i it fits probability distribution to those elements ii it combines this distribution in a manner consistent with their physical relationship and iii it obtains the probability distribution of the quantity of interest for a fixed platform in the gulf of mexico wen and banon 1991 used a poisson distribution for the hurricane occurrence the track direction relative to depth contour line was modelled by a unimodal four parameter beta distribution whereas pressure differences translation speed and the radius of maximum winds were modelled by a joint lognormal distribution the maximum values of wind wave and current were calculated numerically and then approximated by simple analytical expression via a nonlinear regression procedure e g envelope functions the method can also be applied without using the envelope functions toro et al 2004 compared historical and deductive approaches for the calculation of low probability sea states in the gulf of mexico the results indicate that the deductive method exhibits similar statistical uncertainties to the historical method provided that the latter uses pooling of data the deductive method shows lower overall uncertainties ward et al 1979 developed a probability distribution for extreme individual wave height conditioned on distance of the site from the hurricane track the model begins by considering a distribution function for the largest wave height occurring in a hurricane they then calculate the distribution function for the largest wave height occurring at a site during a specific hurricane and successively the distribution function for the largest wave height during a storm of random intensity at a site located at a random distance from the hurricane by integrating over the range of track distances the model obtains the probability distribution for extreme individual wave height for a random site in this paper a multivariate frequency analysis based on the inverse first order reliability method iform is presented in particular this method is based on a bivariate distribution of joint wind speed and distance from the location of interest after a preliminary analysis of cyclonic tracks a marginal distribution of cyclone distance from the site is previously identified subsequently the best conditioned distributions of wind speed for each distance class are obtained for relevant return periods the corresponding iso probability curves of wind speed distance pairs are outlined 2 2 extreme value approach and inverse first order reliability method the purpose of extreme value analysis is to build a relationship between severe events and the probabilities of their exceedance non exceedance the probability of exceedance of a certain event is usually expressed in terms of the return period or recurrence interval i e the average duration of time during which extreme events exceeding a certain threshold value would occur once for example considering as a variable of interest the wind speed here denoted as ws the main problem is determining the probabilistic distribution f ws that controls the long term trend of observed values the most commonly used distributions are known as the gumbel or type i frechet tippett or type ii and weibull or type iii distributions the distribution parameters are determined from site specific data by fitting technique in the context of offshore hazard for which the environmental factors contribute simultaneously to extreme events a multivariate extreme value distribution which provides the joint distribution of two or more random variables is more relevant when compared to generalised extreme value distribution for univariate random variables one model for creating a joint distribution of two random variables and associating them with a return period is the so called iform model which approximates the joint probability density function of random variables xi and xj based on a marginal distribution of one and the conditional probability density of the other the model originally developed by winterstein et al 1993 is based on the concept of environmental contour which determines combinations of joint random variables that have an identical return period the model is based on a transformation between the original correlated variables in uncorrelated variables vi and vj whose joint density is assumed to be multi dimensional gaussian with standard normal marginal distributions the random variables are transformed from the gaussian space to the original space as per the following equations 1 x i f x i 1 ϕ v i v i g v i 2 x j f x j 1 ϕ v j v j g v j where ϕ v i is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution and f x i 1 is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of x i the joint environmental model of the variables of interest is finally 3 f xi xj f x i x i f xj xi x j x i the mean return period n associated with each contour is calculated as 4 n 1 1 ϕ β in which β is the radius of the circle in standard uncorrelated normal space from which the considered contour was transformed 3 numerical modelling approach 3 1 swan model the modeling system for the present study is a third generation simulating waves nearshore swan model the following dynamic interactions are considered 1 wave refraction over a bottom of variable depth 2 depth and current induced shoaling 3 wave generation by wind 4 dissipation by whitecapping 5 dissipation by depth induced breaking 6 dissipation due to bottom friction and 7 nonlinear wave wave interactions the interaction with current and astronomical tide is crucial when dealing with cyclonic events the physical manifestation of pressure gradient causes the rise and fall of the mean sea level also known as wave set up and wave set down especially during severe cyclones the radiation stress is quite important in storm surge applications as wave set up increases the water level along the coast causing widespread damage associated with coastal inundation brown et al 2011 in the present study the goal is to reconstruct the wave field under cyclonic conditions in deep water so that the hydrodynamic effect can be considered negligible the swan simulating waves nearshore model is used to predict the evolution of waves in geographical space and time based on wave action density spectrum it models the relative frequency σ and wave direction θ based on the governing action balance equation booij et al 1999 represented as 5 n t x c g u n c θ n θ c σ n σ s t o t σ the first two terms on the left hand side of eq 5 represent the rate of change of wave action in time and the propagation of wave action in geographical space respectively where x is the gradient operator in geographic space c θ is the wave group velocity and u is the ambient current vector respectively the water depth and current induced refraction have a propagation velocity of c θ and variations in mean current and depth have propagation velocity of c σ the source term stot represents the cumulative effects from wave growth by wind action balance due to white capping dissipation surf breaking and bottom friction and the action balance exchanged between spectral components in deep and shallow waters due to nonlinear wave wave interaction effects 3 2 modelling of wind fields the wind fields are derived using the holland 1980 formulation with the best track data as explained above the model estimates cyclone wind fields based on the gradient between the atmospheric pressure at the centre of a cyclone and the ambient pressure based on 6 v g a b p n p c exp a r b ρ r b r 2 f 2 4 0 5 r f 2 where p is the pressure at radius r p c the central pressure p n the ambient pressure ρ the air density f is the coriolis parameter and a b scaling parameters physically b defines the shape of the profile and a determines its location relative to the origin two relations are considered between a b rmw radial distance from the eye of cyclone where maximum winds are observed 7 r mw a 1 b 8 v max b ρe p n p c assumed rmw a and b are derived straightforwardly the computed winds are then adjusted to account for the asymmetry introduced by the interaction of the cyclone with the steering flow chan and gray 1982 by adding the translatory movement of the cyclone to the existing wind field in the northern hemisphere this vectorial addition increases the winds on the right hand side of the direction of the cyclone movement and reduces those on the left hand side and vice versa in the southern hemisphere 3 3 wind input parameterisation the effects of wind input parameterisation on wave estimation under cyclonic conditions have been examined by many authors huang et al 2013 murty et al 2014 and zijlema et al 2012 among others the source term for energy input by wind is driven by the friction wind velocity u since the wind fields are formulated in terms of wind speed at 10m elevation u10 swan requires transformation from u10 to u this transformation is carried out with the conventional expression 9 u c d u 10 2 the value of the wind drag coefficient c d in swan is due to two different formulations those of wu 1982 10 c d 1 2875 10 3 f o r u 10 7 5 m s 0 8 0 065 u 10 10 3 f o r u 10 7 5 m s and that of zijlema et al 2012 11 c d 0 55 2 97 u ˇ 1 49 u ˇ 2 10 3 in which u ˇ u 10 u r e f with u r e f is the reference wind at which c d attains its maximum value i e 31 5 m s by comparing both formulations it was found that c d values are lower than in the expression of wu 1982 by 10 30 for high wind speed 15 u 10 7 5 m s and over 30 for hurricane wind speeds u 10 32 6 m s many observers powell et al 2003 2007a 2007b black et al 2007 smith and banke 1975 and jarosz et al 2007 show that c d increases almost linearly with wind speed up to 20 m s then almost levels off at wind speeds of 35 m s and finally decreases at very high wind speeds i e higher than 40 m s this is only qualitatively supported by field data moreover zijlema et al 2012 stated that the validation of the wind drag at high wind speed was beyond the scope of their study the main concern with the formulation of zijlema et al 2012 is that when dealing with cyclones of category 5 the estimated energy transferred to waves would be close to zero in the present study the formulation of wu 1982 is preferred to that of zijlema et al 2012 the over estimation of the wind drag coefficient at high wind speed i e u 10 20 m s in the wu 1982 formulation has been remedied by capping the c d value at the limiting value of 2 5 10 3 as in the csowm wave model khandekar et al 1994 see fig 1 4 the synthetic track approach in this section the synthetic track approach to reconstruct the extreme cyclonic sea state with defined probability of exceedance is presented the identification of the cyclone track associated with a specified return period i e wind speed vs distance is performed according to the following methodology see fig 2 5 case study the mozambique channel the south indian ocean cyclonic area has been selected as a test case in particular the east african coast of the mozambique channel has been considered and the analysis has focused on the 5 locations listed in table 1 spanning the whole cyclonic area from north to south the locations have been selected on account of their being characterised by different cyclonic occurrences higher for the central portion of mozambique tropical cyclone data were obtained from the joint typhoon warning centre best track data jtwc jtwc adheres to the world meteorological organization wmo though jtwc data starts in 1945 for the southern hemisphere only the data from 1980 onwards were used owing to questionable data quality during the pre satellite era the dataset includes i position in latitude and longitude ii maximum sustained winds knots and iii central pressure in the cyclone eye mbar in the present analysis tracks within the region 5 s to 35 s and 30 e to 60 e and falling inside a radius of 500 km from each of the points listed in table 1 are considered a total of 64 cyclones and tropical storms have been considered in relation to the last 35 years see fig 3 they represent the most significate amount of cyclones occurring in the area the track from e has been selected since it is the most representative table 2 shows the total cyclone duration the mean and maximum forward speed maximum wind speed pressure drop and direction in which the selected cyclones move the iform approach has been applied to maximum wind speed and distance from the site of interest associated with that return period the marginal variable is the distance of cyclone from the site while the wind speed is assumed conditional on the distance variable a marginal distribution of distances for all points of the tracks is computed by fitting a 3p weibull distribution on classed distance values table 3 the same has been applied for the wind speed which is assumed conditional on the distance the iform contours are computed by 3 for different n year return periods it should be noted how fast the wind speed decreases on approaching the 0 distance see fig 4 as regards the model set up the bathymetric data for the study was obtained from gebco general bathymetric chart of the oceans http www gebco net which has a grid spacing of 30 arc sec and is maintained by the british oceanographic data centre bodc the structured mesh covers the entire east coast of mozambique from tanzania to south africa the grid covers an offshore distance of approximately 20 the grid resolution is uniform in the overall domain the possibility of variable grid resolution has been evaluated but in order to optimise the computational time and due to the fact that shallow water effects with complex bathymetry are of no interest this approach was abandoned under this consideration grid spacing was specified as 10 km a time step of 5 min was selected in order to resolve the equations accurately the swan model was implemented in stationary and non stationary mode the numerical model has been calibrated with local measurements the quantile quantile qq plot in fig 5 shows the hs from swan model vs local measurements considering the overlapping period of 1 year model parameter settings are here described frequency and directional domains have been discretized with 36 directional and 50 frequency bins respectively the logarithmic frequency bins ranged from 0 025 to 0 5 hz whereas the wave directions had an angular resolution of 10 the non linear wave wave interaction in deep water is the quadruplet wave wave interaction it is computed using the discrete interaction approximation dia technique proposed by hasselmann et al 1985 and adapted in the swan model the jonswap model has been selected for swan simulation the default parameters for peak enhancement factor 3 3 has been used the bottom friction formulation proposed by madsen et al 1988 has been used in swan simulations in the presented case studies its effects is negligible however considering wave propagation to shore which is part of sensitivity analysis not presented in this paper bottom friction was used to calibrate the model value equal to 0 0500 the white capping formulation of komen et al 1984 is chosen the coefficient for determining the rate of whitecapping dissipation has been set to 2 36e 5 whereas the value of the wave steepness equal to 3 02e 3 the swan stationary run is computed by generating an artificial track characterised by distance from site and wind intensity with all possible cyclone conditions along the n years iform curve fig 4 for the sake of simplicity only the 100 years event has been considered due to the rapid decrease of the wind speed when the distance approaches 0 i e when the track passes directly over the site it is likely that the most impacting condition is located at a certain distance with a much larger wind speed rmw is chosen following eq 7 the track is then shifted by rmw in order to have a conservative estimate of the maximum wind speed at the site of interest the wind field is generated by the holland 1980 model fig 6 shows the results of the stationary runs which identify the wind speed distance combination selected along the iso probability contour wind speed is the maximum cyclone wind at the correlated distance abscissa scale while hs and tp are the resulting local conditions the green point identifies the conditions for which hs reaches its maximum and corresponds to the wind speed distance combination along the iform selected as representative of the 100 year return period conditions the stationary run performed does not give a real representation of the waves generated by a cyclone mainly because the phenomenon cannot be considered stationary hence a non stationary run must be carried out which takes into account the energy accumulation due to the previous phases of the cyclone and or the time necessary to reach stationarity which could lead respectively to larger or lower hs with respect to the stationary case for non stationary runs the selection of the most appropriate spin up time is a crucial issue because of the large impact this could have on final generated waves and extremes to face this relevant issue the following sensitivity methodology is proposed new cyclone tracks have been generated for non stationary simulations with different time lags 9 12 15 18 and 24 h as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 the spin up time for non stationary simulations to reach the hs saturation at the selected location is intended as the time the cyclone is at its hs maximum the track then moves along the iform the spin up time has been evaluated moving towards the point of interest in two different ways with constant wind speed option a shown in fig 7 or along the iform option b shown in fig 8 this allows observers to understand which kind of track could provide the largest effects currently the use of option b would imply a possible decrease of exceedance probability i e an increase in the return period as an additional constraint which correlates points along the iform curve not used in the iform statistic is applied at any rate no significant differences can be observed in the resulting maximum hs using option a or option b moreover about 9 h of maximum wind speed not lower than the one for which the maximum hs is achieved option a are sufficient for arriving at saturation point this is a very plausible wind speed persistence time for cyclonic conditions which it is possible to see exploring some real tracks hence it is assumed that a track moving for at least 9 h towards the location at constant wind speed is representative of the selected return period and conservative this approach is used to build the 100 year return period synthetic tracks for all the five locations considered the swan non stationary run is computed with the newest track the maximum resulting hs during the cyclone time history is assumed to be the cyclonic n year return period extreme for the considered location results are shown in fig 9 for the 100 year return period beira case 6 historical track approach the results derived from the proposed synthetic track approach have been compared with the cyclonic probabilistic assessment obtained from the historical track approach this implies modelling all the real historical track and obtaining the cyclonic condition for a defined exceedance of probability in a certain location analogously to the previous approach the historical tracks considered are those that fall inside a radius of 500 km from each of the points listed in table 1 tracks have been considered with their own entire length a sketch of simulated tracks is shown in fig 3 right panel the wind field has been generated by holland 1980 and wave modelling has been performed by non stationary swan simulations as an example three historical cyclones are shown in fig 10 the first track refers to cyclone doaza on january 1988 the second to atang tropical depression on november 2002 and the last to cyclone jokwe in march 2008 the 100 years return period extremes derived from a statistical analysis of wave generated by real cyclones are calculated for the entire domain in particular gumbell distribution has been selected to facilitate proper fitting of the hs maxima generated by all observed cyclones at each of the five locations fig 11 clearly shows the consequences of applying a methodology based on hindcasting of real events and on statistical treatment of the resulting values at a certain location in fact there are contiguous areas with very large differences in the resulting estimated extremes with strong gradients in rather short spatial ranges it is currently evident that this behaviour is induced by the stochastic passage of cyclone tracks which being very rapidly variable in space induces strong spatial gradient of effects larger in winds than in waves areas where a severe cyclone track actually passed present much larger extreme values with respect to nearby areas with potentially similar cyclone vulnerability where due to the rare occurrence of cyclones a similar cyclone track has not passed this becomes increasingly true the more one moves towards areas where the occurrence of cyclones is less frequent in our test case peripheral areas north and south of madagascar 7 discussion the extreme of 100 year return period significant wave height hs m obtained by the proposed methodology has been considered the basis for the comparison of the proposed method with traditional historical track methods the extreme value analysis eva calculated at each of the five locations is available in table 4 the wind speed distance combinations along the iform iso probability curves which provide the local maximum sea states i e those which are the base for the construction of the synthetic tracks are also given in a similar way fig 12 shows the eva results for i hs maxima from historical track methods squares ii 100 year return period hs maxima obtained from historical track method stars iii the gumbell fits lines and iv 100 year return period hs by the proposed approach based on iform approach circles looking to the traditional method it can be observed that the eva by maxima is sensitive to few events that passed or not at the location of interest considering an area with homogeneous cyclonic vulnerability such as locations of pemba angoche and beira which are in the neighborhood of a distance of 900 km there is apparently no reason why the extreme values deviate for more than 25 respect to the expected i e pemba hs 100yrs 11 8m angoche hs 100yrs 19 8m beira hs 100yrs 14 8m expected mean hs 100yrs 15 4m also for mtwara and maputo that are peripheral sites of cyclone activity a large inconsistency is found mtwara hs 100yrs 9 9m whereas maputo hs 100yrs 14 9m the extreme found for maputo appears dubious it is much larger than pemba and almost equal to beira locations which are more internal to the cyclone activity area furthermore the angoche extreme seems to be much too large with respect to the others especially if compared to pemba the reason for such differences is due to the fact that a single large event caused by the passage of an intense track at the considered location significantly affects the fitting and the final extreme evaluation in particular locations where a cyclone track has passed tend to overestimate the extreme extrapolation with respect to sites where the track has not passed despite the fact that the passage was casual and not more probable in one location than in another for example the cyclone track that passed very close to angoche see fig 9c is the reason for such increase in extreme estimation by the historical track method on the other hand endeavours to improve consistency by eliminating one or more maxima that appear to be out of the statistic would result in an arbitrary operation significantly affecting the statistical approach in light of the already few available events this makes the results obtained with the historical track method quite uncertain the differences on eva results obtained by the traditional historical track and our method is shown in table 4 the percentage variation δ ranges from 20 to 36 the proposed synthetic tracks approach is found effectively in avoiding inexplicable jumps due to spatial variability in central locations cyclonic extreme range from hs 100yrs 14 4 m pemba to hs 100yrs 15 4m beira whereas at peripherical areas mtwara and maputo results are very similar by the proposed method the passage of a particular track at a certain location is statistically considered and tends to be weighted in the same way for two nearby locations either the track passes over it or it does not 8 conclusions the assessment of extreme waves generated by cyclones for long return periods is fundamental for a safe design of coastal and offshore installations in many oceanic areas cyclones are relatively non frequent events with a strong variability on a relatively short spatial scale this implies that standard statistical methods applied to wind and waves measured or hindcasted at a certain location could lead to uncertain or too approximate results actually the probability of having extreme conditions at a certain location is the result of the combination of the probability of occurrence of a cyclone of a certain intensity combined with the probability of track passing at a certain distance from the considered location it is evident that in areas where cyclones seldom arrive the combined effect of these two probabilities can be barely estimated with a large degree of uncertainty considering only the cyclone s effects at the location under examination this fact may considerably impact on design criteria practically if classical statistics of the local values is applied larger extreme values would result for locations where a strong event track actually passed with respect to nearby locations with the same potential cyclonic vulnerability where a track of a cyclone with the same intensity has not passed this is producing unreliable conclusions with strong discontinuities on the extreme value analysis in contiguous areas a methodology to overcome this issue is proposed considering the global combined statistic of the cyclones affecting the area in terms of intensity and distance i e iform method based on this statistics a synthetic cyclone track representative of the conditions of the selected return period can be generated and simulated to provide the resulting wind and wave extremes the proposed methodology allows statistical evaluation of cyclonic extremes not affected by the actual observation of a very specific track but assuming a bi variate distribution of wind speed with distance suitable for any point of interest it produces consistent results avoiding spurious effect due to spatial variability whatever the area of interest would be either in the most central part of cyclonic activity or peripherical the main advantage while using this method is that it solves the un consistency of traditional method that tends to overestimate the extreme events at locations where a cyclone track has already passed with respect to sites where the track has not passed but with a similar vulnerability to cyclone occurrence declaration of competing interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
22307,this paper presents a novel navigation method for autonomous underwater vehicle auv in respect of improving the precision of navigation recent research mainly focused on how to reduce the system model error however existing optimization methods are less efficient and effective in decreasing interference of sensor deviation motivated by the excellent performance of deep learning a hybrid recurrent neural networks hybrid rnns framework is proposed to estimate the auv position firstly since the different sensors have different data frequency this method employs unidirectional and bi directional long short term memory lstm with multiple memory units to handle raw sensor values in a single calculation cycle subsequently using the outputs of lstms and the time interval of the cycle above the fully connected layers could obtain the displacements of auv eventually to verify the effectiveness of the proposed navigation algorithm a series of evaluations have been carried out which are based on a public dataset and real experimental data of our auv the evaluation results have been validated that the proposed method can reduce the interference of sensor deviation and has better accuracy as well as fault tolerance for navigation meanwhile it could also satisfy the real time requirement keywords auv navigation deep learning long short term memory 1 introduction as crucial equipment to explore the ocean much attention has been drawn to the auv in marine detection missions accurate navigation is a critical factor as a consequence navigation and localization technology has become a central issue for ocean engineering applications the relevant navigation and localization technology mainly include inertial navigation acoustic navigation simultaneous localization and mapping slam and integrated navigation miller et al 2010 paull et al 2014 among the commonly used navigation and localization technology the inertial navigation system is suitable for robot navigation in most situations as it uses inertial sensors to get the pose information kuritsky et al 1983 barshan and durrant whyte 1995 and does not rely on external reference however the error of sensor drift in inertial navigation will accumulate over time which reduces the navigation performance another kind of navigation technology is acoustic navigation auv receives the sound message from pre arranged acoustic beacons to calculate the current location morgado et al 2011 because the acoustic beacons must be placed in advance the acoustic navigation is not proper for an unknown environment alternatively slam can obtain consistent maps and accurate localization at the same time therefore it is suited for the scenario of exploring unknown environment hidalgo and bräunl 2015 nevertheless slam requires external environment information measured by additional sensors and high computation capacity compared to the technologies introduced above the integrated navigation system is more comfortable to implement in practical works and has been widely used in underwater navigation since it combines several different systems and employs multiple sources of information to supplement each other brown 1972 over the past several decades there has been considerable interest in high precision integrated navigation for auv the state estimation techniques such as dead reckoning dr extended kalman filter ekf and unscented kalman filter ukf brokloff 1997 allotta et al 2016 use the data of different sensors to estimate the state by using the optimization methods the system model error will be limited to a certain level and the accuracy of localization will be improved however the sensor deviation problem still exists deep learning lecun et al 2015 has been developing rapidly in recent years and performing well in many fields such as image segmentation and classification chen et al 2018 he et al 2016 video object tracking bertinetto et al 2016 pattern recognition machado et al 2017 etc there are serval relevant algorithms that could be used for underwater applications the convolutional neural network cnn can be adopted to extract useful features to improve the acoustic image matching performance in underwater application kim et al 2016 cnn and recurrent neural network rnn could be used in visual odometry to extract features and estimate vehicle path moreover there have been several simulation experiments been carried out to validate the effectiveness wang et al 2017 in the proposed method the raw measurements from different sensors in the same calculation cycle are sent into corresponding rnn units respectively hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 since the bi directional lstm graves and schmidhuber 2005 is suitable for prediction based on massive previous and subsequent data the high frequency data of attitude are processed by it meanwhile the low frequency data of velocity sensor are handled by unidirectional lstm the outputs of multiple rnns and time interval of two cycles are sent to fully connected layers simultaneously to predict the displacement of the vehicle comparison results of the public dataset and our auv real experimental data demonstrate that the hybrid rnns can reduce the interference of sensor deviation and improve the navigation accuracy as well as the proposed method can satisfy the real time requirement the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the navigation system of our sailfish auv the proposed hybrid rnns is presented in section 3 section 4 shows the experimental results of the kitti dataset and our auv real data by the proposed method finally section 5 summarizes the key conclusions of this work 2 auv navigation system 2 1 description of the sailfish auv the sailfish auv which independently developed at underwater vehicle lab of the ocean university of china is presented in fig 1 it is equipped with the navigation and localization system control and propulsion system communication system environmental perception and data driven system etc fig 2 is the navigation and localization system which has various sensors and equipment including global position system gps attitude and heading reference system ahrs doppler velocity log dvl and pressure sensor the data from all sensors and equipment would be sent to onboard cpu for ego motion estimation the core processor in our sailfish is a single board computer with two cores and 777 mhz main frequency the operating system is linux moreover moos ivp is the software to achieve autonomy and data acquisition the sensors and equipment of navigation are connected to the processor by serial port gps is a satellite navigation system the distance between the satellites and receiver is measured according to the time stamp and the position of the receiver could be calculated by combining the data from multiple satellites generally the gps position is considered as the true position of the vehicle however it is impractical for the auv to receive gps information when the vehicle is underwater in this paper the gps value with an adaptive filter can be viewed as the ground truth to evaluate the performance of the algorithm ahrs usually consists of a multi axis gyroscope a multi axis acceleration sensor and a magnetic compass the data of these sensors are fused by a kalman filter to provide three degrees of freedom rotational displacements yaw pitch and roll the pitch and roll could maintain long term stability and high accuracy which is achieved by the process of measuring gravity vector via

vehicle velocity by analyzing frequency shift this unit transmits a short sound pulse with a fixed frequency to the bottom of the water then receives the echoes according to the doppler effect the dvl can calculate the velocity along with the forward starboard and upward axes the measurements of dvl have a deviation due to the uncertainty of sound velocity therefore the velocity bias of dvl would be another problem for auv navigation pressure sensor aims to measure the underwater depth of auv the depth information which is estimated by combining fluid density and pressure data is generally regarded as a trustworthy value 2 2 gps adaptive filter the auv antenna is exposed to air when auv is floating on the water the gps signal is susceptible due to the multipath effect the instrument

be treated as a measurement failure while the prediction will be used as the final estimation otherwise the kalman filter will be used to estimate an optimal localization value besides a forgetting factor is introduced into the system error covariance which could accelerate the convergence and obtain the optimal value faster the forgetting factor would be used as a dynamic weight to adjust the system covariance additionally the system state and forgetting factor will be initialized due to the fact that gps only works above water the forgetting factor and the initialization mechanism reflect the adaptability of the filter 2 3 navigation algorithm the navigation algorithms used in our sailfish auv platform are given as follows 2 3 1 dead reckoning as the most common method for navigation dr is widely applied in autonomous vehicles the orientation and velocity of auv are used for pose estimation the implementation of dr is defined as equation 3 3 x y k x u cos ψ v sin ψ t y u sin ψ v cos ψ t k 1 where x and y represent the vehicle location in the world frame u and v are the longitudinal and transverse velocities of auv in horizontal coordinates ψ is the yaw angle and t is the time interval although dr is easy to realize the navigation and positioning performance is sensitivity to measurement error 2 3 2 extended kalman filter ekf is a navigation algorithm which is frequently used at present as same as the kalman filter ekf could also be divided into time update phase and measurement update phase furthermore it can achieve nonlinear state estimation by linearizing system model the difference between kalman filter and ekf is update function and transition matrix the time update function is as follows 4 x y ψ u v a u a v ω k x u t 1 2 a u t 2 cos ψ v t 1 2 a v t 2 sin ψ

particular elements in system state which include velocity acceleration yaw angle and angular speed therefore the measurement model has a linear relationship with the system state the measurement transition matrix h could be written as equation 6 6 h 0 6 2 i 6 6 although the ekf has been applied successfully for a long time it still suffers from several major drawbacks for example the ekf is not suitable for the strong nonlinear system as it would discard high order taylor terms during the linearization process 2 3 3 unscented kalman filter as mentioned in the section above the navigation system with ekf has poor performance for stronger nonlinear system estimation in order to achieve better performance ukf is adopted for the navigation system during the time update process assuming

application 3 end to end navigation through hybrid rnns in this section the hybrid rnns framework is described in detail it is mainly composed of rnn with multiple memory units and the fully connected layers 3 1 network architecture the architecture of the proposed end to end navigation and positioning system is shown in fig 4 the label d e and d n are the displacements of the vehicle on the east and north direction it adopts the relevant measurement values from all sensors and the time interval δ t between two calculation cycles as input this framework periodically obtains motion displacement even though the sampling time of velocity and attitude are different in a calculation cycle the speed measured by dvl are fed into lstm and the orientation measured by ahrs are fed into bi lstm the fully connected layers are introduced to transform the outputs of rnns and the time interval to displacement estimation the filtered gps trajectories are separated into a number of segments with different lengths to generate labels for training 3 2 sequential learning deep rnn rnn has been successfully applied in various fields such as video object tracking speech recognition machine translation etc by fusing sequential information with the current state estimation rnn could provide a low frequency and accurate position to solve the problem of sensor deviation fig 5 illustrates the basic structure of the rnn the implementation of rnn is expressed as equations 18 and 19 the input x t can be updated based on previous information where w and b represent weight and bias of neural cell respectively σ h and σ y are the activation functions the output h of each hidden layer is used for the subsequent calculation the measurement data of velocity and attitude might have outliers therefore the rnn framework should have the capacity to choose contributive input values some varieties of rnn framework such as gated recurrent unit gru and lstm could realize this function compared to gru the lstm is better in solving gradient vanishing problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 based on the excellent performance lstm is selected to use in our framework firstly the forget gate computes forgetting factor which employs input data and previous hidden layer output subsequently the input gate determines the contribution degree of current input afterward the cell state get updated based on the input and forget gate eventually the cell state and input are provided to output gate to calculate the current hidden layer output and the lstm output see fig 6 equation 20 24 are used for the calculation above in the lstm cell 20 f t σ w y h t 1 x t b f 21 i t σ h t 1 x t b i 22 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 23 o t σ g w o x t u o h t 1 b o 24 h t o t tanh c t where f t is the output of forget gate i t the input gate o t the output gate the means the point wise product operation the activation function usually chooses sigmoid in the lstm cell the tangent function is used to update the candidates of current cell state the bi directional lstm contains two inverted lstm with the same structure which suits for prediction with previous and subsequent data considering that continuous ahrs data have almost the same impact on motion displacement in a calculation cycle they are fed into bi lstm different from ahrs the velocity measurements from dvl with low frequency are fed into lstm as the forget gate determines the contribution degree of previous data the abnormal data interference could be eliminated by this framework 3 3 fully connected layer the fully connected layer aims to collect the outputs of rnns and the time interval of calculation cycles then transfers them into motion displacements the motion could be divided into two independent segments which are along north and east direction respectively to improve the accuracy of prediction the fully connected layer is designed as two branches each branch has two hidden layers for fitting results in order to enhance the nonlinearity of the system and improve the convergence speed the rectified linear unit is adopted as an activation function the displacements of gps are regarded as labels in this network root mean square error rmse as shown in equation 25 is used to calculate loss while the adagrad optimizer is adopted to train network 25 ξ 1 m i 1 m χ i χ ˆ i 2 where m is the number of samples χ the label value obtained by gps position segment χ ˆ the prediction value in our network the label is divided into two direction movements as a result the loss in each direction movement is calculated individually 4 experiments and analysis in this section the proposed end to end navigation method is evaluated based on a public dataset kitti geiger et al 2013 and our auv real experimental data the deep learning requires a mass of data and lots of iterate calculations to generate stable predict results to increase the efficiency of training a fading learning rate was introduced during experiments the losses of our framework in training and testing during 1000 iterations are depicted in fig 7 4 1 kitti dataset test kitti dataset was obtained by a moving platform driving in and around karlsruhe which includes data of camera images laser scan gps imu system the platform has four cameras two color and two grayscale cameras to collect images around the trajectory velodyne scan was employed to get 3d environment information in point clouds the oxts gps imu integrated navigation system was used to build the attitude orientation velocity acceleration angular speed etc the velocity in the vehicle coordinate system and orientation can be fed into our framework during our navigation experiments attitude orientation and velocity were used as input the oxts data includes forward leftward and upward velocity from the airborne coordinate system the raw data of yaw pitch and roll were based on the east north up coordinate before the experiment the attitude and orientation were transformed into the north east down coordinate to keep uniform with auv the oxts integrated navigation system has fused the information of gps and imu the quality of gps is affected by the environment therefore some position data of oxts system have deviated from the real path partial data with better performance were picked as the training and testing data fig 8 illustrates the positioning performance by our deep learning framework and dr as the gps can help imu to improve the measurement accuracy almost all the raw data are accurate the results show that the trajectory of hybrid rnns is close to gps and our method has effectiveness in the kitti dataset 4 2 auv real experimental data test the gps adaptive filter was introduced to process the gps path due to uncertain jumps in the original location information the labels for neural network need to be filtered before the training phase and also could be treated as the truth value to evaluate the performance of our method fig 9 shows the results of the adaptive filter the red lines are the filtered trajectories compared with the raw positions represented by black lines the jumps of gps location have been effectively filtered out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid rnns a series of auv real experimental data in menlou reservoir jiaozhou bay and tuandao bay had been carried out the details of auv real experimental data are depicted in table 1 dr ekf ukf and extreme learning machine elm were used to generate the trajectory the test results show the comparisons between the proposed algorithm and other approaches in fig 10 four groups of auv path estimation were produced by the methods above black lines represent the gps trajectories which been filtered by the adaptive filter and can be considered as ground truth for auv red lines represent dr trajectories green lines ekf trajectories blue lines ukf trajectories cyan lines elm trajectories violet lines the proposed method in most experimental results the trajectories obtained by hybrid rnns are closer to gps than other methods in fig 10 a the trajectories obtained by traditional methods are closed to the ground truth than the proposed method fig 11 reports the errors between the ground truth and the estimation position obtained by different algorithms in fig 11 a the performance of the proposed method is relatively weak but still better than elm due to the small sensor deviation and high positioning accuracy of traditional methods the proposed algorithm could not reflect its advantages in test1 fig 11 b shows the error of test2 and the transverse measurement velocity of dvl has a jump around step 180 see fig 12 in such a situation that the original data have large outliers the proposed method performs more excellent than others elm has a better path estimation than dr and ekf but worse than ukf this is because the neural network algorithms have a certain level of fault tolerance ability however the structure of elm is too simple to complete complex navigation calculations this result illustrates that the hybrid rnns has positive fault tolerance fig 11 c and d show that the proposed method performs superior to other algorithms table 2 summarizes the rmse of all algorithms above during the four experiments results of rmse evidence the hybrid rnns framework has superior effectiveness in most cases additionally the process duration of each algorithm above during the experiments are used to evaluate the algorithm efficiency as depicted in table 3 compared with ekf and ukf the proposed algorithm has a shorter running time the experimental results illustrate that the machine learning method could effectively suppress the interference caused by sensor deviation however the elm with a single hidden layer is hard to replace the complicated formulas in navigation algorithm the proposed method with multiple rnns is able to estimate accurate position and has high real time capability 5 conclusions this paper presents a novel end to end navigation algorithm based on deep neural networks which uses raw data from sensors to obtain position estimation directly since the sensor data have different sampling frequency this framework handles the raw data of dvl and ahrs by using unidirectional and bi directional lstm respectively then use the outputs of lstms and the time interval of the calculation cycle as the inputs of the fully connected layers to predict the auv displacement considering the framework gets results by end to end schema it does not need to handle various complex matrix operations and is also easy to implement the experimental results of the kitti dataset and our auv real data validate that the hybrid rnns could reduce the interference of sensor deviation and has better accuracy as well as fault tolerance for navigation also it could satisfy the real time requirement although the proposed method demonstrates superiority in most situations it remains instability occasionally we suggest the deep learning navigation method can be a supplement for traditional algorithms to enhance the positioning accuracy and fault tolerance our future work will focus on the intelligence fusion method of deep learning and navigation algorithms acknowledgement this work is partially supported by the national key research and

22307,this paper presents a novel navigation method for autonomous underwater vehicle auv in respect of improving the precision of navigation recent research mainly focused on how to reduce the system model error however existing optimization methods are less efficient and effective in decreasing interference of sensor deviation motivated by the excellent performance of deep learning a hybrid recurrent neural networks hybrid rnns framework is proposed to estimate the auv position firstly since the different sensors have different data frequency this method employs unidirectional and bi directional long short term memory lstm with multiple memory units to handle raw sensor values in a single calculation cycle subsequently using the outputs of lstms and the time interval of the cycle above the fully connected layers could obtain the displacements of auv eventually to verify the effectiveness of the proposed navigation algorithm a series of evaluations have been carried out which are based on a public dataset and real experimental data of our auv the evaluation results have been validated that the proposed method can reduce the interference of sensor deviation and has better accuracy as well as fault tolerance for navigation meanwhile it could also satisfy the real time requirement keywords auv navigation deep learning long short term memory 1 introduction as crucial equipment to explore the ocean much attention has been drawn to the auv in marine detection missions accurate navigation is a critical factor as a consequence navigation and localization technology has become a central issue for ocean engineering applications the relevant navigation and localization technology mainly include inertial navigation acoustic navigation simultaneous localization and mapping slam and integrated navigation miller et al 2010 paull et al 2014 among the commonly used navigation and localization technology the inertial navigation system is suitable for robot navigation in most situations as it uses inertial sensors to get the pose information kuritsky et al 1983 barshan and durrant whyte 1995 and does not rely on external reference however the error of sensor drift in inertial navigation will accumulate over time which reduces the navigation performance another kind of navigation technology is acoustic navigation auv receives the sound message from pre arranged acoustic beacons to calculate the current location morgado et al 2011 because the acoustic beacons must be placed in advance the acoustic navigation is not proper for an unknown environment alternatively slam can obtain consistent maps and accurate localization at the same time therefore it is suited for the scenario of exploring unknown environment hidalgo and bräunl 2015 nevertheless slam requires external environment information measured by additional sensors and high computation capacity compared to the technologies introduced above the integrated navigation system is more comfortable to implement in practical works and has been widely used in underwater navigation since it combines several different systems and employs multiple sources of information to supplement each other brown 1972 over the past several decades there has been considerable interest in high precision integrated navigation for auv the state estimation techniques such as dead reckoning dr extended kalman filter ekf and unscented kalman filter ukf brokloff 1997 allotta et al 2016 use the data of different sensors to estimate the state by using the optimization methods the system model error will be limited to a certain level and the accuracy of localization will be improved however the sensor deviation problem still exists deep learning lecun et al 2015 has been developing rapidly in recent years and performing well in many fields such as image segmentation and classification chen et al 2018 he et al 2016 video object tracking bertinetto et al 2016 pattern recognition machado et al 2017 etc there are serval relevant algorithms that could be used for underwater applications the convolutional neural network cnn can be adopted to extract useful features to improve the acoustic image matching performance in underwater application kim et al 2016 cnn and recurrent neural network rnn could be used in visual odometry to extract features and estimate vehicle path moreover there have been several simulation experiments been carried out to validate the effectiveness wang et al 2017 in the proposed method the raw measurements from different sensors in the same calculation cycle are sent into corresponding rnn units respectively hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 since the bi directional lstm graves and schmidhuber 2005 is suitable for prediction based on massive previous and subsequent data the high frequency data of attitude are processed by it meanwhile the low frequency data of velocity sensor are handled by unidirectional lstm the outputs of multiple rnns and time interval of two cycles are sent to fully connected layers simultaneously to predict the displacement of the vehicle comparison results of the public dataset and our auv real experimental data demonstrate that the hybrid rnns can reduce the interference of sensor deviation and improve the navigation accuracy as well as the proposed method can satisfy the real time requirement the remainder

application 3 end to end navigation through hybrid rnns in this section the hybrid rnns framework is described in detail it is mainly composed of rnn with multiple memory units and the fully connected layers 3 1 network architecture the architecture of the proposed end to end navigation and positioning system is shown in fig 4 the label d e and d n are the displacements of the vehicle on the east and north direction it adopts the relevant measurement values from all sensors and the time interval δ t between two calculation cycles as input this framework periodically obtains motion displacement even though the sampling time of velocity and attitude are different in a calculation cycle the speed measured by dvl are fed into lstm and the orientation measured by ahrs are fed into bi lstm the fully connected layers are introduced to transform the outputs of rnns and the time interval to displacement estimation the filtered gps trajectories are separated into a number of segments with different lengths to generate labels for training 3 2 sequential learning deep rnn rnn has been successfully applied in various fields such as video object tracking speech recognition machine translation etc by fusing sequential information with the current state estimation rnn could provide a low frequency and accurate position to solve the problem of sensor deviation fig 5 illustrates the basic structure of the rnn the implementation of rnn is expressed as equations 18 and 19 the input x t can be updated based on previous information where w and b represent weight and bias of neural cell respectively σ h and σ y are the activation functions the output h of each hidden layer is used for the subsequent calculation the measurement data of velocity and attitude might have outliers therefore the rnn framework should have the capacity to choose contributive input values some varieties of rnn framework such as gated recurrent unit gru and lstm could realize this function compared to gru the lstm is better in solving gradient vanishing problem hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 based on the excellent performance lstm is selected to use in our framework firstly the forget gate computes forgetting factor which employs input data and previous hidden layer output subsequently the input gate determines the contribution degree of current input afterward the cell state get updated based on the input and forget gate eventually the cell state and input are provided to output gate to calculate the current hidden layer output and the lstm output see fig 6 equation 20 24 are used for the calculation above in the lstm cell 20 f t σ w y h t 1 x t b f 21 i t σ h t 1 x t b i 22 c t f t c t 1 i t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 23 o t σ g w o x t u o h t 1 b o 24 h t o t tanh c t where f t is the output of forget gate i t the input gate o t the output gate the means the point wise product operation the activation function usually chooses sigmoid in the lstm cell the tangent function is used to update the candidates of current cell state the bi directional lstm contains two inverted lstm with the same structure which suits for prediction with previous and subsequent data considering that continuous ahrs data have almost the same impact on motion displacement in a calculation cycle they are fed into bi lstm different from ahrs the velocity measurements from dvl with low frequency are fed into lstm as the forget gate determines the contribution degree of previous data the abnormal data interference could be eliminated by this framework 3 3 fully connected layer the fully connected layer aims to collect the outputs of rnns and the time interval of calculation cycles then transfers them into motion displacements the motion could be divided into two independent segments which are along north and east direction respectively to improve the accuracy of prediction the fully connected layer is designed as two branches each branch has two hidden layers for fitting results in order to enhance the nonlinearity of the system and improve the convergence speed the rectified linear unit is adopted as an activation function the displacements of gps are regarded as labels in this network root mean square error rmse as shown in equation 25 is used to calculate loss while the adagrad optimizer is adopted to train network 25 ξ 1 m i 1 m χ i χ ˆ i 2 where m is the number of samples χ the label value obtained by gps position segment χ ˆ the prediction value in our network the label is divided into two direction movements as a result the loss in each direction movement is calculated individually 4 experiments and analysis in this section the proposed end to end navigation method is evaluated based on a public dataset kitti geiger et al 2013 and our auv real experimental data the deep learning requires a mass of data and lots of iterate calculations to generate stable predict results to increase the efficiency of training a fading learning rate was introduced during experiments the losses of our framework in training and testing during 1000 iterations are depicted in fig 7 4 1 kitti dataset test kitti dataset was obtained by a moving platform driving in and around karlsruhe which includes data of camera images laser scan gps imu system the platform has four cameras two color and two grayscale cameras to collect images around the trajectory velodyne scan was employed to get 3d environment information in point clouds the oxts gps imu integrated navigation system was used to build the attitude orientation velocity acceleration angular speed etc the velocity in the vehicle coordinate system and orientation can be fed into our framework during our navigation experiments attitude orientation and velocity were used as input the oxts data includes forward leftward and upward velocity from the airborne coordinate system the raw data of yaw pitch and roll were based on the east north up coordinate before the experiment the attitude and orientation were transformed into the north east down coordinate to keep uniform with auv the oxts integrated navigation system has fused the information of gps and imu the quality of gps is affected by the environment therefore some position data of oxts system have deviated from the real path partial data with better performance were picked as the training and testing data fig 8 illustrates the positioning performance by our deep learning framework and dr as the gps can help imu to improve the measurement accuracy almost all the raw data are accurate the results show that the trajectory of hybrid rnns is close to gps and our method has effectiveness in the kitti dataset 4 2 auv real experimental data test the gps adaptive filter was introduced to process the gps path due to uncertain jumps in the original location information the labels for neural network need to be filtered before the training phase and also could be treated as the truth value to evaluate the performance of our method fig 9 shows the results of the adaptive filter the red lines are the filtered trajectories compared with the raw positions represented by black lines the jumps of gps location have been effectively filtered out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid rnns a series of auv real experimental data in menlou reservoir jiaozhou bay and tuandao bay had been carried out the details of auv real experimental data are depicted in table 1 dr ekf ukf and extreme learning machine elm were used to generate the trajectory the test results show the comparisons between the proposed algorithm and other approaches in fig 10 four groups of auv path estimation were produced by the methods above black lines represent the gps trajectories which been filtered by the adaptive filter and can be considered as ground truth for auv red lines represent dr trajectories green lines ekf trajectories blue lines ukf trajectories cyan lines elm trajectories violet lines the proposed method in most experimental results the trajectories obtained by hybrid rnns are closer to gps than other methods in fig 10 a the trajectories obtained by traditional methods are closed to the ground truth than the proposed method fig 11 reports the errors between the ground truth and the estimation position obtained by different algorithms in fig 11 a the performance of the proposed method is relatively weak but still better than elm due to the small sensor deviation and high positioning accuracy of traditional methods the proposed algorithm could not reflect its advantages in test1 fig 11 b shows the error of test2 and the transverse measurement velocity of dvl has a jump around step 180 see fig 12 in such a situation that the original data have large outliers the proposed method performs more excellent than others elm has a better path estimation than dr and ekf but worse than ukf this is because the neural network algorithms have a certain level of fault tolerance ability however the structure of elm is too simple to complete complex navigation calculations this result illustrates that the hybrid rnns has positive fault tolerance fig 11 c and d show that the proposed method performs superior to other algorithms table 2 summarizes the rmse of all algorithms above during the four experiments results of rmse evidence the hybrid rnns framework has superior effectiveness in most cases additionally the process duration of each algorithm above during the experiments are used to evaluate the algorithm efficiency as depicted in table 3 compared with ekf and ukf the proposed algorithm has a shorter running time the experimental results illustrate that the machine learning method could effectively suppress the interference caused by sensor deviation however the elm with a single hidden layer is hard to replace the complicated formulas in navigation algorithm the proposed method with multiple rnns is able to estimate accurate position and has high real time capability 5 conclusions this paper presents a novel end to end navigation algorithm based on deep neural networks which uses raw data from sensors to obtain position estimation directly since the sensor data have different sampling frequency this framework handles the raw data of dvl and ahrs by using unidirectional and bi directional lstm respectively then use the outputs of lstms and the time interval of the calculation cycle as the inputs of the fully connected layers to predict the auv displacement considering the framework gets results by end to end schema it does not need to handle various complex matrix operations and is also easy to implement the experimental results of the kitti dataset and our auv real data validate that the hybrid rnns could reduce the interference of sensor deviation and has better accuracy as well as fault tolerance for navigation also it could satisfy the real time requirement although the proposed method demonstrates superiority in most situations it remains instability occasionally we suggest the deep learning navigation method can be a supplement for traditional algorithms to enhance the positioning accuracy and fault tolerance our future work will focus on the intelligence fusion method of deep learning and navigation algorithms acknowledgement this work is partially supported by the national key research and

22308,one of the most useful method to indicate the risk of ship collision is the ship domain after decades of development different ship domain models have been constructed from various aspects nevertheless a shortcoming of the early research of ship domains is not able to describe the level of danger of any point in the area around the ship therefore a potential risk ship domain prsd model with clear meaning of risk degree is first proposed in this paper the zone around a ship has been established which is based on concept of ship domain and consists of continuously risk levels by using kernel density algorithm the influence of ship length and speed as well as navigation situation on the size and shape of ship domain by prsd model are analyzed size of ship domain and potential collision risk indexes for each risk level will be identified by comparison with previous models simulations show that the prsd model can effectively evaluate the danger of navigation and discovery

necessary to avoid a probable collision ship collision refers to the physical event that two or more ships occupy the same point or area on the sea surface at the same time therefore the evaluation of safe area around the ship is of major importance for navigation when ships approach each other they should ensure that a minimum spacing around them is clear of other vessels in order to pass each other safely and the shortest distance of the collision does not occur it led to the appearance of ship domain concept ship domain is generally defined as a safety area around either the own ship or target ship which stays or should stay clear of other ships not of other ship s domains if other ships or navigational obstacles do not exceed this area navigational situation can be considered safe in maritime traffic engineering the concept of ship domain has been suggested and developed by a number of authors the two dimensional area named effective domain was first proposed in 1971 by fujii and tanaka 1971 to deal with the safe navigation of ships in open waters off japan which is an ellipse with a long radius of 8 l and short radius of 3 2 l l is ship length under ordinary navigation condition four years later goodwin 1975 developed a sector shaped domain model to investigate the maritime traffic based on data generated by a radar simulator from collision experiments the ship domain was divided into segments of the circles port starboard and astern which have different radii of 0 7 nautical miles nm 0 85 nm and 0 45 nm respectively in southern north sea waters and 2 4 nm 2 4 nm and 0 5 nm in open ocean davis et al 1980 considered the goodwin 1975 model having much defects such as discontinuous boundaries with sudden jumps by smoothing the domain edges the domain as a circle around a phantom ship which was at the center the circle the real ship being fixed by a distance and an angle relative to ship s head from the phantom coldwell 1983 specified different dimension values of ship domain for meeting head on and crossing and overtaking encounters for example 6 1 5 cables for head on meetings with an offset 1 75 cables to port and 3 25 to starboard and 6 3 5 cables for overtaking situations fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 and coldwell 1983 all used radar observations in different areas with some differences in geometrical dimensions and distance measurement unit of ship domains a source of data from the automatic identification system ais makes it possible to overcome the shortcomings of statistical methods primarily due to a large number of observations gucma and marcjan 2012 built a probabilistic domain based on distance distribution into 8 sectors every 45 construction of domain shape was held together by linking distances plotted in the middle of each sector they also concluded that the type of ship had no effect on the shape of the domain hansen et al 2013 analyzed shape and size of the ship domain based on a large amount of ais data in the great belt and in the drogden channel the passing distance between ships was measured in length overall l o a and was determined to have minor differences with the effective domain by fujii and tanaka 1971 in the investigation that revisits and proposes a method using ais data in swedish waters horteborn et al 2019 concluded that the ship domain has the shape of an ellipse with half axis radii of 0 9 and 0 45 nm and recommended that loa should be used as a determinant of the ship domain static ship domain in open waters and a dynamic ship domain in restricted waters in the above models ship domains are static invariable of ship speed despite also being based on statistically processed empirical data wang and chin 2016 domain brings more parameters and complexity than related older models it is further formulated as a mathematical model by taking into account ship size and ship speed as well as a human factor component however the resulting free form polygonal shape is actually quite close to an ellipse domain suggested by past works szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 another shape of ship domain hexagon was developed by smierzchalski 2000 for a target ship on the basis of ship dimension and speed and relative dynamic parameters this domain was obtained which is dependent on actual value of safe distance assumed by the navigator the vertices of the irregular hexagonal shaped domain were defined as a multiple of a unit governing safe distance in the above models ship domains are assumed deterministic and the set of domain parameters has not been extended it was zhao et al 1993 who introduced the idea of a fuzzy boundary for domain based on goodwin 1975 using fuzzy sets theory it was assumed that if the relative motion line of a target is outside of the fuzzy boundary it is safe no action need be taken if the relative motion line is just inside the fuzzy boundary it is not certainly safe but not certainly dangerous either action need not be taken if the relative motion line is inside the fuzzy boundary it is dangerous action must be taken to keep it out of the fuzzy boundary unlike crisp domains a fuzzy one can vary between different levels of safety the domain model based on neural networks has been derived that can express the effect of visibility and a ship s maneuverability and react quickly to a variety of situations zhu et al 2001 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2004 followed the concept of zhao et al 1993 by developing a ship fuzzy domain defined as a fuzzy area around the ship which the navigator should keep clear of other vessels and objects the shape and size of the domain depend on the adopted level of navigational safety which can be different for different navigators the fuzzy domain has been applied in both narrow fairways pietrzykowski 2008 and open waters pietrzykowski and urias 2009 the developed fuzzy domain is claimed as a universal criterion for the assessment of a current navigational situation kijima and furukawa 2001 2003 introduced a new ship domain which is a combination of two ellipses named blocking area and watching area shapes of both areas are modeled by longitudinal radii in fore and aft domains and common transverse radius according to the authors existing ship in the watching area is regarded as target ship which should be watched out for by own ship when the watching area of the target ship invades the blocking area own ship should decide whether she will change or keep her course based on the formulas of kijima and furukawa 2003 and wang et al 2010 changed the crisp boundaries to fuzzy ones resulting in a fuzzy quaternion ship domain qsd and continued as a dynamic quaternion ship domain dqsd wang 2013 the shape is modeled by index parameters the fuzzy possibility value is related to the size of the ship domain and the shape index is related to the state of the navigator qu et al 2011 combined this model with a criterion of number of ship domains overlaps is applied in for assessment of collision risk in the singapore strait based on the ais data nevertheless it is furthermore not clear which parameter choices would be valid since different choices result in significantly different collision risk evaluations goerlandt and kujala 2014 dinh and im 2016 also used the term blocking area for the most dangerous area that is around a target ship and should not be violated by the own ship its dimensions are based mainly on calculations of the advance distance of the own ship for all encounters and additionally the advance distance of the target for head on encounters only apart from the blocking area a circular area called action area is where the ship must perform a collision avoidance maneuver in order to resolve the encounter situation safely nevertheless existing ship domains are lack of the ability to reflect continuously risk level the problem of ship domain determination is still up to date due to many factors affecting its shape and size in many experts opinion the most important domain determinants include the size and speed of the vessel and the type of sea area open or restricted wielgosz 2017 it should be mentioned that there are some successful applications of ship domains namely collision avoidance applying a ship domain is also mentioned in tsou et al 2010 applied a ship domain in where a collision avoidance method based on genetic algorithm ga and took into account colregs however again a circular domain is applied and colregs are handled separately this research is continued in tsou 2016 where collision avoidance method is combined with the use of ecdis the domain remains a circle with a radius set arbitrarily to 1 5 nm near miss detection and trajectory processing van iperen 2015 applies the concept of a ship domain while at the same time identifying an empirical domain for the north sea ship domain in zhang et al 1994 has been there supplemented by a number of other situational characteristics to obtain a greater precision of identifying near miss ship collisions waterway risk analysis various approaches collision risk analysis are compared and assessed including previous domains in goerlandt and kujala 2014 and goerlandt and montewka 2015 this paper presents an alternative model of dynamic ship domain potential risk ship domain prsd for assessing the potential collision risk for surface ships in wide range encounters the proposed model is constructed based on kernel density function consists of three boundaries that divide the neighborhood around the ship into four zones with different potential risk levels in order to express the degree of risk level around the ship and show the ability to evaluate the potential collision risk in real time and in both restricted and open sea areas the length and speed of the ship as well as the type of water area have been fully considered and the parameters are determined by comparing with previous ship domains by fitting method obviously this is a dynamic ship domain model which accounts for ship dimensions maneuverability and navigational situations the prsd model is dramatically effective method in order to estimate the potential risk of collision and to identify the dangerous area around the ship it can provide a reference for the evaluation of ship collisions and other traffic accidents and for the supervision of vts centers the main merits of this framework are propose a novel ship domain name potential risk ship domain which can calculate continuous and dynamic potential collision risk level in area around the ship propose a collision assessment zone around a ship included four zones with different levels of potential collision risk using prsd model for risk evaluation improvement of boundaries with values of pcr in prsd model can not only reveals the different levels of ship collision hazard but also overcome the deterministic problem of existing models in prsd model the continuous values in range of 0 1 are used to indicate the collision risk furthermore two ship domains can be overlapped when coming closer it helps to predict the potential collision area the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a construction of prsd model section 3 explains the applied methods for determining the values of parameters of prsd in section 4 a collision assessment zone around a ship with different levels of potential collision risk index using prsd model is introduced and in section 5 the results of the reliability criteria for the proposed methods are shown in the case study finally concluding remarks are provided in section 6 2 potential risk ship domain modeling 2 1 influence and density function any data point in the neighborhood will be affected by other points surround it the influence of each data point can be modeled formally using a mathematical function called influence function hinneburg and keim 1998 the influence function can be defined as the function which describes the impact of a data point within its neighborhood any other data point in the vicinity will be affected examples for influence functions are parabolic functions square wave function or the gaussian function in order to construct such the new ship domain firstly an function that can continuously describe the risk of every point inside the ship domain by exact value is needed this development can solve the limitation of the earlier models the continuous values in range of 0 1 are used to indicate the collision risk the core idea is that each spatial point has an influence on the space through the influence function in this paper the gaussian influence function is used to construct the ship domain because it is in line with the requirement that the closer to the ship the larger the influence is the influence function is applied to each data point an estimate of the overall density of the data space is the sum of the influence function of all data points hinneburg and keim 2003 the kernel functions are a mathematical description of the influence a data object has within its neighborhood f d is denoted for the d dimensional feature space the density function at a point x f d is defined as the sum of the influence functions of all data objects at that point the influence function of a data object y f d is a function f b y which is defined in terms of a basic influence function f b 1 f b y x f b x y the density function is defined as the sum of the influence functions of all data points given n data objects described by a set of feature vectors d x 1 x n the density function is defined as 2 f b y x i 1 n f b x i x for the definition of specific influence functions a distance function d determines the distance of two d dimensional feature vectors 3 f b y x 1 f b y x 2 if d x 1 y d x 2 y gaussian influence function is as follows 4 f g a u s s x y e d x y 2 2 σ 2 the function which results from a gaussian influence function is as follows 5 f g a u s s x y i 1 n e d x y 2 2 σ 2 fig 1 shows an example of a set of data points in 2d space together with the corresponding overall density functions for a gaussian influence function 2 2 potential risk ship domain modeling ship domain has become a basic method and widely used in research on collision avoidance and traffic engineering ship safety domain is a generalization of a safe distance and its introduction to maritime navigation comes from the observation that the safe distance is not the same in all directions szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 distance between ships has always been the most important factor contributing to the level of safety szlapczynski et al 2018 nevertheless the problem of quantitative quantification directly affects the application and development of the ship domain the cause of this limitation is that in the earlier models the level of ship collision risk inside and outside the domain is deterministic the ship collision risk is 1 within the domain and 0 when out of domain therefore the next step in the development of the ship domain depends on the identification of different levels of ship collision risk and overcome the problem of quantitative quantification in the ship domain boundary when a ship is navigating she will have effect to the surrounding area this paper assumes that any point in this area is a static phantom ship this phantom ship receives the influence from the real ship but has no impact to the neighborhood this effect is greater when near the real ship and smaller when far away each phantom ship will have different degree of influence and this influence can be called potential collision risk the area that consists of every phantom ship around the real ship is potential risk ship domain prsd one of functions of prsd model is to express the impact of the ship to neighborhood the potential risk of the vicinity of the ship is taking the characteristics of the ship and the actual situation of navigation ship domain is a kind of image description of ship collision risk it is reasonable to be changed with different ship speed and other navigation data wang et al 2014 the important factor affecting the safety of a ship at fore side is the speed to model a dynamic ship domain it is key point to form the shape of ship domain changing with ship s specific speed when the ship is sailing a circular zone is constructed at aft side otherwise a half elliptical zone at the fore side is used to extend the way to achieve the impact of the ship the reason is that the area behind the ship is not affected by the forward motion of the ship however due to the forward movement of the ship the area in front of the ship is also affected by the danger of collision of the ship in order to construct prsd firstly a function namely risk diameter is needed the traditional method for judging collision risk i e the combination of d c p a distance to the closest point of approach and t c p a time to the closest point of approach is applied in this function however in this paper c p a closest point of approach between the dynamic real ship and static phantom ship is adopted then by integrating the risk diameter into the gaussian influence function the spatial distribution of potential collision risk into the area around the ship is obtained and the prsd can be constructed suppose the position of the own ship is x y with ship length l speed v and the heading φ and point p x p y p dcpa and tcpa are the two parameters usually to determine the degree of risk of ship collision at sea for the calculation of d c p a and tcpa between own ship and point p a perpendicular from point p is drawn to the heading line of the own ship having c p a when approaching point p d c p a is the shortest distance between the own ship and point p while t c p a is the time needed to reach the closest point of approach consequently in the ship motion simulation system the ship motion parameters can be expressed in fig 2 mathematically d c p a and t c p a between the ship to point p can be calculated by using the following equations 6 d c p a d φ sin φ p x p x 2 y p y 2 sin φ p t c p a d φ cos φ p v x p x 2 y p y 2 cos φ p v the non dimensional of d c p a and t c p a can be obtained as follows 7 d c p a d φ sin φ p l x p x 2 y p y 2 sin φ p l t c p a d φ cos φ p l v x p x 2 y p y 2 cos φ p l v the relative bearing of point p is given by 8 φ p arctan x p x y p y φ this paper adopts the normalization of d c p a and t c p a to determine degree of potential collision risk the risk diameter r based on the model of kearon 1977 which is the combination of d c p a and t c p a can be found as follows 9 r λ d c p a 2 t c p a 2 the dimension size of d c p a and t c p a are different therefore λ is used as a weighting to keep these variables matching the potential collision risk p c r index at any point p x p y p can be calculated as follows 10 p c r f p o i n t p e r i 2 2 σ 2 each point has a different range of effects from the ship p c r is used as the value to reflect the potential collision risk distribution of the ship of one point in its surrounding environment it describes the degree of potential risk of collision the bigger this value is the more dangerous a small value of p c r leads to a large influence range of the ship but a larger p c r makes the influence range smaller the larger the distance between the own ship and the point p is the smaller the effect of the ship is p c r value will reach the maximum value 1 this value approaches 0 at places far away from the ship each value of p c r corresponds to a contour line that joints points of equal value of p c r although these points share same value of p c r the distances from the ship to these points are different the distance depends on an angle φ p clockwise from the ship heading named d φ from eq 10 if p c r is identified in range 0 to 1 d φ at each angle φ p can be calculated the size of ship domain by prsd model is measured by the radius d φ from the ship center to the different vertices of the ship domain as follows 11 d φ 2 ln p c r λ v 2 s i n φ p 2 c o s φ p 2 v σ l if 0 φ p 90 or 270 φ p 360 2 ln p c r λ v σ l if 90 φ p 270 where σ longitudinal influence parameter λ lateral influence parameter longitudinal and lateral influence parameters σ λ determine the longitudinal and lateral influence ranges of ship domain respectively at fore side the radius d φ is governed by a function of ship length l and speed v while at aft side it is only governed by a function of ship length l the length of d φ depends on the value of p c r as well the higher the p c r value maximum 1 is the shorter d φ is the lower the p c r value is minimum 0 the longer it is by applying prsd model the area around the ship can be digitally generated based on value of p c r as is depicted in fig 3 every point in this area has a value of p c r and points with same value of p c r will be shown as contour lines the ship heading determines the direction of the longitudinal axis of the ship domain the ship speed determines the degree of extension of the fore side the coverage of the ship domain is decided by the influence parameters next step is to specify the size of ship domain by prsd model 3 ship domain by prsd model in this step the size of ship domain by prsd model that was formulated earlier will be specified as mentioned above the size of ship domain by prsd model can be measured by eq 11 it depends on an adequate selection of the parameters it is seen that varying choices of parameters lead to important difference sizes of ship domain in order to determine the size of ship domain by prsd model three important factors namely σ λ and p c r should be identified with each set of σ λ and p c r the ship domain by prsd model will have a different size as can be seen in fig 4 with same values of σ and λ smaller value of pcr will lead to larger size than greater one prsd 1 and prsd 2 however with different values of σ and λ prsd will have different range with same value of pcr prsd 1 and prsd 3 in general the waters at sea can be divided into open sea areas and restricted areas the traffic densities in these areas are significantly different the dimension of ship domain is affected by different operating environment and ship density goodwin 1975 it has been observed that generally the ship domain size changes distinctly depending on available maneuverable area dimensions wielgosz 2017 quite clearly the ship domain in open sea and restricted areas should be treated differently in the following we describe how the size of ship domain by prsd model is obtained in both areas by determination of parameters 3 1 in restricted areas restricted areas are high density traffic areas where a ship is likely to collide with others if ship navigation is not carried out in the right manner they have dense traffic in the form of fishing boats small crafts in addition to larger merchant ships which by default means that a higher degree of precaution situational awareness and decision making is to be exercised under such circumstances since there are several ships present in the vicinity chances of a collision are very high attention is increasingly paid to the problem of using a ship domain in the process of safe ship conduct particularly in restricted areas a study on ship domain in restricted areas is promising and the problem and models of ship domain in the restricted areas have been described in many publications lately in this section the size of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas will be suggested by the identification of parameters in formulating the prsd model parameters have been expected to be different under different conditions in order to decide the size of ship domain by prsd model we adapt the approximation method the aim of the approximation is to generate three parameters of ship domain in restricted areas σ λ and p c r five models of ship domain in restricted areas are reviewed and compared i e fujii and tanaka 1971 coldwell 1983 hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2016 and kijima and furukawa 2003 then one of them will be employed as subject model for approximation process for the technique of the approximation least squares method is used this is a tool for determination of a solution that is generally very close often identical with the optimum the stop condition is set on achieving the minimum fitness function wielgosz 2017 the best fit model can be obtained by defining an optimization problem with the objective to minimize the difference between the proposed prsd model and a previous model the size of ship domain by prsd model will be differently generated by each set values of σ λ and p c r the best fitted domain is assumed to take that of minimum value of fitness function the process of the approximation is presented in fig 5 the procedure in fig 5 is to prescribe a framework for the parameters approximation in order to determine the size of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas by adopting this approach the approximation will be done sequentially searching for the best fitted parameters of the ship domain size radii at four directions of ship domain with each set value of σ λ and p c r are calculated then they will be compared with four radii of subjected domain fitness function is the sum of squared differences between four radii of ship domain and the subjected domain the approximation process will stop until the minimum value of fitness function is found out and then the parameters for the ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas can be output in order to conduct approximation process the range of parameters should be considered each parameter has special features in the prsd model it is implied that these parameters have a different range of effects to the size of ship domain longitudinal and lateral radii of prsd model are required in this step applying φ p 0 90 180 and 270 to eq 12 four radii of prsd model can be given by 12 d f 2 ln p c r v σ l d a d s d p 2 ln p c r λ σ l where d f d a d s d p radius of ship domain by prsd model in fore aft starboard and port side respectively as explained in section 2 2 p c r value varies from 0 to 1 the range of influence parameters should be decided to reduce time of approximation process the appropriate value of influence parameter is which make the size of ship domain reasonable with existing ship domains in restricted areas neither too small nor too large first the forward radius d f of the ship domain is independent of lateral influence parameter λ so to determine the range of longitudinal influence parameter σ d f was calculated with each value of σ from 0 1 interval 0 1 by eq 12 until it was realized that if the value of σ is greater than 1 the radius of ship domain by prsd model in fore side d f is significantly larger when comparison with fore radii of other ship domains in restricted area in cases σ 1 0 1 σ 2 1 and p c r 1 0 1 and p c r 2 0 9 d f was compared with the forward radii of previous ship domains in restricted areas which is presented in figs 6 7 the only requirement on σ is that it generates a reasonable fore size of ship domain as we can see the longest range of forward radii in restricted areas is around 6 times of l o a forward radii of dynamic ship domains wang and chin 2016 kijima and furukawa 2003 are small at low speeds but greater when speed increase in case σ 1 0 1 even the length of d f of ship domain by prsd model at p c r 1 0 1 is significantly smaller than those of previous ship domains it will lead to the fore zone of ship domain is too small while with σ 2 1 the length of radius in fore of previous ship domains correspond to longitudinal radius d f of ship domain by prsd model at p c r 2 0 9 at speed of 10kn and higher they are even smaller than d f 0 9 in this case the fore zone of ship domain by prsd model is overwhelmingly larger than other ship domains therefore the suitable value of σ for restricted area should be in range 0 1 to 1 for lateral influence parameter the similar comparison is conducted and the range of λ for ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas is achieved from 0 to 1 after obtaining the ranges of parameters one ship domain should be chosen for comparison ship domains of fujii and tanaka 1971 coldwell 1983 and hansen et al 2013 remain static ones only focus on the size of ship regardless of the dynamic features a threat zone which accounts for dynamic changes in speeds the size of the threat zone is dynamically adjusted throughout the navigational process tran et al 2002 among past ship domains for restricted areas only ship domains in kijima and furukawa 2003 and wang and chin 2016 are dynamic ones however size of ship domain in wang and chin 2016 is smaller than the one in kijima and furukawa 2003 when compared with each other furthermore most of the previous models either completely lack empirical support in deriving the ship domains an empirical investigation on the appropriate shape of the domain would be useful the traffic movement data in wang and chin 2016 model was obtained from the database in the water of singapore port and straits this is busy and high density waterway using empirical data shows that the size of this domain is considered as minimum safety distance for restricted area furthermore the resulting polygon is actually quite close to an ellipse a shape suggested by past works fujii and tanaka 1971 coldwell 1983 hansen et al 2013 which used empirical data in other waters japan england and denmark respectively therefore ship domain in wang and chin 2016 is selected for the subject domain of approximation now the problem is to define a fitness function to estimate the model parameters as a measure of fitness the selected fitness function is defined by summing up of squared distance differences between four domain radii of proposed model and model of wang and chin 2016 at same speed radii of ship domain in wang and chin 2016 are linear functions of ship s length and quadratic functions of its speed radial distances from the ship center to the vertex of the polygon ship domain are calculated as follow 13 r f α f l g f v r a α a l g a v r s α s l g s v r p α p l g p v where r f r a r s r p radius of wang and chin 2016 model in fore aft starboard and port side respectively α f α a α s α p the normalized radial distance of the ship domain when the ship is stationary g f v g a v g s v g p v function of ship speed at fore aft starboard and port side respectively the fitness function thus becomes 14 δ d f d f r f 2 δ d a d a r a 2 δ d s d s r s 2 δ d p d p r p 2 15 δ d v i 1 4 δ d i where δ d f δ d a δ d s δ d p squared distance difference at fore aft starboard and port side respectively δ d sum of squared distance differences the fitness function of the approximation for the size of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas involving a set of three parameters σ λ and p c r and calculated by eq 15 the parameters values can be estimated such that the sum of squared distance differences between radii the proposed model and the subjected model wang and chin 2016 is minimal it means that after finding the minimum value of fitness function m i n δ d and the corresponding parameters can be selected the ship domain with a set values of p c r 0 8 σ 0 35 λ 0 03 is best fitted with ship domain of wang and chin 2016 in restricted areas applying p c r 0 8 σ 0 35 λ 0 03 to eq 13 four radii of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas can be calculated the result in case v 12 k n and radii of ship domains in restricted areas is represented in table 1 and fig 8 the resulting past ship domain in restricted areas are reproduced in fig 8 along with the ship domain by prsd model the comparison shows that ship domain of fujii and tanaka 1971 is reasonably compatible with the proposed ship domain on the fore side but overestimating the space requirement on the aft side while underestimating the lateral sides hansen et al 2013 and wang and chin 2016 ship domains match well with the proposed ship domain on the lateral sides but is greater on the longitudinal sides it should be noted that the fujii and tanaka 1971 and hansen et al 2013 models still cannot take into account the effect of change of speed while wang and chin 2016 model does not enlarge significantly with increasing speed coldwell 1983 modeled for a head on and an overtaking encounter resulting in a half elliptical ship domain and a symmetrically full elliptical ship domain respectively their port sides are closer matches to the one of ship domain by prsd model however three other sides appear overestimated kijima and furukawa 2003 overestimated the size of ship domain along the longitudinal and lateral sides it would be appropriate for risk assessment described in section 4 3 2 in open sea areas unlike restricted areas open sea areas have lesser traffic and ample sea room as expected the ship domain for the open ocean is greater than that in restricted waters due to more degrees of freedom similarly the ship domain in high density water is smaller than that in a water with less traffic it means that larger size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas is required then another set value of parameters needs to be identified to determine the size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas the similar procedure described in section 3 1 is adopted for the parameters estimation however one issue should be mentioned that our objective is to propose a danger criterion for collision assessment for the area around the ship which divided into four zones by three boundaries in section 4 based on the value of p c r that can be used in both restricted and open sea areas therefore after p c r 0 8 was determined for restricted area this value was also directly applied for open sea area as the value for minimum area in both areas only σ λ are estimated and p c r 0 8 is set in advance for the process of approximation to find out an appropriate for size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas a dynamic model that proposes a general boundary of ship domain in these areas is required furthermore ship length also should be considered in this model for this purpose the ship domain in pietrzykowski and urias 2009 is subject to an approximation pietrzykowski and urias 2009 extended and generalized the fuzzy boundary of ship domain an area surrounding the ship that the navigator should keep clear of other vessels and objects whose shape and size dynamically change with various navigational situations as mentioned before the objective is to minimize the difference between the effective clear areas described by the proposed model and the subjected model the difference between them can be treated as an error function given by eq 16 the sum of the squared distance differences between the domain boundaries d φ after applying p c r 0 8 and the minimum ship domain for open sea area of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 for each bearing is chosen as fitness function given by eq 17 16 δ d i d φ p φ 2 17 δ d δ d i where d φ length of radius of ship domain by prsd model at bearing φ p φ length of radius of minimum ship domain of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 at bearing φ δ d i squared distance difference in the i bearing δ d sum of squared distance differences for all analyzed bearings the radius d φ of ship domain by prsd model is then compared with the known radius of minimum ship domain of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 at same bearing φ this provides a measure of the error between them the fitness function of the optimization problem for ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas involving a set of two parameters σ λ the parameter values can be estimated such that sum of the squared distance differences is minimal m i n δ d detailed results obtained in open sea area after approximation process are σ 1 25 and λ 0 02 in order to valid the generated size of ship domain by prsd model the case of ship with l o a 200 m at the speed of 15 knots is examined after applying p c r 0 8 σ 1 25 λ 0 02 to eq 12 the size comparison with existing ship domains in open sea areas is represented in table 2 and fig 9 goodwin 1975 has three unequal sectors with different radii which are invariant with ship speed and length there are clearly distinctive differences between the proposed ship domain and model of goodwin 1975 goodwin 1975 oversimplifies the space domain with large discontinuities at the sector boundaries in addition it overestimates the space requirements particularly on the port and starboard sides compared to smierzchalski 2000 the ship domain by prsd model also compatible there is very good match for minimum ship domain of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 particularly in the fore side and aft side this means that our ship domain by prsd model for open waters is compatible with pietrzykowski and urias 2009 model when the safety level is high it is well suggested that the ship domain by prsd model is suitable in open sea areas 3 3 summary in this step the size of ship domain by prsd model that is identified first the parameters for ship domain in restricted areas were determined to do that it necessary to conduct a comprehensive comparison related to the shape of previous ship domains due to the number of parameters in the ship domain model the least squares method is chosen as the approximation technique the best fit model can be obtained by defining a fitness function with the objective to minimize the difference between the boundaries of proposed domain and the selected domain wang and chin 2016 the fitness function for determining the size of ship domain by prsd model is formulated as the sum of the squared distance differences between radii of two domains there is a minimum value for this fitness function and the most suitable parameters are obtained the same procedure is also carried out in order to obtain the size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas the minimum ship domain in open sea areas of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 is selected as a subject domain for approximation the results of the size of prsd model seem reasonable in accordance with existing ship domain models parameters for prsd model in two areas are shown in table 3 size of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas is determined as follows 18 d φ 2 ln 0 8 0 03 v 2 s i n φ p 2 c o s φ p 2 v 0 35 l if 0 φ p 90 or 270 φ p 360 2 ln 0 8 0 03 v 0 35 l if 90 φ p 270 size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas is determined as follows 19 d φ 2 ln 0 8 0 02 v 2 s i n φ p 2 c o s φ p 2 v 1 25 l if 0 φ p 90 or 270 φ p 360 2 ln 0 8 0 02 v 1 25 l if 90 φ p 270 4 collision assessment zone using potential collision risk the area around a ship is simply divided into two zones in most of existing ship domains inside the ship domain dangerous area and outside the ship domain safe area however this kind of ship domain with a clear boundary is limited in applications when two ships in sight of each other are approaching with no change of compass bearing so that when there is risk of collision one of them there may be four stages relating to the permitted or required action for each ship cockcroft and lameijer 2003 at long range before risk of collision exists both ships are free to take any action when risk of collision first begins to apply the give way ship is required to take early and substantial action to achieve a safe passing distance and the other ship must keep her course and speed when it becomes apparent that the give way ship is not taking appropriate action in compliance with the rules the stand on ship is permitted to take action to avoid collision by her maneuver alone when collision cannot be avoided by the give way ship alone the stand on vessel is required to take such action as will best aid to avoid collision the distances at which the various stages begin to apply will vary considerably they will be much greater for high speed ships in past the determination of the two boundaries or limits for action close quarters range and critical distance were considered together hilgert 1983 ship domains with two areas such as blocking area and watching area action area were developed by kijima and furukawa 2003 and dinh and im 2016 if the neighborhood of a ship can be split into many zones it would be more convenient for navigators to distinguish the danger from wide range the navigator needs criteria like those in navigation such criteria are necessary for the navigator to make decisions in collision avoidance by using the value of p c r the concept of prsd model with three boundaries that divide the area around a ship named collision assessment zone into four zones with different potential risk levels are represented in fig 10 these four zones are safe zone sz cautious zone cz dangerous zone dz and very dangerous zone vdz and the required actions in each zone are given in table 4 as mentioned in section 3 3 the upper boundary for very dangerous zone of prsd model is corresponding with value of p c r 0 8 if the p c r of any target ship is more than 0 8 within this boundary and more than 0 8 outside this boundary it should be ensured that the target ship does not cross this boundary or keeps a distance from it the next step is to estimate dangerous and cautious boundaries based on value of p c r for estimation the least squares method is applied again in this case only p c r needs to be estimated a ship domain with series of boundary is required for approximation among existing ship domains the ones of kijima and furukawa 2003 dinh and im 2016 and hilgert 1983 consist of more than two zones however only the model of kijima and furukawa 2003 takes account into ship length and ship speed similar with prsd model kijima and furukawa 2003 decided to utilize safety blocking area and blocking area with space of arimura et al 1994 to evaluate collision risk with other ships hereafter those domains are simply called as blocking area and watching area respectively they also declared the general action for ship in these two areas according to kijima and furukawa 2003 existing ship in the watching area is regarded as target ship which should be watched out for by own ship when the watching area of the target ship invades the blocking area own ship should decide whether she will change or keep her course these areas are based on traffic regulation and expressed as a relation of elements such as tactical performance speed and ship length their validity was examined by numerical simulations therefore kijima and furukawa 2003 model with blocking area and watching area is subject domain for approximation of dangerous boundary and cautious boundary of prsd model respectively since the model of kijima and furukawa 2003 is for restricted areas the set value of influence parameters for this area σ 0 35 λ 0 03 is adopted then two fitness functions are defined radii of the blocking area of kijima and furukawa 2003 are given by 20 r b f 1 1 34 k a d 2 0 25 k d t 2 l r b a 1 0 67 k a d 2 0 25 k d t 2 l r b s 0 2 k d t l r b p 0 2 0 75 k d t l radii of the watching area of kijima and furukawa 2003 are given by 21 r w f 2 r b f 1 r w a 2 r b a 1 r w s 2 r b s 1 r w p 2 r b p 1 where r b f r b a r b s r b p radius of blocking area of kijima and furukawa 2003 in fore aft starboard and port side respectively r w f r w a r w s r w p radius of watching area of kijima and furukawa 2003 in fore aft starboard and port side respectively l is the own ship length k a d and k d t represent gains of the advance a d and the tactical diameter d t respectively 22 r w f 2 r b f 1 r w a 2 r b a 1 r w s 2 r b s 1 r w p 2 r b p 1 the fitness function to determine p c r value for dangerous boundary is given by 23 δ b f d f r b f 2 δ b a d a r b a 2 δ b s d s r b s 2 δ b p d p r b p 2 24 δ b v i 1 4 δ b i where δ b f δ b a δ b s δ b p squared distance difference at fore aft starboard and port side respectively δ b sum of squared distance differences with the blocking area of kijima and furukawa 2003 the fitness function to determine p c r value for cautious boundary is given by 25 δ w f d f r w f 2 δ w a d a r w a 2 δ w s d s r w s 2 δ w p d p r w p 2 26 δ w v i 1 4 δ w i where δ w f δ w a δ w s δ w p squared distance difference at fore aft starboard and port side respectively δ w sum of squared distance differences with the watching area of kijima and furukawa 2003 the estimations for dangerous boundary and cautious boundary are conducted separately the former is estimated by comparison with blocking area while the latter is estimated by comparison with the watching area of kijima and furukawa 2003 at this time only p c r is involved in the fitness functions of the approximation the fitness functions are defined by summing up the squared distance difference between four radii of prsd model and kijima and furukawa 2003 model δ b to estimate pcr value for dangerous boundary by eq 24 δ w to estimate pcr value for cautious boundary by eq 26 the aim is to find out corresponding values of p c r with minimum δ b and δ w implementing the same method as for restricted areas the boundaries of dangerous zone and cautious zone of prsd model according to values of p c r are figured out the results of p c r value for boundaries are shown in table 5 to verify the size of these boundaries the same comparison with past ship domains in restricted areas as in section 3 1 is carried out and presented fig 11 it is clearly seen that the cautious boundary of prsd model is almost the same as boundary of kijima and furukawa 2003 watching area the comparison shows that this boundary could be used as boundary for ship or obstacle moving into cautious zone should be watched out for by own ship in head on situation ship domain in coldwell 1983 on the starboard side is assumed larger than that on the port side base on the general preference of navigators to pass on the port side instead of the starboard side it is close to dangerous boundary of prsd model in fore and starboard side the dangerous boundary of prsd is also quite similar with the blocking area in kijima and furukawa 2003 only slightly smaller on aft and starboard sides when other ship or obstacle moving across the dangerous boundary own ship should decide whether to act for collision avoidance in order to see if these boundaries of prsd model are suitable in open sea areas we can compare it after applying p c r 0 01 and p c r 0 4 with other ship domains as can be shown in fig 12 the cautious boundary significantly greater than other ship domains in open sea areas in open sea areas ships usually navigate at high speed so they should be given sufficient sea room for watching others there are again good matches between the dangerous boundary of prsd model and pietrzykowski and urias 2009 maximum ship domain in pietrzykowski and urias 2009 and ship domain of goodwin 1975 particularly on the fore and aft side although these two ship domains show a larger increase on the port and starboard sides it may be concluded that the cautious and dangerous boundaries in both restricted areas and open sea areas are reasonable when correspondingly applying p c r 0 01 and p c r 0 4 based on these values collision assessment zone around a ship is divided into four zones by three boundaries can be defined in table 6 the summary of the proposed prsd model s contribution when compared with past ship domains is given in table 7 similar with previous ship domains the prsd model also proposes an area where other ships need to avoid entering the size of ship domain by prsd model is dynamically changed due to the changing in speed during navigation it depends on the value of parameters as well leading to the ability to apply in both restricted areas and open sea areas just by adopting different set of value of parameters another new function of prsd model is to calculate continuous and dynamic potential collision risk level of any point in area around the ship it has been solved the quantitative quantification problem of existing deterministic domain the developed series of boundaries that divided collision assessment zone into four zones combination with criterion for risk evaluation seems to be powerful in determining the navigational level of collision risk the feature makes the model applicable in assessing the risk of collisions furthermore when two ships are approaching each other their domains can be overlapped and the visualization can help to predict the potential collision area that will be represented in section 5 5 application of the proposed prsd in this section the encounter situations of real accidents are carried out based on ais data to demonstrate the validity and superiority of the presented prsd model the results are illustrated in multiple figures representing snapshots of situations a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system presents the distance in nautical miles nm the vertical axis in the positive direction shows north 0 and the horizontal axis in the positive direction is 90 5 1 scenario 1 teaan accident a simulation of collision in west coastal waters of south korea is carried out the collision happened at 7 10a m 19th january 2012 the position of collision was at 36 99 n 126 10 e and has been plotted as red mark in fig 13 the parameters for open sea areas are used in these simulations σ 1 25 and λ 0 02 fig 13 also displays the two ships labeled as ship a and ship b both the vessels are moving with different speeds and courses ship a is believed to be moving in the east northeast direction while the ship b is moving towards the south west direction a detail of distance between two ships ships positions and motion parameters of each ship during navigation is given in table 8 an important issue should be mentioned here when two ships are moving closer to each other their respective ship domains will have an overlap the overlapping area which can be understood as the potential collision area is the collision position if the two ships do not take measures to avoid collision this area will vary at different moments from cautious boundary to very dangerous boundary to a certain extent the changes of the overlapping area also demonstrate the degree of the collision probability in a moment of encounter situation the more inside that the overlapping boundaries are the bigger that the risk of collision is between the two ships and the greater the collision probability collision assessment zones of two ships during navigation using prsd model is illustrated in fig 14 two ships would collide if none of them change their courses theoretically making decision in crossing encounter situations should be easy only one of the ships is supposed to maneuver and the direction of a turn is specified by colregs since ship a is on starboard it is ship b that should maneuver if possible to starboard as fig 14b informed us at time step 240 two ships cautious boundaries were overlapped and distance between them was around 6 nm this overlapping area would be likely the collision area the p c r value of any point in this area seen from both ships would be greater than 0 01 since then two ships only maintained their courses and started to reduce their speeds to avoid this area at time step 540 p c r of ship b seen from ship a was 0 01 it means that ship b was in the cautious boundary of ship a ship a should start to watch if ship b has any action distance between two ships at this moment was 3 8 nm however ship b did not alter her course and two ships were still approaching each other arguably both ships courses were continuously consistent with small fluctuations dangerous and very dangerous boundaries were overlapped at time step 660 fig 14c and 840 as fig 14d respectively it means that the potential collision area was becoming closer to two ships and the collision probability was also greater from time step 660 to 840 ship b tried to turn to starboard however due to the bad weather conditions on the route the ability to maneuver of ship b became restricted and it was difficult to maneuver the ship as desired the high winds and waves made the heading of ship b fluctuated at time step 840 and in the range of 1 8 nm it would be still enough time for both ships to avoid collisions however collision finally occurred due to no effective actions taken from two ships as fig 14e size of a single ship domain is changing due to the change in speeds represented by fore radii of three boundaries in fig 15 due to the different between length and speed ship a had a larger domain than ship b from start to time step 180 both sizes of two ship domains were almost keeping the same because the speeds were not changed at time step 180 two ships started to reduce their own speeds but did not change their own courses at same moment the cautious boundaries started to be overlapped when two ships were approaching each other the distance became closer dangerous boundaries were overlapped it would be safe to combine of changing courses and speeds by two ships ship a collided with ship b had none of them change their courses despite decreasing speed when two ships were navigating at their full speeds the size of cautious boundaries of ship a and b are around 4 2 nm and 2 4 nm respectively during the period 0 540 s the distance between two ships are greater than the cautious boundaries of both ships minimum 3 8 nm at time step 540 this distance can be considered as safe distance in open sea area after that the distance continued to reduce from time step 540 to 840 it was smaller than the cautious boundary of ship a but still larger than the one of ship b it means that ship b entered the cautious zone of ship a sooner it can be explained that ship a is bigger and sailing at higher speed so her domain should be larger than ship b s at time step 960 when the distance was 1 18 nm same as dangerous boundary of ship a it showed that ship b was going inside the dangerous zone of ship a this distance is kindly close and danger in this situation when two ships were coming closer 0 49 nm at time step 1140 it was also the boundary of very dangerous zone of ship a after this boundary was trespassed collision happened fig 16 shows the p c r value of two ships during approaching each other ship b entered cautious zone dangerous zone and very dangerous zone of ship a earlier it means that p c r of ship b reached 0 01 0 4 and 0 8 sooner than ship a did the reason is that ship a is longer and was navigating with higher speed so the collision assessment zone around ship a was larger than the one of ship b therefore ship b crossed each boundary of ship a sooner when ship b was seen crossing into cautious zone from ship a time step 540 it should be watched if p c r was increasing ship b continued to keep direction and surpassed into dangerous zone p c r reached 0 4 from time step 540 to 960 navigators should have action to avoid collision however both ships had no action and very dangerous zones of two ships were invaded p c r s of two ships reached almost 1 when collision 5 2 scenario 2 jindo accident another accident in south coastal waters of south korea is carried out to verify the usefulness of prsd model in restricted areas the collision happened at 8 10a m 10th august 2013 the position of collision was at 34 35 n 126 09 e and has been plotted as red mark in fig 17 the parameters for restricted areas were used in these simulations σ 0 35 and λ 0 03 due to the high density traffic trajectories of two ships in this accident is displayed in fig 17 ship a is moving in the east southeast direction while the ship b is moving in the east northeast direction table 9 shows distance between two ships positions and motion parameters at every time step fig 18 displays collision assessment zones of two ships during navigation it would be safe if ship a altered to starboard according to colregs when the range was around 0 75 nm lateral radii of ship a and ship b were around 0 28 nm and 0 24 nm respectively the cautious boundaries were overlapped from the side where the potential collision area is likely however ship a chose to keep her course when two ships were too close 0 34 nm at time step 240 and dangerous boundaries were overlapped the distance from two ships to potential collision area were around 0 18 nm they decided to change courses but the appearance of a landmass probably made it hard to find a collision avoidance maneuver to starboard and the navigator may be tempted to turn to port again leading to overlap of very dangerous boundaries one thing should be added here is that water of collision is a high traffic area with a lot of small fishing boats around after ship b turned to starboard there were a couple of fishing boats in front sailing towards ship b therefore ship b had to turn back to port side again to avoid a landmark and other boats both ships remained their own courses and speeds until collision different with accident 1 when two ship were coming closer to each other they both attempted to change their own course but keep own speeds therefore the size of ship domains was changed slightly during navigation as fig 19 two ships were navigating in high density and busy water the distance between two ships was reducing smaller than cautious boundaries around 0 6 nm according to the situation of area and the size of both ships this distance could be enough for minimum passing distance however when the distance was smaller than dangerous boundaries around 0 26 nm it was dangerous for both ships at time step 660 when the distance was smaller than very dangerous boundaries around 0 12 nm both ships were in critical situation as we can see from fig 20 both ships entered cautious zones of each other p c r values of two ships reached around 0 01 at time step 240 and the distance was 0 34 nm since two ships were approaching from side the required action at this moment was changing direction however when ship b came inside the dangerous zone of ship a at time step 420 ship b had action to avoid collision by changing to starboard then they came back to cautious zones p c r s decreases to less than 0 4 however the fact that ship b also tried to steer away from landmarks it maneuvered to port again and did not reduce speed then dangerous zones were invade again following by very dangerous zone p c r s continued to increase again over 0 4 and 0 8 respectively until collision happened 5 3 discussion collision candidate is encountered ships which are in a situation that they would collide with each other if no evasive maneuver was performed it indicates ships with geometrical possibility of collision chen et al 2017 according to the definition the ship collision avoidance is defined as prediction and avoidance prediction is to forecast the target ship when and where will stay the same point or have collision risk with own ship on the sea avoidance is that the action been taken by both ships so that the two ship are not simultaneously occupy the same point or avoid encountering the situation of risk of collision liu and xiao 2014 through the above simulations some following conclusions can be proved 1 dynamic extended zones around a ship can be obtained by prsd model delineate the area required for safe collision escape maneuvers 2 overlapping area of ship domains can predict the potential collision area showing at which sub zone in collision assessment zone of ship this area is and the target ship with dynamic pcr value will help the own ship quickly evaluate the situation and have plan for collision evasive maneuvers in the future we will conduct a more comprehensive analysis to making prsd model suitable for a variety of complex environments with multiple ships 6 conclusion this paper proposes a novel ship domain named potential risk ship domain prsd for real time potential collision risk assessment first kernel density function is applied to construct ship domain according to d c p a and t c p a offering a picture of risk zone around a ship ship length speed as well as navigation situation on the size of ship domain by prsd model are considered then the size of prsd model in restricted and open sea areas are obtained by parameters determination based on the comparison with existing ship domains through approximation method finally a collision assessment zone around the ship can be divided into four zones by three boundaries with different levels of risk such zones can recommend action for maneuver and make the navigator s work easier to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed prsd model two real accidents within the coast of south korea are simulated by ais data by using the criterion in accordance with the rules collisions may be avoided with a high probability the results show that prsd model is effective and efficient to detect and evaluate risk of collision in real time has a good adaptability to any water type and can be applied for risk assessment of ship collision accidents as a decision support tool for maritime safety administration to improve navigation safety prsd model can also be used as reference for the evaluation and supervision of vts centers in vessel traffic management 
22308,one of the most useful method to indicate the risk of ship collision is the ship domain after decades of development different ship domain models have been constructed from various aspects nevertheless a shortcoming of the early research of ship domains is not able to describe the level of danger of any point in the area around the ship therefore a potential risk ship domain prsd model with clear meaning of risk degree is first proposed in this paper the zone around a ship has been established which is based on concept of ship domain and consists of continuously risk levels by using kernel density algorithm the influence of ship length and speed as well as navigation situation on the size and shape of ship domain by prsd model are analyzed size of ship domain and potential collision risk indexes for each risk level will be identified by comparison with previous models simulations show that the prsd model can effectively evaluate the danger of navigation and discovery

necessary to avoid a probable collision ship collision refers to the physical event that two or more ships occupy the same point or area on the sea surface at the same time therefore the evaluation of safe area around the ship is of major importance for navigation when ships approach each other they should ensure that a minimum spacing around them is clear of other vessels in order to pass each other safely and the shortest distance of the collision does not occur it led to the appearance of ship domain concept ship domain is generally defined as a safety area around either the own ship or target ship which stays or should stay clear of other ships not of other ship s domains if other ships or navigational obstacles do not exceed this area navigational situation can be considered safe in maritime traffic engineering the concept of ship domain has been suggested and developed by a number of authors the two dimensional area named effective domain was first proposed in 1971 by fujii and tanaka 1971 to deal with the safe navigation of ships in open waters off japan which is an ellipse with a long radius of 8 l and short radius of 3 2 l l is ship length under ordinary navigation condition four years later goodwin 1975 developed a sector shaped domain model to investigate the maritime traffic based on data generated by a radar simulator from collision experiments the ship domain was divided into segments of the circles port starboard and astern which have different radii of 0 7 nautical miles nm 0 85 nm and 0 45 nm respectively in southern north sea waters and 2 4 nm 2 4 nm and 0 5 nm in open ocean davis et al 1980 considered the goodwin 1975 model having much defects such as discontinuous boundaries with sudden jumps by smoothing the domain edges the domain as a circle around a phantom ship which was at the center the circle the real ship being fixed by a distance and an angle relative to ship s head from the phantom coldwell 1983 specified different dimension values of ship domain for meeting head on and crossing and overtaking encounters for example 6 1 5 cables for head on meetings with an offset 1 75 cables to port and 3 25 to starboard and 6 3 5 cables for overtaking situations fujii and tanaka 1971 goodwin 1975 and coldwell 1983 all used radar observations in different areas with some differences in geometrical dimensions and distance measurement unit of ship domains a source of data from the automatic identification system ais makes it possible to overcome the shortcomings of statistical methods primarily due to a large number of observations gucma and marcjan 2012 built a probabilistic domain based on distance distribution into 8 sectors every 45 construction of domain shape was held together by linking distances plotted in the middle of each sector they also concluded that the type of ship had no effect on the shape of the domain hansen et al 2013 analyzed shape and size of the ship domain based on a large amount of ais data in the great belt and in the drogden channel the passing distance between ships was measured in length overall l o a and was determined to have minor differences with the effective domain by fujii and tanaka 1971 in the investigation that revisits and proposes a method using ais data in swedish waters horteborn et al 2019 concluded that the ship domain has the shape of an ellipse with half axis radii of 0 9 and 0 45 nm and recommended that loa should be used as a determinant of the ship domain static ship domain in open waters and a dynamic ship domain in restricted waters in the above models ship domains are static invariable of ship speed despite also being based on statistically processed empirical data wang and chin 2016 domain brings more parameters and complexity than related older models it is further formulated as a mathematical model by taking into account ship size and ship speed as well as a human factor component however the resulting free form polygonal shape is actually quite close to an ellipse domain suggested by past works szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 another shape of ship domain hexagon was developed by smierzchalski 2000 for a target ship on the basis of ship dimension and speed and relative dynamic parameters this domain was obtained which is dependent on actual value of safe distance assumed by the navigator the vertices of the irregular hexagonal shaped domain were defined as a multiple of a unit governing safe distance in the above models ship domains are assumed deterministic and the set of domain parameters has not been extended it was zhao et al 1993 who introduced the idea of a fuzzy boundary for domain based on goodwin 1975 using fuzzy sets theory it was assumed that if the relative motion line of a target is outside of the fuzzy boundary it is safe no action need be taken if the relative motion line is just inside the fuzzy boundary it is not certainly safe but not certainly dangerous either action need not be taken if the relative motion line is inside the fuzzy boundary it is dangerous action must be taken to keep it out of the fuzzy boundary unlike crisp domains a fuzzy one can vary between different levels of safety the domain model based on neural networks has been derived that can express the effect of visibility and a ship s maneuverability and react quickly to a variety of situations zhu et al 2001 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2004 followed the concept of zhao et al 1993 by developing a ship fuzzy domain defined as a fuzzy area around the ship which the navigator should keep clear of other vessels and objects the shape and size of the domain depend on the adopted level of navigational safety which can be different for different navigators the fuzzy domain has been applied in both narrow fairways pietrzykowski 2008 and open waters pietrzykowski and urias 2009 the developed fuzzy domain is claimed as a universal criterion for the assessment of a current navigational situation kijima and furukawa 2001 2003 introduced a new ship domain which is a combination of two ellipses named blocking area and watching area shapes of both areas are modeled by longitudinal radii in fore and aft domains and common transverse radius according to the authors existing ship in the watching area is regarded as target ship which should be watched out for by own ship when the watching area of the target ship invades the blocking area own ship should decide whether she will change or keep her course based on the formulas of kijima and furukawa 2003 and wang et al 2010 changed the crisp boundaries to fuzzy ones resulting in a fuzzy quaternion ship domain qsd and continued as a dynamic quaternion ship domain dqsd wang 2013 the shape is modeled by index parameters the fuzzy possibility value is related to the size of the ship domain and the shape index is related to the state of the navigator qu et al 2011 combined this model with a criterion of number of ship domains overlaps is applied in for assessment of collision risk in the singapore strait based on the ais data nevertheless it is furthermore not clear which parameter choices would be valid since different choices result in significantly different collision risk evaluations goerlandt and kujala 2014 dinh and im 2016 also used the term blocking area for the most dangerous area that is around a target ship and should not be violated by the own ship its dimensions are based mainly on calculations of the advance distance of the own ship for all encounters and additionally the advance distance of the target for head on encounters only apart from the blocking area a circular area called action area is where the ship must perform a collision avoidance maneuver in order to resolve the encounter situation safely nevertheless existing ship domains are lack of the ability to reflect continuously risk level the problem of ship domain determination is still up to date due to many factors affecting its shape and size in many experts opinion the most important domain determinants include the size and speed of the vessel and the type of sea area open or restricted wielgosz 2017 it should be mentioned that there are some successful applications of ship domains namely collision avoidance applying a ship domain is also mentioned in tsou et al 2010 applied a ship domain in where a collision avoidance method based on genetic algorithm ga and took into account colregs however again a circular domain is applied and colregs are handled separately this research is continued in tsou 2016 where collision avoidance method is combined with the use of ecdis the domain remains a circle with a radius set arbitrarily to 1 5 nm near miss detection and trajectory processing van iperen 2015 applies the concept of a ship domain while at the same time identifying an empirical domain for the north sea ship domain in zhang et al 1994 has been there supplemented by a number of other situational characteristics to obtain a greater precision of identifying near miss ship collisions waterway risk analysis various approaches collision risk analysis are compared and assessed including previous domains in goerlandt and kujala 2014 and goerlandt and montewka 2015 this paper presents an alternative model of dynamic ship domain potential risk ship domain prsd for assessing the potential collision risk for surface ships in wide range encounters the proposed model is constructed based on kernel density function consists of three boundaries that divide the neighborhood around the ship into four zones with different potential risk levels in order to express the degree of risk level around the ship and show the ability to evaluate the potential collision risk in real time and in both restricted and open sea areas the length and speed of the ship as well as the type of water area have been fully considered and the parameters are determined by comparing with previous ship domains by fitting method obviously this is a dynamic ship domain model which accounts for ship dimensions maneuverability and navigational situations the prsd model is dramatically effective method in order to estimate the potential risk of collision and to identify the dangerous area around the ship it can provide a reference for the evaluation of ship collisions and other traffic accidents and for the supervision of vts centers the main merits of this framework are propose a novel ship domain name potential risk ship domain which can calculate continuous and dynamic potential collision risk level in area around the ship propose a collision assessment zone around a ship included four zones with different levels of potential collision risk using prsd model for risk evaluation improvement of boundaries with values of pcr in prsd model can not only reveals the different levels of ship collision hazard but also overcome the deterministic problem of existing models in prsd model the continuous values in range of 0 1 are used to indicate the collision risk furthermore two ship domains can be overlapped when coming closer it helps to predict the potential collision area the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a construction of prsd model section 3 explains the applied methods for determining the values of parameters of prsd in section 4 a collision assessment zone around a ship with different levels of potential collision risk index using prsd model is introduced and in section 5 the results of the reliability criteria for the proposed methods are shown in the case study finally concluding remarks are provided in section 6 2 potential risk ship domain modeling 2 1 influence and density function any data point in the neighborhood will be affected by other points surround it the influence of each data point can be modeled formally using a mathematical function called influence function hinneburg and keim 1998 the influence function can be defined as the function which describes the impact of a data point within its neighborhood any other data point in the vicinity will be affected examples for influence functions are parabolic functions square wave function or the gaussian function in order to construct such the new ship domain firstly an function that can continuously describe the risk of every point inside the ship domain by exact value is needed this development can solve the limitation of the earlier models the continuous values in range of 0 1 are used to indicate the collision risk the core idea is that each spatial point has an influence on the space through the influence function in this paper the gaussian influence function is used to construct the ship domain because it is in line with the requirement that the closer to the ship the larger the influence is the influence function is applied to each data point an estimate of the overall density of the data space is the sum of the influence function of all data points hinneburg and keim 2003 the kernel functions are a mathematical description of the influence a data object has within its neighborhood f d is denoted for the d dimensional feature space the density function at a point x f d is defined as the sum of the influence functions of all data objects at that point the influence function of a data object y f d is a function f b y which is defined in terms of a basic influence function f b 1 f b y x f b x y the density function is defined as the sum of the influence functions of all data points given n data objects described by a set of feature vectors d x 1 x n the density function is defined as 2 f b y x i 1 n f b x i x for the definition of specific influence functions a distance function d determines the distance of two d dimensional feature vectors 3 f b y x 1 f b y x 2 if d x 1 y d x 2 y gaussian influence function is as follows 4 f g a u s s x y e d x y 2 2 σ 2 the function which results from a gaussian influence function is as follows 5 f g a u s s x y i 1 n e d x y 2 2 σ 2 fig 1 shows an example of a set of data points in 2d space together with the corresponding overall density functions for a gaussian influence function 2 2 potential risk ship domain modeling ship domain has become a basic method and widely used in research on collision avoidance and traffic engineering ship safety domain is a generalization of a safe distance and its introduction to maritime navigation comes from the observation that the safe distance is not the same in all directions szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 distance between ships has always been the most important factor contributing to the level of safety szlapczynski et al 2018 nevertheless the problem of quantitative quantification directly affects the application and development of the ship domain the cause of this limitation is that in the earlier models the level of ship collision risk inside and outside the domain is deterministic the ship collision risk is 1 within the domain and 0 when out of domain therefore the next step in the development of the ship domain depends on the identification of different levels of ship collision risk and overcome the problem of quantitative quantification in the ship domain boundary when a ship is navigating she will have effect to the surrounding area this paper assumes that any point in this area is a static phantom ship this phantom ship receives the influence from the real ship but has no impact to the neighborhood this effect is greater when near the real ship and smaller when far away each phantom ship will have different degree of influence and this influence can be called potential collision risk the area that consists of every phantom ship around the real ship is potential risk ship domain prsd one of functions of prsd model is to express the impact of the ship to neighborhood the potential risk of the vicinity of the ship is taking the characteristics of the ship and the actual situation of navigation ship domain is a kind of image description of ship collision risk it is reasonable to be changed with different ship speed and other navigation data wang et al 2014 the important factor affecting the safety of a ship at fore side is the speed to model a dynamic ship domain it is key point to form the shape of ship domain changing with ship s specific speed when the ship is sailing a circular zone is constructed at aft side otherwise a half elliptical zone at the fore side is used to extend the way to achieve the impact of the ship the reason is that the area behind the ship is not affected by the forward motion of the ship however due to the forward movement of the ship the area in front of the ship is also affected by the danger of collision of the ship in order to construct prsd firstly a function namely risk diameter is needed the traditional method for judging collision risk i e the combination of d c p a distance to the closest point of approach and t c p a time to the closest point of approach is applied in this function however in this paper c p a closest point of approach between the dynamic real ship and static phantom ship is adopted then by integrating the risk diameter into the gaussian influence function the spatial distribution of potential collision risk into the area around the ship is obtained and the prsd can be constructed suppose the position of the own ship is x y with ship length l speed v and the heading φ and point p x p y p dcpa and tcpa are the two parameters usually to determine the degree of risk of ship collision at sea for the calculation of d c p a and tcpa between own ship and point p a perpendicular from point p is drawn to the heading line of the own ship having c p a when approaching point p d c p a is the shortest distance between the own ship and point p while t c p a is the time needed to reach the closest point of approach consequently in the ship motion simulation system the ship motion parameters can be expressed in fig 2 mathematically d c p a and t c p a between the ship to point p can be calculated by using the following equations 6 d c p a d φ sin φ p x p x 2 y p y 2 sin φ p t c p a d φ cos φ p v x p x 2 y p y 2 cos φ p v the non dimensional of d c p a and t c p a can be obtained as follows 7 d c p a d φ sin φ p l x p x 2 y p y 2 sin φ p l t c p a d φ cos φ p l v x p x 2 y p y 2 cos φ p l v the relative bearing of point p is given by 8 φ p arctan x p x y p y φ this paper adopts the normalization of d c p a and t c p a to determine degree of potential collision risk the risk diameter r based on the model of kearon 1977 which is the combination of d c p a and t c p a can be found as follows 9 r λ d c p a 2 t c p a 2 the dimension size of d c p a and t c p a are different therefore λ is used as a weighting to keep these variables matching the potential collision risk p c r index at any point p x p y p can be calculated as follows 10 p c r f p o i n t p e r i 2 2 σ 2 each point has a different range of effects from the ship p c r is used as the value to reflect the potential collision risk distribution of the ship of one point in its surrounding environment it describes the degree of potential risk of collision the bigger this value is the more dangerous a small value of p c r leads to a large influence range of the ship but a larger p c r makes the influence range smaller the larger the distance between the own ship and the point p is the smaller the effect of the ship is p c r value will reach the maximum value 1 this value approaches 0 at places far away from the ship each value of p c r corresponds to a contour line that joints points of equal value of p c r although these points share same value of p c r the distances from the ship to these points are different the distance depends on an angle φ p clockwise from the ship heading named d φ from eq 10 if p c r is identified in range 0 to 1 d φ at each angle φ p can be calculated the size of ship domain by prsd model is measured by the radius d φ from the ship center to the different vertices of the ship domain as follows 11 d φ 2 ln p c r λ v 2 s i n φ p 2 c o s φ p 2 v σ l if 0 φ p 90 or 270 φ p 360 2 ln p c r λ v σ l if 90 φ p 270 where σ longitudinal influence parameter λ lateral influence parameter longitudinal and lateral influence parameters σ λ determine the longitudinal and lateral influence ranges of ship domain respectively at fore side the radius d φ is governed by a function of ship length l and speed v while at aft side it is only governed by a function of ship length l the length of d φ depends on the value of p c r as well the higher the p c r value maximum 1 is the shorter d φ is the lower the p c r value is minimum 0 the longer it is by applying prsd model the area around the ship can be digitally generated based on value of p c r as is depicted in fig 3 every point in this area has a value of p c r and points with same value of p c r will be shown as contour lines the ship heading determines the direction of the longitudinal axis of the ship domain the ship speed determines the degree of extension of the fore side the coverage of the ship domain is decided by the influence parameters next step is to specify the size of ship domain by prsd model 3 ship domain by prsd model in this step the size of ship domain by prsd model that was formulated earlier will be specified as mentioned above the size of ship domain by prsd model can be measured by eq 11 it depends on an adequate selection of the parameters it is seen that varying choices of parameters lead to important difference sizes of ship domain in order to determine the size of ship domain by prsd model three important factors namely σ λ and p c r should be identified with each set of σ λ and p c r the ship domain by prsd model will have a different size as can be seen in fig 4 with same values of σ and λ smaller value of pcr will lead to larger size than greater one prsd 1 and prsd 2 however with different values of σ and λ prsd will have different range with same value of pcr prsd 1 and prsd 3 in general the waters at sea can be divided into open sea areas and restricted areas the traffic densities in these areas are significantly different the dimension of ship domain is affected by different operating environment and ship density goodwin 1975 it has been observed that generally the ship domain size changes distinctly depending on available maneuverable area dimensions wielgosz 2017 quite clearly the ship domain in open sea and restricted areas should be treated differently in the following we describe how the size of ship domain by prsd model is obtained in both areas by determination of parameters 3 1 in restricted areas restricted areas are high density traffic areas where a ship is likely to collide with others if ship navigation is not carried out in the right manner they have dense traffic in the form of fishing boats small crafts in addition to larger merchant ships which by default means that a higher degree of precaution situational awareness and decision making is to be exercised under such circumstances since there are several ships present in the vicinity chances of a collision are very high attention is increasingly paid to the problem of using a ship domain in the process of safe ship conduct particularly in restricted areas a study on ship domain in restricted areas is promising and the problem and models of ship domain in the restricted areas have been described in many publications lately in this section the size of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas will be suggested by the identification of parameters in formulating the prsd model parameters have been expected to be different under different conditions in order to decide the size of ship domain by prsd model we adapt the approximation method the aim of the approximation is to generate three parameters of ship domain in restricted areas σ λ and p c r five models of ship domain in restricted areas are reviewed and compared i e fujii and tanaka 1971 coldwell 1983 hansen et al 2013 wang and chin 2016 and kijima and furukawa 2003 then one of them will be employed as subject model for approximation process for the technique of the approximation least squares method is used this is a tool for determination of a solution that is generally very close often identical with the optimum the stop condition is set on achieving the minimum fitness function wielgosz 2017 the best fit model can be obtained by defining an optimization problem with the objective to minimize the difference between the proposed prsd model and a previous model the size of ship domain by prsd model will be differently generated by each set values of σ λ and p c r the best fitted domain is assumed to take that of minimum value of fitness function the process of the approximation is presented in fig 5 the procedure in fig 5 is to prescribe a framework for the parameters approximation in order to determine the size of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas by adopting this approach the approximation will be done sequentially searching for the best fitted parameters of the ship domain size radii at four directions of ship domain with each set value of σ λ and p c r are calculated then they will be compared with four radii of subjected domain fitness function is the sum of squared differences between four radii of ship domain and the subjected domain the approximation process will stop until the minimum value of fitness function is found out and then the parameters for the ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas can be output in order to conduct approximation process the range of parameters should be considered each parameter has special features in the prsd model it is implied that these parameters have a different range of effects to the size of ship domain longitudinal and lateral radii of prsd model are required in this step applying φ p 0 90 180 and 270 to eq 12 four radii of prsd model can be given by 12 d f 2 ln p c r v σ l d a d s d p 2 ln p c r λ σ l where d f d a d s d p radius of ship domain by prsd model in fore aft starboard and port side respectively as explained in section 2 2 p c r value varies from 0 to 1 the range of influence parameters should be decided to reduce time of approximation process the appropriate value of influence parameter is which make the size of ship domain reasonable with existing ship domains in restricted areas neither too small nor too large first the forward radius d f of the ship domain is independent of lateral influence parameter λ so to determine the range of longitudinal influence parameter σ d f was calculated with each value of σ from 0 1 interval 0 1 by eq 12 until it was realized that if the value of σ is greater than 1 the radius of ship domain by prsd model in fore side d f is significantly larger when comparison with fore radii of other ship domains in restricted area in cases σ 1 0 1 σ 2 1 and p c r 1 0 1 and p c r 2 0 9 d f was compared with the forward radii of previous ship domains in restricted areas which is presented in figs 6 7 the only requirement on σ is that it generates a reasonable fore size of ship domain as we can see the longest range of forward radii in restricted areas is around 6 times of l o a forward radii of dynamic ship domains wang and chin 2016 kijima and furukawa 2003 are small at low speeds but greater when speed increase in case σ 1 0 1 even the length of d f of ship domain by prsd model at p c r 1 0 1 is significantly smaller than those of previous ship domains it will lead to the fore zone of ship domain is too small while with σ 2 1 the length of radius in fore of previous ship domains correspond to longitudinal radius d f of ship domain by prsd model at p c r 2 0 9 at speed of 10kn and higher they are even smaller than d f 0 9 in this case the fore zone of ship domain by prsd model is overwhelmingly larger than other ship domains therefore the suitable value of σ for restricted area should be in range 0 1 to 1 for lateral influence parameter the similar comparison is conducted and the range of λ for ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas is achieved from 0 to 1 after obtaining the ranges of parameters one ship domain should be chosen for comparison ship domains of fujii and tanaka 1971 coldwell 1983 and hansen et al 2013 remain static ones only focus on the size of ship regardless of the dynamic features a threat zone which accounts for dynamic changes in speeds the size of the threat zone is dynamically adjusted throughout the navigational process tran et al 2002 among past ship domains for restricted areas only ship domains in kijima and furukawa 2003 and wang and chin 2016 are dynamic ones however size of ship domain in wang and chin 2016 is smaller than the one in kijima and furukawa 2003 when compared with each other furthermore most of the previous models either completely lack empirical support in deriving the ship domains an empirical investigation on the appropriate shape of the domain would be useful the traffic movement data in wang and chin 2016 model was obtained from the database in the water of singapore port and straits this is busy and high density waterway using empirical data shows that the size of this domain is considered as minimum safety distance for restricted area furthermore the resulting polygon is actually quite close to an ellipse a shape suggested by past works fujii and tanaka 1971 coldwell 1983 hansen et al 2013 which used empirical data in other waters japan england and denmark respectively therefore ship domain in wang and chin 2016 is selected for the subject domain of approximation now the problem is to define a fitness function to estimate the model parameters as a measure of fitness the selected fitness function is defined by summing up of squared distance differences between four domain radii of proposed model and model of wang and chin 2016 at same speed radii of ship domain in wang and chin 2016 are linear functions of ship s length and quadratic functions of its speed radial distances from the ship center to the vertex of the polygon ship domain are calculated as follow 13 r f α f l g f v r a α a l g a v r s α s l g s v r p α p l g p v where r f r a r s r p radius of wang and chin 2016 model in fore aft starboard and port side respectively α f α a α s α p the normalized radial distance of the ship domain when the ship is stationary g f v g a v g s v g p v function of ship speed at fore aft starboard and port side respectively the fitness function thus becomes 14 δ d f d f r f 2 δ d a d a r a 2 δ d s d s r s 2 δ d p d p r p 2 15 δ d v i 1 4 δ d i where δ d f δ d a δ d s δ d p squared distance difference at fore aft starboard and port side respectively δ d sum of squared distance differences the fitness function of the approximation for the size of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas involving a set of three parameters σ λ and p c r and calculated by eq 15 the parameters values can be estimated such that the sum of squared distance differences between radii the proposed model and the subjected model wang and chin 2016 is minimal it means that after finding the minimum value of fitness function m i n δ d and the corresponding parameters can be selected the ship domain with a set values of p c r 0 8 σ 0 35 λ 0 03 is best fitted with ship domain of wang and chin 2016 in restricted areas applying p c r 0 8 σ 0 35 λ 0 03 to eq 13 four radii of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas can be calculated the result in case v 12 k n and radii of ship domains in restricted areas is represented in table 1 and fig 8 the resulting past ship domain in restricted areas are reproduced in fig 8 along with the ship domain by prsd model the comparison shows that ship domain of fujii and tanaka 1971 is reasonably compatible with the proposed ship domain on the fore side but overestimating the space requirement on the aft side while underestimating the lateral sides hansen et al 2013 and wang and chin 2016 ship domains match well with the proposed ship domain on the lateral sides but is greater on the longitudinal sides it should be noted that the fujii and tanaka 1971 and hansen et al 2013 models still cannot take into account the effect of change of speed while wang and chin 2016 model does not enlarge significantly with increasing speed coldwell 1983 modeled for a head on and an overtaking encounter resulting in a half elliptical ship domain and a symmetrically full elliptical ship domain respectively their port sides are closer matches to the one of ship domain by prsd model however three other sides appear overestimated kijima and furukawa 2003 overestimated the size of ship domain along the longitudinal and lateral sides it would be appropriate for risk assessment described in section 4 3 2 in open sea areas unlike restricted areas open sea areas have lesser traffic and ample sea room as expected the ship domain for the open ocean is greater than that in restricted waters due to more degrees of freedom similarly the ship domain in high density water is smaller than that in a water with less traffic it means that larger size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas is required then another set value of parameters needs to be identified to determine the size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas the similar procedure described in section 3 1 is adopted for the parameters estimation however one issue should be mentioned that our objective is to propose a danger criterion for collision assessment for the area around the ship which divided into four zones by three boundaries in section 4 based on the value of p c r that can be used in both restricted and open sea areas therefore after p c r 0 8 was determined for restricted area this value was also directly applied for open sea area as the value for minimum area in both areas only σ λ are estimated and p c r 0 8 is set in advance for the process of approximation to find out an appropriate for size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas a dynamic model that proposes a general boundary of ship domain in these areas is required furthermore ship length also should be considered in this model for this purpose the ship domain in pietrzykowski and urias 2009 is subject to an approximation pietrzykowski and urias 2009 extended and generalized the fuzzy boundary of ship domain an area surrounding the ship that the navigator should keep clear of other vessels and objects whose shape and size dynamically change with various navigational situations as mentioned before the objective is to minimize the difference between the effective clear areas described by the proposed model and the subjected model the difference between them can be treated as an error function given by eq 16 the sum of the squared distance differences between the domain boundaries d φ after applying p c r 0 8 and the minimum ship domain for open sea area of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 for each bearing is chosen as fitness function given by eq 17 16 δ d i d φ p φ 2 17 δ d δ d i where d φ length of radius of ship domain by prsd model at bearing φ p φ length of radius of minimum ship domain of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 at bearing φ δ d i squared distance difference in the i bearing δ d sum of squared distance differences for all analyzed bearings the radius d φ of ship domain by prsd model is then compared with the known radius of minimum ship domain of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 at same bearing φ this provides a measure of the error between them the fitness function of the optimization problem for ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas involving a set of two parameters σ λ the parameter values can be estimated such that sum of the squared distance differences is minimal m i n δ d detailed results obtained in open sea area after approximation process are σ 1 25 and λ 0 02 in order to valid the generated size of ship domain by prsd model the case of ship with l o a 200 m at the speed of 15 knots is examined after applying p c r 0 8 σ 1 25 λ 0 02 to eq 12 the size comparison with existing ship domains in open sea areas is represented in table 2 and fig 9 goodwin 1975 has three unequal sectors with different radii which are invariant with ship speed and length there are clearly distinctive differences between the proposed ship domain and model of goodwin 1975 goodwin 1975 oversimplifies the space domain with large discontinuities at the sector boundaries in addition it overestimates the space requirements particularly on the port and starboard sides compared to smierzchalski 2000 the ship domain by prsd model also compatible there is very good match for minimum ship domain of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 particularly in the fore side and aft side this means that our ship domain by prsd model for open waters is compatible with pietrzykowski and urias 2009 model when the safety level is high it is well suggested that the ship domain by prsd model is suitable in open sea areas 3 3 summary in this step the size of ship domain by prsd model that is identified first the parameters for ship domain in restricted areas were determined to do that it necessary to conduct a comprehensive comparison related to the shape of previous ship domains due to the number of parameters in the ship domain model the least squares method is chosen as the approximation technique the best fit model can be obtained by defining a fitness function with the objective to minimize the difference between the boundaries of proposed domain and the selected domain wang and chin 2016 the fitness function for determining the size of ship domain by prsd model is formulated as the sum of the squared distance differences between radii of two domains there is a minimum value for this fitness function and the most suitable parameters are obtained the same procedure is also carried out in order to obtain the size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas the minimum ship domain in open sea areas of pietrzykowski and urias 2009 is selected as a subject domain for approximation the results of the size of prsd model seem reasonable in accordance with existing ship domain models parameters for prsd model in two areas are shown in table 3 size of ship domain by prsd model in restricted areas is determined as follows 18 d φ 2 ln 0 8 0 03 v 2 s i n φ p 2 c o s φ p 2 v 0 35 l if 0 φ p 90 or 270 φ p 360 2 ln 0 8 0 03 v 0 35 l if 90 φ p 270 size of ship domain by prsd model in open sea areas is determined as follows 19 d φ 2 ln 0 8 0 02 v 2 s i n φ p 2 c o s φ p 2 v 1 25 l if 0 φ p 90 or 270 φ p 360 2 ln 0 8 0 02 v 1 25 l if 90 φ p 270 4 collision assessment zone using potential collision risk the area around a ship is simply divided into two zones in most of existing ship domains inside the ship domain dangerous area and outside the ship domain safe area however this kind of ship domain with a clear boundary is limited in applications when two ships in sight of each other are approaching with no change of compass bearing so that when there is risk of collision one of them there may be four stages relating to the permitted or required action for each ship cockcroft and lameijer 2003 at long range before risk of collision exists both ships are free to take any action when risk of collision first begins to apply the give way ship is required to take early and substantial action to achieve a safe passing distance and the other ship must keep her course and speed when it becomes apparent that the give way ship is not taking appropriate action in compliance with the rules the stand on ship is permitted to take action to avoid collision by her maneuver alone when collision cannot be avoided by the give way ship alone the stand on vessel is required to take such action as will best aid to avoid collision the distances at which the various stages begin to apply will vary considerably they will be much greater for high speed ships in past the determination of the two boundaries or limits for action close quarters range and critical distance were considered together hilgert 1983 ship domains with two areas such as blocking area and watching area action area were developed by kijima and furukawa 2003 and dinh and im 2016 if the neighborhood of a ship can be split into many zones it would be more convenient for navigators to distinguish the danger from wide range the navigator needs criteria like those in navigation such criteria are necessary for the navigator to make decisions in collision avoidance by using the value of p c r the concept of prsd model with three boundaries that divide the area around a ship named collision assessment zone into four zones with different potential risk levels are represented in fig 10 these four zones are safe zone sz cautious zone cz dangerous zone dz and very dangerous zone vdz and the required actions in each zone are given in table 4 as mentioned in section 3 3 the upper boundary for very dangerous zone of prsd model is corresponding with value of p c r 0 8 if the p c r of any target ship is more than 0 8 within this boundary and more than 0 8 outside this boundary it should be ensured that the target ship does not cross this boundary or keeps a distance from it the next step is to estimate dangerous and cautious boundaries based on value of p c r for estimation the least squares method is applied again in this case only p c r needs to be estimated a ship domain with series of boundary is required for approximation among existing ship domains the ones of kijima and furukawa 2003 dinh and im 2016 and hilgert 1983 consist of more than two zones however only the model of kijima and furukawa 2003 takes account into ship length and ship speed similar with prsd model kijima and furukawa 2003 decided to utilize safety blocking area and blocking area with space of arimura et al 1994 to evaluate collision risk with other ships hereafter those domains are simply called as blocking area and watching area respectively they also declared the general action for ship in these two areas according to kijima and furukawa 2003 existing ship in the watching area is regarded as target ship which should be watched out for by own ship when the watching area of the target ship invades the blocking area own ship should decide whether she will change or keep her course these areas are based on traffic regulation and expressed as a relation of elements such as tactical performance speed and ship length their validity was examined by numerical simulations therefore kijima and furukawa 2003 model with blocking area and watching area is subject domain for approximation of dangerous boundary and cautious boundary of prsd model respectively since the model of kijima and furukawa 2003 is for restricted areas the set value of influence parameters for this area σ 0 35 λ 0 03 is adopted then two fitness functions are defined radii of the blocking area of kijima and furukawa 2003 are given by 20 r b f 1 1 34 k a d 2 0 25 k d t 2 l r b a 1 0 67 k a d 2 0 25 k d t 2 l r b s 0 2 k d t l r b p 0 2 0 75 k d t l radii of the watching area of kijima and furukawa 2003 are given by 21 r w f 2 r b f 1 r w a 2 r b a 1 r w s 2 r b s 1 r w p 2 r b p 1 where r b f r b a r b s r b p radius of blocking area of kijima and furukawa 2003 in fore aft starboard and port side respectively r w f r w a r w s r w p radius of watching area of kijima and furukawa 2003 in fore aft starboard and port side respectively l is the own ship length k a d and k d t represent gains of the advance a d and the tactical diameter d t respectively 22 r w f 2 r b f 1 r w a 2 r b a 1 r w s 2 r b s 1 r w p 2 r b p 1 the fitness function to determine p c r value for dangerous boundary is given by 23 δ b f d f r b f 2 δ b a d a r b a 2 δ b s d s r b s 2 δ b p d p r b p 2 24 δ b v i 1 4 δ b i where δ b f δ b a δ b s δ b p squared distance difference at fore aft starboard and port side respectively δ b sum of squared distance differences with the blocking area of kijima and furukawa 2003 the fitness function to determine p c r value for cautious boundary is given by 25 δ w f d f r w f 2 δ w a d a r w a 2 δ w s d s r w s 2 δ w p d p r w p 2 26 δ w v i 1 4 δ w i where δ w f δ w a δ w s δ w p squared distance difference at fore aft starboard and port side respectively δ w sum of squared distance differences with the watching area of kijima and furukawa 2003 the estimations for dangerous boundary and cautious boundary are conducted separately the former is estimated by comparison with blocking area while the latter is estimated by comparison with the watching area of kijima and furukawa 2003 at this time only p c r is involved in the fitness functions of the approximation the fitness functions are defined by summing up the squared distance difference between four radii of prsd model and kijima and furukawa 2003 model δ b to estimate pcr value for dangerous boundary by eq 24 δ w to estimate pcr value for cautious boundary by eq 26 the aim is to find out corresponding values of p c r with minimum δ b and δ w implementing the same method as for restricted areas the boundaries of dangerous zone and cautious zone of prsd model according to values of p c r are figured out the results of p c r value for boundaries are shown in table 5 to verify the size of these boundaries the same comparison with past ship domains in restricted areas as in section 3 1 is carried out and presented fig 11 it is clearly seen that the cautious boundary of prsd model is almost the same as boundary of kijima and furukawa 2003 watching area the comparison shows that this boundary could be used as boundary for ship or obstacle moving into cautious zone should be watched out for by own ship in head on situation ship domain in coldwell 1983 on the starboard side is assumed larger than that on the port side base on the general preference of navigators to pass on the port side instead of the starboard side it is close to dangerous boundary of prsd model in fore and starboard side the dangerous boundary of prsd is also quite similar with the blocking area in kijima and furukawa 2003 only slightly smaller on aft and starboard sides when other ship or obstacle moving across the dangerous boundary own ship should decide whether to act for collision avoidance in order to see if these boundaries of prsd model are suitable in open sea areas we can compare it after applying p c r 0 01 and p c r 0 4 with other ship domains as can be shown in fig 12 the cautious boundary significantly greater than other ship domains in open sea areas in open sea areas ships usually navigate at high speed so they should be given sufficient sea room for watching others there are again good matches between the dangerous boundary of prsd model and pietrzykowski and urias 2009 maximum ship domain in pietrzykowski and urias 2009 and ship domain of goodwin 1975 particularly on the fore and aft side although these two ship domains show a larger increase on the port and starboard sides it may be concluded that the cautious and dangerous boundaries in both restricted areas and open sea areas are reasonable when correspondingly applying p c r 0 01 and p c r 0 4 based on these values collision assessment zone around a ship is divided into four zones by three boundaries can be defined in table 6 the summary of the proposed prsd model s contribution when compared with past ship domains is given in table 7 similar with previous ship domains the prsd model also proposes an area where other ships need to avoid entering the size of ship domain by prsd model is dynamically changed due to the changing in speed during navigation it depends on the value of parameters as well leading to the ability to apply in both restricted areas and open sea areas just by adopting different set of value of parameters another new function of prsd model is to calculate continuous and dynamic potential collision risk level of any point in area around the ship it has been solved the quantitative quantification problem of existing deterministic domain the developed series of boundaries that divided collision assessment zone into four zones combination with criterion for risk evaluation seems to be powerful in determining the navigational level of collision risk the feature makes the model applicable in assessing the risk of collisions furthermore when two ships are approaching each other their domains can be overlapped and the visualization can help to predict the potential collision area that will be represented in section 5 5 application of the proposed prsd in this section the encounter situations of real accidents are carried out based on ais data to demonstrate the validity and superiority of the presented prsd model the results are illustrated in multiple figures representing snapshots of situations a two dimensional cartesian coordinate system presents the distance in nautical miles nm the vertical axis in the positive direction shows north 0 and the horizontal axis in the positive direction is 90 5 1 scenario 1 teaan accident a simulation of collision in west coastal waters of south korea is carried out the collision happened at 7 10a m 19th january 2012 the position of collision was at 36 99 n 126 10 e and has been plotted as red mark in fig 13 the parameters for open sea areas are used in these simulations σ 1 25 and λ 0 02 fig 13 also displays the two ships labeled as ship a and ship b both the vessels are moving with different speeds and courses ship a is believed to be moving in the east northeast direction while the ship b is moving towards the south west direction a detail of distance between two ships ships positions and motion parameters of each ship during navigation is given in table 8 an important issue should be mentioned here when two ships are moving closer to each other their respective ship domains will have an overlap the overlapping area which can be understood as the potential collision area is the collision position if the two ships do not take measures to avoid collision this area will vary at different moments from cautious boundary to very dangerous boundary to a certain extent the changes of the overlapping area also demonstrate the degree of the collision probability in a moment of encounter situation the more inside that the overlapping boundaries are the bigger that the risk of collision is between the two ships and the greater the collision probability collision assessment zones of two ships during navigation using prsd model is illustrated in fig 14 two ships would collide if none of them change their courses theoretically making decision in crossing encounter situations should be easy only one of the ships is supposed to maneuver and the direction of a turn is specified by colregs since ship a is on starboard it is ship b that should maneuver if possible to starboard as fig 14b informed us at time step 240 two ships cautious boundaries were overlapped and distance between them was around 6 nm this overlapping area would be likely the collision area the p c r value of any point in this area seen from both ships would be greater than 0 01 since then two ships only maintained their courses and started to reduce their speeds to avoid this area at time step 540 p c r of ship b seen from ship a was 0 01 it means that ship b was in the cautious boundary of ship a ship a should start to watch if ship b has any action distance between two ships at this moment was 3 8 nm however ship b did not alter her course and two ships were still approaching each other arguably both ships courses were continuously consistent with small fluctuations dangerous and very dangerous boundaries were overlapped at time step 660 fig 14c and 840 as fig 14d respectively it means that the potential collision area was becoming closer to two ships and the collision probability was also greater from time step 660 to 840 ship b tried to turn to starboard however due to the bad weather conditions on the route the ability to maneuver of ship b became restricted and it was difficult to maneuver the ship as desired the high winds and waves made the heading of ship b fluctuated at time step 840 and in the range of 1 8 nm it would be still enough time for both ships to avoid collisions however collision finally occurred due to no effective actions taken from two ships as fig 14e size of a single ship domain is changing due to the change in speeds represented by fore radii of three boundaries in fig 15 due to the different between length and speed ship a had a larger domain than ship b from start to time step 180 both sizes of two ship domains were almost keeping the same because the speeds were not changed at time step 180 two ships started to reduce their own speeds but did not change their own courses at same moment the cautious boundaries started to be overlapped when two ships were approaching each other the distance became closer dangerous boundaries were overlapped it would be safe to combine of changing courses and speeds by two ships ship a collided with ship b had none of them change their courses despite decreasing speed when two ships were navigating at their full speeds the size of cautious boundaries of ship a and b are around 4 2 nm and 2 4 nm respectively during the period 0 540 s the distance between two ships are greater than the cautious boundaries of both ships minimum 3 8 nm at time step 540 this distance can be considered as safe distance in open sea area after that the distance continued to reduce from time step 540 to 840 it was smaller than the cautious boundary of ship a but still larger than the one of ship b it means that ship b entered the cautious zone of ship a sooner it can be explained that ship a is bigger and sailing at higher speed so her domain should be larger than ship b s at time step 960 when the distance was 1 18 nm same as dangerous boundary of ship a it showed that ship b was going inside the dangerous zone of ship a this distance is kindly close and danger in this situation when two ships were coming closer 0 49 nm at time step 1140 it was also the boundary of very dangerous zone of ship a after this boundary was trespassed collision happened fig 16 shows the p c r value of two ships during approaching each other ship b entered cautious zone dangerous zone and very dangerous zone of ship a earlier it means that p c r of ship b reached 0 01 0 4 and 0 8 sooner than ship a did the reason is that ship a is longer and was navigating with higher speed so the collision assessment zone around ship a was larger than the one of ship b therefore ship b crossed each boundary of ship a sooner when ship b was seen crossing into cautious zone from ship a time step 540 it should be watched if p c r was increasing ship b continued to keep direction and surpassed into dangerous zone p c r reached 0 4 from time step 540 to 960 navigators should have action to avoid collision however both ships had no action and very dangerous zones of two ships were invaded p c r s of two ships reached almost 1 when collision 5 2 scenario 2 jindo accident another accident in south coastal waters of south korea is carried out to verify the usefulness of prsd model in restricted areas the collision happened at 8 10a m 10th august 2013 the position of collision was at 34 35 n 126 09 e and has been plotted as red mark in fig 17 the parameters for restricted areas were used in these simulations σ 0 35 and λ 0 03 due to the high density traffic trajectories of two ships in this accident is displayed in fig 17 ship a is moving in the east southeast direction while the ship b is moving in the east northeast direction table 9 shows distance between two ships positions and motion parameters at every time step fig 18 displays collision assessment zones of two ships during navigation it would be safe if ship a altered to starboard according to colregs when the range was around 0 75 nm lateral radii of ship a and ship b were around 0 28 nm and 0 24 nm respectively the cautious boundaries were overlapped from the side where the potential collision area is likely however ship a chose to keep her course when two ships were too close 0 34 nm at time step 240 and dangerous boundaries were overlapped the distance from two ships to potential collision area were around 0 18 nm they decided to change courses but the appearance of a landmass probably made it hard to find a collision avoidance maneuver to starboard and the navigator may be tempted to turn to port again leading to overlap of very dangerous boundaries one thing should be added here is that water of collision is a high traffic area with a lot of small fishing boats around after ship b turned to starboard there were a couple of fishing boats in front sailing towards ship b therefore ship b had to turn back to port side again to avoid a landmark and other boats both ships remained their own courses and speeds until collision different with accident 1 when two ship were coming closer to each other they both attempted to change their own course but keep own speeds therefore the size of ship domains was changed slightly during navigation as fig 19 two ships were navigating in high density and busy water the distance between two ships was reducing smaller than cautious boundaries around 0 6 nm according to the situation of area and the size of both ships this distance could be enough for minimum passing distance however when the distance was smaller than dangerous boundaries around 0 26 nm it was dangerous for both ships at time step 660 when the distance was smaller than very dangerous boundaries around 0 12 nm both ships were in critical situation as we can see from fig 20 both ships entered cautious zones of each other p c r values of two ships reached around 0 01 at time step 240 and the distance was 0 34 nm since two ships were approaching from side the required action at this moment was changing direction however when ship b came inside the dangerous zone of ship a at time step 420 ship b had action to avoid collision by changing to starboard then they came back to cautious zones p c r s decreases to less than 0 4 however the fact that ship b also tried to steer away from landmarks it maneuvered to port again and did not reduce speed then dangerous zones were invade again following by very dangerous zone p c r s continued to increase again over 0 4 and 0 8 respectively until collision happened 5 3 discussion collision candidate is encountered ships which are in a situation that they would collide with each other if no evasive maneuver was performed it indicates ships with geometrical possibility of collision chen et al 2017 according to the definition the ship collision avoidance is defined as prediction and avoidance prediction is to forecast the target ship when and where will stay the same point or have collision risk with own ship on the sea avoidance is that the action been taken by both ships so that the two ship are not simultaneously occupy the same point or avoid encountering the situation of risk of collision liu and xiao 2014 through the above simulations some following conclusions can be proved 1 dynamic extended zones around a ship can be obtained by prsd model delineate the area required for safe collision escape maneuvers 2 overlapping area of ship domains can predict the potential collision area showing at which sub zone in collision assessment zone of ship this area is and the target ship with dynamic pcr value will help the own ship quickly evaluate the situation and have plan for collision evasive maneuvers in the future we will conduct a more comprehensive analysis to making prsd model suitable for a variety of complex environments with multiple ships 6 conclusion this paper proposes a novel ship domain named potential risk ship domain prsd for real time potential collision risk assessment first kernel density function is applied to construct ship domain according to d c p a and t c p a offering a picture of risk zone around a ship ship length speed as well as navigation situation on the size of ship domain by prsd model are considered then the size of prsd model in restricted and open sea areas are obtained by parameters determination based on the comparison with existing ship domains through approximation method finally a collision assessment zone around the ship can be divided into four zones by three boundaries with different levels of risk such zones can recommend action for maneuver and make the navigator s work easier to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed prsd model two real accidents within the coast of south korea are simulated by ais data by using the criterion in accordance with the rules collisions may be avoided with a high probability the results show that prsd model is effective and efficient to detect and evaluate risk of collision in real time has a good adaptability to any water type and can be applied for risk assessment of ship collision accidents as a decision support tool for maritime safety administration to improve navigation safety prsd model can also be used as reference for the evaluation and supervision of vts centers in vessel traffic management 
22309,offshore wind turbine tripod as one of the important foundation type is widely used so its security and stabilization for the marine environment and even life safety must be guaranteed by the fender during the collision the four types of fenders are proposed by two materials which are combined in different orders and adopted alone base on this the study is devoted to probe and compare the

nowadays the increasing trend of rotor sizes have appeared and benefits such as larger available ozone higher wind shear and less variability on the market price can be achieved from the owts offshore

on the range in scope from near shore to far from the shore gentils et al 2017 that different deeper sites seabed conditions and financial constraints for reference as we choose different types of support structures for owts as illustrated in fig 1 monopile consisting of a steel pile with a diameter of 3 m 4 5 m is mainly installed under the seabed 18 25 m the depth is determined by the type of seabed the structure of monopile owt is simple and has good adaptability to the change of water depth but its diameter is larger construction is difficult so the soil conditions need to be analyzed gibson and dowse 2001 for deeper site location monopiles tend to become practically constrained and economically non competitive thus other support structures such as the jacket or mostly the concept design floating support structure rarely used in practice are considered to be more suitable among them the jacket is suitable for water depths of 20 m 50 m and mainly used for large offshore wind power generation structure but a more complex and stiffer structure leads to high cost for construction hao and liu 2017 compared with monopile and jacket the tripod is more suitable for deep sea area since its structural characteristics could not only meet the depth of the china ocean area but also is more suitable for the construction level in china the tripod can ensure structural stability and reduce the main column diameter for cost consideration wang et al 2008 at the same time it has absorbed some experiences from the offshore platform construction in the traditional offshore oil and gas industry with adopting a three legged steel pipe pile support structure with lightweight and low price because the pile foundation is relatively small heavy construction equipment is not needed and the difficulty of construction is relatively small especially suitable for the water depth greater than 20 m sea area yeter et al 2014 more and more owts are built in the offshore and closer to traffic areas in which many commercial and passenger ships sail additionally the probability of collision between owt and ship is increasing when the traffic lanes are gradually becoming denser once a collision occurs ship and owt may be overturned causing environmental pollution and even worse resulting in loss of human life mo et al 2018 for this reason the analysis of dynamic response for owt structure becomes a necessity and the paper takes fender lee 2013 as a protective device the traditional collision studies attach importance to the offshore platforms bridge or ship impacted by ship in light of the above the theoretical basis and research methods of ship owts collision followed it analysis has been conducted to investigate the collision of ship owts by the nonlinear finite element method according to the collision theory travanca et al travancahong 2014 surveyed the dynamic response of steel offshore platforms impacted by typical supply vessels the collision characteristics of monopiles and jacket were investigated by d moula et al moulas et al 2017 and andreea b et al bela et al 2017 transient response and damage to the grouted onnection of monopile were performed by renjie et al mo et al 2018 in addition biehl f et al biehl and lehmann 2006 studied the process of the ship impacted tripod and obtain the structural damage characteristics of the tripod the support structure of the wind turbine was badly hit based on this an increasing number of researchers are trying to explore effective fenders to protect the offshore wind turbine from the collision so studies have been conducted to investigate different materials of the fender for example cezary graczykowski et al graczykowski and holnicki szulc 2009 proposed pneumatic structure contains several separate air chambers equipped with devices for fast inflation and pressure release and used finite element simulation of ship owt collisions to prove the validity of the device liu et al 2015 studied the performance of rubber guards under the ship collision and the process of dynamic response in different situations results reveal that the maximum collision force and acceleration of a protected monopile under anti collision fender are greatly improved than no fender case hervé le sourne et al 2015 simulated both rigid and deformable ships colliding the jacket at different velocities by the nonlinear finite element and analyzed the damaging situation and transfer of the crushing force at different conditions ren and ou 2009 proposed a fender for an offshore wind turbine with steel sphere shell circular ring aluminum and the foam pad results show that steels sphere shell keeps the ship away from the foundation while circular ring aluminum form or rubber can better mitigate the collision the above study adopts the different analytical model to simulate the protective performance of the fender and almost fenders are made of rubber however the aluminum foam as the energy absorber has the excellent energy absorbing capability which may be used in the fender meanwhile those papers didn t take aluminum foam as the material of fenders into account reyes et al 2003 the collision comes from the relative speed between the objects that cause contact and power generation in essence the process of collision is a highly nonlinear dynamic with unsteady properties variable boundaries wells 1972 which need to be modeled by a finite element method based on continuum mechanics pfeiffer and glocker 2000 the finite element method solves the whole domain function by the element hypothesis approximation function and the approximation fitting of the multi segment line boundary shape the continuous problem of infinite degree of freedom is separated into the problem of finite degree of freedom and then the approximate solution on the whole domain is solved and the collision dynamics problem of complex geometry material properties can be simulated numerically by introducing the search of the contact point and collision solving algorithm belytschko et al 2000 this paper is based on this method quite a few scholars proposed the different materials of the fender and different materials have complex plastic behaviors with a whole analytical model for elasto plastic contact is a challenge therefore the semi analytical models are often used for studying the effect of plasticity in contact mechanics moreover it is overwhelmingly crucial to study the pre and post collision relative velocity and the energy conversion at the contact point in the collision process when ship owt collides and rebound hence the coefficient of restitution cor describing the motion state and the energy conversion in terms of the post collision to pre collision is calculated analytically in the collision model meanwhile cor has an influence on the impact energy and reveals the dynamic response and deformation of the fender after ship collision which makes the design of the fender apply in practice in this work the geometrical dimensions and different material combination of the protective devices for tripod and cor of ship fender collision are conducted additionally a series of various thicknesses of the fender scenarios are defined to estimate the behavior of the anti collision of fender further research is needed to be carried out to optimize the structure of the fender the aim of this research is to investigate the dynamic response and the suitable thickness selection of fender for the tripod offshore wind turbine when subjected to ship collision the case of 2500 tons head on a 4 mw tripod wind turbine is developed by using the explicit finite element code ls dyna while the pile seabed soil interaction is based on the p y curve method jeong and seo 2004 additionally the dynamic response of the owt the anti collision performance of fender and the cor were analyzed 2 research object 2 1 physical description of the owt the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 4 mw wind turbine is chosen as the research object of which the main geometry parameters are listed in table 1 as one of the most widely used fixed foundations the tripod is chosen to support the nrel 4 mw wind turbine in the chinese sea hao and liu 2017 the underwater terrain is flat with quaternary sediments of holocene deposition and late pleistocene deposition the specific soil profile at the site is represented in table 2 2 2 the governing equation of the ship owt collision system the collision of the ship and offshore wind turbines is a complex instantaneous physical process belonging to nonlinear dynamic problem category and the governing equation can be expressed as below abrate 2011 1 m u c u k u f h where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the system respectively u u and u are the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively f is the collision force h is the hourglass damping matrix eqn 1 the time integral is based on the display central difference method the basic format is as follows 2 u t n m 1 f t n h t n k u t n c u t n 1 2 u t n 1 2 u t n 1 2 u t n δ t n 1 δ t n 2 u t n 1 u t n u t n 1 2 δ t n where t n 1 2 t n t n 1 2 t n 1 2 t n 1 t n 2 δ t n 1 t n t n 1 δ t n t n 1 t n u t n u t n u t n 1 2 u t n 1 are the nodal acceleration of t n nodal velocity of t n 1 2 nodal displacement of t n 1 eqn 2 because the centralized mass matrix is used the solution of motion equations is non coupling and the calculation efficiency can be improved without integrating the whole matrix the advantage of explicit center difference is that it can avoid the convergence problem caused by nonlinearity without matrix inversion and simultaneous equations while the disadvantage is that the courant criterion must be satisfied the time step must be smaller than the time step critical value which is determined by the nature of the problem solving equation it s worth noting that the smallest element in the general grid decides the time step selection 3 δ t min δ t e 1 δ t e 2 δ t e i δ t e n where δ t e i is the limit time step of i unit n is the total number of units all types of units can be expressed uniformly in ls dyna eqn 3 4 δ t e α l c where l is the unit characteristics scale c is the sound velocity of material α is 0 9 different type unit of l and c are calculated through table 3 eqn 4 in table 3 v e is the unit volume a e max is the entity l e is the length of bar or beam a e is the shell area l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 respectively indicates four sided edge length of the shell β is the shape parameters of the shell 2 3 the theory of cor a coefficient called cor e is introduced in this paper and defined as aryaei et al 2010 5 e v n 2 v n 1 v n 1 v n 2 where v n1 and v n2 are objects velocities before impact and v n1 and v n2 are objects velocities after impact eqn 5 so cor value is between 0 and 1 is defined as the ratio between relative velocities pre and post collision the impact is fully plastic if and only if cor is zero it is fully elastic if and only if cor is one in the latter cases no energy loss has occurred in actual cases this coefficient is neither zero nor one according to fig 2 if one of the objects is in a static state relation 5 is reduced to its new form 6 e v o u t v i n where v in and v out are the initial and final object speeds respectively thus if an object moving with speed in the collision to a resting object it rebounds with speed v out eqn 6 3 numerical modeling the tripod owt and ship are large structures consisting of multiple components the collision process is a complicated subject involving material properties and non linear constitutive features contact settings large deformation of the structure etc the research method of ship collision is divided into three types including real experiment simplified analytic method and finite element numerical simulation method among them the test can generally provide more accurate and reliable prediction however it s expensive and also requires a lot of manpower and time the test of real ship is seldom carried out since the late 1990s the rapid development of computer technology has made the finite element numerical simulation of large size complex structure hull model feasible comparatively the past analytic method cannot adapt to the current high level of precision and technology so ls dyna is used as a outstanding general explicit non linear dynamic analysis program that simulates a variety of complex contact non linearity material nonlinearity and geometric nonlinearity for most nonlinear dynamic problems especially the transient highly nonlinear problems of large deformation structures such as ship collisions the explicit solution method is generally used in the calculation of the overall strain caused by the overall force of the structure compared with the implicit solution method the explicit solution method doesn t involve the convergence problem nor the simultaneous equations and thereby can avoid the problem of the ill posed deterministic solution due to the simultaneous equations so this paper uses the ls dyna code to carry out numerical applications and also the verification work 3 1 material model 3 1 1 steel model the bow the tripod foundation and the wind turbine tower tube material are all mild steels during the process of collision the structure will have rapid deformation and the strain rate increases obviously compared with the static load action the dynamic test of the material shows that with the increase of strain rate a series of physical will occur inside the material the stress strain relationship of mechanical properties is more complicated the yield limit instantaneous stress ductility resistance ratios and other basic parameters vary to varying degrees which will have an influence on the structural response of the structure so the non linear plastic material model mat plastic kinematic gladman 2013 with the influence of strain rate is given by ls dyna the mode is based on cowper symonds relation 7 σ y 1 ε c 1 p σ 0 β e p ε eff p where σ 0 is the initial yield strength cand p are the constant related to the nature of the material ε is the strain rate β is an adjustable parameter and 0 is a plastic follow up model taking 1 as an equal strength model e p is the modulus of plastic reinforcement e p e t e e e t e t and e are the modulus of elasticity and tangent modulus respectively eqn 7 ε e f f p is the equivalent plastic strain rate as expressed below 8 ε e f f p 0 t 2 3 ε i j p ε i j p 1 2 d t ε i j p is the plastic strain rate namely total strain rate minus elastic strain rate ε i j p ε i j ε i j e the material of bow is q235 steel wind turbine and tripod are q345 steel the physical properties of the q235 q345 steel are listed in table 4 since some parts of the ship are not involved in the collision the hull and stern are modeled by a rigid body mat rigid gladman 2013 to improve the computational efficiency and also the blades hub as well as the nacelle etc are replaced by applying a lumped mass to the top of the tower 3 1 2 rubber material in this paper the phenomenological energy function in the constitutive relation of rubber materials is studied by phenomenological theory the theory of rubber material is that the deformation of the isotropic hyperelastic material uniform deformation li et al 2016 so its stress strain relationship is described by the strain energy density function w i 1 i 2 i 3 which expressed by i 1 i 2 and i 3 invariants of the deformation tensor and the relationship between the main elongation ratio λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 in what follows the relationship between the three tensor invariants and the three principal elongation ratios is presented as follows 9 i 1 λ 1 2 λ 2 2 λ 3 2 10 i 2 λ 1 2 λ 2 2 λ 2 2 λ 3 2 λ 1 2 λ 3 2 11 i 3 λ 1 2 λ 2 2 λ 3 2 12 λ i 1 ε i where i 1 2 3 is the first second and third invariants of the tensor λ i is elongation ratio ε i i 1 2 3 strain in the direction of the spindle eqn 9 eqn 10 eqn 11 eqn 12 the rubber material is a hyperelastic material the strain energy density function is transformed into a polynomial form which consists of the sum of the strain bias energy and the volume strain as shown below 13 w i j 1 n c i j i 1 3 i 2 3 i 1 n 1 d i j 1 2 i wheren is polynomial order j is elastic volume ratio d i is define the compressibility of the material the value determines whether the material is compressible if n 1 indicating that the material is completely incompressible eqn 13 in the formula 8 the first term is the strain deviation and the second is the volume strain for polynomials the initial shear modulus and the initial bulk modulus of the rubber depend on the first order coefficient which is g0 2 c10 c01 k0 2 d1 for a complete polynomial if n 1 the model that only the linear part of the strain can be retained is moony rivilin it is currently most commonly used in constitutive models of rubber materials due to simple model and easy to determine parameters 14 w c 10 i 1 3 c 01 i 2 3 1 d 1 j 1 2 where wis strain potential energy i 1 i 2 is deformation tensor c 10 c 01 d 1 is material constant j is elastic volume ratio eqn 14 however the model moony rivilin is only suitable for relative small deformation and never give a reasonable excuse for the mechanical behavior of large deformation of the material and then ogden 1972 ogden 1972 proposed the strain energy density function is presented as follows 15 w i 1 n 2 μ i α i λ 1 α i λ 2 α i λ 3 α i 3 i 1 n 1 d i j e l 1 2 where n determines the number of terms in the strain energy the constants μ i and α i describe the material s shear behavior λ i j 1 3 λ i and λ i denote the principal stretch ratios j λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 is the jacobean determinant j e l is the volume ratio set equal to 1 0 for incompressible materials d i introduces compressibility and is close to zero for nearly incompressible materials eqn 15 so the parameters of the ogden model is given in table 5 3 1 3 aluminum foam material aluminum foam is a kind of multifunctional lightweight material with aluminum as the matrix and many holes evenly distributed in it the constitutive relationship of aluminum metal foam is based on the foam material model studied by deshpande and fleck 2000 and define the relationship between equivalent stress and equivalent strain which is dependent on standard shape parameters in ls dyna the following empirical relation determines the parameters of the constitutive model 16 σ y σ p l γ ε ˆ ε d α 2 in 1 1 ε ˆ ε d β where σ p l is flow stress ε d is the locking strain ε ˆ is the effective strain and γ α 2 β are fitting model parameters eqn 16 the model parameters are given in table 6 and the fender installation position and sketch in fig 3 3 2 fe model 3 2 1 fe model of owt the tripod foundation structure is mainly composed of the main column diagonal brace cross brace and steel pipe column its finite element model is shown in fig 4 the component listed in table 6 the pile enters the fine sand layer of the seabed and the depth of burial is 65 m which exposing the sea surface to 2 m 3 m the foundation is simulated by shell elements and the grid size in the collision area is 0 2 m which is lower than other parts in order to ensure calculation accuracy the remaining parts are modeled by rigid solid elements with a size of bigger 0 2 m to improve the computation efficiency for tripod foundation the joint between the diagonal brace and the main column is severely damaged to collapse when it was impacted by the ship in order to avoid collision the joint of the tripod should be located lower than the maximum draught of the ship ertong 2016 3 2 2 fe model of the ship according to the design standards of owts veritas 2014 the characteristic impact load on an owt shall be the impact load from an unintended collision by the maximum authorized service vessel in daily operation a typical forward titled ship namely the common ship is chosen here to do the simulation the main parameters of which are expressed in table 7 ship owt collision system is shown in fig 5 normally a ship consists of the bow the hull and the stern but the fe model here of the ship is simplified into two parts for the simulation consideration namely the bow and the remaining part hull and stern specifically the bow is simulated by the shell element with a thickness of 20 mm and an element size of 0 2 m while rest part of the ship is described by the rigid solid element which is suitable of the properer definition of the centre of gravity the ship model and the fe model of the bow are presented in fig 6 the interaction between the ship and the seawater cannot be neglected during the collision the best method is to establish a fluid solid coupling model but the coupling calculation of ship seawater interaction is too time consuming so an added mass model which has been verified and recognized by many scholars is proposed nokobronald 2018 lagrange et al 2018 gupeter tim stallardet al 2018 the interaction between the ship and the water is based on the added mass method petersen 1982 in which the added mass coefficient is selected as 0 1 zhang et al 2019 due to the remarkable effects of the seawater surrounding the vessel during the collision 3 2 3 fe model of the fender the fender installed in the base center is made of two kinds of materials namely aluminum foam and rubber in order to understand the anti collision performance of fender the three fenders are designed to study ren et al ren and ou 2009 used the aluminum foam material in the fender for the first time so aluminum foam is combined with the rubber for the annular fender the steel shell as the outermost layer the thickness of 0 05 m is aim to protect the internal rubber or aluminum material form material rupture others material have the thickness of 1 4 m and an element size of 0 2 m the other combinations of the fenders are as shown in fig 7 and table 8 3 3 contact model in this study a 0 6 m of space is left between the ship and the foundation to avoid the initial contact the penalty based contact algorithm automatic surface to surface is used for the contact consideration between the ship and the fender since the sliding contact type only considers the coulomb friction interaction between the interfaces with a friction value of 0 2 is used to deal with the occurrence of contact in the collision area wen 2010 3 4 boundary conditions at the seabed the structural dynamic response of the owt connection to the ship impact is very sensitive to the boundary constrain at the seabed because of the tall slender structures and large mass top of the tripod owt for this when a tripod owt is struck by a ship the collision force acting on the owt is mainly horizontal and the pile soil interaction is mainly in a horizontal direction the vibration of owt causes the vertical force generated by the mass of the top nacelle blades etc however the vertical force is too small to display in the axial direction because of the relative huge squeezing force from the soil the vertical force from the soil along the tripod has little influence on the vibration of the foundation which can be ignored in the simulation the direction constrain of the tripod is simplified as fixed in the axial direction at the bottom of the tripod p y curve method zhaogeorge et al 2017 reflects the lateral soil resistance for the constrain in the horizontal direction nonlinear spring elements are adapted to simulate the pile soil horizontal interaction at different depths below the seabed one node of springs is linked to pile and another node is fixed as shown in fig 8 at a spacing of l0 m in the z direction the soil tripod interaction was considered during the dynamic simulation of the wind turbine structure in order to ensure stability and safety the interaction mechanism is that the tripod is act on by horizontal bearing capacity to happen lateral displacement along with the presence of resistance which comes from the subsoil that reacts on the tripod structure to hold back the further lateral displacement based on the more discussion about the soil tripod interaction the axial bearing capacity can be neglected because it always meets the requirement hence a dynamic analysis of a collision between the ship and owt is affected by the plastic deformation of subsoil nonlinear cyclic p y curves are suggested in api american petroleum institute api 2011 which was used in their model for the ultimate horizontal resistance of soil when the depth is relatively shallow deep it can be calculated according to equations 17 18 17 p u s c 1 x c 2 d γ x 18 p u d c 3 d γ x where x is the depth c 1 c 2 c 3 are the variation coefficient with internal friction angle φ the values are selected according to the fig 9 a γ is the computing coefficients p u s is the horizontal bearing capacity of shallow soil p u d is horizontal bearing capacity of deep soil at the depth of x the p y curve equation is expressed as eqn 19 19 p a p u tanh κ x a p u y where a is 0 9 κ is the foundation reaction initial modulus with φ related p is the resistance of soil p u is the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity according to the fig 9 b by linearizing p y curve in the depth x of the soil layer the stiffness coefficient of the unit depth equivalent spring at this depth can be obtained on the p y curve if the curve follows a horizontal straight line after the point x y x p x the definition function q x k x y is the best square approximation function p y over the interval 0 y x ie eqn 20 and eqn 21 20 i k x 0 y x p y k x y 2 d y 21 d i d k x 2 0 y x p k x y y d y 0 22 k x 3 y x 3 0 y x a p u y tanh κ x a p u y d y the curve has a small change in curvature when the offset is small so the first derivative of the displacement can be expressed by the initial soil reaction force 23 k x p y 0 κ x where k x is secant stiffness in the formula 22 and tangent stiffness in the formula 23 for safety reasons it is generally obtained by formula 22 which essentially linearizes the original curve also known as the ideal elastoplastic method see fig 10 the expression of the equivalent spring stiffness coefficient per unit depth at the depth the stiffness coefficient of the equivalent spring on a pile foundation can be expressed as eqn 24 24 k i 1 2 k i k i l 0 1 2 k i n l 0 l 0 where k i is the equivalent spring rate coefficient on the pile i segment the pile is divided into small n segments for each segment length l 0 l 0 1 m k i j l 0 j 0 1 n is unit depth equivalent spring rate coefficient at each end of each segment the smaller the spacing is the more accurate the simulation is the soil p y curve was test by the field lateral load and was confirmed that it contains the interaction between the springs 4 ship owt collision analysis in this paper a 2500 tons ship with an initial velocity of 2 m s is used for the collision analysis in order to ensure that the fender can be fixed on the tripod and will not fall down when the collision occurred the weight of fender must be constrained within 15 of the owt this paper mainly analyzes the performance of the fender to relieve the collision force of the ship under collision 4 1 the accuracy validation of the simulation the first important step for the numerical simulation study is to establish a correct mechanics model during the collision process the initial kinetic energy including the water mass of the ship is transformed into the structure deformation energy remaining kinetic energy sliding energy hourglass energy and damping energy the external damping is complex and would never affect the research purpose what s more the collision simulation analysis requires that the hourglass energy should be controlled which generally requires that the hourglass should be less than 5 of the total energy to be considered reliable in fig 11 4 2 the energy analysis of the collision by using the ls dyna code a ship colliding with the tripod in the chinese sea is numerically simulated the simulated hourglass only accounts for 2 73 1 65 1 23 1 87 which is much less than 5 therefore the established fe model is reasonable and the calculation result is convincing the energy changes of the ship tripod collision system are depicted in fig 11 as the variation of fender material the flow of the internal energy and the kinetic energy performs fluctuate at the beginning of the collision the internal energy increases gradually and the kinetic energy begins to decrease it is observed that the trends of the two curves of energy are the same under single material and under the two materials it like so as for the ship tripod collision system there is little oscillation of kinetic energy curve and internal energy curve in fig 11 which implies that the collision leads to the nacelle of the offshore wind turbine to vibrate after the ship far away from tripod the conversion of kinetic energy and internal energy is completed while the energy curve remains stable the kinetic energy of b fender reaches the lowest point with the minimum value of 0 036422 mj which less than 0 05583 mj of a 0 061505 of c 0 062471 of d so it is clear that aluminum foam fender has good energy absorbing the damping energy is rising slightly slower than that of the other three because of the special porous structure of the aluminum foam when the bow deformation is not taken into account the deformation energy absorption of the protection device reduces the collision energy 4 3 the damage analysis of foundations 4 3 1 the analysis of collision force it has been found that the collision force largely reflects the crashworthiness of the fender the case of 2500 tons head on tripod collision at 2 m s is conducted while the owt equipped with the different material fenders the collision force curve is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the maximum collision force grows along with times nevertheless the times to reach the maximum collision force are different from a to d fender combined material fender c and d have maximum value of collision force 9 43 mn 8 96 mn which more than a and b comparing the collision force of the four types of fenders the collision force of the b fender is smaller than the others 51 84 65 14 56 91 which reveals that b fender has a better influence on crashworthiness the difference can be attributed to the characteristics of aluminum foam which porous property promotes collision force to be absorbed by large deformation of the hole it can be compressed with the stress strain go through three stages elastic deformation platform yield and compaction meanwhile the collision process has experienced from elastic to elastoplastic to plastic stage in addition the actual collision time is respectively shown in table 9 the aluminum foam fender has the longest impact time so it is enough time to absorb the energy of the collision to reduce the collision force 4 3 2 the analysis of energy absorbed and von mises stress under the ship fender collision the initial kinetic energy converts part of it into the internal energy of the bow and other parts into the internal energy of the fender in fig 13 in addition the internal energy of the fender is mostly at the aluminum foam which it always absorbs energy better than other materials in the a fender the energy curve increases first and then decreases as the ship tripod collision process continues which the steel absorbs maximum collision energy 0 768 mj and rubber only absorbs 0 604 mj furthermore aluminum of other fenders keeps high energy absorption rate three type fenders such as 66 67 of b 27 63 of c 38 53 of d it has been observed that fender tends to have better anti collision performance with respect to the direction of aluminum foam set due to large deformation during collision fig 14 demonstrates the variation of the von mises stress with respect to the type of fender the von mises stress of a single material protective device is more dispersed nevertheless that of the combined protective device is more concentrated moreover the fender has significant bending moments and the fender s contact zone was chosen to evaluate its damage fig 15 presents the bending moment time history post processed in the chosen sections whatever is the type of fender the bending moment reaches its maximum value immediately after the collision and then decreases after the contact between the fender of owt and the striking ship is lost in the collision area only b fender s bending moment does not reach its maximum value in the first part of the collision event however the other three fenders immediately reach the maximum value followed by the failure of the structure 4 3 3 the analysis of plastic strain fig 16 shows the plastic strain of the a types of fenders it can be seen from the figures mentioned above that the damaged area in which the internal material deforms greatly meanwhile the values of the maximum strain are smaller than the corresponding failure strain which reveals that failure does not occur at the collision point 4 4 dynamic response of nacelle the nacelle of the owt is an important part of the safety of the unit operation during the collision fig 17 depicts the comparative results of the nacelle s maximum acceleration of the tripod in four types of fenders it can be observed that the maximum acceleration rises along with the different fenders and with different rising rate as for a single scenario of any type it can be found that the nacelle of the tripod owt always generates the minimum value of the maximum allowable acceleration the maximum accelerations are 5 81 3 07 9 83 9 63 m s2 for the a b c and d respectively furthermore the nacelle will not fall off due to the protection by b fender which better than others fender it can be seen that the acceleration of foundation with no fender has rapid changes of direction or velocity but the foundation with fender can relieve the acceleration of the violent response 4 5 the thickness of the combination fender first of all we have added the ship owt collision without the fender in the paper in addition the thickness parameter of different material layer of the proposed c and d fender has been discussed in the following fig 18 in those cases the force increases slowly with time in c fender and declines gradually in d fender which the rubber and aluminum foam position transformation has changed as depicted in fig 19 it can be seen that the maximum of force of c fender approximately rises parabolically as the thickness increases and the maximum of force of d fender decrease parabolically see fig 18 for first peak point the fitting line is expressed as y 0 0024 x 1 2 0 0217 x 1 9 1959 y 0 0116 x 2 2 0 27 x 2 10 313 where the x 1 x 2 respectively represent the thickness of different material layers of the proposed c d fender y is the maximum of force as seen the different positions of materials have some influences on the maximum of force therefore the 0 1 1 3 thickness of c fender has good anti collision ability and 1 3 0 1 thickness of d fender has good anti collision ability besides the second peak point appearing predominantly 8 thickness combinations 0 1 1 3 0 2 1 2 0 3 1 1 0 4 1 0 1 0 0 4 1 1 0 3 1 2 0 2 1 3 0 1 of c fender and 9 thickness combinations 0 3 1 1 0 4 1 0 0 5 0 9 0 6 0 8 0 8 0 6 0 9 0 5 1 0 0 4 1 1 0 3 1 2 0 2 of d fender the reason for the second peak point is that the material of two layers was impacted by ship and the force is up to maximum value but the rubber is hyperelastic material that has higher springback velocity than ship which led to second peak point in the force curve in aforementioned thickness combination moreover from the von mises stress of owt under the fender and the damaged and the extent of damage observed in each scenario it was found out that stress have a large mutation during the collision period from 0 3 to 1 0 and the fender with good anti collision ability can effectively alleviate the phenomenon of stress concentration see fig 20 a series of impact scenarios are defined to estimate the behaviour of the fender during and after impact by the ship the various thickness of the material layers involves significant force stress and damage as previously described the thickness change range 0 1 1 3 that make the force have tremendous fluctuation and the difference of c d fender between the maximum and the minimum of the force is 0 78688 mn 1 29633 mn when the aluminum foam is in the middle of the fender its influence on the anti collision of the fender is greater than in the internal position the same is true for stress it can be found that the middle of material layers of fender suffered from impact play an important role 4 6 dynamic response of the ship as discussed before the assumption of a rigid ship which has the structural dynamic response is different from the owt a previous study of ship collision with the owt shows that the offshore wind turbine has obivous structural deformation and energy conversion during the collision therefore it is necessary to evaluate the main dynamic responses of the ship for further study the energy dissipation ship bows are designed according to the rules of ship classification societies when the owt was impacted by the bows the bows happened energy dissipation with the owt fig 21 displays the internal energy time history curves and kinetic energy time history curves the kinetic energy was absorbed by the internal energy of the owt in the four scenarios for a b c d fenders the internal energy of the bows accounts for 3 03 4 44 1 29 2 70 of the kinetic energy respectively such the bows under b fender have more internal energy than others because the bows collision mainly results in the local damage of the owt which often have plastic deformation therefore the bows keep less internal energy and b fender have absorbed the most internal energy the ship displacement internal energy is shown in fig 22 as the internal energy increases to its maximum 1 66 mj of a 0 91 mj of b 2 17 mj of c 1 89 mj of d the curve begins to fall and grow backwards the collision response of the ship bows model and the four scenarios are compared in fig 23 as can be seen the ship bows have different von mises stress responses in various fender collision scenarios at 0 3 s 0 6s 0 9s 1 2s see fig 8 this can be observed when bow contacted the owt the stress first reached 8 937e 06 of b 2 015e 07 of a 2 488e 07 of c 2 019e 07 of d and then the energy exchange with respect to increasing deformation meanwhile the stress of bows extends from a small area to a large area the fender improves the ship bows damage resistance and the most of stress has been absorbed by the fender which one of the most energy absorbing characteristics is fender b 5 the basic analysis of cor in order to further analyze the deformation generation and evolution process of the material of fenders during the collision the influence of the geometry on the characteristics of spring back is analyzed with cor as the reference quantity the three different size of rubber fenders were chosen to study cor its outer diameter and thickness are 1 d 7 7 m h 1 35 m 2 d 7 9 m h 1 45 m 3 d 8 1 m h 1 55 m respectively which with respect to the thickness diameter ratio l r η r d 2 η 1 0 35 η 2 0 367 η 3 0 383 5 1 the deformation process comparison the case of 2500 tons head on different size fenders are simulated by ls dyna and give the three η with respect to varying degree of deformation at 4 m s ship fig 24 depicts the four time 0 3s 0 4s 0 5s 0 6s fig 24 shows the deformation process of collision at three η it can be found that the degree of deformation increases continuously along with the time rises which illustrates the enlargement of η at same velocity does not affect the degree of deformation meanwhile the η 1 0 35 initial velocity of 2 4 6 8 m s are as shown in fig 25 it can be found that the degree deformation of the fender increases along with the initial velocity rises which illustrates the plastic deformation have an enlargement 5 2 the effect of initial velocity of ship the energy conversion occurs in the fender when the collision process from contact and lost fig 26 illustrates the relationship of the velocity and cor the coefficient of restitution of the three fenders changes with initial velocity is given it can be seen that when the initial velocity is very small it can be considered that the fender collides with ship elastically the cor of the three fenders is 0 65 as the initial velocity increases the cor decreases continuously and the downward trend has a significant change when the initial velocity approaches 4 m s the reason is that the different failure modes are converted so that the plastic hinge dissipates more energy at the same time it can be found that the cor of the three fenders are basically the same as the collision velocity which indicates that the main factor of the structural cor is the initial velocity not the geometric parameters of the structure thickness to diameter ratio 6 cost of the aluminum foam and rubber cost analysis is an economic evaluation technique for comparing the cost paid to the gained benefit for the purpose of evaluation rubber and aluminum foam the demand relationship of natural rubber can reflect a country s level of industrialization industrialized countries such as the united states and japan are major consumers of natural rubber in the context of global manufacturing transfer and structural optimization and upgrading china has replaced the united states as the world s largest consumer of natural rubber since 2001 average comprehensive cost for 1996 2001 was about 10 016 rmb t 9 614 rmb t and 9 284 rmb t respectively in different regions in china yunnan province and hainan province as the main production areas of natural rubber provide the cost data of natural rubber in 2014 2017 the average annual price of private natural rubber was 11 611 rmb t and the highest was 14 443 rmb t see table 10 table 11 compared to rubber aluminum foam is also used in fender in general it is the best way to commercialize foamed aluminum by adding foaming agent however the high cost of foaming agent leads to an increase in the price of aluminum foam which limits the commercialization of aluminum foam material on one hand various manufacturing methods are used to produce aluminum foam for different application areas and different performances on the other hand under the specifications of aluminum foam size the price of aluminum foam is based on the square of it and the price changes with thickness accordingly therefore the price of aluminum foam is presented in table 12 from the economic point of view rubber material is more economical than aluminum foam material from the aspect of material structural characteristics the structural rigidity impact resistance and vibration absorption and energy absorption characteristics of aluminum foam material are more excellent 7 conclusions in this paper a comprehension evaluation and comparison of the anti collision performance of fender and owt s response is carried out in the case of a head on collision between ship and tripod and four types of fenders are taken into account rubber aluminum rubber aluminum foam and aluminum foam rubber fender ansys ls dyna a commercial finite element package is employed for impact analysis the energy changes of the ship owt collision system are investigated firstly with the comparison of kinetic energy and internal energy the aluminum foam fender have good protective properties during post collision in the following part this paper analyses the collision force initial energy von mises stress the bending moment of the fender plastic strain and the maximum acceleration of owt by comparing the above parameters it is found that the b fender gives the minimum collision force von mises stress the bending moment of the fender plastic strain and the maximum acceleration as well as maximum initial energy among the four when four types of fenders are subjected to high collision energy the effective factors are considered in the simulation in order to evaluate the anti collision fenders accurately furthermore the thickness and position of aluminum foam in the fender have a bearing on the anti collision of fender and the aluminum foam of the fender not only makes the tripod less vulnerable to damage but also avoids severe damage to the ship caused by the occurrence of secondary disasters besides the cor is discussed by two opinions about geometric parameters of the structure and the initial velocity it implies that the initial velocity depends on the cor the results and the analysis in the paper for crashworthiness performance of the fender are very valuable declaration

22309,offshore wind turbine tripod as one of the important foundation type is widely used so its security and stabilization for the marine environment and even life safety must be guaranteed by the fender during the collision the four types of fenders are proposed by two materials which are combined in different orders and adopted alone base on this the study is devoted to probe and compare the anti collision performance of the fender when 2500 tons ship tripod collision a series of cases are conducted to investigate the fender of tripod damage analysis and the dynamic response of owt under the protection of the fender by ansys ls dyna through investigating and analyzing the maximum collision force energy absorbed the maximum bending moment of the fender von mises stress plastic strain thickness of material layer and ship it is found that the aluminum foam fender has better anti collision performance and the thickness of the material layer has an impact on the anti collision performance of fender moreover the coefficient of restitution cor is discussed during the fender service period hence the aluminum foam material is good for improving the fender s performance which can give valuable information to further study on the application of aluminum foam in the fenders keywords offshore wind turbine structural dynamic response tripod fender cor 1 introduction wind power turbines use the kinetic energy of the wind offering the motive force to rotate turbine blades and develop through a drive shaft the mechanical power to generate electricity wind turbines are classified by the axis of rotation of the main rotor shaft either horizontal or vertical axis and whether they are located onshore or offshore o kelly and muhammad 2013 liu et al 2019 miao et al 2019 nowadays the increasing trend of rotor sizes have appeared and benefits such as larger available ozone higher wind shear and less variability on the market price can be achieved from the owts offshore wind turbines which locate further from shore and alleviate the construction pressure of the onshore wind turbine kaldellis and apostolou 2017 li et al 2014 the uk is the world s largest offshore wind market and commands just over 36 of installed capacity followed by germany in the second spot with 28 5 so even with china comes third in the global offshore rankings with just under 15 the 2788 mw of the cumulative total means that china s offshore wind turbine is taking off steve sawyer 2018 recently with the growth of china s offshore wind farm the development of offshore has mainly been focused on the range in scope from near shore to far from the shore gentils et al 2017 that different deeper sites seabed conditions and financial constraints for reference as we choose different types of support structures for owts as illustrated in fig 1 monopile consisting of a steel pile with a diameter of 3 m 4 5 m is mainly installed under the seabed 18 25 m the depth is determined by the type of seabed the structure of monopile owt is simple and has good adaptability to the change of water depth but its diameter is larger construction is difficult so the soil conditions need to be analyzed gibson and dowse 2001 for deeper site location monopiles tend to become practically constrained and economically non competitive thus other support structures such as the jacket or mostly the concept design floating support structure rarely used in practice are considered to be more suitable among them the jacket is suitable for water depths of 20 m 50 m and mainly used for large offshore wind power generation structure but a more complex and stiffer structure leads to high cost for construction hao and liu 2017 compared with monopile and jacket the tripod is more suitable for deep sea area since its structural characteristics could not only meet the depth of the china ocean area but also is more suitable for the construction level in china the tripod can ensure structural stability and reduce the main column diameter for cost consideration wang et al 2008 at the same time it has absorbed some experiences from the offshore platform construction in the traditional offshore oil and gas industry with adopting a three legged steel pipe pile support structure with lightweight and low price because the pile foundation is relatively small heavy construction equipment is not needed and the difficulty of construction is relatively small especially suitable for the water depth greater than 20 m sea area yeter et al 2014 more and more owts are built in the offshore and closer to traffic areas in which many commercial and passenger ships sail additionally the probability of collision between owt and ship is increasing when the traffic lanes are gradually becoming denser once a collision occurs ship and owt may be overturned causing environmental pollution and even worse resulting in loss of human life mo et al 2018 for this reason the analysis of dynamic response for owt structure becomes a necessity and the paper takes fender lee 2013 as a protective device the traditional collision studies attach importance to the offshore platforms bridge or ship impacted by ship in light of the above the theoretical basis and research methods of ship owts collision followed it analysis has been conducted to investigate the collision of ship owts by the nonlinear finite element method according to the collision theory travanca et al travancahong 2014 surveyed the dynamic response of steel offshore platforms impacted by typical supply vessels the collision characteristics of monopiles and jacket were investigated by d moula et al moulas et al 2017 and andreea b et al bela et al 2017 transient response and damage to the grouted onnection of monopile were performed by renjie et al mo et al 2018 in addition biehl f et al biehl and lehmann 2006 studied the process of the ship impacted tripod and obtain the structural damage characteristics of the tripod the support structure of the wind turbine was badly hit based on this an increasing number of researchers are trying to explore effective fenders to protect the offshore wind turbine from the collision so studies have been conducted to investigate different materials of the fender for example cezary graczykowski et al graczykowski and holnicki szulc 2009 proposed pneumatic structure contains several separate air chambers equipped with devices for fast inflation and pressure release and used finite element simulation of ship owt collisions to prove the validity of the device liu et al 2015 studied the performance of rubber guards under the ship collision and the process of dynamic response in different situations results reveal that the maximum collision force and acceleration of a protected monopile under anti collision fender are greatly improved than no fender case hervé le sourne et al 2015 simulated both rigid and deformable ships colliding the jacket at different velocities by the nonlinear finite element and analyzed the damaging situation and transfer of the crushing force at different conditions ren and ou 2009 proposed a fender for an offshore wind turbine with steel sphere shell circular ring aluminum and the foam pad results show that steels sphere shell keeps the ship away from the foundation while circular ring aluminum form or rubber can better mitigate the collision the above study adopts the different analytical model to simulate the protective performance of the fender and almost fenders are made of rubber however the aluminum foam as the energy absorber has the excellent energy absorbing capability which may be used in the fender meanwhile those papers didn t take aluminum foam as the material of fenders into account reyes et al 2003 the collision comes from the relative speed between the objects that cause contact and power generation in essence the process of collision is a highly nonlinear dynamic with unsteady properties variable boundaries wells 1972 which need to be modeled by a finite element method based on continuum mechanics pfeiffer and glocker 2000 the finite element method solves the whole domain function by the element hypothesis approximation function and the approximation fitting of the multi segment line boundary shape the continuous problem of infinite degree of freedom is separated into the problem of finite degree of freedom and then the approximate solution on the whole domain is solved and the collision dynamics problem of complex geometry material properties can be simulated numerically by introducing the search of the contact point and collision solving algorithm belytschko et al 2000 this paper is based on this method quite a few scholars proposed the different materials of the fender and different materials have complex plastic behaviors with a whole analytical model for elasto plastic contact is a challenge therefore the semi analytical models are often used for studying the effect of plasticity in contact mechanics moreover it is overwhelmingly crucial to study the pre and post collision relative velocity and the energy conversion at the contact point in the collision process when ship owt collides and rebound hence the coefficient of restitution cor describing the motion state and the energy conversion in terms of the post collision to pre collision is calculated analytically in the collision model meanwhile cor has an influence on the impact energy and reveals the dynamic response and deformation of the fender after ship collision which makes the design of the fender apply in practice in this work the geometrical dimensions and different material combination of the protective devices for tripod and cor of ship fender collision are conducted additionally a series of various thicknesses of the fender scenarios are defined to estimate the behavior of the anti collision of fender further research is needed to be carried out to optimize the structure of the fender the aim of this research is to investigate the dynamic response and the suitable thickness selection of fender for the tripod offshore wind turbine when subjected to ship collision the case of 2500 tons head on a 4 mw tripod wind turbine is developed by using the explicit finite element code ls dyna while the pile seabed soil interaction is based on the p y curve method jeong and seo 2004 additionally the dynamic response of the owt the anti collision performance of fender and the cor were analyzed 2 research object 2 1 physical description of the owt the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 4 mw wind turbine is chosen as the research object of which the main geometry parameters are listed in table 1 as one of the most widely used fixed foundations the tripod is chosen to support the nrel 4 mw wind turbine in the chinese sea hao and liu 2017 the underwater terrain is flat with quaternary sediments of holocene deposition and late pleistocene deposition the specific soil profile at the site is represented in table 2 2 2 the governing equation of the ship owt collision system the collision of the ship and offshore wind turbines is a complex instantaneous physical process belonging to nonlinear dynamic problem category and the governing equation can be expressed as below abrate 2011 1 m u c u k u f h where m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the system respectively u u and u are the acceleration velocity and displacement vectors respectively f is the collision force h is the hourglass damping matrix eqn 1 the time integral is based on the display central difference method the basic format is as follows 2 u t n m 1 f t n h t n k u t n c u t n 1 2 u t n 1 2 u t n 1 2 u t n δ t n 1 δ t n 2 u t n 1 u t n u t n 1 2 δ t n where t n 1 2 t n t n 1 2 t n 1 2 t n 1 t n 2 δ t n 1 t n t n 1 δ t n t n 1 t n u t n u t n u t n 1 2 u t n 1 are the nodal acceleration of t n nodal velocity of t n 1 2 nodal displacement of t n 1 eqn 2 because the centralized mass matrix is used the solution of motion equations is non coupling and the calculation efficiency can be improved without integrating the whole matrix the advantage of explicit center difference is that it can avoid the convergence problem caused by nonlinearity without matrix inversion and simultaneous equations while the disadvantage is that the courant criterion must be satisfied the time step must be smaller than the time step critical value which is determined by the nature of the problem solving equation it s worth noting that the smallest element in the general grid decides the time step selection 3 δ t min δ t e 1 δ t e 2 δ t e i δ t e n where δ t e i is the limit time step of i unit n is the total number of units all types of units can be expressed uniformly in ls dyna eqn 3 4 δ t e α l c where l is the unit characteristics scale c is the sound velocity of material α is 0 9 different type unit of l and c are calculated through table 3 eqn 4 in table 3 v e is the unit volume a e max is the entity l e is the length of bar or beam a e is the shell area l 1 l 2 l 3 l 4 respectively indicates four sided edge length of the shell β is the shape parameters of the shell 2 3 the theory of cor a coefficient called cor e is introduced in this paper and defined as aryaei et al 2010 5 e v n 2 v n 1 v n 1 v n 2 where v n1 and v n2 are objects velocities before impact and v n1 and v n2 are objects velocities after impact eqn 5 so cor value is between 0 and 1 is defined as the ratio between relative velocities pre and post collision the impact is fully plastic if and only if cor is zero it is fully elastic if and only if cor is one in the latter cases no energy loss has occurred in actual cases this coefficient is neither zero nor one according to fig 2 if one of the objects is in a static state relation 5 is reduced to its new form 6 e v o u t v i n where v in and v out are the initial and final object speeds respectively thus if an object moving with speed in the collision to a resting object it rebounds with speed v out eqn 6 3 numerical modeling the tripod owt and ship are large structures consisting of multiple components the collision process is a complicated subject involving material properties and non linear constitutive features contact settings large deformation of the structure etc the research method of ship collision is divided into three types including real experiment simplified analytic method and finite element numerical simulation method among them the test can generally provide more accurate and reliable prediction however it s expensive and also requires a lot of manpower and time the test of real ship is seldom carried out since the late 1990s the rapid development of computer technology has made the finite element numerical simulation of large size complex structure hull model feasible comparatively the past analytic method cannot adapt to the current high level of precision and technology so ls dyna is used as a outstanding general explicit non linear dynamic analysis program that simulates a variety of complex contact non linearity material nonlinearity and geometric nonlinearity for most nonlinear dynamic problems especially the transient highly nonlinear problems of large deformation structures such as ship collisions the explicit solution method is generally used in the calculation of the overall strain caused by the overall force of the structure compared with the implicit solution method the explicit solution method doesn t involve the convergence problem nor the simultaneous equations and thereby can avoid the problem of the ill posed deterministic solution due to the simultaneous equations so this paper uses the ls dyna code to carry out numerical applications and also the verification work 3 1 material model 3 1 1 steel model the bow the tripod foundation and the wind turbine tower tube material are all mild steels during the process of collision the structure will have rapid deformation and the strain rate increases obviously compared with the static load action the dynamic test of the material shows that with the increase of strain rate a series of physical will occur inside the material the stress strain relationship of mechanical properties is more complicated the yield limit instantaneous stress ductility resistance ratios and other basic parameters vary to varying degrees which will have an influence on the structural response of the structure so the non linear plastic material model mat plastic kinematic gladman 2013 with the influence of strain rate is given by ls dyna the mode is based on cowper symonds relation 7 σ y 1 ε c 1 p σ 0 β e p ε eff p where σ 0 is the initial yield strength cand p are the constant related to the nature of the material ε is the strain rate β is an adjustable parameter and 0 is a plastic follow up model taking 1 as an equal strength model e p is the modulus of plastic reinforcement e p e t e e e t e t and e are the modulus of elasticity and tangent modulus respectively eqn 7 ε e f f p is the equivalent plastic strain rate as expressed below 8 ε e f f p 0 t 2 3 ε i j p ε i j p 1 2 d t ε i j p is the plastic strain rate namely total strain rate minus elastic strain rate ε i j p ε i j ε i j e the material of bow is q235 steel wind turbine and tripod are q345 steel the physical properties of the q235 q345 steel are listed in table 4 since some parts of the ship are not involved in the collision the hull and stern are modeled by a rigid body mat rigid gladman 2013 to improve the computational efficiency and also the blades hub as well as the nacelle etc are replaced by applying a lumped mass to the top of the tower 3 1 2 rubber material in this paper the phenomenological energy function in the constitutive relation of rubber materials is studied by phenomenological theory the theory of rubber material is that the deformation of the isotropic hyperelastic material uniform deformation li et al 2016 so its stress strain relationship is described by the strain energy density function w i 1 i 2 i 3 which expressed by i 1 i 2 and i 3 invariants of the deformation tensor and the relationship between the main elongation ratio λ 1 λ 2 and λ 3 in what follows the relationship between the three tensor invariants and the three principal elongation ratios is presented as follows 9 i 1 λ 1 2 λ 2 2 λ 3 2 10 i 2 λ 1 2 λ 2 2 λ 2 2 λ 3 2 λ 1 2 λ 3 2 11 i 3 λ 1 2 λ 2 2 λ 3 2 12 λ i 1 ε i where i 1 2 3 is the first second and third invariants of the tensor λ i is elongation ratio ε i i 1 2 3 strain in the direction of the spindle eqn 9 eqn 10 eqn 11 eqn 12 the rubber material is a hyperelastic material the strain energy density function is transformed into a polynomial form which consists of the sum of the strain bias energy and the volume strain as shown below 13 w i j 1 n c i j i 1 3 i 2 3 i 1 n 1 d i j 1 2 i wheren is polynomial order j is elastic volume ratio d i is define the compressibility of the material the value determines whether the material is compressible if n 1 indicating that the material is completely incompressible eqn 13 in the formula 8 the first term is the strain deviation and the second is the volume strain for polynomials the initial shear modulus and the initial bulk modulus of the rubber depend on the first order coefficient which is g0 2 c10 c01 k0 2 d1 for a complete polynomial if n 1 the model that only the linear part of the strain can be retained is moony rivilin it is currently most commonly used in constitutive models of rubber materials due to simple model and easy to determine parameters 14 w c 10 i 1 3 c 01 i 2 3 1 d 1 j 1 2 where wis strain potential energy i 1 i 2 is deformation tensor c 10 c 01 d 1 is material constant j is elastic volume ratio eqn 14 however the model moony rivilin is only suitable for relative small deformation and never give a reasonable excuse for the mechanical behavior of large deformation of the material and then ogden 1972 ogden 1972 proposed the strain energy density function is presented as follows 15 w i 1 n 2 μ i α i λ 1 α i λ 2 α i λ 3 α i 3 i 1 n 1 d i j e l 1 2 where n determines the number of terms in the strain energy the constants μ i and α i describe the material s shear behavior λ i j 1 3 λ i and λ i denote the principal stretch ratios j λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 is the jacobean determinant j e l is the volume ratio set equal to 1 0 for incompressible materials d i introduces compressibility and is close to zero for nearly incompressible materials eqn 15 so the parameters of the ogden model is given in table 5 3 1 3 aluminum foam material aluminum foam is a kind of multifunctional lightweight material with aluminum as the matrix and many holes evenly distributed in it the constitutive relationship of aluminum metal foam is based on the foam material model studied by deshpande and fleck 2000 and define the relationship between equivalent stress and equivalent strain which is dependent on standard shape parameters in ls dyna the following empirical relation determines the parameters of the constitutive model 16 σ y σ p l γ ε ˆ ε d α 2 in 1 1 ε ˆ ε d β where σ p l is flow stress ε d is the locking strain ε ˆ is the effective strain and γ α 2 β are fitting model parameters eqn 16 the model parameters are given in table 6 and the fender installation position and sketch in fig 3 3 2 fe model 3 2 1 fe model of owt the tripod foundation structure is mainly composed of the main column diagonal brace cross brace and steel pipe column its finite element model is shown in fig 4 the component listed in table 6 the pile enters the fine sand layer of the seabed and the depth of burial is 65 m which exposing the sea surface to 2 m 3 m the foundation is simulated by shell elements and the grid size in the collision area is 0 2 m which is lower than other parts in order to ensure calculation accuracy the remaining parts are modeled by rigid solid elements with a size of bigger 0 2 m to improve the computation efficiency for tripod foundation the joint between the diagonal brace and the main column is severely damaged to collapse when it was impacted by the ship in order to avoid collision the joint of the tripod should be located lower than the maximum draught of the ship ertong 2016 3 2 2 fe model of the ship according to the design standards of owts veritas 2014 the characteristic impact load on an owt shall be the impact load from an unintended collision by the maximum authorized service vessel in daily operation a typical forward titled ship namely the common ship is chosen here to do the simulation the main parameters of which are expressed in table 7 ship owt collision system is shown in fig 5 normally a ship consists of the bow the hull and the stern but the fe model here of the ship is simplified into two parts for the simulation consideration namely the bow and the remaining part hull and stern specifically the bow is simulated by the shell element with a thickness of 20 mm and an element size of 0 2 m while rest part of the ship is described by the rigid solid element which is suitable of the properer definition of the centre of gravity the ship model and the fe model of the bow are presented in fig 6 the interaction between the ship and the seawater cannot be neglected during the collision the best method is to establish a fluid solid coupling model but the coupling calculation of ship seawater interaction is too time consuming so an added mass model which has been verified and recognized by many scholars is proposed nokobronald 2018 lagrange et al 2018 gupeter tim stallardet al 2018 the interaction between the ship and the water is based on the added mass method petersen 1982 in which the added mass coefficient is selected as 0 1 zhang et al 2019 due to the remarkable effects of the seawater surrounding the vessel during the collision 3 2 3 fe model of the fender the fender installed in the base center is made of two kinds of materials namely aluminum foam and rubber in order to understand the anti collision performance of fender the three fenders are designed to study ren et al ren and ou 2009 used the aluminum foam material in the fender for the first time so aluminum foam is combined with the rubber for the annular fender the steel shell as the outermost layer the thickness of 0 05 m is aim to protect the internal rubber or aluminum material form material rupture others material have the thickness of 1 4 m and an element size of 0 2 m the other combinations of the fenders are as shown in fig 7 and table 8 3 3 contact model in this study a 0 6 m of space is left between the ship and the foundation to avoid the initial contact the penalty based contact algorithm automatic surface to surface is used for the contact consideration between the ship and the fender since the sliding contact type only considers the coulomb friction interaction between the interfaces with a friction value of 0 2 is used to deal with the occurrence of contact in the collision area wen 2010 3 4 boundary conditions at the seabed the structural dynamic response of the owt connection to the ship impact is very sensitive to the boundary constrain at the seabed because of the tall slender structures and large mass top of the tripod owt for this when a tripod owt is struck by a ship the collision force acting on the owt is mainly horizontal and the pile soil interaction is mainly in a horizontal direction the vibration of owt causes the vertical force generated by the mass of the top nacelle blades etc however the vertical force is too small to display in the axial direction because of the relative huge squeezing force from the soil the vertical force from the soil along the tripod has little influence on the vibration of the foundation which can be ignored in the simulation the direction constrain of the tripod is simplified as fixed in the axial direction at the bottom of the tripod p y curve method zhaogeorge et al 2017 reflects the lateral soil resistance for the constrain in the horizontal direction nonlinear spring elements are adapted to simulate the pile soil horizontal interaction at different depths below the seabed one node of springs is linked to pile and another node is fixed as shown in fig 8 at a spacing of l0 m in the z direction the soil tripod interaction was considered during the dynamic simulation of the wind turbine structure in order to ensure stability and safety the interaction mechanism is that the tripod is act on by horizontal bearing capacity to happen lateral displacement along with the presence of resistance which comes from the subsoil that reacts on the tripod structure to hold back the further lateral displacement based on the more discussion about the soil tripod interaction the axial bearing capacity can be neglected because it always meets the requirement hence a dynamic analysis of a collision between the ship and owt is affected by the plastic deformation of subsoil nonlinear cyclic p y curves are suggested in api american petroleum institute api 2011 which was used in their model for the ultimate horizontal resistance of soil when the depth is relatively shallow deep it can be calculated according to equations 17 18 17 p u s c 1 x c 2 d γ x 18 p u d c 3 d γ x where x is the depth c 1 c 2 c 3 are the variation coefficient with internal friction angle φ the values are selected according to the fig 9 a γ is the computing coefficients p u s is the horizontal bearing capacity of shallow soil p u d is horizontal bearing capacity of deep soil at the depth of x the p y curve equation is expressed as eqn 19 19 p a p u tanh κ x a p u y where a is 0 9 κ is the foundation reaction initial modulus with φ related p is the resistance of soil p u is the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity according to the fig 9 b by linearizing p y curve in the depth x of the soil layer the stiffness coefficient of the unit depth equivalent spring at this depth can be obtained on the p y curve if the curve follows a horizontal straight line after the point x y x p x the definition function q x k x y is the best square approximation function p y over the interval 0 y x ie eqn 20 and eqn 21 20 i k x 0 y x p y k x y 2 d y 21 d i d k x 2 0 y x p k x y y d y 0 22 k x 3 y x 3 0 y x a p u y tanh κ x a p u y d y the curve has a small change in curvature when the offset is small so the first derivative of the displacement can be expressed by the initial soil reaction force 23 k x p y 0 κ x where k x is secant stiffness in the formula 22 and tangent stiffness in the formula 23 for safety reasons it is generally obtained by formula 22 which essentially linearizes the original curve also known as the ideal elastoplastic method see fig 10 the expression of the equivalent spring stiffness coefficient per unit depth at the depth the stiffness coefficient of the equivalent spring on a pile foundation can be expressed as eqn 24 24 k i 1 2 k i k i l 0 1 2 k i n l 0 l 0 where k i is the equivalent spring rate coefficient on the pile i segment the pile is divided into small n segments for each segment length l 0 l 0 1 m k i j l 0 j 0 1 n is unit depth equivalent spring rate coefficient at each end of each segment the smaller the spacing is the more accurate the simulation is the soil p y curve was test by the field lateral load and was confirmed that it contains the interaction between the springs 4 ship owt collision analysis in this paper a 2500 tons ship with an initial velocity of 2 m s is used for the collision analysis in order to ensure that the fender can be fixed on the tripod and will not fall down when the collision occurred the weight of fender must be constrained within 15 of the owt this paper mainly analyzes the performance of the fender to relieve the collision force of the ship under collision 4 1 the accuracy validation of the simulation the first important step for the numerical simulation study is to establish a correct mechanics model during the collision process the initial kinetic energy including the water mass of the ship is transformed into the structure deformation energy remaining kinetic energy sliding energy hourglass energy and damping energy the external damping is complex and would never affect the research purpose what s more the collision simulation analysis requires that the hourglass energy should be controlled which generally requires that the hourglass should be less than 5 of the total energy to be considered reliable in fig 11 4 2 the energy analysis of the collision by using the ls dyna code a ship colliding with the tripod in the chinese sea is numerically simulated the simulated hourglass only accounts for 2 73 1 65 1 23 1 87 which is much less than 5 therefore the established fe model is reasonable and the calculation result is convincing the energy changes of the ship tripod collision system are depicted in fig 11 as the variation of fender material the flow of the internal energy and the kinetic energy performs fluctuate at the beginning of the collision the internal energy increases gradually and the kinetic energy begins to decrease it is observed that the trends of the two curves of energy are the same under single material and under the two materials it like so as for the ship tripod collision system there is little oscillation of kinetic energy curve and internal energy curve in fig 11 which implies that the collision leads to the nacelle of the offshore wind turbine to vibrate after the ship far away from tripod the conversion of kinetic energy and internal energy is completed while the energy curve remains stable the kinetic energy of b fender reaches the lowest point with the minimum value of 0 036422 mj which less than 0 05583 mj of a 0 061505 of c 0 062471 of d so it is clear that aluminum foam fender has good energy absorbing the damping energy is rising slightly slower than that of the other three because of the special porous structure of the aluminum foam when the bow deformation is not taken into account the deformation energy absorption of the protection device reduces the collision energy 4 3 the damage analysis of foundations 4 3 1 the analysis of collision force it has been found that the collision force largely reflects the crashworthiness of the fender the case of 2500 tons head on tripod collision at 2 m s is conducted while the owt equipped with the different material fenders the collision force curve is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the maximum collision force grows along with times nevertheless the times to reach the maximum collision force are different from a to d fender combined material fender c and d have maximum value of collision force 9 43 mn 8 96 mn which more than a and b comparing the collision force of the four types of fenders the collision force of the b fender is smaller than the others 51 84 65 14 56 91 which reveals that b fender has a better influence on crashworthiness the difference can be attributed to the characteristics of aluminum foam which porous property promotes collision force to be absorbed by large deformation of the hole it can be compressed with the stress strain go through three stages elastic deformation platform yield and compaction meanwhile the collision process has experienced from elastic to elastoplastic to plastic stage in addition the actual collision time is respectively shown in table 9 the aluminum foam fender has the longest impact time so it is enough time to absorb the energy of the collision to reduce the collision force 4 3 2 the analysis of energy absorbed and von mises stress under the ship fender collision the initial kinetic energy converts part of it into the internal energy of the bow and other parts into the internal energy of the fender in fig 13 in addition the internal energy of the fender is mostly at the aluminum foam which it always absorbs energy better than other materials in the a fender the energy curve increases first and then decreases as the ship tripod collision process continues which the steel absorbs maximum collision energy 0 768 mj and rubber only absorbs 0 604 mj furthermore aluminum of other fenders keeps high energy absorption rate three type fenders such as 66 67 of b 27 63 of c 38 53 of d it has been observed that fender tends to have better anti collision performance with respect to the direction of aluminum foam set due to large deformation during collision fig 14 demonstrates the variation of the von mises stress with respect to the type of fender the von mises stress of a single material protective device is more dispersed nevertheless that of the combined protective device is more concentrated moreover the fender has significant bending moments and the fender s contact zone was chosen to evaluate its damage fig 15 presents the bending moment time history post processed in the chosen sections whatever is the type of fender the bending moment reaches its maximum value immediately after the collision and then decreases after the contact between the fender of owt and the striking ship is lost in the collision area only b fender s bending moment does not reach its maximum value in the first part of the collision event however the other three fenders immediately reach the maximum value followed by the failure of the structure 4 3 3 the analysis of plastic strain fig 16 shows the plastic strain of the a types of fenders it can be seen from the figures mentioned above that the damaged area in which the internal material deforms greatly meanwhile the values of the maximum strain are smaller than the corresponding failure strain which reveals that failure does not occur at the collision point 4 4 dynamic response of nacelle the nacelle of the owt is an important part of the safety of the unit operation during the collision fig 17 depicts the comparative results of the nacelle s maximum acceleration of the tripod in four types of fenders it can be observed that the maximum acceleration rises along with the different fenders and with different rising rate as for a single scenario of any type it can be found that the nacelle of the tripod owt always generates the minimum value of the maximum allowable acceleration the maximum accelerations are 5 81 3 07 9 83 9 63 m s2 for the a b c and d respectively furthermore the nacelle will not fall off due to the protection by b fender which better than others fender it can be seen that the acceleration of foundation with no fender has rapid changes of direction or velocity but the foundation with fender can relieve the acceleration of the violent response 4 5 the thickness of the combination fender first of all we have added the ship owt collision without the fender in the paper in addition the thickness parameter of different material layer of the proposed c and d fender has been discussed in the following fig 18 in those cases the force increases slowly with time in c fender and declines gradually in d fender which the rubber and aluminum foam position transformation has changed as depicted in fig 19 it can be seen that the maximum of force of c fender approximately rises parabolically as the thickness increases and the maximum of force of d fender decrease parabolically see fig 18 for first peak point the fitting line is expressed as y 0 0024 x 1 2 0 0217 x 1 9 1959 y 0 0116 x 2 2 0 27 x 2 10 313 where the x 1 x 2 respectively represent the thickness of different material layers of the proposed c d fender y is the maximum of force as seen the different positions of materials have some influences on the maximum of force therefore the 0 1 1 3 thickness of c fender has good anti collision ability and 1 3 0 1 thickness of d fender has good anti collision ability besides the second peak point appearing predominantly 8 thickness combinations 0 1 1 3 0 2 1 2 0 3 1 1 0 4 1 0 1 0 0 4 1 1 0 3 1 2 0 2 1 3 0 1 of c fender and 9 thickness combinations 0 3 1 1 0 4 1 0 0 5 0 9 0 6 0 8 0 8 0 6 0 9 0 5 1 0 0 4 1 1 0 3 1 2 0 2 of d fender the reason for the second peak point is that the material of two layers was impacted by ship and the force is up to maximum value but the rubber is hyperelastic material that has higher springback velocity than ship which led to second peak point in the force curve in aforementioned thickness combination moreover from the von mises stress of owt under the fender and the damaged and the extent of damage observed in each scenario it was found out that stress have a large mutation during the collision period from 0 3 to 1 0 and the fender with good anti collision ability can effectively alleviate the phenomenon of stress concentration see fig 20 a series of impact scenarios are defined to estimate the behaviour of the fender during and after impact by the ship the various thickness of the material layers involves significant force stress and damage as previously described the thickness change range 0 1 1 3 that make the force have tremendous fluctuation and the difference of c d fender between the maximum and the minimum of the force is 0 78688 mn 1 29633 mn when the aluminum foam is in the middle of the fender its influence on the anti collision of the fender is greater than in the internal position the same is true for stress it can be found that the middle of material layers of fender suffered from impact play an important role 4 6 dynamic response of the ship as discussed before the assumption of a rigid ship which has the structural dynamic response is different from the owt a previous study of ship collision with the owt shows that the offshore wind turbine has obivous structural deformation and energy conversion during the collision therefore it is necessary to evaluate the main dynamic responses of the ship for further study the energy dissipation ship bows are designed according to the rules of ship classification societies when the owt was impacted by the bows the bows happened energy dissipation with the owt fig 21 displays the internal energy time history curves and kinetic energy time history curves the kinetic energy was absorbed by the internal energy of the owt in the four scenarios for a b c d fenders the internal energy of the bows accounts for 3 03 4 44 1 29 2 70 of the kinetic energy respectively such the bows under b fender have more internal energy than others because the bows collision mainly results in the local damage of the owt which often have plastic deformation therefore the bows keep less internal energy and b fender have absorbed the most internal energy the ship displacement internal energy is shown in fig 22 as the internal energy increases to its maximum 1 66 mj of a 0 91 mj of b 2 17 mj of c 1 89 mj of d the curve begins to fall and grow backwards the collision response of the ship bows model and the four scenarios are compared in fig 23 as can be seen the ship bows have different von mises stress responses in various fender collision scenarios at 0 3 s 0 6s 0 9s 1 2s see fig 8 this can be observed when bow contacted the owt the stress first reached 8 937e 06 of b 2 015e 07 of a 2 488e 07 of c 2 019e 07 of d and then the energy exchange with respect to increasing deformation meanwhile the stress of bows extends from a small area to a large area the fender improves the ship bows damage resistance and the most of stress has been absorbed by the fender which one of the most energy absorbing characteristics is fender b 5 the basic analysis of cor in order to further analyze the deformation generation and evolution process of the material of fenders during the collision the influence of the geometry on the characteristics of spring back is analyzed with cor as the reference quantity the three different size of rubber fenders were chosen to study cor its outer diameter and thickness are 1 d 7 7 m h 1 35 m 2 d 7 9 m h 1 45 m 3 d 8 1 m h 1 55 m respectively which with respect to the thickness diameter ratio l r η r d 2 η 1 0 35 η 2 0 367 η 3 0 383 5 1 the deformation process comparison the case of 2500 tons head on different size fenders are simulated by ls dyna and give the three η with respect to varying degree of deformation at 4 m s ship fig 24 depicts the four time 0 3s 0 4s 0 5s 0 6s fig 24 shows the deformation process of collision at three η it can be found that the degree of deformation increases continuously along with the time rises which illustrates the enlargement of η at same velocity does not affect the degree of deformation meanwhile the η 1 0 35 initial velocity of 2 4 6 8 m s are as shown in fig 25 it can be found that the degree deformation of the fender increases along with the initial velocity rises which illustrates the plastic deformation have an enlargement 5 2 the effect of initial velocity of ship the energy conversion occurs in the fender when the collision process from contact and lost fig 26 illustrates the relationship of the velocity and cor the coefficient of restitution of the three fenders changes with initial velocity is given it can be seen that when the initial velocity is very small it can be considered that the fender collides with ship elastically the cor of the three fenders is 0 65 as the initial velocity increases the cor decreases continuously and the downward trend has a significant change when the initial velocity approaches 4 m s the reason is that the different failure modes are converted so that the plastic hinge dissipates more energy at the same time it can be found that the cor of the three fenders are basically the same as the collision velocity which indicates that the main factor of the structural cor is the initial velocity not the geometric parameters of the structure thickness to diameter ratio 6 cost of the aluminum foam and rubber cost analysis is an economic evaluation technique for comparing the cost paid to the gained benefit for the purpose of evaluation rubber and aluminum foam the demand relationship of natural rubber can reflect a country s level of industrialization industrialized countries such as the united states and japan are major consumers of natural rubber in the context of global manufacturing transfer and structural optimization and upgrading china has replaced the united states as the world s largest consumer of natural rubber since 2001 average comprehensive cost for 1996 2001 was about 10 016 rmb t 9 614 rmb t and 9 284 rmb t respectively in different regions in china yunnan province and hainan province as the main production areas of natural rubber provide the cost data of natural rubber in 2014 2017 the average annual price of private natural rubber was 11 611 rmb t and the highest was 14 443 rmb t see table 10 table 11 compared to rubber aluminum foam is also used in fender in general it is the best way to commercialize foamed aluminum by adding foaming agent however the high cost of foaming agent leads to an increase in the price of aluminum foam which limits the commercialization of aluminum foam material on one hand various manufacturing methods are used to produce aluminum foam for different application areas and different performances on the other hand under the specifications of aluminum foam size the price of aluminum foam is based on the square of it and the price changes with thickness accordingly therefore the price of aluminum foam is presented in table 12 from the economic point of view rubber material is more economical than aluminum foam material from the aspect of material structural characteristics the structural rigidity impact resistance and vibration absorption and energy absorption characteristics of aluminum foam material are more excellent 7 conclusions in this paper a comprehension evaluation and comparison of the anti collision performance of fender and owt s response is carried out in the case of a head on collision between ship and tripod and four types of fenders are taken into account rubber aluminum rubber aluminum foam and aluminum foam rubber fender ansys ls dyna a commercial finite element package is employed for impact analysis the energy changes of the ship owt collision system are investigated firstly with the comparison of kinetic energy and internal energy the aluminum foam fender have good protective properties during post collision in the following part this paper analyses the collision force initial energy von mises stress the bending moment of the fender plastic strain and the maximum acceleration of owt by comparing the above parameters it is found that the b fender gives the minimum collision force von mises stress the bending moment of the fender plastic strain and the maximum acceleration as well as maximum initial energy among the four when four types of fenders are subjected to high collision energy the effective factors are considered in the simulation in order to evaluate the anti collision fenders accurately furthermore the thickness and position of aluminum foam in the fender have a bearing on the anti collision of fender and the aluminum foam of the fender not only makes the tripod less vulnerable to damage but also avoids severe damage to the ship caused by the occurrence of secondary disasters besides the cor is discussed by two opinions about geometric parameters of the structure and the initial velocity it implies that the initial velocity depends on the cor the results and the analysis in the paper for crashworthiness performance of the fender are very valuable declaration
