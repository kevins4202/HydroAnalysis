under four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps by downscaling the cmip6 outputs using a new scale based downscaling method which integrated the gwr ked method and time transfer matrices by linking the precipitation in the historical and future periods new hydrological insights compared with the original cmip6 outputs the downscaled precipitation predictions exhibited large improvements with mean absolute errors maes improved by a range of 37 49 66 81 and 74 95 75 38 on the seasonal and annual scale respectively the downscaled projections showed that the basin would be wetter at the annual scale during the next 80 years precipitation in spring would be increase over the entire basin under all future scenarios except ssp1 2 6 parts of the pl basin exhibit drier trends under the four

precipitation in winter shows a drying trend in some areas except in the ssp1 2 6 scenario with the largest area occurring in ssp5 8 5 the results provide improved precipitation information for policy making in water resource management and adaptation planning to mitigate yangtze river floods in the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords precipitation change cmip6 scenarios downscaling poyang lake basin 1 introduction precipitation as a key parameter influencing regional flooding drought and sustainable development exhibits strong spatial temporal heterogeneity under global climate change assessing the variability of future precipitation is essential to understand the climate change impacts on a range of natural and socioeconomic systems liu et al 2016 khan et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the latest outputs of the coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 models based on a new set of possible alternative future scenarios can be used for this purpose with improved spatial specificity and less uncertainty in annual and seasonal precipitation compared with the cmip5 projections lehner et al 2020 xin et al 2020 rivera and arnould 2020 however direct application of the data from cmip6 models is inadequate due to the limited representation of spatial detail on local scales which cannot reflect some geographical and topographical features this problem can be effectively solved by using a proper downscaling method an important procedure for obtaining climate change projections at regional scales the methods of downscaling are usually classified into two main categories dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling tang et al 2016 roux et al 2018 dynamical downscaling can be achieved using a regional climate model and has a complicated design and expensive computational cost soltanzadeh et al 2017 roux et al 2018 statistical downscaling considered a more practical technique due to less computational effort involves establishing quantitative relationships between large scale variables predictands and local parameters predictors benestad et al 2008 the most commonly used statistical downscaling methods are based on some functions such as linear and nonlinear regressions artificial neural networks and bayesian based frameworks vu et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 these kinds of methods are performed in an observational calibration period and then applied to give future scenarios at local scales after verification within independent subperiods ayar et al 2016 tabari et al 2021 however due to the large gap between the present and future scenarios for natural and human systems the methods developed in the historical period may not be applicable for the future this study is motivated by a desire to develop an effective scale based downscaling model by integrating projected and recorded precipitation data through a time transfer matrix to identify precipitation changes in the poyang lake pl basin pl the largest freshwater lake in china retains the direct connection to the yangtze river yr with a seasonal and reverse flow pattern and plays a crucial role for yr flood mitigation and ecological conservation it is necessary to investigate future precipitation changes over the pl basin as its importance for both the local area and the middle and lower reaches of the yr basin hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 the strong inter annual variability has been identified as the most striking feature of precipitation over the pl basin guo et al 2020 this paper aims to investigate the spatial and temporal inter annual variations in precipitation at seasonal and annual time scales from 2020 to 2100 by proposing a scale based downscaling method first a spatial downscaling method based on a local regression method and residual correction algorithm was established in the pl basin for the historical period 1980 2014 second a time transfer matrix was defined and a scale based downscaling method was developed this method was then validated by using precipitation data in the period 2015 2019 under four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps third precipitation variations during 2020 2100 under the four scenarios were obtained at 1 km 1 km spatial resolution by applying the proposed scale based downscaling method to cmip6 outputs the rest of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the study area and the data section 3 describes the scale based downscaling method for future scenarios in the pl basin section 4 shows the results and section 5 gives the conclusions 2 study area and data the pl basin plays a crucial role in mitigating and controlling flood water in the middle and lower reaches of the yr in china with runoff of 14 53 108 m3 accounting for approximately 16 of the total runoff of the yr fig 1 the elevation of the pl basin ranges from 2200 m in high mountainous areas in the north to approximately 30 m with wide alluvial plains surrounding the lake which are important crop growing regions due to the impact of the southeast monsoon climate the annual total precipitation in pl basin is over 1300 mm with notable inter seasonal variations guo et al 2020 the surface area and water level of pl are altered conspicuously with the season due to the topographic characteristics and variations in the discharges of the rivers that flow into it it has been reported that pl basin has tended to shrink in recent decades because of escalated human activities and changing climate which further influence its flood storage capacity and flood hazard risk in the yr basin zhang et al 2014 hence the projection of future variations in precipitation is essential for addressing a range of issues in context of water conservation ecological recovery and sustainable development in both pl and yr basins a total of 285 meteorological observations located in the pl basin and its surrounding areas were obtained from the national meteorological information center the stations were subject to strict quality control procedures by applying rhtests software https githhub com eccc cdas rhtests to detect and adjust for multiple change points that could exist in the data series finally data from 278 stations with consistent and missing data less than 1 remained for further analysis the stations follow a relatively uniform distribution with 91 stations located in pl basin fig 1 the historical 1980 2014 precipitation estimates and future 2015 2100 projections were obtained from the cmip6 multi models table 1 the output of each gcm was interpolated to 1 1 by using the bilinear method the final estimate was yielded by computing the mean value of the gcm models the future precipitation variations over the pl basin were investigated under four ssp rcp scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 ssp3 7 0 a new scenario filling in the gaps in cmip5 hausfather 2018 charlotte et al 2019 and other three represent the updates of the rcp scenarios in cmip5 the monthly precipitation for the period of 1980 2014 was used to establish the spatial downscaling method while the data for the period of 2015 2019 were adopted to develop the time transfer matrix under different scenarios finally the established scale based downscaling method was validated during the period of 2015 2019 and was then applied to project the future precipitation scenarios from 2020 to 2100 3 method to investigate the inter annual and inter seasonal precipitation changes with high accuracy we designed a two step downscaling method in this study first the cmip6 outputs during the historical period of 1980 2014 were downscaled in the pl basin by applying the geographical weighted regression method gwr together with a residual correction technique using kriging with external drift ked second by combining a time transfer matrix the downscaling method gwr ked was used to downscale the precipitation in the future scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 for the period of 2015 2019 this established scale based downscaling method was validated by using meteorological observations for the period 2015 2019 and was finally applied to downscale precipitation for future projections 2020 2100 3 1 downscaling precipitation in the historical period for the statistical downscaling method an accurate exploration of the relationship between precipitation and its predictors is crucial to obtain high accuracy downscaled results other than the atmosphere ocean land interactions the topographic structure and the pl shape a complex and regionally variable precipitation climate in the study area a spatial variable relationship could be more suitable for obtaining improved precipitation information in the pl basin which can be constructed as follows 1 c m i p 6 t 0 s t β o s t β i s t x i s t ε s t where x i s t with i 1 2 n represents the influencing factors at spatial location s at time t spring summer autumn winter and annual β o s t is the intercept is the corresponding coefficient of x i s t and ε s t is the residual of the regression method relationship 1 can be implemented by applying the widely used gwr method which is a local spatial statistical method designed to address spatial non stationarity brunsdon et al 1996 many studies have demonstrated that this regression method combined with the residual correction algorithm can obtain improved results as the precipitation variability may not be fully explained by the regression method alone alexakis and tsanis 2016 zhao et al 2018 sharifi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the bias of the gwr method ε s t at the meteorological stations was corrected and interpolated by using the ked method with local explanatory variables in this study in addition it is critical to identify the most influential factors in the regression method the precipitation values in the central and adjacent coarse grid cells are considered as the most likely important predictors he et al 2016 topographical and geographical factors including altitude slope aspect relief and distance to the sea were also employed to explore their interactions with precipitation by using the gwr method in addition the significant relationship between the seasonal precipitation and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi had been well demonstrated kang et al 2014 chen et al 2020 the most influential factors were selected in this study by using the stepwise regression method in each time period 3 2 establishing scale based downscaling method based on the gwr ked downscaling method we finally obtained high spatial resolution precipitation data in future scenarios by using a time transfer matrix which can be constructed as follows 2 c i j pr e t i s j pr e t 0 where is the time transfer matrix at time i in scenario j pr e t 0 represents the cmip6 gcm simulations in the historical period 1980 2014 pr e t i s j is the cmip6 outputs at the future time period i in scenario j i 1 2 3 4 represents the periods of 2015 2019 2020 2049 2050 2079 2080 2100 respectively and j 1 2 3 4 represents the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively after interpolating c i j from 1 to 0 01 by using a simple bilinear method the downscaling method for future scenarios can be given as 3 c m i p 6 t i c i j c m i p 6 t 0 similar to the process reported by huffman et al 2007 eq 3 was established based on the assumption that before and after spatial downscaling the ratio of future scenarios to historical precipitation remains unchanged here c m i p 6 t 0 represents the downscaled result yielded from eq 1 in the historical period t 0 3 3 validation the ten fold cross validation strategy was employed for model evaluation roberts et al 2017 watson et al 2019 the data were randomly divided into ten non overlapping equal subsets nine sets were used to train the method while the rest subset was used to test the performance of the method this process was repeated ten times to ensure that each observation was validated the accuracy measurements including root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were calculated by averaging the error indicators produced from the ten tests 4 r m s e i 1 n y y 2 n 5 m a e i 1 n y y n where y i is the ith observation at the point x i y i y i is the estimated value and n represents the number of test points 4 results 4 1 model evaluation 4 1 1 evaluation of the statistical downscaling method in the historical period of 1980 2014 the gwr method is frequently used for downscaling coarse precipitation datasets due to its ability to analyze the spatial non stationarity of the relationship between spatial variables and provide a more appropriate and accurate basis for the relationship modeling between spatial variables moreover several studies have shown that the residual corrections of gwr can yield improved results compared with the gwr method alone hutengs and vohland 2016 chen et al 2018 yue et al 2019 zhao 2021 by using interpolators combined with the station values the modified residuals were added back to the gwr results the performance of different interpolators including ordinary kriging ok ked inverse distance weighted method idw and spline were first compared based on the values of mae and rmse table 2 elevation relief distance to the sea ndvi and the precipitation values in the central and adjacent coarse grid cells are considered in the gwr method and local evaluation aspect and slope were used as the auxiliary variables in ked the results showed that using the residual correction improves the seasonal and annual precipitation fields models generated with the help of auxiliary variables gave more accurate results and methods including gwr ok gwr idw and gwr spline which consider only the residual value at the stations performed worse than gwr ked with secondary data the inclusion of residual corrections with local auxiliary information improves precipitation predictions therefore the gwr ked was used as the primary downscaling method in this study the gwr ked based statistical downscaling method was applied to downscale the cmip6 products to a 1 km resolution during the period of 1980 2014 fig 2 compares the original cmip6 products and the downscaling results revealing that all the downscaling precipitation fields show similar spatial patterns and distributions to the original cmip6 outputs yet the former has more detailed precipitation information than the later since the addition of the fine scale explanatory variables in the downscaling process significant differences in the spatial patterns of precipitation can be observed in different time periods the mean differences between the original cmip6 outputs and the downscaling results in the pl basin were 13 55 mm 34 81 mm 40 58 mm 13 47 mm and 4 72 mm at the annual spring summer autumn and winter scales respectively table 3 further gives the accuracy of the downscaling results indicating that the error of the downscaling results was reduced by 60 30 60 69 19 59 52 01 and 75 30 for spring summer autumn winter and annually respectively based on mae the errors at the spring summer winter and annual scales notably reduced while in autumn the errors decreased by 19 59 and 23 37 based on mae and rmse values respectively 4 1 2 evaluation of the scale based downscaling method in the validation period of 2015 2019 the final established scale based downscaling method was validated during the period 2015 2019 under the four scenarios figs 3 and 4 display the downscaling results in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios as examples like the downscaling results in the historical period the downscaled precipitation fields exhibit similar spatial patterns to the original cmip6 outputs but show more detailed information the spatial patterns exhibit significant differences in the two scenarios by comparing with the precipitation distributions in the period 1980 2014 especially at the winter and annual scales precipitation at the annual scale generally exhibited decreasing trends from east to west in the period of 1980 2014 with values ranging from 1193 18 mm 1651 27 mm while precipitation showed north south spatial patterns with maximum precipitation occurring in the central region under ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 with annual precipitation amounts ranging from 988 11 mm 1505 56 mm and 1087 00 mm 1408 46 mm respectively precipitation at the winter scale exhibited a west east spatial pattern changing from 129 39 mm to 236 07 mm and 100 47 244 50 mm in the historical and validation periods in the ssp2 4 5 scenario respectively while precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario shows a south north distribution with values changing from 112 26 mm to 202 21 mm although the north south distributions were observed in both the historical and validation periods in autumn precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario displays a larger difference than that in the other two scenarios the precipitation amounts in autumn range from 143 72 mm to 233 11 mm 114 05 300 05 mm 53 71 333 48 mm for the historical period and ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios in the validation period respectively precipitation in summer showed an increasing pattern from north to south in the historical period and validation period under the two scenarios while precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario exhibited a larger difference with most of the regions having values changing between 500 mm 550 mm in spring precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario also showed significant differences compared with the other two scenarios fig 4 a and the rainfall belt had maximum values ranging from 400 mm to 450 mm while the maximum rain belts changed from 450 mm to 500 mm under ssp2 4 5 and the historical period precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario shows a larger difference than that in the other scenarios these obvious differences provide a basis for assessing the variations in precipitation in the future since the precipitation change analyses at fine scales were based on the scale based downscaling method more importantly the uncertainty of precipitation change in future scenarios is also based on the accuracy of the scale based downscaling method established in the validation period under different scenarios the accuracy of the scale based downscaling method is listed in table 4 the downscaling accuracy varies with different time scales in spring the downscaled precipitation field with the highest accuracy was observed under the ssp1 2 6 scenario with mae and rmse values of 72 81 mm and 83 76 mm respectively according to the mae values the downscaling accuracy in spring improved by 57 22 61 39 59 39 and 59 30 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively the precipitation field with the highest accuracy was produced under the ssp3 7 0 scenario in summer with mae and rmse values of 69 81 mm and 72 17 mm respectively however in summer the downscaled method performed the best under the ssp1 2 6 scenario with mae and rmse reduced by 66 81 and 67 15 respectively compared with the original cmip6 outputs in addition the accuracy of precipitation in summer improved by 62 96 55 26 and 59 25 under the other three scenarios respectively based on mae values in autumn the mae values decreased by 42 96 42 71 37 49 and 47 04 under the four scenarios respectively compared with the original cmip6 products the precipitation field with the highest accuracy occurred under the ssp3 7 0 scenario with mae and rmse values of 47 10 mm and 51 96 mm respectively in winter the error of the downscaled precipitation field decreased by 42 06 39 12 42 15 and 45 15 under the four shared socioeconomic pathways respectively compared with the cmip6 datasets and a high accuracy precipitation field was found in the ssp5 8 5 scenario with mae and rmse values of 43 32 mm and 46 68 mm respectively in terms of the mae value the accuracy of annual precipitation improved by 75 20 74 95 75 08 and 75 38 under the four scenarios respectively in addition compared with the seasonal scales the accuracy of precipitation at annual scales improved the most in other words the scale based downscaling method performs the best at the annual scale followed by summer and spring which both have relatively large amounts of precipitation moreover the time transfer matrix did not introduce large errors in the final downscaling results based on tables 3 and 4 particularly for the results in autumn where the scale based downscaling method performed better in the validation period than the gwr ked method that was carried out in the historical period 4 2 future precipitation trends in the pl basin the scale based downscaled method was then applied for the cmip6 outputs under the four scenarios table 4 shows the error levels in different scenarios by using the scale based downscaling method under these error levels the precipitation changes in future scenarios are given for the future period of 2020 2100 the future precipitation trends were obtained by using the well known mann kendall statistical test and sen s slope chatterjee et al 2016 under the ssp1 2 6 scenario fig 5 72 68 of the pl basin would be drier in spring with a maximum decreasing change rate of 0 77 mm year the maximum change rate of precipitation in spring was 0 75 mm

06 mm year to 0 82 mm year with a mean change rate of 0 38 mm year fig 5 c in winter precipitation would increase by 0 47 mm year on average with a maximum rising rate of 0 59 mm year and a rate of maximum reduction of 0 20 mm year in the west and east occupying by 36 13 of the pl basin precipitation changes occurred at rates of greater than 0 5 mm year fig 5 d the annual precipitation increases from 0 30 mm year to 2 95 mm year across the whole study area with the maximum changing rate occurring in the south the average changing rate of annual precipitation is 1 32 mm year for the whole basin fig 5 e under the ssp2 4 5 scenario the entire pl basin would be wetter in spring with precipitation increasing at a rate of 0 85 mm year on average the minimum and maximum increasing rates were 0 44 mm year and 1 00 mm year respectively and 56 24 of the total area showed a wetting trend with an increasing rate greater than 0 85 mm year fig 6 a in summer 62 32 of the pl basin would be drier and precipitation would decrease at a rate of 0 02 mm year the increasing trends mainly occurred in the south with a maximum increasing rate of 0 62 mm year in autumn precipitation exhibits increasing trends in the south and decreasing trends in the west with a maximum change rate of 0 89 mm year and a minimum change rate of 0 21 mm year a total of 80 04 of the total study area would be wetter and the regional average change rate was 0 25 mm year fig 6 c in winter 69 56 of the total basin would be wetter the precipitation change ranges from 0 17 mm year in the east to 0 13 mm year in the west and 66 18 of the region exhibits increasing trends with rates between 0 and 1 mm year the annual precipitation increases across the whole basin at rates of 1 14 1 64 mm per year fig 6 e under the ssp3 7 0 scenario the entire pl basin would be wetter in spring and precipitation would change at rates of 0 49 1 87 mm year with an average change rate of 1 18 mm year the maximum change rate occurred in the north while the minimum change rate occurred in the south fig 7 a in summer precipitation changes at rates of 0 17 1 54 mm year increases in the east and decreases in the west 97 18 of the total area would be wetter fig 7 b in autumn precipitation shows increasing trends across the whole study area with a maximum rising rate of 1 10 mm year occurring in the south and a minimum changing rate of 0 25 mm year occurring in the north fig 7 c in winter 47 47 of the pl basin would be wetter with a maximum changing rate of 0 48 mm year which occurred in the north decreases in precipitation would mainly occur in the southeastern part of the region with a maximum changing rate of 0 53 mm year fig 7 d the annual precipitation would increase at rates of 0 93 4 09 mm year across the whole area with a regional mean increasing rate of 2 25 mm year and precipitation in the north would increase the most fig 7 e under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the pl basin becomes wetter in spring and precipitation increases at rates of 0 80 1 61 mm year with a regional mean increasing rate of 1 24 mm year precipitation in the west increases the most fig 8 a in summer 52 58 of the total study area would be wetter and precipitation in the central region would decrease with a maximum changing rate of 0 5 mm year precipitation in the north would increase the most at a rate of 1 04 mm year fig 8 b in autumn the entire basin would be wetter and precipitation in the northwest would increase the most with a maximum changing rate of 0 93 mm year fig 8 c in winter 63 37 of the pl basin would be drier mainly located in the north precipitation in the south exhibits increasing trends with a maximum changing rate of 0 11 mm year fig 8 d the annual precipitation would increase across the whole region with a maximum changing rate of 3 26 mm year a minimum increasing rate of 1 00 mm year and a regional average increasing rate of 2 11 mm year fig 8 e in general precipitation in spring would be increase over the entire basin under all future scenarios except ssp1 2 6 and the largest regional average increasing trend occurs in ssp3 7 0 with an average changing rate of 1 18 mm year parts of the pl basin exhibit drier trends under the four scenarios in summer with the largest drying area occurring in the ssp2 4 5 scenario covering 62 32 of the entire basin in the ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 scenarios the regions with drying trends occur in the northern part while these regions occur in the western and central parts under ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively except in the ssp2 4 5 scenario precipitation in autumn has increasing trends in all scenarios across the study area with the largest increasing rate being 0 75 mm year on average precipitation in winter shows drying trends in some areas except in the ssp1 2 6 scenario with the largest area occurring in ssp5 8 5 occupying 63 37 of the total basin the annual precipitation exhibits increasing trends across the entire basin under the four scenarios with the largest rising rate of 2 25 mm year occurring in the ssp3 7 0 scenario 4 3 discussion to facilitate climate change adaptation strategies for planning and policy in the pl basin the cmip6 scenarios were downscaled by establishing a scale based downscaling method the basic downscaling method gwr ked was first developed in the historical period during 1980 2014 and then a scale based downscaling method was established by introducing a time transfer matrix in gwr ked to give the downscaling results for future scenarios this scale based downscaling method was first validated under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios for the 2015 2019 period using observations from 278 meteorological stations and then was used to downscale precipitation for the 2020 2100 period under the four scenarios the downscaling results for the period 2015 2019 show the extent to which the four downscaled scenarios can provide information with high accuracy to facilitate regional and local planning in the pl basin during the next 80 years in spring the maes for precipitation showed a 57 22 61 39 59 39 and 59 30 improvement under the four scenarios respectively the accuracy of precipitation in summer improved by 66 81 62 49 55 26 and 59 25 under the four scenarios respectively based on the mae values in autumn the mae values decreased by 42 96 42 71 37 49 and 47 04 respectively compared with the original cmip6 products the accuracy of the downscaled precipitation field in winter improved by 42 06 39 12 42 15 and 45 15 and the accuracy of annual precipitation improved by 75 20 74 95 75 08 and 75 38 under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively the downscaling method developed in the historical period gwr ked showed good performance at the spring summer winter and annual scales but performed relatively worse in autumn during the period 1980 2014 table 3 this could be due to the high accuracy of the original cmip6 outputs in autumn and the ignorance of some important explanatory variables which will be investigated further the scale based downscaling method applied in the period 2015 2019 showed a relatively similar performance to the gwr ked method but performed better than gwr ked in autumn table 4 which indicated that the introduction of the time transfer matrix in the scale based downscaling method did not produce large additional errors in the downscaling process in this study to reduce the inflation maraun 2013 the ked method associating observations and local predictors was applied to correct the bias produced by gwr method except for the systematic measuring errors from the meteorological observations the main factors that influence the accuracy could lie in the explanatory variables in the gwr ked method more predictors such as some meteorological elements could generate more accurate results although introducing a large computational cost in addition to the considered auxiliary variables in this research other factors affecting local precipitation should be taken into account in future studies furthermore it has been demonstrated that although precipitation increases as the elevation increases its value reaches a peak and decreases after a certain threshold which should be taken into account in the gwr ked method especially in the northern mountainous area in the basin for daily precipitation in future research the downscaling method should be conducted not only in the horizontal direction but also in the vertical direction by considering the terrain effect at a daily scale 5 conclusion a new framework for downscaling future coarse scale precipitation using the gwr ked together with time transfer matrices was proposed in this study quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the results exhibited that the developed method can capture the improved fine scale spatiotemporal specificity and reduced the uncertainty bolstered by the improvement produced by the scale based gwr ked method we predicted precipitation variations under the four scenarios for the 2020 2100 period the results show that the pl basin in spring would be wetter under ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 and 72 86 of the total basin would be drier under the ssp1 2 6 scenario ssp3 7 0 shows the largest increase followed by the ssp5 8 5 scenario compared to other scenarios ssp2 4 5 exhibits the largest areas with a drying trend in summer occupying 62 30 of the entire basin followed by the ssp5 8 5 scenario 47 42 the basin would be wetter in ssp3 7 0 and 82 9 of the area would be wetter in the ssp1 2 6 scenario in summer except for ssp2 4 5 the pl basin would be wetter under all scenarios in autumn and precipitation would have the largest increase under the ssp5 8 5 scenario followed by the ssp3 7 0 scenario in winter precipitation would increase in the pl basin under ssp1 2 6 while precipitation would decrease in some areas under the other three scenarios led by ssp5 8 5 for which 60 of the entire basin would be drier in addition the annual precipitation would increase under the four scenarios with average increasing rates of 1 32 mm year 1 34 mm year 2 25 mm year and 2 11 mm year respectively these gradually evolving precipitation trends will provide useful information for policy making in water resource management and play a critical role in mitigating

scenarios in summer with the largest drying area occurring in the ssp2 4 5 scenario except in the ssp2 4 5 scenario precipitation in autumn has increasing trends in all scenarios across the pl basin precipitation in winter shows a drying trend in some areas except in the ssp1 2 6 scenario with the largest area occurring in ssp5 8 5 the results provide improved precipitation information for policy making in water resource management and adaptation planning to mitigate yangtze river floods in the future graphical abstract ga1 keywords precipitation change cmip6 scenarios downscaling poyang lake basin 1 introduction precipitation as a key parameter influencing regional flooding drought and sustainable development exhibits strong spatial temporal heterogeneity under global climate change assessing the variability of future precipitation is essential to understand the climate change impacts on a range of natural and socioeconomic systems liu et al 2016 khan et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the latest outputs of the coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 models based on a new set of possible alternative future scenarios can be used for this purpose with improved spatial specificity and less uncertainty in annual and seasonal precipitation compared with the cmip5 projections lehner et al 2020 xin et al 2020 rivera and arnould 2020 however direct application of the data from cmip6 models is inadequate due to the limited representation of spatial detail on local scales which cannot reflect some geographical and topographical features this problem can be effectively solved by using a proper downscaling method an important procedure for obtaining climate change projections at regional scales the methods of downscaling are usually classified into two main categories dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling tang et al 2016 roux et al 2018 dynamical downscaling can be achieved using a regional climate model and has a complicated design and expensive computational cost soltanzadeh et al 2017 roux et al 2018 statistical downscaling considered a more practical technique due to less computational effort involves establishing quantitative relationships between large scale variables predictands and local parameters predictors benestad et al 2008 the most commonly used statistical downscaling methods are based on some functions such as linear and nonlinear regressions artificial neural networks and bayesian based frameworks vu et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 these kinds of methods are performed in an observational calibration period and then applied to give future scenarios at local scales after verification within independent subperiods ayar et al 2016 tabari et al 2021 however due to the large gap between the present and future scenarios for natural and human systems the methods developed in the historical period may not be applicable for the future this study is motivated by a desire to develop an effective scale based downscaling model by integrating projected and recorded precipitation data through a time transfer matrix to identify precipitation changes in the poyang lake pl basin pl the largest freshwater lake in china retains the direct connection to the yangtze river yr with a seasonal and reverse flow pattern and plays a crucial role for yr flood mitigation and ecological conservation it is necessary to investigate future precipitation changes over the pl basin as its importance for both the local area and the middle and lower reaches of the yr basin hu et al 2007 zhang et al 2016 the strong inter annual variability has been identified as the most striking feature of precipitation over the pl basin guo et al 2020 this paper aims to investigate the spatial and temporal inter annual variations in precipitation at seasonal and annual time scales from 2020 to 2100 by proposing a scale based downscaling method first a spatial downscaling method based on a local regression method and residual correction algorithm was established in the pl basin for the historical period 1980 2014 second a time transfer matrix was defined and a scale based downscaling method was developed this method was then validated by using precipitation data in the period 2015 2019 under four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps third precipitation variations during 2020 2100 under the four scenarios were obtained at 1 km 1 km spatial resolution by applying the proposed scale based downscaling method to cmip6 outputs the rest of the paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the study area and the data section 3 describes the scale based downscaling method for future scenarios in the pl basin section 4 shows the results and section 5 gives the conclusions 2 study area and data the pl basin plays a crucial role in mitigating and controlling flood water in the middle and lower reaches of the yr in china with runoff of 14 53 108 m3 accounting for approximately 16 of the total runoff of the yr fig 1 the elevation of the pl basin ranges from 2200 m in high mountainous areas in the north to approximately 30 m with wide alluvial plains surrounding the lake which are important crop growing regions due to the impact of the southeast monsoon climate the annual total precipitation in pl basin is over 1300 mm with notable inter seasonal variations guo et al 2020 the surface area and water level of pl are altered conspicuously with the season due to the topographic characteristics and variations in the discharges of the rivers that flow into it it has been reported that pl basin has tended to shrink in recent decades because of escalated human activities and changing climate which further influence its flood storage capacity and flood hazard risk in the yr basin zhang et al 2014 hence the projection of future variations in precipitation is essential for addressing a range of issues in context of water conservation ecological recovery and sustainable development in both pl and yr basins a total of 285 meteorological observations located in the pl basin and its surrounding areas were obtained from the national meteorological information center the stations were subject to strict quality control procedures by applying rhtests software https githhub com eccc cdas rhtests to detect and adjust for multiple change points that could exist in the data series finally data from 278 stations with consistent and missing data less than 1 remained for further analysis the stations follow a relatively uniform distribution with 91 stations located in pl basin fig 1 the historical 1980 2014 precipitation estimates and future 2015 2100 projections were obtained from the cmip6 multi models table 1 the output of each gcm was interpolated to 1 1 by using the bilinear method the final estimate was yielded by computing the mean value of the gcm models the future precipitation variations over the pl basin were investigated under four ssp rcp scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 ssp3 7 0 a new scenario filling in the gaps in cmip5 hausfather 2018 charlotte et al 2019 and other three represent the updates of the rcp scenarios in cmip5 the monthly precipitation for the period of 1980 2014 was used to establish the spatial downscaling method while the data for the period of 2015 2019 were adopted to develop the time transfer matrix under different scenarios finally the established scale based downscaling method was validated during the period of 2015 2019 and was then applied to project the future precipitation scenarios from 2020 to 2100 3 method to investigate the inter annual and inter seasonal precipitation changes with high accuracy we designed a two step downscaling method in this study first the cmip6 outputs during the historical period of 1980 2014 were downscaled in the pl basin by applying the geographical weighted regression method gwr together with a residual correction technique using kriging with external drift ked second by combining a time transfer matrix the downscaling method gwr ked was used to downscale the precipitation in the future scenarios ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 for the period of 2015 2019 this established scale based downscaling method was validated by using meteorological observations for the period 2015 2019 and was finally applied to downscale precipitation for future projections 2020 2100 3 1 downscaling precipitation in the historical period for the statistical downscaling method an accurate exploration of the relationship between precipitation and its predictors is crucial to obtain high accuracy downscaled results other than the atmosphere ocean land interactions the topographic structure and the pl shape a complex and regionally variable precipitation climate in the study area a spatial variable relationship could be more suitable for obtaining improved precipitation information in the pl basin which can be constructed as follows 1 c m i p 6 t 0 s t β o s t β i s t x i s t ε s t where x i s t with i 1 2 n represents the influencing factors at spatial location s at time t spring summer autumn winter and annual β o s t is the intercept is the corresponding coefficient of x i s t and ε s t is the residual of the regression method relationship 1 can be implemented by applying the widely used gwr method which is a local spatial statistical method designed to address spatial non stationarity brunsdon et al 1996 many studies have demonstrated that this regression method combined with the residual correction algorithm can obtain improved results as the precipitation variability may not be fully explained by the regression method alone alexakis and tsanis 2016 zhao et al 2018 sharifi et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the bias of the gwr method ε s t at the meteorological stations was corrected and interpolated by using the ked method with local explanatory variables in this study in addition it is critical to identify the most influential factors in the regression method the precipitation values in the central and adjacent coarse grid cells are considered as the most likely important predictors he et al 2016 topographical and geographical factors including altitude slope aspect relief and distance to the sea were also employed to explore their interactions with precipitation by using the gwr method in addition the significant relationship between the seasonal precipitation and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi had been well demonstrated kang et al 2014 chen et al 2020 the most influential factors were selected in this study by using the stepwise regression method in each time period 3 2 establishing scale based downscaling method based on the gwr ked downscaling method we finally obtained high spatial resolution precipitation data in future scenarios by using a time transfer matrix which can be constructed as follows 2 c i j pr e t i s j pr e t 0 where is the time transfer matrix at time i in scenario j pr e t 0 represents the cmip6 gcm simulations in the historical period 1980 2014 pr e t i s j is the cmip6 outputs at the future time period i in scenario j i 1 2 3 4 represents the periods of 2015 2019 2020 2049 2050 2079 2080 2100 respectively and j 1 2 3 4 represents the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively after interpolating c i j from 1 to 0 01 by using a simple bilinear method the downscaling method for future scenarios can be given as 3 c m i p 6 t i c i j c m i p 6 t 0 similar to the process reported by huffman et al 2007 eq 3 was established based on the assumption that before and after spatial downscaling the ratio of future scenarios to historical precipitation remains unchanged here c m i p 6 t 0 represents the downscaled result yielded from eq 1 in the historical period t 0 3 3 validation the ten fold cross validation strategy was employed for model evaluation roberts et al 2017 watson et al 2019 the data were randomly divided into ten non overlapping equal subsets nine sets were used to train the method while the rest subset was used to test the performance of the method this process was repeated ten times to ensure that each observation was validated the accuracy measurements including root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were calculated by averaging the error indicators produced from the ten tests 4 r m s e i 1 n y y 2 n 5 m a e i 1 n y y n where y i is the ith observation at the point x i y i y i is the estimated value and n represents the number of test points 4 results 4 1 model evaluation 4 1 1 evaluation of the statistical downscaling method in the historical period of 1980 2014 the gwr method is frequently used for downscaling coarse precipitation datasets due to its ability to analyze the spatial non stationarity of the relationship between spatial variables and provide a more appropriate and accurate basis for the relationship modeling between spatial variables moreover several studies have shown that the residual corrections of gwr can yield improved results compared with the gwr method alone hutengs and vohland 2016 chen et al 2018 yue et al 2019 zhao 2021 by using interpolators combined with the station values the modified residuals were added back to the gwr results the performance of different interpolators including ordinary kriging ok ked inverse distance weighted method idw and spline were first compared based on the values of mae and rmse table 2 elevation relief distance to the sea ndvi and the precipitation values in the central and adjacent coarse grid cells are considered in the gwr method and local evaluation aspect and slope were used as the auxiliary variables in ked the results showed that using the residual correction improves the seasonal and annual precipitation fields models generated with the help of auxiliary variables gave more accurate results and methods including gwr ok gwr idw and gwr spline which consider only the residual value at the stations performed worse than gwr ked with secondary data the inclusion of residual corrections with local auxiliary information improves precipitation predictions therefore the gwr ked was used as the primary downscaling method in this study the gwr ked based statistical downscaling method was applied to downscale the cmip6 products to a 1 km resolution during the period of 1980 2014 fig 2 compares the original cmip6 products and the downscaling results revealing that all the downscaling precipitation fields show similar spatial patterns and distributions to the original cmip6 outputs yet the former has more detailed precipitation information than the later since the addition of the fine scale explanatory variables in the downscaling process significant differences in the spatial patterns of precipitation can be observed in different time periods the mean differences between the original cmip6 outputs and the downscaling results in the pl basin were 13 55 mm 34 81 mm 40 58 mm 13 47 mm and 4 72 mm at the annual spring summer autumn and winter scales respectively table 3 further gives the accuracy of the downscaling results indicating that the error of the downscaling results was reduced by 60 30 60 69 19 59 52 01 and 75 30 for spring summer autumn winter and annually respectively based on mae the errors at the spring summer winter and annual scales notably reduced while in autumn the errors decreased by 19 59 and 23 37 based on mae and rmse values respectively 4 1 2 evaluation of the scale based downscaling method in the validation period of 2015 2019 the final established scale based downscaling method was validated during the period 2015 2019 under the four scenarios figs 3 and 4 display the downscaling results in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios as examples like the downscaling results in the historical period the downscaled precipitation fields exhibit similar spatial patterns to the original cmip6 outputs but show more detailed information the spatial patterns exhibit significant differences in the two scenarios by comparing with the precipitation distributions in the period 1980 2014 especially at the winter and annual scales precipitation at the annual scale generally exhibited decreasing trends from east to west in the period of 1980 2014 with values ranging from 1193 18 mm 1651 27 mm while precipitation showed north south spatial patterns with maximum precipitation occurring in the central region under ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 with annual precipitation amounts ranging from 988 11 mm 1505 56 mm and 1087 00 mm 1408 46 mm respectively precipitation at the winter scale exhibited a west east spatial pattern changing from 129 39 mm to 236 07 mm and 100 47 244 50 mm in the historical and validation periods in the ssp2 4 5 scenario respectively while precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario shows a south north distribution with values changing from 112 26 mm to 202 21 mm although the north south distributions were observed in both the historical and validation periods in autumn precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario displays a larger difference than that in the other two scenarios the precipitation amounts in autumn range from 143 72 mm to 233 11 mm 114 05 300 05 mm 53 71 333 48 mm for the historical period and ssp2 4 5 and ssp3 7 0 scenarios in the validation period respectively precipitation in summer showed an increasing pattern from north to south in the historical period and validation period under the two scenarios while precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario exhibited a larger difference with most of the regions having values changing between 500 mm 550 mm in spring precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario also showed significant differences compared with the other two scenarios fig 4 a and the rainfall belt had maximum values ranging from 400 mm to 450 mm while the maximum rain belts changed from 450 mm to 500 mm under ssp2 4 5 and the historical period precipitation in the ssp3 7 0 scenario shows a larger difference than that in the other scenarios these obvious differences provide a basis for assessing the variations in precipitation in the future since the precipitation change analyses at fine scales were based on the scale based downscaling method more importantly the uncertainty of precipitation change in future scenarios is also based on the accuracy of the scale based downscaling method established in the validation period under different scenarios the accuracy of the scale based downscaling method is listed in table 4 the downscaling accuracy varies with different time scales in spring the downscaled precipitation field with the highest accuracy was observed under the ssp1 2 6 scenario with mae and rmse values of 72 81 mm and 83 76 mm respectively according to the mae values the downscaling accuracy in spring improved by 57 22 61 39 59 39 and 59 30 under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively the precipitation field with the highest accuracy was produced under the ssp3 7 0 scenario in summer with mae and rmse values of 69 81 mm and 72 17 mm respectively however in summer the downscaled method performed the best under the ssp1 2 6 scenario with mae and rmse reduced by 66 81 and 67 15 respectively compared with the original cmip6 outputs in addition the accuracy of precipitation in summer improved by 62 96 55 26 and 59 25 under the other three scenarios respectively based on mae values in autumn the mae values decreased by 42 96 42 71 37 49 and 47 04 under the four scenarios respectively compared with the original cmip6 products the precipitation field with the highest accuracy occurred under the ssp3 7 0 scenario with mae and rmse values of 47 10 mm and 51 96 mm respectively in winter the error of the downscaled precipitation field decreased by 42 06 39 12 42 15 and 45 15 under the four shared socioeconomic pathways respectively compared with the cmip6 datasets and a high accuracy precipitation field was found in the ssp5 8 5 scenario with mae and rmse values of 43 32 mm and 46 68 mm respectively in terms of the mae value the accuracy of annual precipitation improved by 75 20 74 95 75 08 and 75 38 under the four scenarios respectively in addition compared with the seasonal scales the accuracy of precipitation at annual scales improved the most in other words the scale based downscaling method performs the best at the annual scale followed by summer and spring which both have relatively large amounts of precipitation moreover the time transfer matrix did not introduce large errors in the final downscaling results based on tables 3 and 4 particularly for the results in autumn where the scale based downscaling method performed better in the validation period than the gwr ked method that was carried out in the historical period 4 2 future precipitation trends in the pl basin the scale based downscaled method was then applied for the cmip6 outputs under the four scenarios table 4 shows the error levels in different scenarios by using the scale based downscaling method under these error levels the precipitation changes in future scenarios are given for the future period of 2020 2100 the future precipitation trends were obtained by using the well known mann kendall statistical test and sen s slope chatterjee et al 2016 under the ssp1 2 6 scenario fig 5 72 68 of the pl basin would be drier in spring with a maximum decreasing change rate of 0 77 mm year the maximum change rate of precipitation in spring was 0 75 mm

06 mm year to 0 82 mm year with a mean change rate of 0 38 mm year fig 5 c in winter precipitation would increase by 0 47 mm year on average with a maximum rising rate of 0 59 mm year and a rate of maximum reduction of 0 20 mm year in the west and east occupying by 36 13 of the pl basin precipitation changes occurred at rates of greater than 0 5 mm year fig 5 d the annual precipitation increases from 0 30 mm year to 2 95 mm year across the whole study area with the maximum changing rate occurring in the south the average changing rate of annual precipitation is 1 32 mm year for the whole basin fig 5 e under the ssp2 4 5 scenario the entire pl basin would be wetter in spring with precipitation increasing at a rate of 0 85 mm year on average the minimum and maximum increasing rates were 0 44 mm year and 1 00 mm year respectively and 56 24 of the total area showed a wetting trend with an increasing rate greater than 0 85 mm year fig 6 a in summer 62 32 of the pl basin would be drier and precipitation would decrease at a rate of 0 02 mm year the increasing trends mainly occurred in the south with a maximum increasing rate of 0 62 mm year in autumn precipitation exhibits increasing trends in the south and decreasing trends in the west with a maximum change rate of 0 89 mm year and a minimum change rate of 0 21 mm year a total of 80 04 of the total study area would be wetter and the regional average change rate was 0 25 mm year fig 6 c in winter 69 56 of the total basin would be wetter the precipitation change ranges from 0 17 mm year in the east to 0 13 mm year in the west and 66 18 of the region exhibits increasing trends with rates between 0 and 1 mm year the annual precipitation increases across the whole basin at rates of 1 14 1 64 mm per year fig 6 e under the ssp3 7 0 scenario the entire pl basin would be wetter in spring and precipitation would change at rates of 0 49 1 87 mm year with an average change rate of 1 18 mm year the maximum change rate occurred in the north while the minimum change rate occurred in the south fig 7 a in summer precipitation changes at rates of 0 17 1 54 mm year increases in the east and decreases in the west 97 18 of the total area would be wetter fig 7 b in autumn precipitation shows increasing trends across the whole study area with a maximum rising rate of 1 10 mm year occurring in the south and a minimum changing rate of 0 25 mm year occurring in the north fig 7 c in winter 47 47 of the pl basin would be wetter with a maximum changing rate of 0 48 mm year which occurred in the north decreases in precipitation would mainly occur in the southeastern part of the region with a maximum changing rate of 0 53 mm year fig 7 d the annual precipitation would increase at rates of 0 93 4 09 mm year across the whole area with a regional mean increasing rate of 2 25 mm year and precipitation in the north would increase the most fig 7 e under the ssp5 8 5 scenario the pl basin becomes wetter in spring and precipitation increases at rates of 0 80 1 61 mm year with a regional mean increasing rate of 1 24 mm year precipitation in the west increases the most fig 8 a in summer 52 58 of the total study area would be wetter and precipitation in the central region would decrease with a maximum changing rate of 0 5 mm year precipitation in the north would increase the most at a rate of 1 04 mm year fig 8 b in autumn the entire basin would be wetter and precipitation in the northwest would increase the most with a maximum changing rate of 0 93 mm year fig 8 c in winter 63 37 of the pl basin would be drier mainly located in the north precipitation in the south exhibits increasing trends with a maximum changing rate of 0 11 mm year fig 8 d the annual precipitation would increase across the whole region with a maximum changing rate of 3 26 mm year a minimum increasing rate of 1 00 mm year and a regional average increasing rate of 2 11 mm year fig 8 e in general precipitation in spring would be increase over the entire basin under all future scenarios except ssp1 2 6 and the largest regional average increasing trend occurs in ssp3 7 0 with an average changing rate of 1 18 mm year parts of the pl basin exhibit drier trends under the four scenarios in summer with the largest drying area occurring in the ssp2 4 5 scenario covering 62 32 of the entire basin in the ssp1 2 6 and ssp2 4 5 scenarios the regions with drying trends occur in the northern part while these regions occur in the western and central parts under ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 respectively except in the ssp2 4 5 scenario precipitation in autumn has increasing trends in all scenarios across the study area with the largest increasing rate being 0 75 mm year on average precipitation in winter shows drying trends in some areas except in the ssp1 2 6 scenario with the largest area occurring in ssp5 8 5 occupying 63 37 of the total basin the annual precipitation exhibits increasing trends across the entire basin under the four scenarios with the largest rising rate of 2 25 mm year occurring in the ssp3 7 0 scenario 4 3 discussion to facilitate climate change adaptation strategies for planning and policy in the pl basin the cmip6 scenarios were downscaled by establishing a scale based downscaling method the basic downscaling method gwr ked was first developed in the historical period during 1980 2014 and then a scale based downscaling method was established by introducing a time transfer matrix in gwr ked to give the downscaling results for future scenarios this scale based downscaling method was first validated under the ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios for the 2015 2019 period using observations from 278 meteorological stations and then was used to downscale precipitation for the 2020 2100 period under the four scenarios the downscaling results for the period 2015 2019 show the extent to which the four downscaled scenarios can provide information with high accuracy to facilitate regional and local planning in the pl basin during the next 80 years in spring the maes for precipitation showed a 57 22 61 39 59 39 and 59 30 improvement under the four scenarios respectively the accuracy of precipitation in summer improved by 66 81 62 49 55 26 and 59 25 under the four scenarios respectively based on the mae values in autumn the mae values decreased by 42 96 42 71 37 49 and 47 04 respectively compared with the original cmip6 products the accuracy of the downscaled precipitation field in winter improved by 42 06 39 12 42 15 and 45 15 and the accuracy of annual precipitation improved by 75 20 74 95 75 08 and 75 38 under ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios respectively the downscaling method developed in the historical period gwr ked showed good performance at the spring summer winter and annual scales but performed relatively worse in autumn during the period 1980 2014 table 3 this could be due to the high accuracy of the original cmip6 outputs in autumn and the ignorance of some important explanatory variables which will be investigated further the scale based downscaling method applied in the period 2015 2019 showed a relatively similar performance to the gwr ked method but performed better than gwr ked in autumn table 4 which indicated that the introduction of the time transfer matrix in the scale based downscaling method did not produce large additional errors in the downscaling process in this study to reduce the inflation maraun 2013 the ked method associating observations and local predictors was applied to correct the bias produced by gwr method except for the systematic measuring errors from the meteorological observations the main factors that influence the accuracy could lie in the explanatory variables in the gwr ked method more predictors such as some meteorological elements could generate more accurate results although introducing a large computational cost in addition to the considered auxiliary variables in this research other factors affecting local precipitation should be taken into account in future studies furthermore it has been demonstrated that although precipitation increases as the elevation increases its value reaches a peak and decreases after a certain threshold which should be taken into account in the gwr ked method especially in the northern mountainous area in the basin for daily precipitation in future research the downscaling method should be conducted not only in the horizontal direction but also in the vertical direction by considering the terrain effect at a daily scale 5 conclusion a new framework for downscaling future coarse scale precipitation using the gwr ked together with time transfer matrices was proposed in this study quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the results exhibited that the developed method can capture the improved fine scale spatiotemporal specificity and reduced the uncertainty bolstered by the improvement produced by the scale based gwr ked method we predicted precipitation variations under the four scenarios for the 2020 2100 period the results show that the pl basin in spring would be wetter under ssp2 4 5 ssp3 7 0 and ssp5 8 5 and 72 86 of the total basin would be drier under the ssp1 2 6 scenario ssp3 7 0 shows the largest increase followed by the ssp5 8 5 scenario compared to other scenarios ssp2 4 5 exhibits the largest areas with a drying trend in summer occupying 62 30 of the entire basin followed by the ssp5 8 5 scenario 47 42 the basin would be wetter in ssp3 7 0 and 82 9 of the area would be wetter in the ssp1 2 6 scenario in summer except for ssp2 4 5 the pl basin would be wetter under all scenarios in autumn and precipitation would have the largest increase under the ssp5 8 5 scenario followed by the ssp3 7 0 scenario in winter precipitation would increase in the pl basin under ssp1 2 6 while precipitation would decrease in some areas under the other three scenarios led by ssp5 8 5 for which 60 of the entire basin would be drier in addition the annual precipitation would increase under the four scenarios with average increasing rates of 1 32 mm year 1 34 mm year 2 25 mm year and 2 11 mm year respectively these gradually evolving precipitation trends will provide useful information for policy making in water resource management and play a critical role in mitigating

direct outcomes of scarcity but also in measures of wellbeing fontana and elson 2014 gimelli et al 2018 several hours spent daily in collection and transportation of limited quantities of water can cause bodily and emotional distress especially among women anwar et al 2019 lu et al 2014 compromise personal hygiene crow and odaba 2010 and prevent pursuit of opportunities that can result in improved outcomes such as economic activities and education crow et al 2012 lund 2015 goes as far as claiming that societies where households have to devote substantial time and resources in securing access to water are almost always poor therefore hurdles in access to water where sacrifices in terms of time energy and expenses are disproportionately required from the poor and socially marginalized means that they are effectively discouraged from leading a desirable quality of life however at the same time water remains accessible for socioeconomically privileged populations of the same places who can utilize their financial privilege and power to buy appropriate available water or deploy expensive technologies to mitigate scarcity risks this pattern of vastly different degrees of access to water within a city and often even within a neighborhood is common to unequal societies in the global south categorized by wide socioeconomic disparities and power asymmetry between different groups of people and incapacitated urban water utilities that are unable to adequately serve its most vulnerable populations there is a dearth of analytical and evidence based studies that can quantify socioeconomic disparities in access to water lu et al 2014 especially in terms of costs vis à vis household income and water consumption gulyani et al 2005 charnley and durham 2010 emphasize that adding analytical approaches can help account for systems capacity bottlenecks and constraints in development as well as imbalances and endemic problems related to improper allocation of water prominent scholars in the fields of water justice harris et al 2013 2017 sultana 2018 socio hydrology lund 2015 wesselink et al 2017 and political ecology akhter 2017 swyngedouw et al 2002 have pointed out that the predominant academic literature in fields of urban water management urban hydrology and water governance that informs cities water plans is largely apolitical lund 2015 there is little acknowledgment of political social and ethnocultural dynamics which underscore important inequalities or the conditions that reproduce disparities and asymmetrical power relations in the setting of agendas and priorities related to water supply rendering large portions of the population parched for water even with an ample availability enqvist et al 2020 goldman 2007 even though ideas of water justice i e ensuring that every citizen especially the most vulnerable have achieved their right to water may have started to gain traction in formal debates most studies nonetheless maintain economistic individualistic or natural science framings of the issues in ways that make justice concerns appear to be secondary at best or at worst irrelevant as emphasized in a recent editorial highlighting this gap in hydrologic research too much and not enough 2021 engineering solutions to water problems are portrayed in elegant terms that may appear simple and make us feel better precisely because they ignore the messy institutions norms and processes that underlie our relationship as individuals and as a society with water coupled with this public discourse shaped by government narrative such as in policy frameworks and public briefings news media reports and forum discussions on urban water challenges in cities across the global south khan 2022 karachi facing acute water shortage sindh irrigation minister geo tv 2022 mumbai corporators across party lines raise water shortage issue 2021 ioris 2016 collyns 2015 focuses predominantly on the materiality of systems with a myopically focused narrative of water shortages harris et al 2017 this water scarcity narrative continues to serve as a powerful excuse for debt laden water infrastructure projects that end up addressing a very limited portion of the overall population without sufficiently focusing on mechanisms to ensure access to available water budds and mcgranahan 2003 a focus on social ecological justice in urban water management where scarcity is seen beyond being a mere physical insufficiency of resources and manifestly connected with the scarcity of socioeconomic deprivation and political influence is crucial to strengthen responsible institutions and develop water resilient systems lund 2015 considering the magnitude of water crisis situations faced by urban populations in the global south especially in the circumstances of rapid urbanization and climate change studies that quantify the nature and degrees of water insecurity for different groups in developing countries cities are vitally important this study aims to fill this research gap this paper presents a case study of a semi regularized and low income township from the coastal megacity of karachi with a population of over 25 million much like other megacities in south asia e g mumbai karachi suffers from a lack of universal access to water only about 28 of dwellings in karachi where nearly half the population lives in informal settlements have reliable access to municipal piped water beard and mitlin 2021 public discourse understands karachi s burgeoning water crisis through reasons like dwindling reserves and a growing demand supply gap ahmed 2009 the government employs a techno scientific authority to render water development as a purely techno managerial pursuit bypassing any involvement with political conflicts aijaz and akhter 2020 this directly influences water policy and investment decisions which focus exclusively on water supply augmentation best encapsulated by the greater karachi bulk water supply scheme also known as the k iv project which with an estimated cost of pkr 192 billion us 1 1 billion is being touted as the solution to all of karachi s water challenges this dominant narrative of water scarcity has swayed attention away from how poorer populations have to involve in alliances conflicts for access to water on a daily basis mustafa et al 2017 for example anwar et al 2019 talk about invisibility in the eyes of the state of vulnerable populations living in informal settlements known as katchi abadis who despite comprising more than half of the city s population are largely ignored or neglected in water supply plans as anwer et al 2020 also point the nature and extent of water problems between different neighborhoods within karachi is markedly different depending on factors like legality jurisdiction income groups geographic position relative to city s water infrastructure and etc however even though there is considerable welfare work committed to karachi rahman 2008 despite a complex urban water landscape karachi s water problems remain largely understudied and unexplored by academic literature the analysis presented here focuses on the low income settlement of lyari situated at the tail end of karachi s piped water network and host to complex relationships between ethnically diverse communities we have two primary objectives first to evaluate the performance of the sole public water utility karachi water and sewerage board kwsb with respect to provision of piped water supply and second to quantify factors that influence the ability of households to purchase access and consume a safe and adequate volume of water for domestic purposes both from formal and alternate sources by employing a mixed methods approach we demonstrate how a weak water institution with unreliable service and inadequate revenue streams disproportionately affects the most vulnerable who end up paying higher amounts for lower water consumption and are forced to compromise on the overall control and quality of life in pursuit of water 2 methodology 2 1 the case study lyari township lyari township with a population of approximately 660 000 is a multi ethnic low income and semi regularized settlement situated in the southern district of karachi due to its geographical position at the tail end of the city s water supply infrastructure lyari is considered particularly vulnerable to acute water scarcity conditions two westward flowing conduits from the supply infrastructure the k iii and cod lines pass through the region s northern and eastern strips and are responsible for providing piped water to all of its 11 divisions called union councils uc a total of six pumping stations are connected to these conduits to ensure sufficient pipeline water pressure across the township fig 1 there is considerable spatial disparity in access to water in lyari part of the reason for which is a historical neglect in terms of urban infrastructure development with subsequent waves of rural urban migration over the years lyari grew as a largely informal settlement which was regularized only after the 1970s where the new government provided ninety year leases to households and allowed lyari to be considered in the city s water infrastructure plans kabraji 2015 despite this a sustained culture of lax governance by state institutions allowed the region to become a gray zone of state power viqar 2014 categorized by rule of criminal syndicates practices of political patronage and a dramatic growth of illegal high rise apartments consequently amenities like water supply were influenced by these actors and developments causing marginalization and displacement of certain communities whilst the groups with better social political capital were able to settle in areas with better water access the poorest communities such as the native sindhi mahigeer community and the rural urban migrant zikri community continued living in regions in the southwestern wing with poor access to piped water these entanglements of water supply with political social relationships between different communities within a township makes lyari an interesting study area for our research 2 2 methods this paper assesses access to water by low income urban communities and has two key objectives first to evaluate the performance of the city s water utility kwsb with respect to sustainable provision of safe reliable and adequate water to all residents and second to quantify inequities associated with procuring various sources of water a mixed methods approach which uses qualitative data to explain quantitative results for compounded and interconnected results creswell and clark 2017 is employed for a more holistic understanding of shortcomings of the utility from the perspective of consumers as well as kwsb staff and of lived experiences of those households facing scarcity conditions in the first phase 465 household surveys across lyari s 11 ucs were conducted and analyzed followed by interviews and participant observations as complementary methods the most recent census data does not provide population numbers at the uc level to ensure a representative sampling of households local expertize e g union councilors and community mobilizers were used to determine the number of surveys conducted in each uc clusters of approximately five randomly selected households were used for a balanced spatial distribution within each uc while all attempts were made to ensure a representative survey sample the unavailability of a uc level population data in lyari is a limitation of this study and it would benefit from this information if it becomes available in subsequent census datasets the data was analyzed using the statistical package r as well as gis software arcgis the survey questionnaire is provided in the supplementary materials metered water data would provide the most accurate assessment of household water consumption however piped water supply in lyari is limited and unreliable so most household water uses depend on water containers of various sizes in absence of metered data the survey questionnaire asks a series of questions on various water uses the survey respondents water use activities are used as a proxy for water consumption for their household we categorize the various household water uses as either individual or collective for collective water uses the reported volume of water used for the activity was divided by the number of household members to determine the respondent s share of water use the quantities of water used for the different activities were determined by ascertaining the volume and number of containers used where running tap or piped water was used in some activities the duration for which the tap was used was noted and multiplied with a measured flow rate to ascertain the total volume of water used this method of data collection is similar to the methods used by shaban and sharma 2007 basu et al 2017 and singh and turkiya 2013 in their studies a limitation with this approach is that the water use habits and activities were recorded via respondents memories thus potentially introducing an intrinsic bias e g due to privacy concerns this limitation also applies to information regarding household income and expenses where many of the reported numbers could not be triangulated due to a lack of documented evidence such as for alternate sources where bookkeeping practices do not exist water samples from select 79 households from the survey population based on criteria of satisfaction treatment methods and instances of diseases in household members as well as from each of the six pumping stations were collected and tested for presence of e coli and total coliform tc finally semi structured interviews from select households local water activists and kwsb officials were conducted to capture experiences of everyday injustice in the procurement of water and its resultant effect on quality of life finewood and holifield 2015 as well as tacit and experiential knowledge held by people regarding the region s water system enqvist et al 2020 3 results 3 1 evaluating kwsb s performance in the region s current water system we start with an evaluation of the performance of the water utility in the region with respect to water costs sufficiency reliability and quality of piped water supply and the utility s measures or lack thereof to ensure financial sustainability as the sole official supplier of water in lyari the kwsb is failing to meet basic expectations with respect to sustainable provision of adequate reliable and safe water to every citizen around 93 of surveyed households n 465 have connections to piped water with 33 households still not connected to piped supply all of these 33 unconnected households are in the bottom 50th percentile of monthly household incomes reported average household monthly income across the entire sample is pkr 22 000 there is no household with a monthly income 40 000 pkr or more that does not have a pipeline connection one of the biggest reasons for this disparity is significant capital costs of piped water connection fig 2 illustrates how residents lay down their piped connections on a self help basis these capital expenses which include material infrastructure and labor with a median cost of approximately 10 000 pkr are especially burdensome on lower income households if a household is not able to afford these installment costs they will be unable to connect to the piped water network fig 3 shows the status of piped water availability for 465 households from our sample households with no pipeline can be seen amidst households with established piped connections highlighting the fact that just being present in a neighborhood serviced by a piped water network doesn t guarantee access to that network even if households are able to maintain a pipeline connection there is no guarantee that they ll receive an adequate supply of water due to constrained water supply and infrastructure the kwsb supplies water intermittently instead of a 24 7 supply for all surveyed households with piped water connection the median for total water supply per week is only 3 5 h 210 min when intermittency is the norm onsite storage becomes a dominant household coping mechanism burt et al 2018 households have to ensure that whenever water becomes available in the pipelines they are able to store water that will last them until the next time water becomes available we find that higher income households are better able to afford these storage facilities as the median water storage capacity for households with monthly incomes exceeding pkr 50 000 600 gallons is almost six times greater than that of households with a monthly income of below pkr 20 000 participant observations collected from many low income households also confirm a fairly limited access to storage capacities household members juggled through different containers utensils buckets and drums to be able to collect and store sufficient quantities households situated in eastern lyari generally receive higher water quantities owing to close proximity to the two main kwsb bulk water supply conduits conversely households in the western part experience a more erratic water supply schedule and are supplied through pumping stations operated by the kwsb s valve men most households only receive water on alternative days nearly half of these households receive water for a total of less than 90 min per week moreover even the households with an apparent daily supply may suffer from water scarcity as a frequent supply does not guarantee sufficient water availability as many as 21 households that report getting water daily or every other day receive water for approximately 1 h per week these supply schedules are also often unreliable for many households a schedule simply does not exist i e the water supply days duration and or time is inconsistent around 40 of households complained that there is no fixed timing of water supply a small number of these households also reported power outages coinciding with water supply timings the absence of a functioning generator at the pumping stations and lack of affordability of generators for most households mean that they will not be able to access piped water in case of power outages either at the water point or end user neighborhood uncertainty also means that such households have to remain on guard throughout the day so they do not miss crucial supply hours consequently these households have to operate their electrical motors multiple times a day to check for water significantly adding to their monthly electrical bills in addition to this unreliability for as many as 46 households the supply schedule is inconvenient i e at traditional resting hours between 12 a m and 5 a m these citizens complain about sleep deprivation and exhaustion and its resultant effect on their deteriorating health and productivity the quality of water provided by the utility both at source and end use is poor and the water provided by the municipal service for the majority is not fit for consumption a staggering number of 87 of households reported sewage water in their piped water connections such households have to drain away the contaminated water by making judgment based on sensory observations of smell and esthetics such as color and presence of particles during an already limited supply duration besides an obvious mixing of sewage water in the piped supply it is also well documented that intermittent and erratic supplies also increase the risk of microbial contamination due to insufficient water pressures in the pipes burt et al 2018 ercumen et al 2015 the water quality tests for bacterial contamination from 79 selected households in our sample population reinforce these findings an alarming 92 4 of households drinking water tested positive for presence of total coliform tc 77 2 of these households drinking water samples showed presence of e coli which is a primary cause for several waterborne diseases water samples obtained from the six upstream pumping stations also revealed presence of coliform in all samples and of e coli in all but one despite considering their water as unsafe or only marginally safe nearly half the number of households do not treat their water a large number from the remaining half only pass it through a cloth filter before consuming interviews reveal that these households are either unable to pay increased gas bills accompanied by processes like boiling water or are not convinced of the benefits of treating their water finally the utility is not able to generate sufficient revenue for any improved services survey results show that as many as 80 of all households with pipeline connections two thirds of whom get regular supply of water do not receive a water bill from the kwsb in situations where households have maintained illegal connections the unauthorized practice of connecting directly to kwsb supply lines or live in non leased houses officials claim that the kwsb is unable to send water bills however even for households that do maintain a lease and have been provided authorized water pipeline connections the majority continue to utilize water supply without receiving any bill according to the water utility s executive engineer for the region such households have not registered themselves with the service in other words in order to get billed the onus is actually on the consumers themselves to visit kwsb s revenue offices and document their connection to the system the kwsb official further claims that such households who have not registered themselves to be billed by the service show a lack of willingness to pay because they consider it a free resource the claim of lack of willingness to pay by the households is not supported by survey data on piped water expenses including installation costs and recurring costs which include costs for maintaining infrastructure and increased electricity usage to run electric motors a majority of the households are already paying significant amounts each month to maintain a piped connection besides this as many as 9 of households with piped connections are paying monthly charges to informal collectively managed piped supply providers such as building unions in apartments on the top of this many residents alternatively additionally spend significant amounts on local private water vendor therefore the recurring monthly water is almost always considerably higher than the median water bills as generated by the kwsb 3 2 alternate sources household costs and inequities in access only around 16 or one in six households from the sample population report being reliant on kwsb s piped water supply the remaining have to resort to other often multiple alternate sources alongside or instead of the piped water supply to meet their day to day needs some of these alternate sources such as water tankers were introduced by the kwsb as stop gap arrangements to counter piped water shortfalls but have since become permanent sources operating in a de facto informal market anwar et al 2019 rahman 2008 on the surface the presence of multiple paid and free sources can be seen as devices of resilience for the local community affected by disparities in piped water supply collaborating and regrouping to share water and designing new methods of procurement can bridge scarcity conditions caused by inadequate or unreliable piped supply however in reality the degree of access to these alternate resources differs considerably across socioeconomic groups around 77 of all surveyed households rely on two or more sources of water on a daily basis an observation consistent with literature on use of alternate sources in developing countries median monthly household expenditure on water is approximately pkr 1200 which is significantly greater than the official kwsb tariffs for residential use pkr 221 for a 120 sq yard plot the typical household size in lyari fig 4 shows that as households increase their number of water sources their total monthly water expenditure increases however this increased expenditure doesn t result in an increase in water consumption this means that citizens have to procure multiple sources not to expand their daily consumption but in order to fulfill their basic consumption needs comparing these observations against income groups shows that besides having a better access to piped water supply higher income households are better able to procure sufficient quantities of water from a fewer number of and often cheaper alternate sources among those respondents that report expenses for water households with monthly income 5000 pkr or less have to spend around 18 whereas those with monthly income 40 000 or more spend around 2 on water every month there is a significant spatial disparity in the percentage of monthly income spent on procurement of water neighborhoods situated in the western part of lyari are among the poorest neighborhoods in the region and as shown in fig 5 spend over 20 of their monthly incomes on water with an understanding of the extent of costs of water procurement across income groups it is worthwhile to analyze the type of water sources the quantities of water consumption they allow and the income groups that utilize them households in lyari access water through the following eight modes altogether pipeline piped water supply tube well groundwater collectively managed sources water vendors includes water tankers mushki and other vendors neighbors public sources includes pumping stations public standpipes and mosques and ro plants for drinking purposes only fig 6 shows the monthly recurring expense distribution for all the different available water sources in lyari these expenses include direct water charges along with indirect costs such as cost of transportation renting of trolley and containers electricity charges to operate motors and maintenance of infrastructure even free sources such as standpipes or nearby houses despite no direct water costs can carry significant procurement expenses which are sometimes even comparable to those charged by water vendors like water tankers and mushki fig 7 shows per capita water consumption plotted against the cost per gallon for difference sources of water based on the subset of households that procure water from a single source the figure indicates that households that depend on expensive water sources have a much lower per capita water consumption groundwater is the most oft used alternate source of water and the main source for day to day consumption for 15 of households from our survey population as fig 7 shows tubewell groundwater is also among the sources with highest per capita consumption and lowest median cost per gallon ratio besides groundwater collectively managed sources which are mostly seen in apartment buildings give opportunity to the citizens to regroup and divide their finances to find a collective solution for a reliable water supply apart from these two sources the municipal piped supply fares better than other alternate options the water vending options particularly mushki have the highest median cost per gallon ratio and lowest per capita consumption as the pay as you go nature of expenses means that utilizers pay higher monthly water expenditures for lower water consumption a handful of houses also rely exclusively on tanker water which is priced at approximately pkr 0 6 gallon 4 discussion 4 1 kwsb utility as weak institution reflecting on kwsb operation this investigation paints kwsb as a weak and non independent institution one that is influenced by a host of different stakeholders acting at different levels of a wider political economy in this regard interviews with residents local water activists as well as from kwsb staff attest to a culture of political interference and patronage in operations of the utility political actors through use of violence would often secure control over infrastructure mustafa et al 2013 this includes influencing supply hours from upstream pumping stations tampering with pipelines by installing suction pumps or diverting pipelines to ensure better supply in their areas of patronage moreover elected representatives would regulate water provision by issuing permission slips for new pipeline connections or respond to fairly common protests and sit ins during events of prolonged water non availability despite their lack of political mandate the interviews also reveal that while the presence of water vendors provides a needed service to those areas without adequate or reliable supply their operations are non regularized with arbitrary price setting that can change based on seasonal variations and increased demands often these vendors pilfer water from pumping stations for a share on commissions with the valve men and as per kwsb officials under the garb of political protection participant observation at the lea market pumping station also showed vendors frequently coming and filling their several containers and loading them on their carts along with external influence and a poor service delivery for the majority the utility also fails to generate any significant revenue from its customers as it fails to bill even those households that receive relatively better water supply as shown earlier citizens with poor and sufficient water supply alike are already spending significant amounts to maintain piped water extrapolating from water costs reported in the survey annual expenditures on water run into billions of rupees only a small fraction of which ends with kwsb as the official and primary supplier of water in the region daily times 2017 from a consumer welfare perspective these water expenditures are better directed to the public water utility rather than to private vendors or spent inefficiently by each resident on procuring water in an ad hoc manner since water utility revenues can be used to improve the system performance the current status quo of a perpetually poor quality of service from the utility which disproportionately affects the poorer households who pay a significant portion of their incomes on much costlier methods can begin to change if it is able to generate a reliable revenue stream to sustain improve its operations therefore as akhter 2017 claims water insecurity at individual region scales is as much about political and social structures as it is about the physical availability of the resource in such an environment of lax governance and inadequate revenue stream there is a huge resultant disparity in access to water within the region the lack of an effective water utility equates to a loss of social safety net citizens with relative power financial privilege or political capital are able to appropriate the water infrastructures to cope with acute water scarcity conditions on the other hand the vulnerable populations are left to face water scarcity of crisis proportions graham et al 2013 asserts how even if water might be available for the poor marginalized populations water resource appropriation helped by an imbalanced social dynamic between the powerful and powerless render it inaccessible so while large capital intensive water supply augmentation interventions can be a part of the portfolio of solutions to lyari s water challenges they do not address the existing inequities furthermore large infrastructure projects can take considerable time to materialize in the interim period shorter term improvements such as increasing reliability of supply and making the supply schedule more convenient will help in progressing towards water justice in lyari all these improvements can only come from kwsb since it s the sole water provider to make these improvements the utility will require increased resources for which improvements in billing and revenue collections are needed 4 2 praxis of financial privilege leaves a disproportionate burden of costs and effort on the poor crow and swallow 2017 and crow and sultana 2010 argue that struggles in procurement of water have a profound effect on many different dimensions of well being including economic productivity education and health for a region like lyari with acute water scarcity conditions produced by a weak and unreliable water supply system the poorest residents are most affected as struggles in household water management take a major share of their mental space and of daily routine while the financially privileged groups and those with social capital are better able to make financially viable choices to cope with water scarcity the poorer and marginalized sections of the population are bearing a disproportionate burden of costs as they continue spending high amounts for lower quantities of water all the while having to navigate through multiple number of water sources to meet their daily water needs one way for households to secure a more reliable and adequate water supply is by investing or participating in groundwater or collectively managed arrangements which provide the highest quantities of water at the lowest recurring expense the availability of groundwater helps as many as 51 surveyed households in that they either use it entirely or interchangeably with piped water connection to replicate a 24 7 supply system bakker et al 2008 in a similar study on jakarta also note households ability to use a combination of networked water and groundwater to pay significantly less than other sources however the cost of establishing groundwater connection is substantially high the median capital expenditure at 40 000 pkr is nearly four times that for piped water connection therefore consistent with findings of other studies on water inequity relating to groundwater use in south asia srinivasan and kulkarni 2014 only the wealthier households are able to install this water source in their premises similarly the collectively managed systems are mostly seen in apartment buildings where many of the higher income households live in contrast for low income populations procurement of piped water as well as from alternate sources has been reported to be physically and mentally taxing process and requires trade offs in terms of added costs both explicit on water and in traveling for water and implicit which include opportunity cost of productive work hours utilized in procurement agénor et al 2015 or reduced time and expenses on other bare necessities such as education healthcare and food resulting in a deteriorated quality of life bartlett 2003 majuru et al s 2016 study that includes nine south asian cities from india nepal pakistan and bangladesh to evaluate impact of water procurement issues on different aspects of life reveals similar results much like neighborhoods in other cities in south asia even after undertaking these compromises many households in lyari continue to face scarcity conditions firstly not only is the onus on the residents to manage their own often hefty expenses to establish municipal piped water connection but a lack of piped water supply is also an additional tax for the poor households as whittington 2003 notes many households in semi non regularized neighborhoods in south asia are not able to manage capital for private piped water connections similarly ahmed our respondent from agrataj colony is unable to manage upfront funds to get a pipeline connection despite having to spend large sums on alternate sources on a monthly basis and remarks getting a pipeline would make a huge difference as our whole lifestyle has changed because of the supply water has become an extremely precious resource for us and we have been using it very carefully we are spending more money on it than anything else secondly those low income households with pipeline connections but with uncertain and inconvenient supply schedules frequently express a feeling of loss of agency over their life muhammad asif who belongs to one such household explains there is no fixed day or time when the pipelines supply water so we are always on a watch and that is extremely time consuming every poor house has a man who is up every night keeping an eye on the water in our area we go to our job come back and then search for water at different places it is like a routine for us among alternate sources the ability to share water from nearby houses provides a cheap alternative where around 9 of our surveyed households use it as their main water source for day to day consumption shows an excellent example of resilience and collaboration in face of adversity household members travel with containers to neighborhoods that usually lie within a small radius subbaraman et al 2014 ramsey et al 2017 interviews from households that rely on this source also show a strong pattern of kinship and ethnic bonds as important factors in providing easier access respondents often remarked how similar ethnic backgrounds or familial connections allow them to tap this source better one such respondent muneeba who lives in the bihar colony mentions i visit my daughter once every 10 days to wash the clothes she lives in a different area however this cannot be considered a viable daily water source for many there is only a limited amount to share and residents who do not have these social connections may not be able to borrow water besides this household members still may have to walk long distances on a daily basis for other alternate sources as well considerable time and energy is required in planning and for traveling to and waiting at the source as many as 95 of all the households that have to travel for water complain about physical exhaustion caused by activities including carrying large quantities of water in hand on back or over their heads on a daily basis as well as having to stand in lines especially during scorching weathers during summer season finally when residents are unable to access enough water through either piped supply or other free sources they have to resort to using the readily available albeit considerably more expensive sources like tanker service mushki and other vendors enqvist et al 2020 for lower income households buying this water involves major cuts on other household expenses especially during summer when prices increase significantly owing to increased consumption 5 conclusions water scarcity beyond just being a physical insufficiency of resources is strongly connected to variations in socioeconomic demographics and political influence and manifests in different degrees and mannerisms to different types of populations depending on how easy difficult access to water is however traditional urban water management literature often fails to account for these causes effects of disparities especially in the context of global south as a result cities continue to struggle with a lack of universal access to water to demonstrate the effect of socioeconomic and social political inequalities in determining a community s level of water in security we conduct a total of 465 household surveys from a low income township in karachi supplemented with participant observation and stakeholder interviews the results emphasize how a weak water institution with poor service delivery and inadequate revenue streams contributes in pushing vulnerable sections of the population further to the margins in lyari the burden of responsibility lies on households themselves to either connect to the utility s piped water service making the utility exclusionary for those who are unable to afford a connection or arrange alternative methods to meet their daily water needs even for those with piped water connections the supply is inadequate for the majority the supply schedule is unreliable for a significant number and the quality of water is unsafe for consumption in most cases forcing many households to resort to additional costlier and inconvenient means in pursuit of this bare necessity lower income populations are especially affected and pay disproportionately higher amounts for a much lower water consumption therefore any water supply interventions in lyari need to start from those neighborhoods which suffer from the most acute scarcity and also tend to be the poorest this will help in relieving the burden of disproportionate costs from the poorest households who are often not serviced by the piped water network lyari s water problems and those of similar settlements across karachi and other megacities across the global south cannot be resolved by just augmenting water supply to karachi as posited by predominant public discourse and water utility plans while increased water supply can help the findings discussed here show that even with supply augmentations lyari and other settlements in karachi will need institutional structures and policies to ensure equitable and more just access to existing and any increased water supplies

intermittent leading to severe water insecurity in densely populated low income neighborhoods shaban and sharma 2007 residents in these neighborhoods suffer disproportionately not just in terms of direct outcomes of scarcity but also in measures of wellbeing fontana and elson 2014 gimelli et al 2018 several hours spent daily in collection and transportation of limited quantities of water can cause bodily and emotional distress especially among women anwar et al 2019 lu et al 2014 compromise personal hygiene crow and odaba 2010 and prevent pursuit of opportunities that can result in improved outcomes such as economic activities and education crow et al 2012 lund 2015 goes as far as claiming that societies where households have to devote substantial time and resources in securing access to water are almost always poor therefore hurdles in access to water where sacrifices in terms of time energy and expenses are disproportionately required from the poor and socially marginalized means that they are effectively discouraged from leading a desirable quality of life however at the same time water remains accessible for socioeconomically privileged populations of the same places who can utilize their financial privilege and power to buy appropriate available water or deploy expensive technologies to mitigate scarcity risks this pattern of vastly different degrees of access to water within a city and often even within a neighborhood is common to unequal societies in the global south categorized by wide socioeconomic disparities and power asymmetry between different groups of people and incapacitated urban water utilities that are unable to adequately serve its most vulnerable populations there is a dearth of analytical and evidence based studies that can quantify socioeconomic disparities in access to water lu et al 2014 especially in terms of costs vis à vis household income and water consumption gulyani et al 2005 charnley and durham 2010 emphasize that adding analytical approaches can help account for systems capacity bottlenecks and constraints in development as well as imbalances and endemic problems related to improper allocation of water prominent scholars in the fields of water justice harris et al 2013 2017 sultana 2018 socio hydrology lund 2015 wesselink et al 2017 and political ecology akhter 2017 swyngedouw et al 2002 have pointed out that the predominant academic literature in fields of urban water management urban hydrology and water governance that informs cities water plans is largely apolitical lund 2015 there is little acknowledgment of political social and ethnocultural dynamics which underscore important inequalities or the conditions that reproduce disparities and asymmetrical power relations in the setting of agendas and priorities related to water supply rendering large portions of the population parched for water even with an ample availability enqvist et al 2020 goldman 2007 even though ideas of water justice i e ensuring that every citizen especially the most vulnerable have achieved their right to water may have started to gain traction in formal debates most studies nonetheless maintain economistic individualistic or natural science framings of the issues in ways that make justice concerns appear to be secondary at best or at worst irrelevant as emphasized in a recent editorial highlighting this gap in hydrologic research too much and not enough 2021 engineering solutions to water problems are portrayed in elegant terms that may appear simple and make us feel better precisely because they ignore the messy institutions norms and processes that underlie our relationship as individuals and as a society with water coupled with this public discourse shaped by government narrative such as in policy frameworks and public briefings news media reports and forum discussions on urban water challenges in cities across the global south khan 2022 karachi facing acute water shortage sindh irrigation minister geo tv 2022 mumbai corporators across party lines raise water shortage issue 2021 ioris 2016 collyns 2015 focuses predominantly on the materiality of systems with a myopically focused narrative of water shortages harris et al 2017 this water scarcity narrative continues to serve as a powerful excuse for debt laden water infrastructure projects that end up addressing a very limited portion of the overall population without sufficiently focusing on mechanisms to ensure access to available water budds and mcgranahan 2003 a focus on social ecological justice in urban water management where scarcity is seen beyond being a mere physical insufficiency of resources and manifestly connected with the scarcity of socioeconomic deprivation and political influence is crucial to strengthen responsible institutions and develop water resilient systems lund 2015 considering the magnitude of water crisis situations faced by urban populations in the global south especially in the circumstances of rapid urbanization and climate change studies that quantify the nature and degrees of water insecurity for different groups in developing countries cities are vitally important this study aims to fill this research gap this paper presents a case study of a semi regularized and low income township from the coastal megacity of karachi with a population of over 25 million much like other megacities in south asia e g mumbai karachi suffers from a lack of universal access to water only about 28 of dwellings in karachi where nearly half the population lives in informal settlements have reliable access to municipal piped water beard and mitlin 2021 public discourse understands karachi s burgeoning water crisis through reasons like dwindling reserves and a growing demand supply gap ahmed 2009 the government employs a techno scientific authority to render water development as a purely techno managerial pursuit bypassing any involvement with political conflicts aijaz and akhter 2020 this directly influences water policy and investment decisions which focus exclusively on water supply augmentation best encapsulated by the greater karachi bulk water supply scheme also known as the k iv project which with an estimated cost of pkr 192 billion us 1 1 billion is being touted as the solution to all of karachi s water challenges this dominant narrative of water scarcity has swayed attention away from how poorer populations have to involve in alliances conflicts for access to water on a daily basis mustafa et al 2017 for example anwar et al 2019 talk about invisibility in the eyes of the state of vulnerable populations living in informal settlements known as katchi abadis who despite comprising more than half of the city s population are largely ignored or neglected in water supply plans as anwer et al 2020 also point the nature and extent of water problems between different neighborhoods within karachi is markedly different depending on factors like legality jurisdiction income groups geographic position relative to city s water infrastructure and etc however even though there is considerable welfare work committed to karachi rahman 2008 despite a complex urban water landscape karachi s water problems remain largely understudied and unexplored by academic literature the analysis presented here focuses on the low income settlement of lyari situated at the tail end of karachi s piped water network and host to complex relationships between ethnically diverse communities we have two primary objectives first to evaluate the performance of the sole public water utility karachi water and sewerage board kwsb with respect to provision of piped water supply and second to quantify factors that influence the ability of households to purchase access and consume a safe and adequate volume of water for domestic purposes both from formal and alternate sources by employing a mixed methods approach we demonstrate how a weak water institution with unreliable service and inadequate revenue streams disproportionately affects the most vulnerable who end up paying higher amounts for lower water consumption and are forced to compromise on the overall control and quality of life in pursuit of water 2 methodology 2 1 the case study lyari township lyari township with a population of approximately 660 000 is a multi ethnic low income and semi regularized settlement situated in the southern district of karachi due to its geographical position at the tail end of the city s water supply infrastructure lyari is considered particularly vulnerable to acute water scarcity conditions two westward flowing conduits from the supply infrastructure the k iii and cod lines pass through the region s northern and eastern strips and are responsible for providing piped water to all of its 11 divisions called union councils uc a total of six pumping stations are connected to these conduits to ensure sufficient pipeline water pressure across the township fig 1 there is considerable spatial disparity in access to water in lyari part of the reason for which is a historical neglect in terms of urban infrastructure development with subsequent waves of rural urban migration over the years lyari grew as a largely informal settlement which was regularized only after the 1970s where the new government provided ninety year leases to households and allowed lyari to be considered in the city s water infrastructure plans kabraji 2015 despite this a sustained culture of lax governance by state institutions allowed the region to become a gray zone of state power viqar 2014 categorized by rule of criminal syndicates practices of political patronage and a dramatic growth of illegal high rise apartments consequently amenities like water supply were influenced by these actors and developments causing marginalization and displacement of certain communities whilst the groups with better social political capital were able to settle in areas with better water access the poorest communities such as the native sindhi mahigeer community and the rural urban migrant zikri community continued living in regions in the southwestern wing with poor access to piped water these entanglements of water supply with political social relationships between different communities within a township makes lyari an interesting study area for our research 2 2 methods this paper assesses access to water by low income urban communities and has two key objectives first to evaluate the performance of the city s water utility kwsb with respect to sustainable provision of safe reliable and adequate water to all residents and second to quantify inequities associated with procuring various sources of water a mixed methods approach which uses qualitative data to explain quantitative results for compounded and interconnected results creswell and clark 2017 is employed for a more holistic understanding of shortcomings of the utility from the perspective of consumers as well as kwsb staff and of lived experiences of those households facing scarcity conditions in the first phase 465 household surveys across lyari s 11 ucs were conducted and analyzed followed by interviews and participant observations as complementary methods the most recent census data does not provide population numbers at the uc level to ensure a representative sampling of households local expertize e g union councilors and community mobilizers were used to determine the number of surveys conducted in each uc clusters of approximately five randomly selected households were used for a balanced spatial distribution within each uc while all attempts were made to ensure a representative survey sample the unavailability of a uc level population data in lyari is a limitation of this study and it would benefit from this information if it becomes available in subsequent census datasets the data was analyzed using the statistical package r as well as gis software arcgis the survey questionnaire is provided in the supplementary materials metered water data would provide the most accurate assessment of household water consumption however piped water supply in lyari is limited and unreliable so most household water uses depend on water containers of various sizes in absence of metered data the survey questionnaire asks a series of questions on various water uses the survey respondents water use activities are used as a proxy for water consumption for their household we categorize the various household water uses as either individual or collective for collective water uses the reported volume of water used for the activity was divided by the number of household members to determine the respondent s share of water use the quantities of water used for the different activities were determined by ascertaining the volume and number of containers used where running tap or piped water was used in some activities the duration for which the tap was used was noted and multiplied with a measured flow rate to ascertain the total volume of water used this method of data collection is similar to the methods used by shaban and sharma 2007 basu et al 2017 and singh and turkiya 2013 in their studies a limitation with this approach is that the water use habits and activities were recorded via respondents memories thus potentially introducing an intrinsic bias e g due to privacy concerns this limitation also applies to information regarding household income and expenses where many of the reported numbers could not be triangulated due to a lack of documented evidence such as for alternate sources where bookkeeping practices do not exist water samples from select 79 households from the survey population based on criteria of satisfaction treatment methods and instances of diseases in household members as well as from each of the six pumping stations were collected and tested for presence of e coli and total coliform tc finally semi structured interviews from select households local water activists and kwsb officials were conducted to capture experiences of everyday injustice in the procurement of water and its resultant effect on quality of life finewood and holifield 2015 as well as tacit and experiential knowledge held by people regarding the region s water system enqvist et al 2020 3 results 3 1 evaluating kwsb s performance in the region s current water system we start with an evaluation of the performance of the water utility in the region with respect to water costs sufficiency reliability and quality of piped water supply and the utility s measures or lack thereof to ensure financial sustainability as the sole official supplier of water in lyari the kwsb is failing to meet basic expectations with respect to sustainable provision of adequate reliable and safe water to every citizen around 93 of surveyed households n 465 have connections to piped water with 33 households still not connected to piped supply all of these 33 unconnected households are in the bottom 50th percentile of monthly household incomes reported average household monthly income across the entire sample is pkr 22 000 there is no household with a monthly income 40 000 pkr or more that does not have a pipeline connection one of the biggest reasons for this disparity is significant capital costs of piped water connection fig 2 illustrates how residents lay down their piped connections on a self help basis these capital expenses which include material infrastructure and labor with a median cost of approximately 10 000 pkr are especially burdensome on lower income households if a household is not able to afford these installment costs they will be unable to connect to the piped water network fig 3 shows the status of piped water availability for 465 households from our sample households with no pipeline can be seen amidst households with established piped connections highlighting the fact that just being present in a neighborhood serviced by a piped water network doesn t guarantee access to that network even if households are able to maintain a pipeline connection there is no guarantee that they ll receive an adequate supply of water due to constrained water supply and infrastructure the kwsb supplies water intermittently instead of a 24 7 supply for all surveyed households with piped water connection the median for total water supply per week is only 3 5 h 210 min when intermittency is the norm onsite storage becomes a dominant household coping mechanism burt et al 2018 households have to ensure that whenever water becomes available in the pipelines they are able to store water that will last them until the next time water becomes available we find that higher income households are better able to afford these storage facilities as the median water storage capacity for households with monthly incomes exceeding pkr 50 000 600 gallons is almost six times greater than that of households with a monthly income of below pkr 20 000 participant observations collected from many low income households also confirm a fairly limited access to storage capacities household members juggled through different containers utensils buckets and drums to be able to collect and store sufficient quantities households situated in eastern lyari generally receive higher water quantities owing to close proximity to the two main kwsb bulk water supply conduits conversely households in the western part experience a more erratic water supply schedule and are supplied through pumping stations operated by the kwsb s valve men most households only receive water on alternative days nearly half of these households receive water for a total of less than 90 min per week moreover even the households with an apparent daily supply may suffer from water scarcity as a frequent supply does not guarantee sufficient water availability as many as 21 households that report getting water daily or every other day receive water for approximately 1 h per week these supply schedules are also often unreliable for many households a schedule simply does not exist i e the water supply days duration and or time is inconsistent around 40 of households complained that there is no fixed timing of water supply a small number of these households also reported power outages coinciding with water supply timings the absence of a functioning generator at the pumping stations and lack of affordability of generators for most households mean that they will not be able to access piped water in case of power outages either at the water point or end user neighborhood uncertainty also means that such households have to remain on guard throughout the day so they do not miss crucial supply hours consequently these households have to operate their electrical motors multiple times a day to check for water significantly adding to their monthly electrical bills in addition to this unreliability for as many as 46 households the supply schedule is inconvenient i e at traditional resting hours between 12 a m and 5 a m these citizens complain about sleep deprivation and exhaustion and its resultant effect on their deteriorating health and productivity the quality of water provided by the utility both at source and end use is poor and the water provided by the municipal service for the majority is not fit for consumption a staggering number of 87 of households reported sewage water in their piped water connections such households have to drain away the contaminated water by making judgment based on sensory observations of smell and esthetics such as color and presence of particles during an already limited supply duration besides an obvious mixing of sewage water in the piped supply it is also well documented that intermittent and erratic supplies also increase the risk of microbial contamination due to insufficient water pressures in the pipes burt et al 2018 ercumen et al 2015 the water quality tests for bacterial contamination from 79 selected households in our sample population reinforce these findings an alarming 92 4 of households drinking water tested positive for presence of total coliform tc 77 2 of these households drinking water samples showed presence of e coli which is a primary cause for several waterborne diseases water samples obtained from the six upstream pumping stations also revealed presence of coliform in all samples and of e coli in all but one despite considering their water as unsafe or only marginally safe nearly half the number of households do not treat their water a large number from the remaining half only pass it through a cloth filter before consuming interviews reveal that these households are either unable to pay increased gas bills accompanied by processes like boiling water or are not convinced of the benefits of treating their water finally the utility is not able to generate sufficient revenue for any improved services survey results show that as many as 80 of all households with pipeline connections two thirds of whom get regular supply of water do not receive a water bill from the kwsb in situations where households have maintained illegal connections the unauthorized practice of connecting directly to kwsb supply lines or live in non leased houses officials claim that the kwsb is unable to send water bills however even for households that do maintain a lease and have been provided authorized water pipeline connections the majority continue to utilize water supply without receiving any bill according to the water utility s executive engineer for the region such households have not registered themselves with the service in other words in order to get billed the onus is actually on the consumers themselves to visit kwsb s revenue offices and document their connection to the system the kwsb official further claims that such households who have not registered themselves to be billed by the service show a lack of willingness to pay because they consider it a free resource the claim of lack of willingness to pay by the households is not supported by survey data on piped water expenses including installation costs and recurring costs which include costs for maintaining infrastructure and increased electricity usage to run electric motors a majority of the households are already paying significant amounts each month to maintain a piped connection besides this as many as 9 of households with piped connections are paying monthly charges to informal collectively managed piped supply providers such as building unions in apartments on the top of this many residents alternatively additionally spend significant amounts on local private water vendor therefore the recurring monthly water is almost always considerably higher than the median water bills as generated by the kwsb 3 2 alternate sources household costs and inequities in access only around 16 or one in six households from the sample population report being reliant on kwsb s piped water supply the remaining have to resort to other often multiple alternate sources alongside or instead of the piped water supply to meet their day to day needs some of these alternate sources such as water tankers were introduced by the kwsb as stop gap arrangements to counter piped water shortfalls but have since become permanent sources operating in a de facto informal market anwar et al 2019 rahman 2008 on the surface the presence of multiple paid and free sources can be seen as devices of resilience for the local community affected by disparities in piped water supply collaborating and regrouping to share water and designing new methods of procurement can bridge scarcity conditions caused by inadequate or unreliable piped supply however in reality the degree of access to these alternate resources differs considerably across socioeconomic groups around 77 of all surveyed households rely on two or more sources of water on a daily basis an observation consistent with literature on use of alternate sources in developing countries median monthly household expenditure on water is approximately pkr 1200 which is significantly greater than the official kwsb tariffs for residential use pkr 221 for a 120 sq yard plot the typical household size in lyari fig 4 shows that as households increase their number of water sources their total monthly water expenditure increases however this increased expenditure doesn t result in an increase in water consumption this means that citizens have to procure multiple sources not to expand their daily consumption but in order to fulfill their basic consumption needs comparing these observations against income groups shows that besides having a better access to piped water supply higher income households are better able to procure sufficient quantities of water from a fewer number of and often cheaper alternate sources among those respondents that report expenses for water households with monthly income 5000 pkr or less have to spend around 18 whereas those with monthly income 40 000 or more spend around 2 on water every month there is a significant spatial disparity in the percentage of monthly income spent on procurement of water neighborhoods situated in the western part of lyari are among the poorest neighborhoods in the region and as shown in fig 5 spend over 20 of their monthly incomes on water with an understanding of the extent of costs of water procurement across income groups it is worthwhile to analyze the type of water sources the quantities of water consumption they allow and the income groups that utilize them households in lyari access water through the following eight modes altogether pipeline piped water supply tube well groundwater collectively managed sources water vendors includes water tankers mushki and other vendors neighbors public sources includes pumping stations public standpipes and mosques and ro plants for drinking purposes only fig 6 shows the monthly recurring expense distribution for all the different available water sources in lyari these expenses include direct water charges along with indirect costs such as cost of transportation renting of trolley and containers electricity charges to operate motors and maintenance of infrastructure even free sources such as standpipes or nearby houses despite no direct water costs can carry significant procurement expenses which are sometimes even comparable to those charged by water vendors like water tankers and mushki fig 7 shows per capita water consumption plotted against the cost per gallon for difference sources of water based on the subset of households that procure water from a single source the figure indicates that households that depend on expensive water sources have a much lower per capita water consumption groundwater is the most oft used alternate source of water and the main source for day to day consumption for 15 of households from our survey population as fig 7 shows tubewell groundwater is also among the sources with highest per capita consumption and lowest median cost per gallon ratio besides groundwater collectively managed sources which are mostly seen in apartment buildings give opportunity to the citizens to regroup and divide their finances to find a collective solution for a reliable water supply apart from these two sources the municipal piped supply fares better than other alternate options the water vending options particularly mushki have the highest median cost per gallon ratio and lowest per capita consumption as the pay as you go nature of expenses means that utilizers pay higher monthly water expenditures for lower water consumption a handful of houses also rely exclusively on tanker water which is priced at approximately pkr 0 6 gallon 4 discussion 4 1 kwsb utility as weak institution reflecting on kwsb operation this investigation paints kwsb as a weak and non independent institution one that is influenced by a host of different stakeholders acting at different levels of a wider political economy in this regard interviews with residents local water activists as well as from kwsb staff attest to a culture of political interference and patronage in operations of the utility political actors through use of violence would often secure control over infrastructure mustafa et al 2013 this includes influencing supply hours from upstream pumping stations tampering with pipelines by installing suction pumps or diverting pipelines to ensure better supply in their areas of patronage moreover elected representatives would regulate water provision by issuing permission slips for new pipeline connections or respond to fairly common protests and sit ins during events of prolonged water non availability despite their lack of political mandate the interviews also reveal that while the presence of water vendors provides a needed service to those areas without adequate or reliable supply their operations are non regularized with arbitrary price setting that can change based on seasonal variations and increased demands often these vendors pilfer water from pumping stations for a share on commissions with the valve men and as per kwsb officials under the garb of political protection participant observation at the lea market pumping station also showed vendors frequently coming and filling their several containers and loading them on their carts along with external influence and a poor service delivery for the majority the utility also fails to generate any significant revenue from its customers as it fails to bill even those households that receive relatively better water supply as shown earlier citizens with poor and sufficient water supply alike are already spending significant amounts to maintain piped water extrapolating from water costs reported in the survey annual expenditures on water run into billions of rupees only a small fraction of which ends with kwsb as the official and primary supplier of water in the region daily times 2017 from a consumer welfare perspective these water expenditures are better directed to the public water utility rather than to private vendors or spent inefficiently by each resident on procuring water in an ad hoc manner since water utility revenues can be used to improve the system performance the current status quo of a perpetually poor quality of service from the utility which disproportionately affects the poorer households who pay a significant portion of their incomes on much costlier methods can begin to change if it is able to generate a reliable revenue stream to sustain improve its operations therefore as akhter 2017 claims water insecurity at individual region scales is as much about political and social structures as it is about the physical availability of the resource in such an environment of lax governance and inadequate revenue stream there is a huge resultant disparity in access to water within the region the lack of an effective water utility equates to a loss of social safety net citizens with relative power financial privilege or political capital are able to appropriate the water infrastructures to cope with acute water scarcity conditions on the other hand the vulnerable populations are left to face water scarcity of crisis proportions graham et al 2013 asserts how even if water might be available for the poor marginalized populations water resource appropriation helped by an imbalanced social dynamic between the powerful and powerless render it inaccessible so while large capital intensive water supply augmentation interventions can be a part of the portfolio of solutions to lyari s water challenges they do not address the existing inequities furthermore large infrastructure projects can take considerable time to materialize in the interim period shorter term improvements such as increasing reliability of supply and making the supply schedule more convenient will help in progressing towards water justice in lyari all these improvements can only come from kwsb since it s the sole water provider to make these improvements the utility will require increased resources for which improvements in billing and revenue collections are needed 4 2 praxis of financial privilege leaves a disproportionate burden of costs and effort on the poor crow and swallow 2017 and crow and sultana 2010 argue that struggles in procurement of water have a profound effect on many different dimensions of well being including economic productivity education and health for a region like lyari with acute water scarcity conditions produced by a weak and unreliable water supply system the poorest residents are most affected as struggles in household water management take a major share of their mental space and of daily routine while the financially privileged groups and those with social capital are better able to make financially viable choices to cope with water scarcity the poorer and marginalized sections of the population are bearing a disproportionate burden of costs as they continue spending high amounts for lower quantities of water all the while having to navigate through multiple number of water sources to meet their daily water needs one way for households to secure a more reliable and adequate water supply is by investing or participating in groundwater or collectively managed arrangements which provide the highest quantities of water at the lowest recurring expense the availability of groundwater helps as many as 51 surveyed households in that they either use it entirely or interchangeably with piped water connection to replicate a 24 7 supply system bakker et al 2008 in a similar study on jakarta also note households ability to use a combination of networked water and groundwater to pay significantly less than other sources however the cost of establishing groundwater connection is substantially high the median capital expenditure at 40 000 pkr is nearly four times that for piped water connection therefore consistent with findings of other studies on water inequity relating to groundwater use in south asia srinivasan and kulkarni 2014 only the wealthier households are able to install this water source in their premises similarly the collectively managed systems are mostly seen in apartment buildings where many of the higher income households live in contrast for low income populations procurement of piped water as well as from alternate sources has been reported to be physically and mentally taxing process and requires trade offs in terms of added costs both explicit on water and in traveling for water and implicit which include opportunity cost of productive work hours utilized in procurement agénor et al 2015 or reduced time and expenses on other bare necessities such as education healthcare and food resulting in a deteriorated quality of life bartlett 2003 majuru et al s 2016 study that includes nine south asian cities from india nepal pakistan and bangladesh to evaluate impact of water procurement issues on different aspects of life reveals similar results much like neighborhoods in other cities in south asia even after undertaking these compromises many households in lyari continue to face scarcity conditions firstly not only is the onus on the residents to manage their own often hefty expenses to establish municipal piped water connection but a lack of piped water supply is also an additional tax for the poor households as whittington 2003 notes many households in semi non regularized neighborhoods in south asia are not able to manage capital for private piped water connections similarly ahmed our respondent from agrataj colony is unable to manage upfront funds to get a pipeline connection despite having to spend large sums on alternate sources on a monthly basis and remarks getting a pipeline would make a huge difference as our whole lifestyle has changed because of the supply water has become an extremely precious resource for us and we have been using it very carefully we are spending more money on it than anything else secondly those low income households with pipeline connections but with uncertain and inconvenient supply schedules frequently express a feeling of loss of agency over their life muhammad asif who belongs to one such household explains there is no fixed day or time when the pipelines supply water so we are always on a watch and that is extremely time consuming every poor house has a man who is up every night keeping an eye on the water in our area we go to our job come back and then search for water at different places it is like a routine for us among alternate sources the ability to share water from nearby houses provides a cheap alternative where around 9 of our surveyed households use it as their main water source for day to day consumption shows an excellent example of resilience and collaboration in face of adversity household members travel with containers to neighborhoods that usually lie within a small radius subbaraman et al 2014 ramsey et al 2017 interviews from households that rely on this source also show a strong pattern of kinship and ethnic bonds as important factors in providing easier access respondents often remarked how similar ethnic backgrounds or familial connections allow them to tap this source better one such respondent muneeba who lives in the bihar colony mentions i visit my daughter once every 10 days to wash the clothes she lives in a different area however this cannot be considered a viable daily water source for many there is only a limited amount to share and residents who do not have these social connections may not be able to borrow water besides this household members still may have to walk long distances on a daily basis for other alternate sources as well considerable time and energy is required in planning and for traveling to and waiting at the source as many as 95 of all the households that have to travel for water complain about physical exhaustion caused by activities including carrying large quantities of water in hand on back or over their heads on a daily basis as well as having to stand in lines especially during scorching weathers during summer season finally when residents are unable to access enough water through either piped supply or other free sources they have to resort to using the readily available albeit considerably more expensive sources like tanker service mushki and other vendors enqvist et al 2020 for lower income households buying this water involves major cuts on other household expenses especially during summer when prices increase significantly owing to increased consumption 5 conclusions water scarcity beyond just being a physical insufficiency of resources is strongly connected to variations in socioeconomic demographics and political influence and manifests in different degrees and mannerisms to different types of populations depending on how easy difficult access to water is however traditional urban water management literature often fails to account for these causes effects of disparities especially in the context of global south as a result cities continue to struggle with a lack of universal access to water to demonstrate the effect of socioeconomic and social political inequalities in determining a community s level of water in security we conduct a total of 465 household surveys from a low income township in karachi supplemented with participant observation and stakeholder interviews the results emphasize how a weak water institution with poor service delivery and inadequate revenue streams contributes in pushing vulnerable sections of the population further to the margins in lyari the burden of responsibility lies on households themselves to either connect to the utility s piped water service making the utility exclusionary for those who are unable to afford a connection or arrange alternative methods to meet their daily water needs even for those with piped water connections the supply is inadequate for the majority the supply schedule is unreliable for a significant number and the quality of water is unsafe for consumption in most cases forcing many households to resort to additional costlier and inconvenient means in pursuit of this bare necessity lower income populations are especially affected and pay disproportionately higher amounts for a much lower water consumption therefore any water supply interventions in lyari need to start from those neighborhoods which suffer from the most acute scarcity and also tend to be the poorest this will help in relieving the burden of disproportionate costs from the poorest households who are often not serviced by the piped water network lyari s water problems and those of similar settlements across karachi and other megacities across the global south cannot be resolved by just augmenting water supply to karachi as posited by predominant public discourse and water utility plans while increased water supply can help the findings discussed here show that even with supply augmentations lyari and other settlements in karachi will need institutional structures and policies to ensure equitable and more just access to existing and any increased water supplies

frozen ground degradation would be mild during the near future and would be severe for the far future under rcp 8 5 this study provides valuable insights into the protection of frozen ground in the upper heihe river basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change long term warning system frost depth freezing thawing indices soil and water assessment tool 1 introduction frozen ground mainly including permafrost and seasonal refers to the phenomenon where ground temperature is equal to or lower than 0 c and the ground is frozen zimov et al 2006 woo et al 2018 frozen ground a key component of the terrestrial cryosphere is widely distributed in polar high latitude and plateau areas and its response to climate change is rapid and significant schuur et al 2015 because climate warming has disturbed the land atmosphere energy balance frozen ground has experienced large scale degradation particularly on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp and is characterized by a decrease in frozen soil thickness deepening of the active layer and transformation of continuous permafrost into discontinuous and island permafrost zou et al 2017 koven et al 2011 in addition permafrost degradation has further caused various problems such as vegetation changes shrinking and decline of wetlands intensified land desertification and increasing geomorphological hazards and disasters streletskiy et al 2015 owing to the sensitivity to the changes in external hydrothermal conditions in some regions global warming has resulted in regional degradation of frozen ground guglielmin et al 2018 lawrence et al 2012 used the community climate system model version 4 and community land model version 4 to evaluate permafrost in the arctic and found that under representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 permafrost was expected to decrease by 72 in this century the increase in the average annual temperature of the qtp by approximately 0 4 c 10y r from the 1960 2000 s which was considerably higher than the average global increase of 0 1 c 10y r has been observed in previous studies ran et al 2018 ran 2016 the permafrost in the upper heihe river basin uhrb located at the northeastern edge of the qtp is thinner and not as cold and therefore has a stronger response to climate change and human activities than the permafrost in the central and southern qtp jin et al 2009 additionally the uhrb has low relative humidity and high evaporation thus the frozen ground properties degradation degree and hydrological responses are different from those in other cold regions worldwide yang et al 2010 based on the daily average temperature at the depth of 0 0 3 2 m in the heihe river basin wang et al 2015 found that by the end of a 35 year time period 1972 2006 the annual onset of soil freezing has delayed by 2 days 10 yr and soil thawing has advanced by 4 days 10 yr equating to a total reduction of 6 days 10 yr in the annual duration of soil freezing in addition many scientists have revealed that the degradation of frozen ground is manifested in the shrinkage of permafrost and reduction in the maximum depth of seasonal frost penetration indicating that frozen ground in the uhrb is substantially degraded thus more studies are required to investigate this further qin et al 2020 previous studies have revealed that warming induced degradation of frozen ground has significantly changed the hydrological processes in alpine areas including soil moisture seasonality of runoff and movement and exchange of surface runoff and groundwater beniston et al 1997 iwasaki et al 2010 jin et al 2022 found that permafrost degradation improved groundwater storage and discharge to surface runoff by improving the hydraulic connectivity and reactivation of the groundwater system sjöberg et al 2021 indicated that the thawing process in the noatak river basin related to climate warming increased its contribution to water flow through deep and cold groundwater flow paths and this could reduce summer river temperatures which would have series effects on aquatic ecology mathematical models e g soil and water assessment tool swat organizing carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystems and variable infiltration capacity have been widely used to investigate hydrological responses to climate change in ground freezing and thawing areas clément et al 2017 bui et al 2020 wang et al 2020a gouttevin et al 2012 cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 integrating soil property investigation hydrological modeling swat and multivariate statistical analysis wu et al 2020 revealed that because of the ground freezing thawing process soil water content was a key driver of surface runoff in the headwater and highland sub basins on the qtp using the swat model with physic based freeze thaw cycles wang et al 2020b projected that reduced subsurface runoff was the main driver of declining trends in annual streamflow in the upper mississippi river basin in the uhrb frozen ground degradation might impact the surface hydrological cycle change runoff generation mechanisms and reduce surface runoff gao et al 2018 2019 as the primary water source for the entire heihe river basin the upper river has become an important water source for agriculture in the middle reaches and ecological protection in the lower reaches cheng et al 2014 thus the changes in the frozen ground in the uhrb could not only disrupt local hydrology but also pose a threat to the integrity of the aquatic environment in the middle and lower reaches of the heihe river basin most previous studies on warming and hydrological processes of frozen ground have focused on experimental research and localized field station observations however the spatiotemporal changes in degraded frozen ground and its hydrological effects are not well understood yang et al 2019 the lack of long term monitoring data because of the scarcity of meteorological stations and harsh environments in alpine areas has made it difficult to study long term changes in frozen ground supper et al 2014 however to minimize the need of physical data collection processes and application of indices empirical formulas and numerical simulations such as air and ground surface freezing and thawing indices n index temperature at top of permafrost model geophysical institute permafrost laboratory gipl model and stefan model have been proposed riseborough et al 2008 obu et al 2019 jin et al 2020 based on the analysis of surface and ground temperatures westermann et al 2015 found that the width of the transition zone between permafrost and non permafrost regions on the southern edge of scandinavia and russia gradually decreased the freezing thawing index is defined as the accumulated average daily temperature of below or above than 0 in a year the stefan model can calculate the maximum depth of frost penetration using soil property parameters and ground surface temperature bilotta et al 2015 many studies determined indicators using field station observations and then analyzed the spatial characteristics via the interpolation method rarely considering spatial heterogeneity resulting from the changes in land use and cover in the basin the daily soil temperature in the swat was determined as an empirical function of several variables including air temperature and ground surface temperature and soil temperature on the previous day while considering the thermal influences of snow and vegetation canopy cover as a weight factor arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 this module has successfully applied in many studies worldwide qi et al 2017 2019a nowadays swat has been applied to the freezing thawing cycle and soil temperature has been used to determine the freezing and thawing status of soils qi et al 2019b used the modified version of swat tswat to simulate the ground surface and soil temperatures frost depth and number of days at five depths therefore swat with hydrological response unit hru discretization based on topography climate land cover and soil type attributes can be used in analyzing freezing and thawing processes in terms of indices and frost depth the uhrb located in the qilian mountains is an important ecological barrier in northwest china even small changes in environmental factors can have a considerable impact on the fragile environment because the region is located on the margins of the qtp the freezing thawing states are highly sensitive to increasing temperatures leading to increased incidence of frozen ground degradation than in the central and southern qtp jin et al 2009 most studies have comprehensively explored the extent of frozen ground ground freezing duration and frozen ground distribution however these are inadequate to fully characterize the overall degradation status of frozen ground in this study a comprehensive evaluation index system was developed for frozen ground degradation to project the degree of future degradation the aim of this study was to assess the response of frozen ground to climate change in the uhrb during the 21st century the specific objectives were to 1 analyze the spatiotemporal changes in freezing thawing factors and explore the relationship between frozen ground degradation and hydrological processes namely soil water and water yield 2 project the changes in freezing and thawing indices and frost depth under three rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and 3 develop a long term warning system for measuring the risk and degree of frozen ground degradation the evaluation method proposed in this study can help quantify the degree of frozen ground degradation and define the warning severity levels which is of considerable importance for frozen ground and ecological environmental protection of the basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the heihe river originating from the northern flank of the qilian mountains 98 50 e 101 20 e 37 80 n 39 20 n is the second largest inland river in china with a length of 820 km the catchment area of the uhrb is 9900 km2 accounting for 6 9 of the heihe river basin fig 1 the average annual precipitation during 1976 2015 is 323 mm and the average annual temperature is approximately 0 5 c the average annual runoff measured at the yingluoxia hydrological station is 1 66 109 m3 with summer runoff accounting for more than 50 of this value there are three major land use types in this region grassland 57 barren land 19 and forest 16 frozen ground distribution is primarily a factor of elevation which ranges between 1556 and 5003 m in the uhrb permafrost in the uhrb is located above 3600 m above sea level a s l and seasonal frost is located below 3600 m a s l peng et al 2016 the permafrost zone accounted for approximately 52 and seasonal frozen ground accounted for approximately 48 of the study area with the annual maximum frost depth exceeding 2 5 m 2 2 data meteorological data used in this study include daily maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity we used data collected at four meteorological stations between 1966 and 2015 from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the 90 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem were used to extract the flow direction and accumulation create streams delineate the watershed and calculate the subbasin parameters land use data for the year 1980 1 1 km and soil data at a scale of 1 1 000 000 were provided by the environmental and ecological science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn according to the harmonized world soil database hwsd the soil depth in the basin was predominantly 1 5 m except for leptisols with a depth of 0 3 m the monthly streamflow data observed over the period 1966 2015 at the yingluoxia hydrological station were obtained from the yearbook of hydrological observation in this study we used climate projection data from eight general circulation models gcms to perform swat modeling under the rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios which represent a very low forcing scenario medium stabilization scenario and very high emission scenario respectively see table 1 the daily data sets specifically precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures used in the modeling were downloaded from the earth system grid federation esgf website http pcmdi9 llnl gov we performed bilinear interpolation and simple bias correction on both observational and gcm data from 1966 to 1985 bae et al 2015 hu et al 2021 the downscaled gcms were validated against historical observational data from 1986 to 2005 where it was found that both the simulated downscaled precipitation and temperature values were consistent with the observed values suggesting that the actual climatic conditions of the uhrb could be accurately reflected by the downscaled climate data derived from the gcms fig s4 the prediction period was divided into two time periods to compare the changes in the freezing thawing processes near future from 2020 to 2059 and far future from 2060 to 2099 2 3 model setup calibration and validation the swat model was developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars and has been widely used to project the impact of climate change and land use and cover change on water sediment and chemical components arnold et al 2012 the hydrological components in the swat are based on the water balance equation gassman et al 2007 1 sw t sw i 1 t r i q i et i p i ql i where sw is the soil water content i is the time t days for the simulation period r mm q mm et mm p mm and ql mm are the daily amounts of precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration percolation and subsurface lateral flow respectively hydrological response unit hru the basic unit in swat is defined as a unique aggregation of land use soil properties and terrain slope flügel 2010 patel and srivastava 2013 we delineated the uhrb into 135 subbasins and 1369 hrus and calibrated the model based on monthly streamflow using the swat cup calibration and uncertainty procedures with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm kumar et al 2017 finally we used numeric criteria to evaluate model performance including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pbias appendix 1 2 4 annual freezing thawing indices and frost depth in this study we used the daily observed air temperature data and swat simulated ground surface temperature data to calculate the air and ground surface freezing and thawing indices fi a fi g ti a and ti g neitsch et al 2011 annual freezing thawing indices refer to the accumulated temperatures below or above 0 c we set the freezing period from july 1 t 0 to june 30 t 1 of the following year and the thawing period from january 1 t 2 to december 31 t 3 the indices can be calculated as follows 2 fi a t 0 t 1 t a dt fi g t 0 t 1 t g dt t 0 3 ti a t 2 t 3 t a dt ti g t 2 t 3 t g dt t 0 where t a represents the air temperature c and t g represents the ground surface temperature c we then used the stefan formula to estimate the frost depth using the following equation that can be represented as follows 4 fd 2 k f n f fi a lw p b where fd represents the frost depth m k f represents the thermal conductivity of frozen soils w m 1 1 n f represents n factor fi g fi a fi a represents air freezing index c d l represents the latent heat j kg 1 w represents the soil water content by weight and p b represents the soil bulk density kg m 3 because the stefan formula includes many parameters that are difficult to obtain harlan and nixon 1978 simplified the formula using parameter e 5 e 2 k f n f lw p b 6 fd e fi a in our study frost depth refers to the potential frost depth of active layer in permafrost areas and the maximum frost depth in the seasonally frozen area 2 5 gray correlation analysis to analyze the impact of frozen ground degradation on hydrological processes we chose gray correlation analysis which provides only a partial understanding of the system zhang et al 2019 the gray correlation analysis method was used to identify the major controlling factors of the variable we defined x 0 t t 1 2 m as the time series of the target variable and x i t i 1 2 n as the n influence variable first we normalized the following influence variables 7 x ni t x i t x i 8 x i 1 m i 1 m x i t when the time step is t the expression of the gray correlation can be given as follows 9 ζ o i t min i min i δ o i t ρ max i max i δ o i t δ o i t ρ max i max i δ o i t where ζ o i t represents the gray correlation coefficient among variables ρ represents the resolution coefficient we took 0 5 referring to researches finally the calculation expression of the gray correlation degree g oi can be given as follows 10 g o i 1 m i 1 m ζ o i t the closer it is to one the better the correlation degree 2 6 long term warning system and entropy method it is challenging to evaluate the state of frozen ground degradation using a single index therefore that is why we selected five indices including frost depth air freezing index ground surface freezing index air thawing index and ground surface thawing index first we calculated the differences between the indices in the two future time periods 2020 2059 and 2060 2099 and in the baseline period 1976 2015 second we split the differences of each index into four thresholds using to the quartile method and assigned values of 1 2 3 and 4 representing four levels we then used the entropy method to determine the weight of each index finally we calculated the weighted grades of five indices on hru scale and rated the degree of frozen ground degradation in terms of four levels of increasing severity mild moderate severe and extreme corresponding to grades of 0 1 1 2 2 3 and 3 4 respectively fig a1 the entropy method is presented below firstly the indices were normalized suppose j indices are given as follows x i x 1 x 2 x n y 1 y 2 y j second a positive index can be referred to as a positive effect on the preservation of permafrost 11 y ij x i j min x i max x i min x i the negative index can be represented as follows 12 y ij max x i x ij max x i min x i we then calculated the proportion of the index value of the i th item under the j th index as follows 13 p ij y i j i 1 n y i j finally we calculated the entropy e j and weight w j of the data as follows 14 e j ln n 1 i 1 n p i j ln p i j 15 w j e j j 1 m e j 3 results 3 1 model evaluation a visual comparison of the monthly simulated streamflow data compared to observational data for the calibration 1971 1993 and validation 1994 2016 periods is shown in fig 2 although there were two underestimated i e 1971 and 1987 and three overestimated i e 1972 1983 and 1998 peak flows during years with extreme water quantities the monthly streamflow simulations generally corresponded well with the observations based on the performance ratings by assuming typical uncertainty in observations given by pereira et al 2016 our streamflow simulations could be evaluated as satisfied pbias 10 nse 0 80 and r2 0 80 therefore our model performed well and is acceptable for this study 3 2 changes in air temperature and hydrological processes fig s2 shows the temporal and spatial changes in the maximum and minimum air temperatures the annual average maximum temperature was 10 1 c which exhibited an upward trend with a significant increase of 0 4 c 10y r compared to the trend prior 2000 the growth rate has slowed since the 21st century as shown in fig s2 b we observed that the maximum temperature in the study area ranged from 6 5 to 16 c with higher temperatures in the northeast and close to the basin outlet with an increasing trend of 0 039 0 045 c yr in contrast the minimum temperature varied from 10 05 to 0 65 c with the highest range 5 5 0 65 c at the basin outlet as shown in fig s2 c the minimum temperature was highest in 2009 at 4 6 c and lowest in 1975 at 7 5 c with an average of 6 c during 1976 2015 the simulated annual average soil water was approximately 103 3 mm during the period 1976 2015 seasonal analysis of soil water revealed a slight increase during spring and summer but a decrease during in autumn and winter fig 3 a and b leading to a slight overall annual increase of 0 12 mm yr the soil water level was higher at between 251 and 514 mm in the northwestern part of the basin but lower between 0 and 250 mm in the remainder of the study area the soil water trend in the study area exhibited spatial heterogeneity with the largest reduction of 7 5 mm yr observed in the northwestern region fig 3 c and d the basin average water yield amounted to approximately 175 4 mm during the study period with a 109 2 mm in 1996 to 257 6 mm in 2004 with an increasing trend observed in most areas of the uhrb fig 3 e and h table 2 3 3 spatiotemporal distribution of the freezing thawing factors 3 3 1 changes in freezing thawing indices we analyzed the variation in the freezing and thawing indices of the uhrb fig 4 and found that the annual average air freezing index was 1694 c d with the highest index of 2063 c d in 1977 and lowest index of 1196 c d observed in 2003 the ground surface freezing index range was 1412 2317 c d which was a slightly higher than the air freezing index from 1976 to 2015 the air and ground surface freezing indices significantly decreased at the rate of 75 9 and 66 7 c d 10 yr respectively spatially air and ground surface freezing indices ranged from 624 to 1889 c d and 444 5632 c d fig s4 respectively with higher indices being observed in the western part and lower indices near the uhrb outlet northeast corresponding to the distribution of temperature and altitude the freezing indices decreased in the entire basin particularly in the west up to 12 35 c d yr where they substantially decreased the air thawing index was lower than the ground surface thawing index and the ranging 1483 1909 d and 1690 2170 d respectively fig 4 a a larger air h air thawing index was observed at yingluoxia hydrological station with a maximum value of 3731 d and the west branch had a lower index with a minimum of 1251 d fig s4 the spatial distribution of the ground surface thawing index was comparable to that of the air thawing index and the highest index in study area was 3963 d based on the trend analysis a change in air thawing index of 8 0 9 8 d yr and 6 75 8 0 d yr was evident in the north and west respectively the distribution of the change rate of the ground surface thawing index was more dispersed than that of the air thawing index and increased by 14 2 d yr near yingluoxia station fig 4 b shows that the difference in the air freezing index and air thawing index revealed a significant downward trend while the ratio of the air thawing index to the air freezing index increased and gradually exceeded one indicating that the heat in the uhrb was accumulating and the frozen ground tended to degrade 3 3 2 spatiotemporal changes in frost depth and hydrological impacts as presented in table 3 we selected different e values for different land use and applied them to stefan formula to calculate the frost depth fd in the uhrb fig 5 from 1976 to 2015 the annual average frost depth was 1 5 m which significantly decreased at a rate of 3 cm 10 yr with an increase in altitude and decrease in temperature the frost depth gradually increased from northeast to the southwest the area with a frost depth of 1 5 2 0 m accounted for the largest proportion at 45 9 primarily distributed in the western part of the basin and the area with frost depth of 1 1 5 m accounted for 30 5 primarily distributed in the east the frost depth in the southwest was 2 2 64 m and accounted for 14 7 of the basin fig 5 b shows that the frost depth of the basin decreased at a rate of 0 001 0 007 m yr with the highest change occurring in the southeast the decreasing trend in the central and western regions of the basin was relatively slow in this study soil water and water yield were used as target variables and the influencing variables such as precipitation temperature and frost depth were used to identify the degree of seasonal influence the results showed that frost depth had the largest gray relational degree in spring summer and autumn indicating that the change in frost depth was the major controlling factor of soil water in these seasons fig 5 c the gray relational degrees of frost depth and temperature in winter were almost equal suggesting that frost depth and temperature equally affected the change in soil water in winter fig 5 d shows the gray relational degree of seasonal water yield with precipitation temperature and frost depth in the uhrb the influence of precipitation and frost depth in autumn was similar indicating that the water yield was almost equally affected by both precipitation and frost depth during this season in summer the gray relational degree between precipitation and water yield was the highest thus summer precipitation was the major factor influencing water yield in the uhrb 3 4 projected changes in freezing thawing factors 3 4 1 projected changes in freezing thawing indices the air thawing index is projected to increase by 15 4 19 3 during the near future and 18 3 58 during the far future fig 6 respectively the change in the ground surface thawing index was smaller than the air thawing index that is the ground surface thawing index would increase by 7 8 and 8 9 under rcp 2 6 by 9 6 and 20 under rcp 4 5 and by 10 and 39 9 under rcp 8 5 respectively during the near future and far future periods fig s4 a shows that the air thawing index might increase in the future by 196 2845 d when compared with historical period a high air thawing index is expected in the east branch and the area near the outlet whereas a small increment is expected in the western part of the uhrb although the ground surface thawing index might decrease in the smaller area of the west branch under rcp 2 6 with a range of 39 to 1 d it would increase in most areas by 1 1469 d under three rcps fig s4 b air and ground surface freezing indices are anticipated to decrease by 15 1 18 6 and 7 6 11 7 respectively during the near future period relative to the baseline period however for the far future the decreasing rates are slightly higher at 15 8 45 7 for the air freezing index and 9 2 38 6 for the ground surface freezing index fig 6 c and d in particular the decreasing trend of freezing indices was high in the west and low in the eastern part of the uhrb which contrasted with the distribution of thawing indices fig s4 c and d 3 4 2 projected changes in frost depth fig 6 e shows the projected annual change in the frost depth in the uhrb the frost depth was projected to decrease by 0 07 m under rcp 2 6 0 09 m under rcp 4 5 and 0 1 m under rcp 8 5 during the near future period during far future period the frost depth would be shallower under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with a decrease of 0 17 m and 0 36 m respectively in fig 7 we compared the projected frost depth with the baseline on the hru scale and we found that the areas with conspicuous decline were primarily concentrated near the basin outlet with a change range of 1 17 to 0 01 m under rcp 2 6 the spatial variations in frost depth during two future periods was similar and the range of decline was 0 01 0 74 m under rcp 4 5 the frost depth in the center and eastern part of the basin and near the yingluoxia station would decrease more sharply during the far future period fig 7 b shows that the area with a frost depth lower than 1 m and 1 1 5 m increased from 3 6 and 30 5 during the baseline period to 13 2 and 51 3 in the future respectively under rcp 8 5 the area with frost depths of with less than 1 m would increase to 27 6 the area with frost depths of 1 5 2 m would decrease from 45 9 to 16 4 and the area with frost depth exceeding 2 m would reduce to 0 9 indicating a significant reduction of in frost depth 3 5 long term warning system we used the quartile method to determine the thresholds and entropy method to determine the weight of indices when developing the index system to evaluate frozen ground degradation table 4 according to the calculated warning levels we found that under rcp 2 6 the degree of frozen ground degradation would primarily be mild 74 5 during the near future period and that the moderate degradation area would account for 22 6 which is primarily distributed in the western source area and areas close to the basin outlet fig 8 by 2099 the area of mildly degraded frozen ground would decrease to 37 3 and the area of moderate degradation would increase to 59 1 under rcp 4 5 the areas with mild and moderate degradation would account for 14 4 and 81 4 of the entire basin during from 2020 to 2059 respectively during the far future period the degradation degree is projected to be primarily severe and frozen ground degradation would be more severe in the northwest of the basin under rcp 8 5 there would be no mild degradation area in the uhrb and the area with severe degradation would slightly increase in the western section of the basin accounting for 16 8 from 2060 to 2099 with substantial warming the frozen ground in the entire basin is projected to extensively degrade and the western edge of the basin would be in a severe degradation state 4 discussion 4 1 changes in the freezing thawing factors in this study we selected the air freezing index ground surface freezing index air thawing index ground surface thawing index and frost depth as key factors for evaluating frozen ground degradation over the study period the annual average air and ground surface freezing indices in the uhrb were 1522 and 1754 d respectively and were higher than those in the upper reaches of the yellow river 1154 and 850 d respectively and in the upper brahmaputra river basin 937 and 628 d respectively wang et al 2019 liu et al 2021 meanwhile the average thawing indices were 1697 d air and 1925 d ground surface which were lower than those in northern china 2514 and 3101 d respectively indicating that the heat of frozen ground was lower in the uhrb than in southeastern qinghai tibet plateau and north china luo et al 2014 during 1976 2015 the average frost depth ranged from 1 3 to 1 7 m decreasing by 3 cm 10 yr which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2015 who reported a decrease of 4 cm 10 yr in the middle and lower heihe river basin however this decline rate was considerably lower than that in the headwater area of the yellow river 1 2 cm yr qin et al 2017 suggesting a slow degeneration of the freezing capacity in the uhrb compared to the central qtp according to previous studies latitude and altitude were key factors affecting freezing thawing peng et al 2017 in the study area altitude had a greater impact on the freezing index where the freezing index was higher in high altitude areas whereas latitude had a relatively small effect for example the difference in the latitude between the southeast section and basin outlet was evident however the air and ground surface freezing indices near the outlet in the northern region were lower indicating that altitude was the predominant factor affecting the changes in freezing thawing indices in the uhrb 4 2 influence of frozen ground degradation on soil water and water yield the influence of precipitation temperature and frost depth on hydrological processes was quantified via gray correlation analysis our results showed that frost depth had a strong influence on the changes in soil water in spring summer and autumn in winter both frost depth and temperature affected the amount of soil water therefore the decrease in soil water in winter was mainly affected by the increase in temperature and the decrease in frost depth the shallower frost depth which indicated a decrease in the freezing potential in the basin caused additional soil water loss through evapotranspiration and runoff li et al 2021 the water yield increased by 0 05 mm per year in spring which was primarily attributed to the thawing of originally frozen water because of frozen ground degradation in summer the water yield exhibited a more conspicuous upward trend at a rate of 0 33 mm yr this is because although global warming increased evapotranspiration precipitation was the major controlling factor in summer moreover lateral infiltration and flow production increased because the decrease in freezing potential released more water from the soil through hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration or water production and permafrost degradation resulted in the loss of water originally stored in the soil walvoord and kurylyk 2016 therefore the increase in warming induced evapotranspiration was offset by the increase in precipitation and decrease in frost depth leading to a high water yield in summer 4 3 implications of long term warning system and uncertainties in addition to hydrological processes frozen ground degradation has an impact on ecology such as the carbon cycle and vegetation growth as well as stability of engineering structures and could eventually lead to considerable economic losses yang et al 2010 therefore evaluating the impacts of climate change on degraded land is important the changes in environmental factors are spatially heterogeneous for example the thawing indices were projected to significantly increase in the eastern branch of the basin in the future suggesting an increase in the frozen ground temperature in this area whereas the opposite is true for the western part i e a decreasing freezing capacity in this study using gcms data we analyzed the projected change in the maximum and minimum air temperatures from 2020 to 2099 fig s5 and found that under rcp 8 5 the maximum and minimum temperatures would increase by 4 5 and 4 4 subsequently based on the temperature projection results we selected various indicators to evaluate the future degradation degree of frozen soil and defined a long term warning level the degree of frozen ground degradation in the uhrb was primarily mild and moderate during the near future period however severe and extreme cases may occur by the end of this century notably the soil water and water yield in the western branch of the basin exhibited a downward trend in the baseline period and would be further exacerbated by the increase in temperature and frozen ground degradation in the future the reduction in water yield in the water source area might not only have an impact on the local area but also pose a threat to water safety downstream in addition the degradation of frozen ground and change in soil water content would affect vegetation growth particularly during spring in this study surface temperature was calculated based on land cover and soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity and bulk density ignoring other factors e g snow cover and geological conditions the impacts of comprehensive land surface conditions such as dynamic land use and improved hydrological representation on freezing thawing processes deserve further investigations owing to the complex processes of the water cycle and substantial influencing factors the gray correlation analysis results could only show that the changes in soil freezing capacity play a significant role when compared with temperature and precipitation 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal changes in frozen ground between 1976 and 2015 in the upper heihe river basin uhrb and projected the effects of climate change on the freezing thawing status by combining swat gcms and air and ground freezing thawing indices finally we developed a long term warning system to quantify the potential degree of frozen ground degradation the air and ground surface freezing indices in the uhrb significantly decreased during the historical period and the air and ground surface thawing indices increased suggesting accumulation of heat in the study area the frost depth with an average of 1 5 m was shallower in the northeast predominantly 1 1 5 m and deeper in the western part with a depth of 1 5 2 64 m through swat simulation and gray relational analysis method we found that water yield in summer and autumn was controlled by precipitation and frost depth the quantification of the impacts of climate change on freezing thawing showed that the freezing indices would decrease and when compared to the baseline the air and ground surface thawing indices would increase by 18 58 and 9 40 for respectively in the latter part of the century the frost depth was projected to decrease by 0 07 0 1 m during the near future period and by 0 08 0 36 m during the far future period indicating that the frozen soil would continue to degrade in the future in addition by constructing a long term warning system we evaluated the potential degree of severity of frozen ground degradation during the near future period 2020 2059 the degradation degree would be predominantly mild and moderate whereas at the end of the century the degradation would be extreme under rcp 8 5 especially in upstream of western part and the area near the basin outlet in summary this study is helpful in understanding the degradation characteristics of frozen ground in alpine areas under changing environment quantitative assessment of freezing thawing indices responses to climate change could provide valuable scientific guidance for permafrost environmental management and regional socioeconomic development credit authorship

7902,study region upper heihe river basin northwest china study focus we investigated potential climate change under three representative concentration pathways rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and their impacts on frozen ground in the upper heihe river basin using the ensemble climate data from eight general circulation models and the soil and water assessment tool swat new hydrological insights for the region air and ground freezing indices declined significantly during the baseline period 1976 2015 whereas the thawing indices increased indicating the heat accumulation in study area the frost depth which refers to the potential frost depth of active layer in permafrost areas and the maximum frost depth in seasonally frozen areas decreased significantly at the rate of 3 cm 10 yr the swat simulation and gray relational analysis revealed that soil water was controlled by precipitation and frost depth in spring and autumn compared to that of the baseline the projected frost depth is projected to decline by 0 07 0 1 m during the near future 2020 2059 and 0 08 0 36 m for the far future 2060 2099 in addition we developed a long term warning system which indicates that the degree of frozen ground degradation would be mild during the near future and would be severe for the far future under rcp 8 5 this study provides valuable insights into the protection of frozen ground in the upper heihe river basin graphical abstract ga1 keywords climate change long term warning system frost depth freezing thawing indices soil and water assessment tool 1 introduction frozen ground mainly including permafrost and seasonal refers to the phenomenon where ground temperature is equal to or lower than 0 c and the ground is frozen zimov et al 2006 woo et al 2018 frozen ground a key component of the terrestrial cryosphere is widely distributed in polar high latitude and plateau areas and its response to climate change is rapid and significant schuur et al 2015 because climate warming has disturbed the land atmosphere energy balance frozen ground has experienced large scale degradation particularly on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp and is characterized by a decrease in frozen soil thickness deepening of the active layer and transformation of continuous permafrost into discontinuous and island permafrost zou et al 2017 koven et al 2011 in addition permafrost degradation has further caused various problems such as vegetation changes shrinking and decline of wetlands intensified land desertification and increasing geomorphological hazards and disasters streletskiy et al 2015 owing to the sensitivity to the changes in external hydrothermal conditions in some regions global warming has resulted in regional degradation of frozen ground guglielmin et al 2018 lawrence et al 2012 used the community climate system model version 4 and community land model version 4 to evaluate permafrost in the arctic and found that under representative concentration pathways rcp 8 5 permafrost was expected to decrease by 72 in this century the increase in the average annual temperature of the qtp by approximately 0 4 c 10y r from the 1960 2000 s which was considerably higher than the average global increase of 0 1 c 10y r has been observed in previous studies ran et al 2018 ran 2016 the permafrost in the upper heihe river basin uhrb located at the northeastern edge of the qtp is thinner and not as cold and therefore has a stronger response to climate change and human activities than the permafrost in the central and southern qtp jin et al 2009 additionally the uhrb has low relative humidity and high evaporation thus the frozen ground properties degradation degree and hydrological responses are different from those in other cold regions worldwide yang et al 2010 based on the daily average temperature at the depth of 0 0 3 2 m in the heihe river basin wang et al 2015 found that by the end of a 35 year time period 1972 2006 the annual onset of soil freezing has delayed by 2 days 10 yr and soil thawing has advanced by 4 days 10 yr equating to a total reduction of 6 days 10 yr in the annual duration of soil freezing in addition many scientists have revealed that the degradation of frozen ground is manifested in the shrinkage of permafrost and reduction in the maximum depth of seasonal frost penetration indicating that frozen ground in the uhrb is substantially degraded thus more studies are required to investigate this further qin et al 2020 previous studies have revealed that warming induced degradation of frozen ground has significantly changed the hydrological processes in alpine areas including soil moisture seasonality of runoff and movement and exchange of surface runoff and groundwater beniston et al 1997 iwasaki et al 2010 jin et al 2022 found that permafrost degradation improved groundwater storage and discharge to surface runoff by improving the hydraulic connectivity and reactivation of the groundwater system sjöberg et al 2021 indicated that the thawing process in the noatak river basin related to climate warming increased its contribution to water flow through deep and cold groundwater flow paths and this could reduce summer river temperatures which would have series effects on aquatic ecology mathematical models e g soil and water assessment tool swat organizing carbon and hydrology in dynamic ecosystems and variable infiltration capacity have been widely used to investigate hydrological responses to climate change in ground freezing and thawing areas clément et al 2017 bui et al 2020 wang et al 2020a gouttevin et al 2012 cherkauer and lettenmaier 1999 integrating soil property investigation hydrological modeling swat and multivariate statistical analysis wu et al 2020 revealed that because of the ground freezing thawing process soil water content was a key driver of surface runoff in the headwater and highland sub basins on the qtp using the swat model with physic based freeze thaw cycles wang et al 2020b projected that reduced subsurface runoff was the main driver of declining trends in annual streamflow in the upper mississippi river basin in the uhrb frozen ground degradation might impact the surface hydrological cycle change runoff generation mechanisms and reduce surface runoff gao et al 2018 2019 as the primary water source for the entire heihe river basin the upper river has become an important water source for agriculture in the middle reaches and ecological protection in the lower reaches cheng et al 2014 thus the changes in the frozen ground in the uhrb could not only disrupt local hydrology but also pose a threat to the integrity of the aquatic environment in the middle and lower reaches of the heihe river basin most previous studies on warming and hydrological processes of frozen ground have focused on experimental research and localized field station observations however the spatiotemporal changes in degraded frozen ground and its hydrological effects are not well understood yang et al 2019 the lack of long term monitoring data because of the scarcity of meteorological stations and harsh environments in alpine areas has made it difficult to study long term changes in frozen ground supper et al 2014 however to minimize the need of physical data collection processes and application of indices empirical formulas and numerical simulations such as air and ground surface freezing and thawing indices n index temperature at top of permafrost model geophysical institute permafrost laboratory gipl model and stefan model have been proposed riseborough et al 2008 obu et al 2019 jin et al 2020 based on the analysis of surface and ground temperatures westermann et al 2015 found that the width of the transition zone between permafrost and non permafrost regions on the southern edge of scandinavia and russia gradually decreased the freezing thawing index is defined as the accumulated average daily temperature of below or above than 0 in a year the stefan model can calculate the maximum depth of frost penetration using soil property parameters and ground surface temperature bilotta et al 2015 many studies determined indicators using field station observations and then analyzed the spatial characteristics via the interpolation method rarely considering spatial heterogeneity resulting from the changes in land use and cover in the basin the daily soil temperature in the swat was determined as an empirical function of several variables including air temperature and ground surface temperature and soil temperature on the previous day while considering the thermal influences of snow and vegetation canopy cover as a weight factor arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2011 this module has successfully applied in many studies worldwide qi et al 2017 2019a nowadays swat has been applied to the freezing thawing cycle and soil temperature has been used to determine the freezing and thawing status of soils qi et al 2019b used the modified version of swat tswat to simulate the ground surface and soil temperatures frost depth and number of days at five depths therefore swat with hydrological response unit hru discretization based on topography climate land cover and soil type attributes can be used in analyzing freezing and thawing processes in terms of indices and frost depth the uhrb located in the qilian mountains is an important ecological barrier in northwest china even small changes in environmental factors can have a considerable impact on the fragile environment because the region is located on the margins of the qtp the freezing thawing states are highly sensitive to increasing temperatures leading to increased incidence of frozen ground degradation than in the central and southern qtp jin et al 2009 most studies have comprehensively explored the extent of frozen ground ground freezing duration and frozen ground distribution however these are inadequate to fully characterize the overall degradation status of frozen ground in this study a comprehensive evaluation index system was developed for frozen ground degradation to project the degree of future degradation the aim of this study was to assess the response of frozen ground to climate change in the uhrb during the 21st century the specific objectives were to 1 analyze the spatiotemporal changes in freezing thawing factors and explore the relationship between frozen ground degradation and hydrological processes namely soil water and water yield 2 project the changes in freezing and thawing indices and frost depth under three rcp scenarios rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 and 3 develop a long term warning system for measuring the risk and degree of frozen ground degradation the evaluation method proposed in this study can help quantify the degree of frozen ground degradation and define the warning severity levels which is of considerable importance for frozen ground and ecological environmental protection of the basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the heihe river originating from the northern flank of the qilian mountains 98 50 e 101 20 e 37 80 n 39 20 n is the second largest inland river in china with a length of 820 km the catchment area of the uhrb is 9900 km2 accounting for 6 9 of the heihe river basin fig 1 the average annual precipitation during 1976 2015 is 323 mm and the average annual temperature is approximately 0 5 c the average annual runoff measured at the yingluoxia hydrological station is 1 66 109 m3 with summer runoff accounting for more than 50 of this value there are three major land use types in this region grassland 57 barren land 19 and forest 16 frozen ground distribution is primarily a factor of elevation which ranges between 1556 and 5003 m in the uhrb permafrost in the uhrb is located above 3600 m above sea level a s l and seasonal frost is located below 3600 m a s l peng et al 2016 the permafrost zone accounted for approximately 52 and seasonal frozen ground accounted for approximately 48 of the study area with the annual maximum frost depth exceeding 2 5 m 2 2 data meteorological data used in this study include daily maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity we used data collected at four meteorological stations between 1966 and 2015 from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn the 90 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem were used to extract the flow direction and accumulation create streams delineate the watershed and calculate the subbasin parameters land use data for the year 1980 1 1 km and soil data at a scale of 1 1 000 000 were provided by the environmental and ecological science data center for west china http westdc westgis ac cn according to the harmonized world soil database hwsd the soil depth in the basin was predominantly 1 5 m except for leptisols with a depth of 0 3 m the monthly streamflow data observed over the period 1966 2015 at the yingluoxia hydrological station were obtained from the yearbook of hydrological observation in this study we used climate projection data from eight general circulation models gcms to perform swat modeling under the rcp 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 scenarios which represent a very low forcing scenario medium stabilization scenario and very high emission scenario respectively see table 1 the daily data sets specifically precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures used in the modeling were downloaded from the earth system grid federation esgf website http pcmdi9 llnl gov we performed bilinear interpolation and simple bias correction on both observational and gcm data from 1966 to 1985 bae et al 2015 hu et al 2021 the downscaled gcms were validated against historical observational data from 1986 to 2005 where it was found that both the simulated downscaled precipitation and temperature values were consistent with the observed values suggesting that the actual climatic conditions of the uhrb could be accurately reflected by the downscaled climate data derived from the gcms fig s4 the prediction period was divided into two time periods to compare the changes in the freezing thawing processes near future from 2020 to 2059 and far future from 2060 to 2099 2 3 model setup calibration and validation the swat model was developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service usda ars and has been widely used to project the impact of climate change and land use and cover change on water sediment and chemical components arnold et al 2012 the hydrological components in the swat are based on the water balance equation gassman et al 2007 1 sw t sw i 1 t r i q i et i p i ql i where sw is the soil water content i is the time t days for the simulation period r mm q mm et mm p mm and ql mm are the daily amounts of precipitation surface runoff evapotranspiration percolation and subsurface lateral flow respectively hydrological response unit hru the basic unit in swat is defined as a unique aggregation of land use soil properties and terrain slope flügel 2010 patel and srivastava 2013 we delineated the uhrb into 135 subbasins and 1369 hrus and calibrated the model based on monthly streamflow using the swat cup calibration and uncertainty procedures with the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm kumar et al 2017 finally we used numeric criteria to evaluate model performance including the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percentage bias pbias appendix 1 2 4 annual freezing thawing indices and frost depth in this study we used the daily observed air temperature data and swat simulated ground surface temperature data to calculate the air and ground surface freezing and thawing indices fi a fi g ti a and ti g neitsch et al 2011 annual freezing thawing indices refer to the accumulated temperatures below or above 0 c we set the freezing period from july 1 t 0 to june 30 t 1 of the following year and the thawing period from january 1 t 2 to december 31 t 3 the indices can be calculated as follows 2 fi a t 0 t 1 t a dt fi g t 0 t 1 t g dt t 0 3 ti a t 2 t 3 t a dt ti g t 2 t 3 t g dt t 0 where t a represents the air temperature c and t g represents the ground surface temperature c we then used the stefan formula to estimate the frost depth using the following equation that can be represented as follows 4 fd 2 k f n f fi a lw p b where fd represents the frost depth m k f represents the thermal conductivity of frozen soils w m 1 1 n f represents n factor fi g fi a fi a represents air freezing index c d l represents the latent heat j kg 1 w represents the soil water content by weight and p b represents the soil bulk density kg m 3 because the stefan formula includes many parameters that are difficult to obtain harlan and nixon 1978 simplified the formula using parameter e 5 e 2 k f n f lw p b 6 fd e fi a in our study frost depth refers to the potential frost depth of active layer in permafrost areas and the maximum frost depth in the seasonally frozen area 2 5 gray correlation analysis to analyze the impact of frozen ground degradation on hydrological processes we chose gray correlation analysis which provides only a partial understanding of the system zhang et al 2019 the gray correlation analysis method was used to identify the major controlling factors of the variable we defined x 0 t t 1 2 m as the time series of the target variable and x i t i 1 2 n as the n influence variable first we normalized the following influence variables 7 x ni t x i t x i 8 x i 1 m i 1 m x i t when the time step is t the expression of the gray correlation can be given as follows 9 ζ o i t min i min i δ o i t ρ max i max i δ o i t δ o i t ρ max i max i δ o i t where ζ o i t represents the gray correlation coefficient among variables ρ represents the resolution coefficient we took 0 5 referring to researches finally the calculation expression of the gray correlation degree g oi can be given as follows 10 g o i 1 m i 1 m ζ o i t the closer it is to one the better the correlation degree 2 6 long term warning system and entropy method it is challenging to evaluate the state of frozen ground degradation using a single index therefore that is why we selected five indices including frost depth air freezing index ground surface freezing index air thawing index and ground surface thawing index first we calculated the differences between the indices in the two future time periods 2020 2059 and 2060 2099 and in the baseline period 1976 2015 second we split the differences of each index into four thresholds using to the quartile method and assigned values of 1 2 3 and 4 representing four levels we then used the entropy method to determine the weight of each index finally we calculated the weighted grades of five indices on hru scale and rated the degree of frozen ground degradation in terms of four levels of increasing severity mild moderate severe and extreme corresponding to grades of 0 1 1 2 2 3 and 3 4 respectively fig a1 the entropy method is presented below firstly the indices were normalized suppose j indices are given as follows x i x 1 x 2 x n y 1 y 2 y j second a positive index can be referred to as a positive effect on the preservation of permafrost 11 y ij x i j min x i max x i min x i the negative index can be represented as follows 12 y ij max x i x ij max x i min x i we then calculated the proportion of the index value of the i th item under the j th index as follows 13 p ij y i j i 1 n y i j finally we calculated the entropy e j and weight w j of the data as follows 14 e j ln n 1 i 1 n p i j ln p i j 15 w j e j j 1 m e j 3 results 3 1 model evaluation a visual comparison of the monthly simulated streamflow data compared to observational data for the calibration 1971 1993 and validation 1994 2016 periods is shown in fig 2 although there were two underestimated i e 1971 and 1987 and three overestimated i e 1972 1983 and 1998 peak flows during years with extreme water quantities the monthly streamflow simulations generally corresponded well with the observations based on the performance ratings by assuming typical uncertainty in observations given by pereira et al 2016 our streamflow simulations could be evaluated as satisfied pbias 10 nse 0 80 and r2 0 80 therefore our model performed well and is acceptable for this study 3 2 changes in air temperature and hydrological processes fig s2 shows the temporal and spatial changes in the maximum and minimum air temperatures the annual average maximum temperature was 10 1 c which exhibited an upward trend with a significant increase of 0 4 c 10y r compared to the trend prior 2000 the growth rate has slowed since the 21st century as shown in fig s2 b we observed that the maximum temperature in the study area ranged from 6 5 to 16 c with higher temperatures in the northeast and close to the basin outlet with an increasing trend of 0 039 0 045 c yr in contrast the minimum temperature varied from 10 05 to 0 65 c with the highest range 5 5 0 65 c at the basin outlet as shown in fig s2 c the minimum temperature was highest in 2009 at 4 6 c and lowest in 1975 at 7 5 c with an average of 6 c during 1976 2015 the simulated annual average soil water was approximately 103 3 mm during the period 1976 2015 seasonal analysis of soil water revealed a slight increase during spring and summer but a decrease during in autumn and winter fig 3 a and b leading to a slight overall annual increase of 0 12 mm yr the soil water level was higher at between 251 and 514 mm in the northwestern part of the basin but lower between 0 and 250 mm in the remainder of the study area the soil water trend in the study area exhibited spatial heterogeneity with the largest reduction of 7 5 mm yr observed in the northwestern region fig 3 c and d the basin average water yield amounted to approximately 175 4 mm during the study period with a 109 2 mm in 1996 to 257 6 mm in 2004 with an increasing trend observed in most areas of the uhrb fig 3 e and h table 2 3 3 spatiotemporal distribution of the freezing thawing factors 3 3 1 changes in freezing thawing indices we analyzed the variation in the freezing and thawing indices of the uhrb fig 4 and found that the annual average air freezing index was 1694 c d with the highest index of 2063 c d in 1977 and lowest index of 1196 c d observed in 2003 the ground surface freezing index range was 1412 2317 c d which was a slightly higher than the air freezing index from 1976 to 2015 the air and ground surface freezing indices significantly decreased at the rate of 75 9 and 66 7 c d 10 yr respectively spatially air and ground surface freezing indices ranged from 624 to 1889 c d and 444 5632 c d fig s4 respectively with higher indices being observed in the western part and lower indices near the uhrb outlet northeast corresponding to the distribution of temperature and altitude the freezing indices decreased in the entire basin particularly in the west up to 12 35 c d yr where they substantially decreased the air thawing index was lower than the ground surface thawing index and the ranging 1483 1909 d and 1690 2170 d respectively fig 4 a a larger air h air thawing index was observed at yingluoxia hydrological station with a maximum value of 3731 d and the west branch had a lower index with a minimum of 1251 d fig s4 the spatial distribution of the ground surface thawing index was comparable to that of the air thawing index and the highest index in study area was 3963 d based on the trend analysis a change in air thawing index of 8 0 9 8 d yr and 6 75 8 0 d yr was evident in the north and west respectively the distribution of the change rate of the ground surface thawing index was more dispersed than that of the air thawing index and increased by 14 2 d yr near yingluoxia station fig 4 b shows that the difference in the air freezing index and air thawing index revealed a significant downward trend while the ratio of the air thawing index to the air freezing index increased and gradually exceeded one indicating that the heat in the uhrb was accumulating and the frozen ground tended to degrade 3 3 2 spatiotemporal changes in frost depth and hydrological impacts as presented in table 3 we selected different e values for different land use and applied them to stefan formula to calculate the frost depth fd in the uhrb fig 5 from 1976 to 2015 the annual average frost depth was 1 5 m which significantly decreased at a rate of 3 cm 10 yr with an increase in altitude and decrease in temperature the frost depth gradually increased from northeast to the southwest the area with a frost depth of 1 5 2 0 m accounted for the largest proportion at 45 9 primarily distributed in the western part of the basin and the area with frost depth of 1 1 5 m accounted for 30 5 primarily distributed in the east the frost depth in the southwest was 2 2 64 m and accounted for 14 7 of the basin fig 5 b shows that the frost depth of the basin decreased at a rate of 0 001 0 007 m yr with the highest change occurring in the southeast the decreasing trend in the central and western regions of the basin was relatively slow in this study soil water and water yield were used as target variables and the influencing variables such as precipitation temperature and frost depth were used to identify the degree of seasonal influence the results showed that frost depth had the largest gray relational degree in spring summer and autumn indicating that the change in frost depth was the major controlling factor of soil water in these seasons fig 5 c the gray relational degrees of frost depth and temperature in winter were almost equal suggesting that frost depth and temperature equally affected the change in soil water in winter fig 5 d shows the gray relational degree of seasonal water yield with precipitation temperature and frost depth in the uhrb the influence of precipitation and frost depth in autumn was similar indicating that the water yield was almost equally affected by both precipitation and frost depth during this season in summer the gray relational degree between precipitation and water yield was the highest thus summer precipitation was the major factor influencing water yield in the uhrb 3 4 projected changes in freezing thawing factors 3 4 1 projected changes in freezing thawing indices the air thawing index is projected to increase by 15 4 19 3 during the near future and 18 3 58 during the far future fig 6 respectively the change in the ground surface thawing index was smaller than the air thawing index that is the ground surface thawing index would increase by 7 8 and 8 9 under rcp 2 6 by 9 6 and 20 under rcp 4 5 and by 10 and 39 9 under rcp 8 5 respectively during the near future and far future periods fig s4 a shows that the air thawing index might increase in the future by 196 2845 d when compared with historical period a high air thawing index is expected in the east branch and the area near the outlet whereas a small increment is expected in the western part of the uhrb although the ground surface thawing index might decrease in the smaller area of the west branch under rcp 2 6 with a range of 39 to 1 d it would increase in most areas by 1 1469 d under three rcps fig s4 b air and ground surface freezing indices are anticipated to decrease by 15 1 18 6 and 7 6 11 7 respectively during the near future period relative to the baseline period however for the far future the decreasing rates are slightly higher at 15 8 45 7 for the air freezing index and 9 2 38 6 for the ground surface freezing index fig 6 c and d in particular the decreasing trend of freezing indices was high in the west and low in the eastern part of the uhrb which contrasted with the distribution of thawing indices fig s4 c and d 3 4 2 projected changes in frost depth fig 6 e shows the projected annual change in the frost depth in the uhrb the frost depth was projected to decrease by 0 07 m under rcp 2 6 0 09 m under rcp 4 5 and 0 1 m under rcp 8 5 during the near future period during far future period the frost depth would be shallower under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with a decrease of 0 17 m and 0 36 m respectively in fig 7 we compared the projected frost depth with the baseline on the hru scale and we found that the areas with conspicuous decline were primarily concentrated near the basin outlet with a change range of 1 17 to 0 01 m under rcp 2 6 the spatial variations in frost depth during two future periods was similar and the range of decline was 0 01 0 74 m under rcp 4 5 the frost depth in the center and eastern part of the basin and near the yingluoxia station would decrease more sharply during the far future period fig 7 b shows that the area with a frost depth lower than 1 m and 1 1 5 m increased from 3 6 and 30 5 during the baseline period to 13 2 and 51 3 in the future respectively under rcp 8 5 the area with frost depths of with less than 1 m would increase to 27 6 the area with frost depths of 1 5 2 m would decrease from 45 9 to 16 4 and the area with frost depth exceeding 2 m would reduce to 0 9 indicating a significant reduction of in frost depth 3 5 long term warning system we used the quartile method to determine the thresholds and entropy method to determine the weight of indices when developing the index system to evaluate frozen ground degradation table 4 according to the calculated warning levels we found that under rcp 2 6 the degree of frozen ground degradation would primarily be mild 74 5 during the near future period and that the moderate degradation area would account for 22 6 which is primarily distributed in the western source area and areas close to the basin outlet fig 8 by 2099 the area of mildly degraded frozen ground would decrease to 37 3 and the area of moderate degradation would increase to 59 1 under rcp 4 5 the areas with mild and moderate degradation would account for 14 4 and 81 4 of the entire basin during from 2020 to 2059 respectively during the far future period the degradation degree is projected to be primarily severe and frozen ground degradation would be more severe in the northwest of the basin under rcp 8 5 there would be no mild degradation area in the uhrb and the area with severe degradation would slightly increase in the western section of the basin accounting for 16 8 from 2060 to 2099 with substantial warming the frozen ground in the entire basin is projected to extensively degrade and the western edge of the basin would be in a severe degradation state 4 discussion 4 1 changes in the freezing thawing factors in this study we selected the air freezing index ground surface freezing index air thawing index ground surface thawing index and frost depth as key factors for evaluating frozen ground degradation over the study period the annual average air and ground surface freezing indices in the uhrb were 1522 and 1754 d respectively and were higher than those in the upper reaches of the yellow river 1154 and 850 d respectively and in the upper brahmaputra river basin 937 and 628 d respectively wang et al 2019 liu et al 2021 meanwhile the average thawing indices were 1697 d air and 1925 d ground surface which were lower than those in northern china 2514 and 3101 d respectively indicating that the heat of frozen ground was lower in the uhrb than in southeastern qinghai tibet plateau and north china luo et al 2014 during 1976 2015 the average frost depth ranged from 1 3 to 1 7 m decreasing by 3 cm 10 yr which was consistent with the results of wang et al 2015 who reported a decrease of 4 cm 10 yr in the middle and lower heihe river basin however this decline rate was considerably lower than that in the headwater area of the yellow river 1 2 cm yr qin et al 2017 suggesting a slow degeneration of the freezing capacity in the uhrb compared to the central qtp according to previous studies latitude and altitude were key factors affecting freezing thawing peng et al 2017 in the study area altitude had a greater impact on the freezing index where the freezing index was higher in high altitude areas whereas latitude had a relatively small effect for example the difference in the latitude between the southeast section and basin outlet was evident however the air and ground surface freezing indices near the outlet in the northern region were lower indicating that altitude was the predominant factor affecting the changes in freezing thawing indices in the uhrb 4 2 influence of frozen ground degradation on soil water and water yield the influence of precipitation temperature and frost depth on hydrological processes was quantified via gray correlation analysis our results showed that frost depth had a strong influence on the changes in soil water in spring summer and autumn in winter both frost depth and temperature affected the amount of soil water therefore the decrease in soil water in winter was mainly affected by the increase in temperature and the decrease in frost depth the shallower frost depth which indicated a decrease in the freezing potential in the basin caused additional soil water loss through evapotranspiration and runoff li et al 2021 the water yield increased by 0 05 mm per year in spring which was primarily attributed to the thawing of originally frozen water because of frozen ground degradation in summer the water yield exhibited a more conspicuous upward trend at a rate of 0 33 mm yr this is because although global warming increased evapotranspiration precipitation was the major controlling factor in summer moreover lateral infiltration and flow production increased because the decrease in freezing potential released more water from the soil through hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration or water production and permafrost degradation resulted in the loss of water originally stored in the soil walvoord and kurylyk 2016 therefore the increase in warming induced evapotranspiration was offset by the increase in precipitation and decrease in frost depth leading to a high water yield in summer 4 3 implications of long term warning system and uncertainties in addition to hydrological processes frozen ground degradation has an impact on ecology such as the carbon cycle and vegetation growth as well as stability of engineering structures and could eventually lead to considerable economic losses yang et al 2010 therefore evaluating the impacts of climate change on degraded land is important the changes in environmental factors are spatially heterogeneous for example the thawing indices were projected to significantly increase in the eastern branch of the basin in the future suggesting an increase in the frozen ground temperature in this area whereas the opposite is true for the western part i e a decreasing freezing capacity in this study using gcms data we analyzed the projected change in the maximum and minimum air temperatures from 2020 to 2099 fig s5 and found that under rcp 8 5 the maximum and minimum temperatures would increase by 4 5 and 4 4 subsequently based on the temperature projection results we selected various indicators to evaluate the future degradation degree of frozen soil and defined a long term warning level the degree of frozen ground degradation in the uhrb was primarily mild and moderate during the near future period however severe and extreme cases may occur by the end of this century notably the soil water and water yield in the western branch of the basin exhibited a downward trend in the baseline period and would be further exacerbated by the increase in temperature and frozen ground degradation in the future the reduction in water yield in the water source area might not only have an impact on the local area but also pose a threat to water safety downstream in addition the degradation of frozen ground and change in soil water content would affect vegetation growth particularly during spring in this study surface temperature was calculated based on land cover and soil properties such as hydraulic conductivity and bulk density ignoring other factors e g snow cover and geological conditions the impacts of comprehensive land surface conditions such as dynamic land use and improved hydrological representation on freezing thawing processes deserve further investigations owing to the complex processes of the water cycle and substantial influencing factors the gray correlation analysis results could only show that the changes in soil freezing capacity play a significant role when compared with temperature and precipitation 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the spatiotemporal changes in frozen ground between 1976 and 2015 in the upper heihe river basin uhrb and projected the effects of climate change on the freezing thawing status by combining swat gcms and air and ground freezing thawing indices finally we developed a long term warning system to quantify the potential degree of frozen ground degradation the air and ground surface freezing indices in the uhrb significantly decreased during the historical period and the air and ground surface thawing indices increased suggesting accumulation of heat in the study area the frost depth with an average of 1 5 m was shallower in the northeast predominantly 1 1 5 m and deeper in the western part with a depth of 1 5 2 64 m through swat simulation and gray relational analysis method we found that water yield in summer and autumn was controlled by precipitation and frost depth the quantification of the impacts of climate change on freezing thawing showed that the freezing indices would decrease and when compared to the baseline the air and ground surface thawing indices would increase by 18 58 and 9 40 for respectively in the latter part of the century the frost depth was projected to decrease by 0 07 0 1 m during the near future period and by 0 08 0 36 m during the far future period indicating that the frozen soil would continue to degrade in the future in addition by constructing a long term warning system we evaluated the potential degree of severity of frozen ground degradation during the near future period 2020 2059 the degradation degree would be predominantly mild and moderate whereas at the end of the century the degradation would be extreme under rcp 8 5 especially in upstream of western part and the area near the basin outlet in summary this study is helpful in understanding the degradation characteristics of frozen ground in alpine areas under changing environment quantitative assessment of freezing thawing indices responses to climate change could provide valuable scientific guidance for permafrost environmental management and regional socioeconomic development credit authorship

7903,study region patna is located on the southern bank of the river ganges in bihar india rapid population growth over the past few decades has driven an increase in groundwater abstraction from aquifers under the city study focus this study exeplores the pumping induced water exchange between the river ganges and groundwater under transient conditions between 2009 and 2015 using a numerical simulation the deterministic water exchange model within an uncertainty quantification was used to reveal the controlling factors affecting river water infiltration new hydrological insights for the region modelling reveals that under baseline eno pumping conditions the dominant 91 of the year flow direction is from the aquifer to the river which reverses 9 of the year when the river stage is high when a municipal pumping well is implemented river water infiltration into the aquifer increases to 68 of the year the groundwater pumping rate is found to be the most important factor affecting the river water infiltration whilst the groundwater table level is most sensitive to the well distance from the river followed by pumping rate optimizing the location depth and pumping rate of new wells in the area could mitigate fluvial contamination of the aquifer and help maintain groundwater levels keywords groundwater water exchange abstraction river water infiltration sensitivity analysis

and population growth are causing an increasing reliance on groundwater across the globe groundwater is often assumed to be less susceptible to contamination from surface derived contamination including pathogens and anthropogenic contaminants although the potential risks associated with geogenic groundwater contaminants are often significant like the dangerous concentrations of geogenic arsenic in groundwater because of changes of redox conditions etc charlet and polya 2006 ravenscroft et al 2009 richards et al 2021 2022 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the ganges alluvial plain in india has a rapidly increasing population and a growing dependence on groundwater chatterjee et al 2020 duttagupta et al 2020 kumar et al 2017 saha et al 2011 increasing abstraction for agriculture and

et al 2011 duttagupta et al 2020 in such areas most of the year the dominant groundwater flow direction is towards the river contributing to baseflow however the dominant flow direction frequently reverses during the monsoon season when river water infiltrates into aquifers due to a higher river stage relative to hydraulic heads in adjacent groundwater systems chatterjee et al 2020 das et al

city of patna bihar india observations made along a river groundwater transect in the study area enable a detailed assessment of the impacts of rapidly growing urban water demand on river groundwater interactions to be made the focus of our study is to determine to what extent groundwater pumping from modelled municipal drinking water supply boreholes can impact river groundwater interactions after calibrating the model with data from cgwb 2015 and evaluating the model with the available groundwater level observations we consider several plausible scenarios of groundwater abstraction regimes under transient conditions for both river water level and rainfall in the region to 1 quantify the extent of expected water exchange between the river ganges and groundwater under transient conditions 2 estimate the spatial distribution and residence time of river water infiltration in the shallow aquifers underlying patna 3 characterize the impact of monsoon on the water exchange and 4 identify the critical factors influencing the river groundwater exchange due to pumping with a global sensitivity analysis the findings of this study can contribute to baseline understanding to potentially inform groundwater management practice in patna and other similar rapidly expanding urban areas where the groundwater quality may be deteriorated by surface water sources through natural or anthropogenic groundwater surface water interactions duttagupta et al 2020 joekar niasar and ataie ashtiani 2009 richards et al 2021 2 methodology 2 1 case study patna is located on the southern bank of the river ganges in bihar india fig 1 over the past three decades there has been a substantial growth of the urban population as well as an expansion of industrial commercial activities with a concomitant increasing demand for water resulting in increased groundwater abstraction alakshendra 2019 saha et al 2014 the area has a sub tropical to sub humid climate with a monsoon season from june to september which accounts 82 of average annual rainfall cgwb 2015 july and august are the wettest months and in the past decade accounted for 51 of mean annual rainfall saha et al 2014 the middle ganges plain in patna is underlain by two major quaternary aquifers within a depth of 300 m below ground level separated by a 15 32 m thick clay sandy clay layer fig 1 saha et al 2014 a pervasive layer of clay mixed sand constitutes the top aquitard of the succession the presence of kankar nodules concretions of lime and fine sand makes this clay layer semi permeable underneath and near the ganges this clay sand clay layer consists of several thinner clay lens with sand the ganges is the groundwater outflow boundary according to the local hydrogeological conditions cgwb 2015 das 2021a 2021b with the net flow of groundwater from the south west to north east towards the ganges in patna cgwb 2015 2 2 hydrological parameterization subsurface layers were parameterized for the purposes of numerical modelling the modelling framework is described in section 2 3 the layer stratification and thickness were interpolated on the basis of previous geophysical logging reports cgwb 2015 in some locations near a cross section running roughly perpendicular from the ganges inland from patna fig 1b pumping test data of cgwb wells cgwb 2015 indicate that the transmissivity of the aquifers ranges between 4900 and 16000 m2 day with a mean of 8300 m2 day the specific capacity of the wells ranges from 56 100 m3 hr m and the mean hydraulic conductivity k has been reported 87 m day corresponding to that of coarse sand and coarse sand mixed with gravel hydraulic conductivity data obtained from pumping tests conducted by cgwb 2015 was utilized through interpolation in terms of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy vertical hydraulic conductivity was assumed to be 10 of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity cgwb 2015 the hydraulic conductivity of the top aquitard layer thickness 28 60 m has been estimated through grain size analysis cgwb 2015 the range of hydraulic conductivity for this layer varies from 5 m day to 20 m day the hydraulic conductivity of the first aquifer aquifer 1 lying between 40 and 110 m has been estimated to between 60 and 120 m day and the hydraulic conductivity of the deeper aquifer system aquifer 2 lying below 120 130 m depth has been estimated to be between 82 and 92 m day cgwb 2015 groundwater in the deeper aquifer occurs under semi confined to confined conditions due to the relatively poor hydraulic conductivity of the middle clay between aquifer 1 and aquifer 2 5 m day below aquifer 2 it is assumed to be impermeable hydraulic conductivity 7 2 10 3 4 7 10 2 m day cgwb 2015 the porosity of various major layers has been estimated using the equation given by vukovic and soro 1992 1 n 0 255 1 0 83 d 60 d 10 where d60 is the 40 retained grain size and d10 is the 90 retained grain size the calculated porosities are as follows 0 01 for clay layer top 0 35 for aquitard layer with range 0 34 0 37 0 38 for the middle aquifer aquifer 1 with range 0 36 0 4 and 0 35 for the deep aquifer aquifer 2 with range 0 33 0 40 cgwb 2015 porosity estimates could be improved in future models if direct corresponding measurements were systematically made with depth across the modelled transect however this data was not available at this time of this study the assumed structure of the subsurface may not capture local heterogeneity such as the existence of unknown clay lenses or high permeable lenses especially as the detailed 3d substructure of the modelled transect and wider study area is not available cgwb 2015 saha et al 2014 2 3 modelling framework a two dimensional domain was established to represent the 27 km cross section oriented approximately perpendicular to the river along expected dominant groundwater flow paths fig 1b this cross section starts from the river and goes in the direction of southwest it passes through the east patna urban area and crosses the south farming land until 27 km faraway from ganges in which the river is the outflow boundary and the location around 27 km is near the local surface water divide based on the gis data analysis it was selected because of the available geophysical survey profile which was nearby and parallel to this cross section cgwb 2015 it is also because that groundwater geochemical measurement was performed in several locations at this cross section along which the current work findings will be used for next step geogenic contamination numerical simulation richards et al 2021 we used this cross section to estimate the extent of groundwater river water exchange under natural transient conditions e g as influenced by seasonally variable river water levels and precipitation the 27 km longcross section is 250 m deep and 50 m wide which covers the effect radius of the pumping wells it was discretized into 4988 grid cells with variable horizontal discretization length ranging from 0 625 m near the river to 1000 m in the south boundary and variable vertical discretization length ranging from 0 625 m near the surface to 10 m at the bottom depths in total there are 172 columns and 29 layers for the discretization the river package in modflow 6 hughes et al 2017 is used for the gangetic model the conductance of the river boundary is 1000 m2 day assuming that the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed is 0 1 m day with a thickness of 0 5 m to establish boundary conditions for the river a time series of ganges water level data was provided by nasa viz pre swot hydrology grrats virtual station river heights coss et al 2020 the rainfall is the major water source term in the area average precipitation values for patna for the january 2009 to december 2014 period were used to establish the groundwater flow model as this represents a recent continuous record worldweatheronline 2021 fig 2 the ground surface elevation analysis also shows that the surface water runoff accumulates and flows mostly in direction to east and into the downstream of ganges in patna https earthexplorer usgs gov only the surface runoff in a small area at north west part of patna will flows directly to the ganges at patna the rainfall infiltration ratio was calibrated to fit the groundwater head distribution map of patna cgwb 2015 both of the rainfall rate and infiltration rate were assumed to be universal along the cross section the processing modflow platform chiang and kinzelbach 2003 was used to simulate water flow through modflow hughes et al 2017 and conservative tracer transport in the aquifer through mt3d bedekar et al 2016 and exchange with river water a transient model was set up for 6 years using existing rainfall and river level data this 6 year time period was restricted by availability of river water level data coss et al 2020 we also ran a steady state model for the initial groundwater distribution conservative tracers were virtually added in the river to track water exchange between the river and aquifer using a molecular diffusion coefficient of 8 64 10 5 m2 day and a horizontal dispersivity of 5 mm based on the reported aquifer grain size distribution cgwb 2015 the ratio between tracer concentration in the pumping well and initial concentration in the river c c0 0 1 and 0 01 respectively were used to identify the modelled proportion of river source water in the pumped water the transient model without introducing pumping schemes was performed as an initial base run to determine the extent of groundwater surface water exchange including the effect of the annual monsoon this base model was validated with the groundwater table data observed at kankerbagh patna two models considering the impact of pumping scenarios for municipal typically targeting deeper groundwater from aquifer 2 with depth 100 m and agricultural purposes typically targeting shallow groundwater in aquitard with depth 50 m were then run in the first scenario a new planned municipal purpose pumping well is located 1 km from the river with a depth of 175 m in aquifer 2 and a high pumping rate of 2000 m3 day the pumping rate of the municipal purpose well in patna is between 1875 and 2500 m3 day cgwg 2015 in the second scenario a new planned irrigation purpose pumping well is located 1 km from the river with a depth of 45 m in aquitard and a pumping rate of 1000 m3 day together with the base simulation the changes in residence time of water from the river were assessed two alternative models were run to estimate the effect of multiple wells on river and aquifer water exchange the pumping rates of two pumping wells were given as half of the rate of the single well scenario there was one well located also 1 km from the river and another well located at 2 km and 0 5 km from the river in the different two well scenarios respectively finally to investigate the sensitivity of well parameters affecting the water exchange dynamics we used the psuade problem solving environment for uncertainty analysis and design exploration code tong 2017 with the pmwin to conduct the uncertainty quantification uq analyses psuade is a software package for various uq activities such as uncertainty assessment global sensitivity analysis risk analysis design optimization and parameter identification three major factors were considered to simulate the effect of groundwater pumping on the water exchange between the aquifer and river pumping rate well distance from the river and well depth the daily pumping rate of the wells for drinking water supply in patna are typically between 1875 and 2500 m3 day calculated using estimated pumping rates and daily hours of usage cgwb 2015 the following ranges were used for sensitivity analysis 1800 2500 m3 day for pumping rates 2 3000 m perpendicular distance from the river for well locations and 15 225 m for well depth one pumping well was implemented for the sensitivity analysis given that total pumping rate is a more influential parameter on water exchange in comparison to well location or number of wells a latin hypercube method tong 2017 was used to produce 200 simulations with these different factors randomly distributed within the ranges indicated above the sensitivity of infiltrated river water extent area and the groundwater drawdown to the 3 factors were assessed in order to prevent the observation point from being close to the well in one model and far from the well in the other model the water drawdown at 25 km which is far from the pumping well in all models was selected for the final sensitivity analysis to determine the modelled destination and the travel times of the infiltrated river water individual conservative particles which will transport together with water were considered particles were released virtually into the river they were traced on their way into the aquifer when the river water level was relatively high and then out of the aquifer when the hydraulic head in the aquifer was relatively higher than that of the river the pathway of a particle was observed with time from a starting point particle transport velocities were described as dx dt v x t with the position of the particle x t at a specific time t given by the equation 2 x t x 0 0 t v x t ˆ d t ˆ where x 0 is the initial position of the particle and v x t is the seepage velocity at a particular location x t the seepage velocity was used to determine the travel time τ of a particle this was integrated eq 3 over the travel path of a particle beginning at its starting point x 0 and ending at an observation point x 3 τ x x 0 x dx v x a matlab code was developed to simulate the particle tracking process the seepage velocity was updated every time step based on the time dependent hydraulic head distribution 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation for the base scenario model the rainfall infiltration ratio was calibrated with the groundwater hydraulic head distribution data in cgwb 2015 therefore the initial hydraulic head distribution is consistent to those reported in cgwb 2015 cgwb 2015 reported also water table depth observation data collected monthly from november of 2011 to june of 2014 in patna area in which the well in kankerbagh around 3 km from the river is 500 m away from the modelled cross section fig 1b we used these data for the model validation fig 3 and the comparison show that the results of basic scenario model match the seasonal variability in observed groundwater levels the differences between the simulated and observed water table depth are in reasonable range fig 3a the mean error between calculated and observed values is 0 03 and the root mean squared error is 0 85 fig 3b the numerical model captured the observed water table depth evolution trend it increases during pre monsoon season decreases after the onset of the monsoon and then increases again in the post monsoon season the difference is relatively bigger at maxima and minima of the evolution curve fig 3a this is likely because a uniform precipitation rate and rainfall infiltration rate were used along the whole cross section the heterogeneity of the aquifer s physical properties is another possible reason for the smooth numerical evolution curve a slow infiltration of rainfall at the observation location will delay the groundwater table response to rainwater whilst also reducing variability exhibited in the water table evolution curve therefore detailed measurements of the heterogeneous distribution of porosity would improve future simulations the variable precipitation rate and rainfall infiltration rate in different parts of the cross section depending on in situ measurement and observation data would improve the delineation of the source term in the model seasonal tracer tests near the river would help also in model validation and identifying target areas for more detailed modelling 3 2 surface water groundwater interactions under transient conditions generally the ganges gains flow from groundwater in patna fig 4 because the alluvial plain has a higher piezometric head compared to the river water level the groundwater flows northward from the south of patna to the river fig s1 when the monsoon season starts typically in july precipitation increases as well as the water level in the ganges river near the river the hydraulic head in the aquifer responds to the river water quickly and has a similar temporal pattern to that of the river water level fig 4 and fig s1 the largest increases in hydraulic head in the river drive water flow from the river into the aquifer fig s1 and the yellow colored zone in fig 4 the numerical simulation shows that if river water infiltration occurs this mostly happens in late july august and early september depending on the annually dependent onset of the monsoon period and river water level fig 4 during the monsoonal period the groundwater hydraulic head in the aquifer increases near the river and the location of the minimum head values moves to 2 5 km away from the river extending to the south side of the urban area of patna city in late september even though the river water level is still high the accumulation of rainwater since june causes the accumulated hydraulic head in the south zone to become higher so the direction of groundwater flow changes back to from south to north i e towards the river again in september see fig s1 on average the ganges river becomes a source term for the groundwater just 9 of the year around 33 days with range 0 68 days for the selected cross section for the simulation period from 2009 to 2014 when the river water levels in 2010 and 2013 were still higher in august and september because of the relative high rainfall in the upstream region of ganges the rainfall in patna were lower so the river water moved into the aquifer for longer periods in those years fig 2 and fig 4 for example there were 68 days in 2013 with river water infiltration starting relatively early at the beginning of july however in 2009 the river water level was relatively low and the rainfall was higher than average in this year there was no river water movement into the aquifer the river water level in 2011 was relatively high but the precipitation in 2011 at patna was the highest in 6 years since most of the surface water runoff at patna region goes to the east direction and it flows finally to the downstream of ganges so the local rainfall would result in greater recharge to groundwater but less amount direct to the ganges in the north of patna then comparing with other year the river infiltration time was short 28 days starting mid july and the rate is lower compared to that in years of 2010 and 2013 the effect of high and prolonged precipitation in 2011 causing river infiltration in 2012 to have a very short duration 22 days starting at the beginning of august and a lower rate of flow in 2014 both the water level and rainfall in monsoon are low the river water infiltration started on middle of august and only lasted 19 days fig 4 the cgwb 2015 reports have shown that the groundwater table reached a minimum before the monsoon in 2014 due to low precipitation and continuing groundwater abstraction especially in urban areas which may cause river water inflow in some part of patna noting the river water level is also relatively low pre monsoon cgwb 2015 das et al 2021a showed that contribution of groundwater in ganges baseflow is estimated to be the highest during dry season whereas during monsoon the flow direction also reverses in varanasi river water and hence tracer infiltration varies considerably between years with the volumes particularly small in 2011 2012 and 2014 fig 5 there is a clear plume of the conservative tracer distributed in the shallow depth 75 m for short time 28 22 and 18 days for 2011 2012 and 2014 respectively the plume of the tracer extends horizontally and vertically with time the maximum distance and maximum depth of tracer plume are larger when the infiltration rate of river water is highest years 2010 and 2013 in fig 5 the tracer plume reaches the maximum extent at the middle of september thereafter because the water flux direction reverses the infiltrated tracers are transported towards the river and the plume shrinks when the flow from the river to aquifer is small 2011 2012 and 2014 the infiltrated tracer leaves the aquifer earlier and almost completely disappears at the end of the year when the flow of water from the river is high in the monsoon season the tracer needs a longer time to transport out of the aquifer and some tracer lasts until the following year fig 5a with c c0 0 01 in year 2013 the maximum residence time of the tracers in aquifer varied between 1 and 7 months a similar pattern of tracer transport is repeated every year with a different plume extent due to the variation of rainfall and river water level the maximum lateral extent of the plume is small reaching 75 m in years with higher rates of river water to aquifer flow whilst the maximum modelled depth of the plume in the aquifer was 45 m fig 5a with c c0 0 01 in year 2013 if the plume extent is instead estimated using the cut off concentration c c0 0 1 the modelled plume dissipates faster and moves out of the aquifer around 1 5 3 months after the start of the monsoon fig 5b and fig s2 as a result the majority of tracer moves in and out with the water exchange between river and aquifer but there is still a small proportion of the tracer that remains in the aquifer for a much longer time 3 3 effect of pumping on the river aquifer water exchange when there is a pumping well located 1 km from the river it significantly effects the water exchange between the river and aquifer fig 6 the maximum flux rate towards river decreases around 80 for the scenario with municipal purpose well and around 40 for the scenario with irrigation purpose well the decrease of flux rate towards river in scenario with municipal purpose well is around double of that in scenario with irrigation purpose well pumping reduces the rate of groundwater transport to river with higher pumping rates steeper decreases of water exchange rate and an earlier reversal of water exchange direction in the scenario with shallow irrigation purpose pumping well lower pumping rate the rate of groundwater flow to the river decreases and the river water infiltration occurs in the first year which is not seen in the base simulation the rate of river water infiltration increases compared to base simulation however during most of the time in the year the water exchange direction is still from aquifer into river the river water infiltration rate is around 1 5 1 7 3 4 0 94 and 2 5 times of that of base model in year 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively and on average the time of river water infiltration increases to 23 of the year around 84 days with range 62 110 days in the scenario with the municipal purpose well higher pumping rate the river water infiltration lasts for a much longer period of time and at a higher rate blue line in fig 6 the increment of river water infiltration rate compared to the base model is double of that of scenario with irrigation purpose well the river water infiltration continues for most of the year and there even was no apparent groundwater flow towards the river in the last year the time of river water infiltration increases to 68 of the year around 253 days with range 140 365 days however the evolution pattern of the river water plume is still affected by the transient conditions since there is less groundwater flowing to the river in the scenario with municipal pumping well there is more tracer continuing into the aquifer and the tracer plume expands in distance and depth figs 7 and 8 after 6 years the plume extends more than 500 m from the river reaches 180 m depth and reaches a state where the plume does not recede further for the scenario with irrigation pumping well the maximum depth reaches to 110 m which is caused by the vertical flow downward close to the river but most of the plume stays not beyond depth 60 m this demonstrates that if a new pumping well is installed the abstraction rate and location should be selected carefully to avoid contamination from river water 3 4 transport time of water from the river to the aquifer fig 9 shows the transport time of a particle to the maximum distance in the aquifer and the total transport time of the particle in the aquifer for the base simulation and scenario with a shallow irrigation well in the base run there was no river water infiltration in 2009 and so there are no data shown in 2010 and 2013 the river water infiltration lasted a longer time with relatively high rates fig 6 the particle transports for a longer time to the maximum distance 56 and 68 days for 2010 and 2013 respectively the travel times to the maximum distance are less than 1 month 28 22 and 22 days in 2011 2012 and 2014 respectively in the scenario with the shallow irrigation well in which the river water infiltration time is longer and the rate is higher fig 6 the particle travels for a much longer time after more than 2 months the particle reaches the maximum distance in each year 62 68 89 and 83 days in 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 respectively in 2010 and 2013 the particle travels for more than 3 months to the maximum distance 95 and 110 days respectively when the flow direction of groundwater changes the particle starts moving back towards the river for the base simulation the particles travel for a shorter time leaving the aquifer because of the higher flow rates into the river 34 21 15 42 and 14 days respectively from 2010 to 2014 in terms of total travel time in the aquifer the maximum particle residence times in the aquifer are 90 49 37 110 and 36 days in 2010 2014 respectively in the scenario with the shallow irrigation well in contrast the particle starts moving back to the river relatively slowly because the water flow rates are lower compared to those during the infiltration period in 2010 and 2013 fig 6 thereafter the particle travel time to leave the aquifer is much longer 109 and 248 days in 2010 and 2013 respectively remaining in the aquifer through the year in 2009 2011 and 2012 the flow rates to the river are still lower than those in the infiltration period but the difference is not substantial it takes 52 50 and 74 days for the particle to leave the aquifer in 2013 the maximum residence time in the aquifer is about one year 358 days the particle transported into the aquifer in 2014 stayed in the aquifer until the end of the year end of the simulation and so the total transport time is not shown here therefore the pollutants carried by the river water plume will be transported deeper and for a longer distance into the aquifer when a new pumping well is made operational additionally the plume will stay a longer time in the aquifer and may not ultimately be transported out of the aquifer figs 7 9 and fig s3 3 5 effect of multiple pumping wells on the river aquifer water exchange the effects of multiple pumping wells on the river aquifer water exchange and water drawdown were evaluated before a sensitivity analysis based on the single pumping well was carried out the scenario with deep municipal well was used for comparison well locations at 0 5 1 and 2 km were selected because these locations are close to the river and in the sub urban area the groundwater abstraction is needed the comparison shows that there are very small differences 0 4 m3 day m for the water exchange between river and aquifer after the groundwater abstraction commences but the three models have the similar water exchange rate after six months fig 10a the comparison of hydraulic head indicates the differences are obvious when the water head is high during monsoon season and low before the monsoon arrives fig 10b the total pumping rate of multiple pumping wells is important for the water exchange between river and aquifer whilst the effect of well location is insignificant the well location does affect the groundwater head distribution 3 6 sensitivity analysis the results the river infiltration flux area and the water drawdown observation at location 25 km from the river from the 200 successful realizations fig 11 with different pumping rate and well location setups were used for a sobol sensitivity analysis a form of global sensitivity analysis sobol 2001 to then identify using psuade which parameters are most important fig 12 the pumping rate is the dominant factor controlling the extent of the conservative tracer plume figs 11 and 12 when the pumping rate is high there is more water infiltration from the river and this is widely dispersed into the aquifer fig 11a the flux area of river infiltration shows a clear relationship with the pumping rate except the wells very close to the river the flux area increases from around 2 8 104 m2 to around 6 104 m2 when the pumping rate increases from 1800 to 2400 m3 day the area doubles which the pumping rate increases only one third however the groundwater table change at 25 km shows a relationship with the well distance from the river clearly with the water table decreasing more when the well is far from the river fig 11e when the well is located far away from the river in the southern part of the cross section pumping will have a greater effect on the water table as most of the abstracted water is derived from aquifer storage contains no river source water anymore both the tracer plume and ground water table show less sensitivity to the well depth compared to the pumping rate and well distance from river figs 11 and 12 only when the well is very close to the river does the flux area increase with the deeper well depth fig 11c if the well is located close to the river this will limit the spatial extent of river water incursion and spread because the pumping will induce flow from the river towards the well fig 11b the data for 2014 was analyzed to check the sensitivity of plume area and drawdown in pre and post monsoon to the different factors for the infiltrated tracer plume area the pumping rate is always the dominant parameter for the whole year fig 12a the sobol sensitivity indices are slightly higher during the pre monsoon january to june as there is less rainfall during the pre monsoon the increase of pumping rate will cause more river water infiltration thus increasing the tracer plume area higher pumping rates for municipal wells are commonly used in patna to meet demands of increasing population and industrial usage however as the river water infiltration and groundwater table are sensitive to pumping rates potential implementation of new wells and or increasing pumping rates must be carefully considered especially in pre monsoon time the plume area is relatively less sensitive to the pumping rate in monsoon and post monsoon seasons july to december in contrast the well distance is a secondary dominant parameter for plume area all the time and the plume area is relatively more sensitive to the well distance in the monsoon and post monsoon the plume area is not sensitive to the well depth even in july when the rainfall is heavy fig 12a well distance is the dominant parameter for water drawdown at 25 km for the whole year and pumping rate the second most dominant parameter fig 12b water drawdown shows a similar sensitivity pattern in pre and post monsoon seasons based on the 200 simulation results triangulation based cubic interpolation was used to interpolate more data points to analyze the relationship between the controlling factors and water drawdown and tracer concentration in the test well with this analysis the confidence level of well location and pumping rate characteristics can be estimated for water resource protection when the pumping rate is high and the well distance is far away from the river the water drawdown at 25 km is relatively high fig 13a c and fig s4 the drawdown shows a quasi linear positive relationship with the pumping rate and the well distance from the river fig 13a this indicates that the pumping rate and location of new planned wells must be limited and optimized for the purpose of water resource protection cgwb 2015 also showed that a modelled 12 m groundwater drawdown was reached in the highly urbanized part of patna for even just a 2 increase in annual groundwater withdraw therefore the groundwater table is very sensitive to the rate of well water abstraction as the precipitation is the major source term for the groundwater in patna area when the pumping well is near to the river 500 m there is a high possibility for the pumped water to contain water from the river c c0 up to a maximum of 0 8 for locations greater than 1 km distance from the river there is almost no river source water in the pumping well c c0 0 1 fig 13b d and fig s5 generally the pumped water contains more water from the river when the well depth is relatively shallow the relative tracer concentration in the pumped water is less than 0 2 if the well depth is deeper than 200 m however it will be more than 0 5 if the depth is shallower than 150 m when the well is located close to the river the effect of pumping rate on the portion of river source water in pumped water is not substantial for the range of pumping rates considered fig 13d and fig s5 therefore the simulation results suggest that deep pumping wells at a distance greater than 1 km from the river could supply water less impacted by river water and hence of higher quality although importantly only to the extent that is determined by the proportion of river water in the produced water other factors including local pollutant sources and in aquifer geogenic biogeochemical contamination processes islam et al 2004 might also affect the produced water quality 4 conclusions for the majority of the year groundwater under patna flows from the aquifer into the river ganges river water starts infiltrating into the aquifer when the monsoon season starts on average the ganges river becomes a source term for the groundwater for just 9 of the year around 33 days with range 0 68 days for the selected cross section installing new pumping water supply wells will result in more river water being transported into the aquifer with a new implemented municipal purpose pumping well pumping rate 2000 m3 day the time of river water infiltration increases to 68 of the year around 253 days with range 140 365 days a global sensitivity analysis shows that well pumping rate is the dominant factor controlling river plume extent and that distance of the pumping well from the river is the second most important factor the horizontal location of well plays an important role for changes in groundwater table at a given location the sensitivity of water drawdown shows a near linear positive relation with the pumping rate and well distance from the river abstracted groundwater is expected to contain 10 river water when wells are located 1 km from the river the results suggest that uncertainty quantification of aquifer river water exchange under transient conditions with pumping water should be conducted before installing municipal pumping wells or high pumping rate irrigation wells the location of wells their depth and pumping rate should be optimized to protect groundwater levels and to prevent contaminants being transported from the river to the abstracted groundwater in this study we present a first generation water exchange profile approach that can provide valuable input to models and related risk assessment studies water resources management and the biogeochemical analysis in the aquifer it provides a system of research workflow for the assessment of water exchange trends between rivers and aquifers in other pumping impacted sites along ganges in future a three dimensional aquifer model with heterogeneous aquifer parameters and multiple wells considering variable pump rates and pump times may be necessary to provide more robust assessments of groundwater river exchange along the ganges

7903,study region patna is located on the southern bank of the river ganges in bihar india rapid population growth over the past few decades has driven an increase in groundwater abstraction from aquifers under the city study focus this study exeplores the pumping induced water exchange between the river ganges and groundwater under transient conditions between 2009 and 2015 using a numerical simulation the deterministic water exchange model within an uncertainty quantification was used to reveal the controlling factors affecting river water infiltration new hydrological insights for the region modelling reveals that under baseline eno pumping conditions the dominant 91 of the year flow direction is from the aquifer to the river which reverses 9 of the year when the river stage is high when a municipal pumping well is implemented river water infiltration into the aquifer increases to 68 of the year the groundwater pumping rate is found to be the most important factor affecting the river water infiltration whilst the groundwater table level is most sensitive to the well distance from the river followed by pumping rate optimizing the location depth and pumping rate of new wells in the area could mitigate fluvial contamination of the aquifer and help maintain groundwater levels keywords groundwater water exchange abstraction river water infiltration sensitivity analysis

and population growth are causing an increasing reliance on groundwater across the globe groundwater is often assumed to be less susceptible to contamination from surface derived contamination including pathogens and anthropogenic contaminants although the potential risks associated with geogenic groundwater contaminants are often significant like the dangerous concentrations of geogenic

has a rapidly increasing population and a growing dependence on groundwater chatterjee et al 2020 duttagupta et al 2020 kumar et al 2017 saha et al 2011 increasing abstraction for agriculture and municipal water supplies can lower the groundwater level which potentially changes geochemical conditions in the aquifer and the nature and extent of water exchange with the ganges river brikowski et

et al 2011 duttagupta et al 2020 in such areas most of the year the dominant groundwater flow direction is towards the river contributing to baseflow however the dominant flow direction frequently reverses during the monsoon season when river water infiltrates into aquifers due to a higher river stage relative to hydraulic heads in adjacent groundwater systems chatterjee et al 2020 das et al

city of patna bihar india observations made along a river groundwater transect in the study area enable a detailed assessment of the impacts of rapidly growing urban water demand on river groundwater interactions to be made the focus of our study is to determine to what extent groundwater pumping from modelled municipal drinking water supply boreholes can impact river groundwater interactions after calibrating the model with data from cgwb 2015 and evaluating the model with the available groundwater level observations we consider several plausible scenarios of groundwater abstraction regimes under transient conditions for both river water level and rainfall in the region to 1 quantify the extent of expected water exchange between the river ganges and groundwater under transient conditions 2 estimate the spatial distribution and residence time of river water infiltration in the shallow aquifers underlying patna 3 characterize the impact of monsoon on the water exchange and 4 identify the critical factors influencing the river groundwater exchange due to pumping with a global sensitivity analysis the findings of this study can contribute to baseline understanding to potentially inform groundwater management practice in patna and other similar rapidly expanding urban areas where the groundwater quality may be deteriorated by surface water sources through natural or anthropogenic groundwater surface water interactions duttagupta et al 2020 joekar niasar and ataie ashtiani 2009 richards et al 2021 2 methodology 2 1 case study patna is located on the southern bank of the river ganges in bihar india fig 1 over the past three decades there has been a substantial growth of the urban population as well as an expansion of industrial commercial activities with a concomitant increasing demand for water resulting in increased groundwater abstraction alakshendra 2019 saha et al 2014 the area has a sub tropical to sub humid climate with a monsoon season from june to september which accounts 82 of average annual rainfall cgwb 2015 july and august are the wettest months and in the past decade accounted for 51 of mean annual rainfall saha et al 2014 the middle ganges plain in patna is underlain by two major quaternary aquifers within a depth of 300 m below ground level separated by a 15 32 m thick clay sandy clay layer fig 1 saha et al 2014 a pervasive layer of clay mixed sand constitutes the top aquitard of the succession the presence of kankar nodules concretions of lime and fine sand makes this clay layer semi permeable underneath and near the ganges this clay sand clay layer consists of several thinner clay lens with sand the ganges is the groundwater outflow boundary according to the local hydrogeological conditions cgwb 2015 das 2021a 2021b with the net flow of groundwater from the south west to north east towards the ganges in patna cgwb 2015 2 2 hydrological parameterization subsurface layers were parameterized for the purposes of numerical modelling the modelling framework is described in section 2 3 the layer stratification and thickness were interpolated on the basis of previous geophysical logging reports cgwb 2015 in some locations near a cross section running roughly perpendicular from the ganges inland from patna fig 1b pumping test data of cgwb wells cgwb 2015 indicate that the transmissivity of the aquifers ranges between 4900 and 16000 m2 day with a mean of 8300 m2 day the specific capacity of the wells ranges from 56 100 m3 hr m and the mean hydraulic conductivity k has been reported 87 m day corresponding to that of coarse sand and coarse sand mixed with gravel hydraulic conductivity data obtained from pumping tests conducted by cgwb 2015 was utilized through interpolation in terms of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy vertical hydraulic conductivity was assumed to be 10 of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity cgwb 2015 the hydraulic conductivity of the top aquitard layer thickness 28 60 m has been estimated through grain size analysis cgwb 2015 the range of hydraulic conductivity for this layer varies from 5 m day to 20 m day the hydraulic conductivity of the first aquifer aquifer 1 lying between 40 and 110 m has been estimated to between 60 and 120 m day and the hydraulic conductivity of the deeper aquifer system aquifer 2 lying below 120 130 m depth has been estimated to be between 82 and 92 m day cgwb 2015 groundwater in the deeper aquifer occurs under semi confined to confined conditions due to the relatively poor hydraulic conductivity of the middle clay between aquifer 1 and aquifer 2 5 m day below aquifer 2 it is assumed to be impermeable hydraulic conductivity 7 2 10 3 4 7 10 2 m day cgwb 2015 the porosity of various major layers has been estimated using the equation given by vukovic and soro 1992 1 n 0 255 1 0 83 d 60 d 10 where d60 is the 40 retained grain size and d10 is the 90 retained grain size the calculated porosities are as follows 0 01 for clay layer top 0 35 for aquitard layer with range 0 34 0 37 0 38 for the middle aquifer aquifer 1 with range 0 36 0 4 and 0 35 for the deep aquifer aquifer 2 with range 0 33 0 40 cgwb 2015 porosity estimates could be improved in future models if direct corresponding measurements were systematically made with depth across the modelled transect however this data was not available at this time of this study the assumed structure of the subsurface may not capture local heterogeneity such as the existence of unknown clay lenses or high permeable lenses especially as the detailed 3d substructure of the modelled transect and wider study area is not available cgwb 2015 saha et al 2014 2 3 modelling framework a two dimensional domain was established to represent the 27 km cross section oriented approximately perpendicular to the river along expected dominant groundwater flow paths fig 1b this cross section starts from the river and goes in the direction of southwest it passes through the east patna urban area and crosses the south farming land until 27 km faraway from ganges in which the river is the outflow boundary and the location around 27 km is near the local surface water divide based on the gis data analysis it was selected because of the available geophysical survey profile which was nearby and parallel to this cross section cgwb 2015 it is also because that groundwater geochemical measurement was performed in several locations at this cross section along which the current work findings will be used for next step geogenic contamination numerical simulation richards et al 2021 we used this cross section to estimate the extent of groundwater river water exchange under natural transient conditions e g as influenced by seasonally variable river water levels and precipitation the 27 km longcross section is 250 m deep and 50 m wide which covers the effect radius of the pumping wells it was discretized into 4988 grid cells with variable horizontal discretization length ranging from 0 625 m near the river to 1000 m in the south boundary and variable vertical discretization length ranging from 0 625 m near the surface to 10 m at the bottom depths in total there are 172 columns and 29 layers for the discretization the river package in modflow 6 hughes et al 2017 is used for the gangetic model the conductance of the river boundary is 1000 m2 day assuming that the hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed is 0 1 m day with a thickness of 0 5 m to establish boundary conditions for the river a time series of ganges water level data was provided by nasa viz pre swot hydrology grrats virtual station river heights coss et al 2020 the rainfall is the major water source term in the area average precipitation values for patna for the january 2009 to december 2014 period were used to establish the groundwater flow model as this represents a recent continuous record worldweatheronline 2021 fig 2 the ground surface elevation analysis also shows that the surface water runoff accumulates and flows mostly in direction to east and into the downstream of ganges in patna https earthexplorer usgs gov only the surface runoff in a small area at north west part of patna will flows directly to the ganges at patna the rainfall infiltration ratio was calibrated to fit the groundwater head distribution map of patna cgwb 2015 both of the rainfall rate and infiltration rate were assumed to be universal along the cross section the processing modflow platform chiang and kinzelbach 2003 was used to simulate water flow through modflow hughes et al 2017 and conservative tracer transport in the aquifer through mt3d bedekar et al 2016 and exchange with river water a transient model was set up for 6 years using existing rainfall and river level data this 6 year time period was restricted by availability of river water level data coss et al 2020 we also ran a steady state model for the initial groundwater distribution conservative tracers were virtually added in the river to track water exchange between the river and aquifer using a molecular diffusion coefficient of 8 64 10 5 m2 day and a horizontal dispersivity of 5 mm based on the reported aquifer grain size distribution cgwb 2015 the ratio between tracer concentration in the pumping well and initial concentration in the river c c0 0 1 and 0 01 respectively were used to identify the modelled proportion of river source water in the pumped water the transient model without introducing pumping schemes was performed as an initial base run to determine the extent of groundwater surface water exchange including the effect of the annual monsoon this base model was validated with the groundwater table data observed at kankerbagh patna two models considering the impact of pumping scenarios for municipal typically targeting deeper groundwater from aquifer 2 with depth 100 m and agricultural purposes typically targeting shallow groundwater in aquitard with depth 50 m were then run in the first scenario a new planned municipal purpose pumping well is located 1 km from the river with a depth of 175 m in aquifer 2 and a high pumping rate of 2000 m3 day the pumping rate of the municipal purpose well in patna is between 1875 and 2500 m3 day cgwg 2015 in the second scenario a new planned irrigation purpose pumping well is located 1 km from the river with a depth of 45 m in aquitard and a pumping rate of 1000 m3 day together with the base simulation the changes in residence time of water from the river were assessed two alternative models were run to estimate the effect of multiple wells on river and aquifer water exchange the pumping rates of two pumping wells were given as half of the rate of the single well scenario there was one well located also 1 km from the river and another well located at 2 km and 0 5 km from the river in the different two well scenarios respectively finally to investigate the sensitivity of well parameters affecting the water exchange dynamics we used the psuade problem solving environment for uncertainty analysis and design exploration code tong 2017 with the pmwin to conduct the uncertainty quantification uq analyses psuade is a software package for various uq activities such as uncertainty assessment global sensitivity analysis risk analysis design optimization and parameter identification three major factors were considered to simulate the effect of groundwater pumping on the water exchange between the aquifer and river pumping rate well distance from the river and well depth the daily pumping rate of the wells for drinking water supply in patna are typically between 1875 and 2500 m3 day calculated using estimated pumping rates and daily hours of usage cgwb 2015 the following ranges were used for sensitivity analysis 1800 2500 m3 day for pumping rates 2 3000 m perpendicular distance from the river for well locations and 15 225 m for well depth one pumping well was implemented for the sensitivity analysis given that total pumping rate is a more influential parameter on water exchange in comparison to well location or number of wells a latin hypercube method tong 2017 was used to produce 200 simulations with these different factors randomly distributed within the ranges indicated above the sensitivity of infiltrated river water extent area and the groundwater drawdown to the 3 factors were assessed in order to prevent the observation point from being close to the well in one model and far from the well in the other model the water drawdown at 25 km which is far from the pumping well in all models was selected for the final sensitivity analysis to determine the modelled destination and the travel times of the infiltrated river water individual conservative particles which will transport together with water were considered particles were released virtually into the river they were traced on their way into the aquifer when the river water level was relatively high and then out of the aquifer when the hydraulic head in the aquifer was relatively higher than that of the river the pathway of a particle was observed with time from a starting point particle transport velocities were described as dx dt v x t with the position of the particle x t at a specific time t given by the equation 2 x t x 0 0 t v x t ˆ d t ˆ where x 0 is the initial position of the particle and v x t is the seepage velocity at a particular location x t the seepage velocity was used to determine the travel time τ of a particle this was integrated eq 3 over the travel path of a particle beginning at its starting point x 0 and ending at an observation point x 3 τ x x 0 x dx v x a matlab code was developed to simulate the particle tracking process the seepage velocity was updated every time step based on the time dependent hydraulic head distribution 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation for the base scenario model the rainfall infiltration ratio was calibrated with the groundwater hydraulic head distribution data in cgwb 2015 therefore the initial hydraulic head distribution is consistent to those reported in cgwb 2015 cgwb 2015 reported also water table depth observation data collected monthly from november of 2011 to june of 2014 in patna area in which the well in kankerbagh around 3 km from the river is 500 m away from the modelled cross section fig 1b we used these data for the model validation fig 3 and the comparison show that the results of basic scenario model match the seasonal variability in observed groundwater levels the differences between the simulated and observed water table depth are in reasonable range fig 3a the mean error between calculated and observed values is 0 03 and the root mean squared error is 0 85 fig 3b the numerical model captured the observed water table depth evolution trend it increases during pre monsoon season decreases after the onset of the monsoon and then increases again in the post monsoon season the difference is relatively bigger at maxima and minima of the evolution curve fig 3a this is likely because a uniform precipitation rate and rainfall infiltration rate were used along the whole cross section the heterogeneity of the aquifer s physical properties is another possible reason for the smooth numerical evolution curve a slow infiltration of rainfall at the observation location will delay the groundwater table response to rainwater whilst also reducing variability exhibited in the water table evolution curve therefore detailed measurements of the heterogeneous distribution of porosity would improve future simulations the variable precipitation rate and rainfall infiltration rate in different parts of the cross section depending on in situ measurement and observation data would improve the delineation of the source term in the model seasonal tracer tests near the river would help also in model validation and identifying target areas for more detailed modelling 3 2 surface water groundwater interactions under transient conditions generally the ganges gains flow from groundwater in patna fig 4 because the alluvial plain has a higher piezometric head compared to the river water level the groundwater flows northward from the south of patna to the river fig s1 when the monsoon season starts typically in july precipitation increases as well as the water level in the ganges river near the river the hydraulic head in the aquifer responds to the river water quickly and has a similar temporal pattern to that of the river water level fig 4 and fig s1 the largest increases in hydraulic head in the river drive water flow from the river into the aquifer fig s1 and the yellow colored zone in fig 4 the numerical simulation shows that if river water infiltration occurs this mostly happens in late july august and early september depending on the annually dependent onset of the monsoon period and river water level fig 4 during the monsoonal period the groundwater hydraulic head in the aquifer increases near the river and the location of the minimum head values moves to 2 5 km away from the river extending to the south side of the urban area of patna city in late september even though the river water level is still high the accumulation of rainwater since june causes the accumulated hydraulic head in the south zone to become higher so the direction of groundwater flow changes back to from south to north i e towards the river again in september see fig s1 on average the ganges river becomes a source term for the groundwater just 9 of the year around 33 days with range 0 68 days for the selected cross section for the simulation period from 2009 to 2014 when the river water levels in 2010 and 2013 were still higher in august and september because of the relative high rainfall in the upstream region of ganges the rainfall in patna were lower so the river water moved into the aquifer for longer periods in those years fig 2 and fig 4 for example there were 68 days in 2013 with river water infiltration starting relatively early at the beginning of july however in 2009 the river water level was relatively low and the rainfall was higher than average in this year there was no river water movement into the aquifer the river water level in 2011 was relatively high but the precipitation in 2011 at patna was the highest in 6 years since most of the surface water runoff at patna region goes to the east direction and it flows finally to the downstream of ganges so the local rainfall would result in greater recharge to groundwater but less amount direct to the ganges in the north of patna then comparing with other year the river infiltration time was short 28 days starting mid july and the rate is lower compared to that in years of 2010 and 2013 the effect of high and prolonged precipitation in 2011 causing river infiltration in 2012 to have a very short duration 22 days starting at the beginning of august and a lower rate of flow in 2014 both the water level and rainfall in monsoon are low the river water infiltration started on middle of august and only lasted 19 days fig 4 the cgwb 2015 reports have shown that the groundwater table reached a minimum before the monsoon in 2014 due to low precipitation and continuing groundwater abstraction especially in urban areas which may cause river water inflow in some part of patna noting the river water level is also relatively low pre monsoon cgwb 2015 das et al 2021a showed that contribution of groundwater in ganges baseflow is estimated to be the highest during dry season whereas during monsoon the flow direction also reverses in varanasi river water and hence tracer infiltration varies considerably between years with the volumes particularly small in 2011 2012 and 2014 fig 5 there is a clear plume of the conservative tracer distributed in the shallow depth 75 m for short time 28 22 and 18 days for 2011 2012 and 2014 respectively the plume of the tracer extends horizontally and vertically with time the maximum distance and maximum depth of tracer plume are larger when the infiltration rate of river water is highest years 2010 and 2013 in fig 5 the tracer plume reaches the maximum extent at the middle of september thereafter because the water flux direction reverses the infiltrated tracers are transported towards the river and the plume shrinks when the flow from the river to aquifer is small 2011 2012 and 2014 the infiltrated tracer leaves the aquifer earlier and almost completely disappears at the end of the year when the flow of water from the river is high in the monsoon season the tracer needs a longer time to transport out of the aquifer and some tracer lasts until the following year fig 5a with c c0 0 01 in year 2013 the maximum residence time of the tracers in aquifer varied between 1 and 7 months a similar pattern of tracer transport is repeated every year with a different plume extent due to the variation of rainfall and river water level the maximum lateral extent of the plume is small reaching 75 m in years with higher rates of river water to aquifer flow whilst the maximum modelled depth of the plume in the aquifer was 45 m fig 5a with c c0 0 01 in year 2013 if the plume extent is instead estimated using the cut off concentration c c0 0 1 the modelled plume dissipates faster and moves out of the aquifer around 1 5 3 months after the start of the monsoon fig 5b and fig s2 as a result the majority of tracer moves in and out with the water exchange between river and aquifer but there is still a small proportion of the tracer that remains in the aquifer for a much longer time 3 3 effect of pumping on the river aquifer water exchange when there is a pumping well located 1 km from the river it significantly effects the water exchange between the river and aquifer fig 6 the maximum flux rate towards river decreases around 80 for the scenario with municipal purpose well and around 40 for the scenario with irrigation purpose well the decrease of flux rate towards river in scenario with municipal purpose well is around double of that in scenario with irrigation purpose well pumping reduces the rate of groundwater transport to river with higher pumping rates steeper decreases of water exchange rate and an earlier reversal of water exchange direction in the scenario with shallow irrigation purpose pumping well lower pumping rate the rate of groundwater flow to the river decreases and the river water infiltration occurs in the first year which is not seen in the base simulation the rate of river water infiltration increases compared to base simulation however during most of the time in the year the water exchange direction is still from aquifer into river the river water infiltration rate is around 1 5 1 7 3 4 0 94 and 2 5 times of that of base model in year 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively and on average the time of river water infiltration increases to 23 of the year around 84 days with range 62 110 days in the scenario with the municipal purpose well higher pumping rate the river water infiltration lasts for a much longer period of time and at a higher rate blue line in fig 6 the increment of river water infiltration rate compared to the base model is double of that of scenario with irrigation purpose well the river water infiltration continues for most of the year and there even was no apparent groundwater flow towards the river in the last year the time of river water infiltration increases to 68 of the year around 253 days with range 140 365 days however the evolution pattern of the river water plume is still affected by the transient conditions since there is less groundwater flowing to the river in the scenario with municipal pumping well there is more tracer continuing into the aquifer and the tracer plume expands in distance and depth figs 7 and 8 after 6 years the plume extends more than 500 m from the river reaches 180 m depth and reaches a state where the plume does not recede further for the scenario with irrigation pumping well the maximum depth reaches to 110 m which is caused by the vertical flow downward close to the river but most of the plume stays not beyond depth 60 m this demonstrates that if a new pumping well is installed the abstraction rate and location should be selected carefully to avoid contamination from river water 3 4 transport time of water from the river to the aquifer fig 9 shows the transport time of a particle to the maximum distance in the aquifer and the total transport time of the particle in the aquifer for the base simulation and scenario with a shallow irrigation well in the base run there was no river water infiltration in 2009 and so there are no data shown in 2010 and 2013 the river water infiltration lasted a longer time with relatively high rates fig 6 the particle transports for a longer time to the maximum distance 56 and 68 days for 2010 and 2013 respectively the travel times to the maximum distance are less than 1 month 28 22 and 22 days in 2011 2012 and 2014 respectively in the scenario with the shallow irrigation well in which the river water infiltration time is longer and the rate is higher fig 6 the particle travels for a much longer time after more than 2 months the particle reaches the maximum distance in each year 62 68 89 and 83 days in 2009 2011 2012 and 2014 respectively in 2010 and 2013 the particle travels for more than 3 months to the maximum distance 95 and 110 days respectively when the flow direction of groundwater changes the particle starts moving back towards the river for the base simulation the particles travel for a shorter time leaving the aquifer because of the higher flow rates into the river 34 21 15 42 and 14 days respectively from 2010 to 2014 in terms of total travel time in the aquifer the maximum particle residence times in the aquifer are 90 49 37 110 and 36 days in 2010 2014 respectively in the scenario with the shallow irrigation well in contrast the particle starts moving back to the river relatively slowly because the water flow rates are lower compared to those during the infiltration period in 2010 and 2013 fig 6 thereafter the particle travel time to leave the aquifer is much longer 109 and 248 days in 2010 and 2013 respectively remaining in the aquifer through the year in 2009 2011 and 2012 the flow rates to the river are still lower than those in the infiltration period but the difference is not substantial it takes 52 50 and 74 days for the particle to leave the aquifer in 2013 the maximum residence time in the aquifer is about one year 358 days the particle transported into the aquifer in 2014 stayed in the aquifer until the end of the year end of the simulation and so the total transport time is not shown here therefore the pollutants carried by the river water plume will be transported deeper and for a longer distance into the aquifer when a new pumping well is made operational additionally the plume will stay a longer time in the aquifer and may not ultimately be transported out of the aquifer figs 7 9 and fig s3 3 5 effect of multiple pumping wells on the river aquifer water exchange the effects of multiple pumping wells on the river aquifer water exchange and water drawdown were evaluated before a sensitivity analysis based on the single pumping well was carried out the scenario with deep municipal well was used for comparison well locations at 0 5 1 and 2 km were selected because these locations are close to the river and in the sub urban area the groundwater abstraction is needed the comparison shows that there are very small differences 0 4 m3 day m for the water exchange between river and aquifer after the groundwater abstraction commences but the three models have the similar water exchange rate after six months fig 10a the comparison of hydraulic head indicates the differences are obvious when the water head is high during monsoon season and low before the monsoon arrives fig 10b the total pumping rate of multiple pumping wells is important for the water exchange between river and aquifer whilst the effect of well location is insignificant the well location does affect the groundwater head distribution 3 6 sensitivity analysis the results the river infiltration flux area and the water drawdown observation at location 25 km from the river from the 200 successful realizations fig 11 with different pumping rate and well location setups were used for a sobol sensitivity analysis a form of global sensitivity analysis sobol 2001 to then identify using psuade which parameters are most important fig 12 the pumping rate is the dominant factor controlling the extent of the conservative tracer plume figs 11 and 12 when the pumping rate is high there is more water infiltration from the river and this is widely dispersed into the aquifer fig 11a the flux area of river infiltration shows a clear relationship with the pumping rate except the wells very close to the river the flux area increases from around 2 8 104 m2 to around 6 104 m2 when the pumping rate increases from 1800 to 2400 m3 day the area doubles which the pumping rate increases only one third however the groundwater table change at 25 km shows a relationship with the well distance from the river clearly with the water table decreasing more when the well is far from the river fig 11e when the well is located far away from the river in the southern part of the cross section pumping will have a greater effect on the water table as most of the abstracted water is derived from aquifer storage contains no river source water anymore both the tracer plume and ground water table show less sensitivity to the well depth compared to the pumping rate and well distance from river figs 11 and 12 only when the well is very close to the river does the flux area increase with the deeper well depth fig 11c if the well is located close to the river this will limit the spatial extent of river water incursion and spread because the pumping will induce flow from the river towards the well fig 11b the data for 2014 was analyzed to check the sensitivity of plume area and drawdown in pre and post monsoon to the different factors for the infiltrated tracer plume area the pumping rate is always the dominant parameter for the whole year fig 12a the sobol sensitivity indices are slightly higher during the pre monsoon january to june as there is less rainfall during the pre monsoon the increase of pumping rate will cause more river water infiltration thus increasing the tracer plume area higher pumping rates for municipal wells are commonly used in patna to meet demands of increasing population and industrial usage however as the river water infiltration and groundwater table are sensitive to pumping rates potential implementation of new wells and or increasing pumping rates must be carefully considered especially in pre monsoon time the plume area is relatively less sensitive to the pumping rate in monsoon and post monsoon seasons july to december in contrast the well distance is a secondary dominant parameter for plume area all the time and the plume area is relatively more sensitive to the well distance in the monsoon and post monsoon the plume area is not sensitive to the well depth even in july when the rainfall is heavy fig 12a well distance is the dominant parameter for water drawdown at 25 km for the whole year and pumping rate the second most dominant parameter fig 12b water drawdown shows a similar sensitivity pattern in pre and post monsoon seasons based on the 200 simulation results triangulation based cubic interpolation was used to interpolate more data points to analyze the relationship between the controlling factors and water drawdown and tracer concentration in the test well with this analysis the confidence level of well location and pumping rate characteristics can be estimated for water resource protection when the pumping rate is high and the well distance is far away from the river the water drawdown at 25 km is relatively high fig 13a c and fig s4 the drawdown shows a quasi linear positive relationship with the pumping rate and the well distance from the river fig 13a this indicates that the pumping rate and location of new planned wells must be limited and optimized for the purpose of water resource protection cgwb 2015 also showed that a modelled 12 m groundwater drawdown was reached in the highly urbanized part of patna for even just a 2 increase in annual groundwater withdraw therefore the groundwater table is very sensitive to the rate of well water abstraction as the precipitation is the major source term for the groundwater in patna area when the pumping well is near to the river 500 m there is a high possibility for the pumped water to contain water from the river c c0 up to a maximum of 0 8 for locations greater than 1 km distance from the river there is almost no river source water in the pumping well c c0 0 1 fig 13b d and fig s5 generally the pumped water contains more water from the river when the well depth is relatively shallow the relative tracer concentration in the pumped water is less than 0 2 if the well depth is deeper than 200 m however it will be more than 0 5 if the depth is shallower than 150 m when the well is located close to the river the effect of pumping rate on the portion of river source water in pumped water is not substantial for the range of pumping rates considered fig 13d and fig s5 therefore the simulation results suggest that deep pumping wells at a distance greater than 1 km from the river could supply water less impacted by river water and hence of higher quality although importantly only to the extent that is determined by the proportion of river water in the produced water other factors including local pollutant sources and in aquifer geogenic biogeochemical contamination processes islam et al 2004 might also affect the produced water quality 4 conclusions for the majority of the year groundwater under patna flows from the aquifer into the river ganges river water starts infiltrating into the aquifer when the monsoon season starts on average the ganges river becomes a source term for the groundwater for just 9 of the year around 33 days with range 0 68 days for the selected cross section installing new pumping water supply wells will result in more river water being transported into the aquifer with a new implemented municipal purpose pumping well pumping rate 2000 m3 day the time of river water infiltration increases to 68 of the year around 253 days with range 140 365 days a global sensitivity analysis shows that well pumping rate is the dominant factor controlling river plume extent and that distance of the pumping well from the river is the second most important factor the horizontal location of well plays an important role for changes in groundwater table at a given location the sensitivity of water drawdown shows a near linear positive relation with the pumping rate and well distance from the river abstracted groundwater is expected to contain 10 river water when wells are located 1 km from the river the results suggest that uncertainty quantification of aquifer river water exchange under transient conditions with pumping water should be conducted before installing municipal pumping wells or high pumping rate irrigation wells the location of wells their depth and pumping rate should be optimized to protect groundwater levels and to prevent contaminants being transported from the river to the abstracted groundwater in this study we present a first generation water exchange profile approach that can provide valuable input to models and related risk assessment studies water resources management and the biogeochemical analysis in the aquifer it provides a system of research workflow for the assessment of water exchange trends between rivers and aquifers in other pumping impacted sites along ganges in future a three dimensional aquifer model with heterogeneous aquifer parameters and multiple wells considering variable pump rates and pump times may be necessary to provide more robust assessments of groundwater river exchange along the ganges

et al 2016 they are also likely to be increasingly impacted in the future not only because of the projected changes in drought but also because of ongoing socio economic changes over the last few decades the demand for water has significantly increased by many folds and water scarcity is occurring almost every year due to an increase in population growth and expansion in agriculture industrial and energy sectors mishra and singh 2010 the increase in population and economic activities have led to an increase in construction of water infrastructure to meet sectoral demands which put water resources under increasing stress mul et al 2015 according to haile et al 2020 assessing drought risks at a basin level is crucial to effectively and efficiently monitor and manage droughts and can serve as a basis for development of adaptation measures under conditions of climate variability and change oloruntade et al 2017 the current study focuses on one of the largest river basins in west africa the volta basin aiming to provide a detailed analysis of the variability and change in hydrological drought focused on streamflow the analysis is carried out using modeled data over an unprecedented number of river reaches i e 10 300 the volta river basin is an important resource for around 24 million people across six countries ghana burkina faso mali ivory coast benin and togo using water for domestic livestock agriculture and hydropower purposes rodgers et al 2007 mul et al 2015 the basin therefore plays an important role in the economic development of the region however due to increases in demand from the increasing population and economic growth there is potential for competition over water resources that are already under stress which is exacerbated under drought conditions mul et al 2015 this is expected to become worse in the future with consequences for the food security and economic growth of the six countries mccartney et al 2012 mul et al 2015 we focus on the characterization of streamflow droughts over the period 1979 2013 in terms of the time below a threshold level drought duration and accumulated streamflow deficit drought severity which is derived from the streamflow time series e g melsen and guse 2019 rivera et al 2017 we choose this period due to the availability of the most reliable precipitation data which begins at the start of the satellite period we also assess the relationship between daily streamflow and antecedent precipitation and therefore how meteorological droughts propagate into hydrological droughts because of the lack of coverage in time and space of observed records of streamflow we use simulated runoff from the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface hydrological model liang et al 1994 further we used the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid routing model david et al 2011 to convert the runoff from vic into streamflow these simulations are forced by a gridded gauge satellite reanalysis climate forcing dataset we compare the modeled streamflow against available observations of streamflow to understand the performance of the model and its suitability for looking at drought characteristics across the basin overall the analysis could provide baseline risk information for users and water agencies to better manage water resources develop site specific adaptation measures and support the development of integrated water management and planning strategies to tackle the impacts of droughts under variability in climate and future change 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the volta basin is one of the largest river basins in west africa with an area of 412 772 km2 fig 1 the basin is shared among burkina faso 43 0 of the basin area ghana 41 6 togo 6 4 benin 3 4 mali 3 1 and côte d ivoire 2 5 mul et al 2015 the volta has four major sub basins white volta black volta lower volta and oti river covering an area of 27 36 18 and 19 of the total drainage area respectively gordon et al 2013 mul et al 2015 the climate is highly variable with a clear gradient from south to north as influenced by the movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and zonal winds which leads to high variability in floods and droughts the climate of the river basin is classified as moist sub humid dry sub humid and semi arid in the south central and north respectively ferreira et al 2019 mul et al 2015 more than 1100 reservoirs large multipurpose irrigation and small impoundments with a storage volume of between 1 and 147 960 mm3 have been constructed during the 1980 2010 s there are 19 planned hydropower dams in the basin due to an increase in water demand for energy agriculture and water supply barry et al 2005 mul et al 2015 the average annual precipitation for the basin over 1979 2013 is 850 mm year with the highest and lowest amounts in the southern up to 1600 mm year and northern up to 400 mm year parts of the basin respectively fig 2a the inter annual variability of precipitation is higher in the lower volta standard deviation up to 250 mm but decreases towards the northern part of the basin fig 2c on average the basin receives about 70 of the total precipitation during july september with little rainfall during the months of november march the northern part receives the majority of precipitation during june september while the southern part receives this during may september jones et al 2017 the northern part is warmer than the southern part with an annual daily average 1979 2013 temperature of about 29 c fig 2b inter annual variability in average temperature is higher in the north standard deviation up to 0 43 c and lower in the south standard deviation up to 0 23 c part of the basin fig 2d 2 2 hydrological modelling and streamflow routing the vic model is a semi distributed model that solves the energy and water balances at the grid scale liang et al 1994 vic organises the spatial domain into different computational cells characterized by land cover type and vertically into soil layers to calculate water budget components such as runoff surface and subsurface evapotranspiration and infiltration the horizontal flow between grid cells is not modeled and it is assumed that water cannot flow back into the soil after reaching the river dang et al 2020 the penman monteith approach is used to compute evapotranspiration the variable infiltration curve is used to represent the spatial distribution of infiltration and surface runoff within the grid cell and the non linear arno recession curve is used for baseflow simulation liang et al 1994 the variable infiltration curve is an important part of vic which drives the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration and runoff depending on the spatial distribution of soil moisture meteorological forcings required by vic are daily precipitation temperature shortwave and longwave radiation wind speed atmospheric pressure and vapour pressure in addition soil e g texture and bulk density saturated conductivity and vegetation e g albedo and leaf area index parameters are required to parametrize the model vic 4 2 the model is calibrated and bias corrected at 0 25 to match global maps of 17 runoff characteristics such as mean annual runoff baseflow index and different percentiles derived from ground observations beck et al 2015 the most sensitive vic parameters for runoff generation were calibrated such as the variable infiltration curve binf soil depth and the maximum soil moisture fraction at which non linear rapidly increasing baseflow begins ds the observation based runoff maps were developed to estimate streamflow at ungauged catchments and more than 3000 stations were used to train a machine learning neural network ensembles and applied globally beck et al 2015 the use of these runoff characteristics improved the performance of hydrological models in simulating streamflow as compared to traditional calibration approaches using limited ground stations lin et al 2019 rapid david et al 2011 is a vector based routing model used to simulate streamflow at potentially thousands of river reaches it applies the muskingum channel routing scheme to calculate the volume of water and streamflow with dimensionless x and time k parameters in addition the model requires a network connectivity file and gridded runoff surface and subsurface which can be computed in arc gis eg https github com esri python toolbox for rapid to assess the performance of vic rapid the modeled streamflow is evaluated against available in situ data on daily and monthly time scales in terms of the correlation coefficient cc percentage bias pbias root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and time series

forcings pgf sheffield et al 2006 mswep version 2 2 is a global precipitation product developed by merging several datasets such as from more than 77 000 ground stations satellite based rainfall

shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds dataset hydrosheds provides a georeferenced vector and raster stream network and flow directions derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm elevation data https hydrosheds cr usgs gov the location of the reservoirs shown in fig 1 are obtained from the water research institute of ghana although we do not model the hydrological impact of the reservoirs and dam operations we discuss the results in the context of their presence across the basin to assess the potential differences between the model output and the unobserved reality we calculated the degree of regulation dor as the ratio of the reservoir capacity to average annual flow upstream of the reservoir lehner et al 2011 for each reservoir with available capacity information for a given year a higher dor indicates the probability that a substantial amount of flow can be stored for future release which influences flows downstream lehner et al 2011 the dor was then used to inform a qualitative assessment of the performance of the model where the lack of reservoir representation in the model could lead to large uncertainties or errors in the modelled output and drought characteristics observed streamflow data from 39 stations 20 daily and 19 monthly were obtained from the global runoff data centre http www bafg de grdc and the water research institute of ghana tables 1 and 2 the grdc database provides quality controlled historical daily and monthly streamflow to help scientists perform global and local scale hydrological and environmental studies grdc 2019 2 4 drought indices and trend analysis the threshold level approach yevjevich 1967 is used to define streamflow droughts the threshold is derived from the flow duration curve as flow exceeded or equalled for selected percentile thresholds 70 80 and 90 of the time these thresholds are classified as moderate severe and extreme droughts respectively rivera et al 2017 which is an approach that has been widely used to assess streamflow droughts e g fleig et al 2006 wanders et al 2015 rivera et al 2018 compared to standardised indices such as the standardised streamflow index mckee et al 1993 shukla and wood 2008 the threshold level approach allows estimation of streamflow deficit severity which is crucial for water management in sectors such as agriculture and hydropower rivera et al 2018 van loon 2015 streamflow droughts are computed from the daily time series of the modelled years 1979 2013 using the threshold approach the approach defines droughts when the flow is below the given threshold value the threshold values are computed based on a moving quantile where daily threshold values are defined based on the 70th 80th and 90th percentiles of the flow duration curve over a moving window of 30 days that moves through the time series of the study period beyene et al 2014 dierauer and whitfield 2019 hence this method provides different threshold values for every day of the year which remains the same across all years this approach helps to account for the influence of seasonality to identify individual droughts we used a minimum inter event and event duration of 10 and 15 days respectively as recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 2008 and dierauer and whitfield 2019 the event duration avoids counting two adjacent droughts separated by minor fluctuations around the threshold as separate events droughts occurring with less than the minimum inter event days i e 10 days were considered as a single event droughts are assessed in terms of their duration days and severity m3 s further severity and total severity total deficit volume during the drought events are normalised by mean annual flow and catchment area for spatial comparison the moderate severe and extreme droughts are assessed relative to their threshold level this does mean that a moderate drought may contain a severe or extreme drought if values fall below the threshold for these latter types of drought to assess the presence of monotonic downward or upward trends in drought duration days and severity we used the mann kendall test kendall 1975 and the magnitude of the change i e slope is computed using the sen s slope method sen 1968 furthermore we assessed the propagation of drought i e meteorological to hydrological droughts via the relationship between precipitation and streamflow to understand the influence of precipitation variability on the changes in hydrological drought we calculated the 3 7 14 21 30 60 and 90 days moving average of antecedent precipitation averaged over the upstream catchment for catchments smaller than 100 km2 and identified the duration of antecedent precipitation with maximum correlation with streamflow variability the selection of smaller catchments is to reduce the impact of flow travel time and spatially variable precipitation in larger catchments which will affect the relationship between antecedent precipitation and streamflow we then used percentile thresholds as above to identify the start of meteorological and hydrological droughts and calculated the time lag between them as a metric of propagation 3 results 3 1 comparison of observed and modeled data the modeled streamflow data is compared with observed data using the methods described in section 2 2 the performance of the model in general is very good e g cc up to 0 96 and increases from daily to monthly time scale fig 3 provides a summary map of the accuracy of the modeled data compared to station data at daily and monthly scales even though there is a high impact of large reservoirs and dams on the performance of the model such as the akosombo dam with a dor of greater than 250 there is no clear relationship between the skill and dor the dor ranges from 0 1 to 552 the large reservoirs 2000 mm3 show the highest dor 36 compared to the smaller reservoirs the monthly correlation at the basin outlet most southerly station in fig 3b is 0 2 because of the significant influence of the akosombo and other upstream dams that are not accounted for in the model but generally increases upstream and where there are fewer dams the dor of the akosombo dam is about 270 which is consistent with the known and significant impact on downstream flow similarly the pbias and rmse are higher at the outlet but lower at stations with few or no dams upstream for example at station tile no upstream dam the monthly cc pbias and rmse and nse are 0 89 0 7 4 3 m3s 1 and 0 78 respectively moreover for stations with the longest records and fewer data gaps the modeled data capture the daily and monthly low and high flows very well as shown for stations nuwani fig 4a and bittou fig 4b with cc and nse values of 0 91 and 0 83 and 0 85 and 0 63 respectively the reservoir above the station nuwani have a dor of about 36 suggesting that their influence on the downstream flows recorded at these stations is relatively low overall the monthly cc and nse for most of the stations are higher than 0 7 and 0 55 respectively and the reservoirs above these stations have a dor of less than 36 to evaluate the model performance for drought duration and severity we identified seven stations with observed records of greater than 6 years fig 5 the results indicate that the model does reasonably well in representing the average number of drought duration per drought event but with a tendency to underestimate compared to the observations this may be largely due to the impact of dams and reservoirs e g because of the water storage and release for hydropower and diversion to agriculture as well as uncertainties in the modelling for example at station nawuni the observed and modeled streamflow show average drought duration days of 66 and 41 for moderate 72 and 42 for severe and 51 and 30 for extreme droughts respectively fig 5 the presence of upstream dams is expected to impact the drought regime downstream nevertheless the reliability of the modeled data for drought analysis will be significantly lower in catchments with upstream dams and therefore we show the results in this context sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 simulated climatology of drought duration and severity the spatial distribution of simulated drought duration and severity averaged over all identified drought events during 1979 2013 is shown in fig 6 the average drought duration is higher in the far south and northern parts of the basin for all threshold levels moderate drought durations fig 6a are lower 30 60 days in the central part 8 n to 11 n but higher 80 130 days in the north north eastern and southern parts of the basin similarly a lower number of severe fig 6b and extreme fig 6c drought durations 20 60 days are simulated in central parts of the basin and increases towards the southern and northern parts of the basin 50 100 days moving from moderate to extreme droughts drought duration decreases as expected but with hotspots of high drought durations persisting in the far north and south the normalised severity severity divided by mean annual daily flow is higher in the north and south east fig 6d f generally reflecting the spatial distribution of the drought duration but with also a west east gradient with higher severity in the east the severity for moderate droughts fig 6d is lower in large parts of the black volta and increases towards the northern part of the basin the severity is higher in the lower volta oti river and large parts of the white volta which shows an increase from the west to the east part of the basin for severe droughts fig 6e similar to moderate droughts the north part of the black volta lower volta and the oti river show a higher severity compared to the rest of the basin moreover the lower volta and oti river show a higher severity for extreme droughts compared to the black and white volta fig 6f in general there is a tendency for longer drought durations and higher severity for river reaches with larger upstream areas which is expected given the lower variability of flows fig 6g i total severity normalized by upstream catchment area is lower in the upper part of the basin 0 25 m3s 1 km2 and increases towards the lower volta up to 5 m3s 1 km2 with an increase in drainage area for moderate fig 6g severe fig 6h and extreme fig 6i droughts a large part of the oti river shows the maximum severity 3 5 m3s 1 km2 compared to the white and black volta compared to moderate and severe droughts the total severity for extreme droughts is lower in the white and black volta with the maximum severity up to 2 m3s 1 km2 in the oti river and lower volta fig 7 shows the same data as scatter plots and highlights the strong relationship between severity and catchment area i e droughts are more severe in larger catchments as the flows are generally higher the figure also shows the normalized severity severity divided by maf versus catchment size to account for this relationship and shows that this becomes closer to a constant value although dependent on the drought threshold for catchments larger than about 2000 3000 km2 fig 7b for smaller catchments there is more diversity in values which likely reflects the much higher variability of flows drought duration tends to vary for larger catchments from about 30 60 days depending on the threshold with a large range in values from 30 to more than 120 days in smaller catchments fig 7c 3 3 trends in drought duration and severity the trend analysis shows spatially varying trends over 1979 2013 in moderate severe and extreme drought duration and severity with statistical significance in a few areas fig 8 relative to the long term mean fig 6a c the upper part of the white volta and the oti river show a decreasing trend in moderate and severe drought durations of up to 5 per drought event conversely large parts of the lower and black volta and downstream of the white volta show an increasing trend up to 1 per event the decreasing trends in moderate drought durations in upstream parts of the white volta and oti river are statistically significant the number of extreme drought duration days shows an increasing trend up to 2 5 per event in the upper parts of the white volta and oti river and large parts of lower volta and a decreasing trend up to 5 per event in the black volta which are significant in a few places drought severity shows decreasing and increasing trends up to 20 per event significant in a few places in the upper and lower parts respectively of the white volta black volta and oti river for moderate and severe droughts the lower volta shows an increasing trend up to 20 per event for moderate severe and extreme droughts for severe droughts a large part of the basin shows an increasing trend of severity whereas the upper part of the black volta shows a decreasing trend of up to 20 per event in general drought durations and severity have decreased in the upper basin and increased in the lower basin particularly for moderate and severe droughts whilst extreme droughts have become longer and more severe in the northeast in reality the trends in many areas will likely be impacted by the presence and operation of upstream dams for which there tends to be a higher observed drought duration and severity compared to the modeled data 3 4 decadal variability in drought duration and severity even though there are increasing and decreasing trends in drought duration and severity there is high decadal variability across the time period to assess this variability we calculated the drought statistics over three decades 1981 1990 1980 s 1991 2000 1990 s and 2001 2010 2000 s the result shows large differences in drought duration and severity between the three decades with spatial variability in the drought characteristics in different decades figs 9 and 10 moderate drought duration is higher during the 1980 s and 2000 s in northern volta compared to the 1990 s fig 9 the white volta shows an increasing tendency from the 1980 2000 s and the black and lower volta basins show high variability between the three decades the maximum number of moderate droughts 100 130 days is observed in southern and northern volta during each decade similar to moderate droughts severe droughts show a high number of drought durations in the north and south part of volta with a reduction during the 1990 s and a maximum of up to 100 130 days in the other decades the duration of extreme droughts is also lower in the 1990 s particularly in the lower volta oti river and white volta the normalised severity similarly shows spatial and temporal variability across the three time periods fig 10 moderate drought severity is higher in the black volta lower volta and oti compared to the white volta in the 1980 s however moderate drought severity in the black volta is lower during the 1990 s and 2000 s the oti river and lower volta show a higher severity in all periods in the 1990 s the severity for severe and extreme droughts is lower in a large part of the volta compared to the 1980 s and 2000 s in general the oti river and lower volta showed a higher severity in all periods compared to the white volta 3 5 streamflow precipitation relationship and drought propagation the correlation with streamflow increases from 1 to 30 days and decreases thereafter the correlation varies depending on the climate and upstream catchment area in wetter and larger catchments 9000 16000 km2 the correlation is very high from 0 74 to 0 84 compared to drier and smaller catchments 130 4500 with correlations from 0 65 to 0 71 for 30 day antecedent precipitation fig 11a an example is provided in fig 11a for 12 river reaches selected from white volta black volta oti river and lower volta which shows that the highest correlation is for a 30 days average the location of the 12 river reachs river id is provided in the suplimentary material sfig 1 moreover there is a clear propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought using the same threshold level for the 30 day average precipitation on average the propagation to streamflow droughts start two weeks after the start of the meteorological drought fig 11b but this varies depending on the season wet versus dry and length of the meteorological drought fig 11b also shows negative lag values indicating streamflow drought starts before meteorological droughts longer meteorological droughts increase the duration and severity of streamflow droughts during wetter months streamflow droughts can start up to a month after meteorological droughts during dry months however the lag is much smaller with hydrological droughts starting quickly 1 10 days after meteorological droughts 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties in the modeled streamflow one of the main challenges in assessing and understanding drought in the region is the limited availability of high quality measured hydro climate data to allow long term analysis and especially across different scales down to the catchment level van huijgevoort et al 2013 hydrological models driven by the most accurate meteorological forcing developed from a combination of remote sensing climate model and observations are a plausible alternative to represent regional terrestrial water cycles for drought analysis van huijgevoort et al 2013 here we used reliable and widely used meteorological forcing datasets available at a high spatial and temporal resolution and for multiple decades to drive a widely applied and tested hydrological model nevertheless there are several uncertainties in the modelling approach which affect the results and their interpretation hydrological droughts are strongly modified by natural conditions such as land cover and soil type as well as human activities such as changes in land use storage and redistribution of water which influence the propagation of precipitation through the hydrological system and modify drought characteristics van loon et al 2016 in the volta basin the increase in water storage and abstraction by riparian countries to meet demand has driven water stress streamflow droughts and competition over water resources van de giesen et al 2001 mul et al 2015 these management activities including the numerous dams and associated reservoirs across the basin which show a dor of between 0 1 and 500 are not represented in the version of the vic model used here therefore the skill of the model in representing actual streamflow particularly in major rivers of the white black oti and lower volta fig 1 is affected by the presence of these hydraulic structures and their impact on streamflow nevertheless the model captures the overall variability and does reasonably well in representing the characteristics of hydrological drought at stations with adequate observed data records and with fewer upstream dams taking one of the stations nawuni catchment area 93 000 km2 with the longest record a low number of data gaps and a large number of upstream dams and reservoirs dor 40 the daily and monthly correlation is higher than 90 and the mean duration for moderate severe and extreme droughts shows an average under estimation of about 20 days given the mean drought duration of about 40 60 days from the model this under estimation is significant and is likely influenced by the lack of representation in the model of upstream water abstraction and water holding by the dams in basins with significant human impacts it is therefore not possible to model drought events with confidence and a new framework is required to assess droughts that takes into account often unknown dam operations and water abstraction van loon et al 2016 the input climate data particularly precipitation provide additional uncertainties although there have been no specific evaluations of mswep for the volta basin that we are aware of it is likely suitable for this application given evaluations for other regions and globally several studies have evaluated mswep in terms of its reliability as compared to station data and against other gridded datasets but also in how well streamflow observations are simulated when used to force a hydrological model which is of interest here mswep captures extreme events in different climate regions and generates streamflow data including high and low flows with higher accuracy compared to other satellite based precipitation datasets tang et al 2019 and provides the highest daily correlation globally beck et al 2016 in addition mswep was found to produce reliable streamflow in the nile basin in ethiopia lakew 2020 and globally lin et al 2019 furthermore vic has a large number of parameters with the most sensitive ones for runoff generation such as the infiltration curve and soil thickness parameters which are somewhat constrained by calibration to the overall streamflow regime but not necessarily to the low flows these may be driven by groundwater sources which are not well represented in the model additional uncertainties in other parameters will contribute to the overall uncertainties 4 2 spatial distribution and propagation of drought the results show diversity in drought characteristics across the basin drought duration days are higher in the north for all threshold levels which reflects the north south climate gradient with streamflow conditions persisting in relatively drier states for longer in the drier conditions of the north the variability in severity is mainly due to the size of the catchment but will also be influenced by the temporal variability in precipitation which is lower in the north and higher in the south drought duration varies from place to place due to many local factors such as air temperature precipitation soil type topography and antecedent conditions that will determine the persistence of anomalies in precipitation as they propagate through the hydrological system in particular differences in the temporal variability of precipitation across the basin will drive differences in drought duration sheffield et al 2004 with low variability in the drier north leading to longer droughts and vice versa in the wetter more variable south the differences in seasonal variability in precipitation may also play a role with the distinct dry season in the north potentially influencing drought duration by extending drought conditions that emerge in the wet season in the south the year round precipitation provides an opportunity to recover droughts that emerge in the wetter part of the year the hotspot of longer droughts and maximum severity in the southeast may be related to the observed increase in dry spell days and decreasing trend in precipitation extremes such as heavy and very heavy rainfall days klassou and komi 2021 the distribution of severity is more complex and depends on how it is normalized but generally follows the pattern of drought duration when normalized by maf and a northwest to southeast gradient when normalized by area we assessed the relationship between precipitation and streamflow by identifying the time scale of antecedent precipitation from 1 to 90 days mean that correlated most strongly with streamflow for all river reaches and found the highest correlation for the 30 day mean for streamflow drought in particular we found a clear propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought with an average lag time of two weeks although with large variation 1 45 days depending on the climate wet or dry and upstream catchment size in general there is a strong relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts in arid and semi arid areas peters et al 2006 vidal et al 2010 van loon and laaha 2015 with lag times similar to this study the relationship shown here for the volta is weaker in smaller and drier catchments which indicates the additional complexity of the propagation that may also be seasonally dependent other catchment characteristics e g elevation soil type geology and land cover and processes modulate the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff and the translation into streamflow and importantly in the context of drought the generation of subsurface flows that can maintain streamflow during meteorological drought chiverton et al 2015 tijdeman et al 2018 van oel et al 2018 van tiel et al 2021 this includes the dynamics of soil water content and groundwater storage hughes 1998 that are influenced by soil and aquifer characteristics and the connection to the stream network groundwater droughts will have a longer lag time e g 45 days li et al 2018 caused by the delay in recharge and residence time in the aquifer 4 3 drivers of changes in streamflow drought we found high temporal variability in drought duration and severity across the volta basin during 1979 2013 the maximum severity occurred in the 1980 s which is in line with known climate variability and the decrease in precipitation in the 1970 1980 s the 1980 s were the driest decade in west africa compared to the period of 1901 1970 nicholson and palao 1993 and more than 90 of the basin faced extreme metrological drought van de giesen et al 2010 kasei et al 2009 which led to food insecurity for more than 50 of the population kasei et al 2009 studies have indicated that the droughts in the sahel region in the 1970 s and 1980 s were influenced by anthropogenic warming which caused a shift in sea surface temperatures sst in the indo pacific oceans and tropical atlantic park et al 2016 for example sst based indices such as enso atlantic niño and tropical indian ocean tio tend to show the largest connection to the variability in streamflow extremes across west africa chun et al 2021 in addition increasing ssts in the gulf of guinea and south atlantic ocean have been associated with droughts which is a common feature in the tropics rowell et al 1995 hoerling et al 2006 a clear link between droughts and indian ocean warming has also been shown for the region over the period 1950 1990 hoerling et al 2006 and this is expected to lead to increased droughts in the 21st century with warming of the indian ocean 4 4 implications and future changes overall the model data show an increasing trend in streamflow drought in the lower volta and a decreasing trend in the northeastern part of the basin which is in part a rebound from the dry conditions of the 1980 s trenberth et al 2007 in the volta and west africa in general the amount and duration of daily precipitation has declined since the 1970 s and led to an increase in moderate and severe drought durations kasei et al 2009 oguntunde et al 2017 owusu et al 2008 future climate projections for the volta basin indicate an increase in the magnitude and frequency of droughts oguntunde et al 2020 this will further impact water availability for agriculture energy and other public needs and will be aggravated by the projected increase in population and related demand for water for agriculture energy and food production ipcc 2013 in the volta basin more than 90 of the agricultural land is rainfed and managed by smallholder farmers kasei et al 2009 which makes it more susceptible to the projected change and variability in climate 5 summary and conclusion droughts are one of the main challenges in africa affecting the agriculture and energy sectors and livelihoods of millions of africans particularly those in rural areas which mainly depend on rain fed agriculture due to its natural complexity however it is very difficult to manage monitor and mitigate drought and its impacts the impact of droughts is exacerbated due to the lack of water storage infrastructure and limited knowledge and up to date information on their changes and variability and links to climate drivers as a basis to effectively manage and monitor droughts at a basin and sub catchment level we provided a detailed analysis of variability and changes in droughts based on streamflow data simulated using the vic and rapid modelling system for 10 300 river reaches the application of a high resolution hydrological modelling framework has allowed the assessment of changes and variability in drought duration and severity at a much finer scale than previous studies in the region which helps to identify hotspot areas of drought hazard which can inform the development of adaptation measures accordingly based on the simulated flow drought duration days and severity showed high variability in space and time through the three decades of analysis the number of drought duration days are higher in the north and south and lower in central parts of the basin the oti river and northern volta show the highest severity compared to the black white and lower volta drought duration and severity was generally higher in the 1980 s drought duration and severity generally decreases in the north and northeastern parts of the basin since the 1980 s and increased in the lower part the observed increase in the south up to 2 5 per event and decrease up to 5 per event in the north in drought duration days might not cause a significant impact on the agriculture water supply and energy sectors however the change in severity which is up to 20 per event in the lower volta might cause an impact on the hydroelectric e g akosombo dam and irrigation dams on the other hand existing and planned irrigation and multipurpose dams in the upper part of the black and the north part volta in general will benefit from the decrease in severity as a result of the increase in precipitation in general considering the importance of the basin for water supply irrigation and energy for the six countries that share the basin these changes have implications for how water resources are managed in the basin including the need for early warning strategies to reduce the

7904,study region volta river basin west africa study focus hydrological droughts have a wide range of impacts on societies and economic sectors such as agriculture and energy production analysis of hydrological droughts helps better plan and manage water resources under global change this study analyses the spatial and temporal variability of hydrological drought occurrence duration and severity in the volta river basin during 1979 2013 we used the variable infiltration capacity and vector based routing rapid models and high resolution forcing data to simulate streamflow for 10300 river reaches new hydrological insights for the region drought duration and severity show high spatial variability and large differences between the three decades 1980 s 1990 s and 2000 s droughts are more severe in larger catchments as the flows are generally higher the trend analysis shows a general decreasing trend up to 5 per event in drought duration in the north eastern and an increasing trend in southern parts of the basin drought severity shows an increasing and decreasing trend up to 20 in south and north part of the basin respectively daily streamflow has a maximum correlation up to 0 78 with upstream precipitation for the previous 30 days with a clear signal of propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought with an average lag time of two weeks the results indicate the need to consider site specific and adaptive drought management measures to minimize the impacts graphical abstract total severity during the period 1979 2013 normalized by upstream catchment area m3 s 1

phenomenon that affects the environment economies and a large number of people globally every year wilhite et al 2007 sternberg 2011 ipcc 2012 cred 2018 the most negative impacts usually occur in developing countries where droughts can lead to crop failure and food crisis together with other socio economic conditions droughts can amplify the risk of malnutrition health issues and chronic poverty which may ultimately result in forced migration and even loss of life vicente serrano et al 2012 lyon and dewitt 2012 stanke et al 2013 unisdr cred 2015 haile et al 2020 ngcamu and chari 2020 drought occurs across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales which makes managing socio economic and environmental impacts such as land degradation and desertification very challenging vicente serrano et al 2012 masih et al 2014 rivera et al 2017 variation in drought characteristics is driven by variability and changes in precipitation and temperature ipcc 2012 but can also be aggravated by direct anthropogenic drivers such as water management and land use mishra and singh 2010 sheffield et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2018 global warming and an increase in temperature extremes have increased concurrent extreme events such as heatwaves and droughts aghakouchak et al 2014 ballarin et al 2021 leonard et al 2014 the potential impact of this type of compound event could lead to longer and more severe hydrological droughts as a result of increased variability and long term changes in climate the duration and severity of droughts have potentially increased in africa in the last few decades sheffield et al 2012 dai 2013 sivakumar et al 2014 naumann et al 2018 this is expected to continue into the future as drought magnitude and severity are projected to increase under global change ipcc 2013 naumann et al 2018 sheffield and wood 2008 with the largest changes expected in sub tropical dry regions that are projected to become drier overall droughts are already common in arid and semi arid regions of africa and their frequency and duration has increased in recent years such as in west africa dai 2013 masih et al 2014 and the greater horn of africa sivakumar et al 2014 ayana et al 2016 nicholson 2017 haile et al 2020 for africa overall future climate projections indicate an increase in frequency and intensity of droughts as well as other extreme events such as floods and heavy rainstorms bates et al 2008 niang et al 2014 gebrechorkos et al 2019 many african countries face the highest impact of drought due to their lower capacity to adapt to changes niang et al 2014 mcdowell et al 2016 they are also likely to be increasingly impacted in the future not only because of the projected changes in drought but also because of ongoing socio economic changes over the last few decades the demand for water has significantly increased by many folds and water scarcity is occurring almost every year due to an increase in population growth and expansion in agriculture industrial and energy sectors mishra and singh 2010 the increase in population and economic activities have led to an increase in construction of water infrastructure to meet sectoral demands which put water resources under increasing stress mul et al 2015 according to haile et al 2020 assessing drought risks at a basin level is crucial to effectively and efficiently monitor and manage droughts and can serve as a basis for development of adaptation measures under conditions of climate variability and change oloruntade et al 2017 the current study focuses on one of the largest river basins in west africa the volta basin aiming to provide a detailed analysis of the variability and change in hydrological drought focused on streamflow the analysis is carried out using modeled data over an unprecedented number of river reaches i e 10 300 the volta river basin is an important resource for around 24 million people across six countries ghana burkina faso mali ivory coast benin and togo using water for domestic livestock agriculture and hydropower purposes rodgers et al 2007 mul et al 2015 the basin therefore plays an important role in the economic development of the region however due to increases in demand from the increasing population and economic growth there is potential for competition over water resources that are already under stress which is exacerbated under drought conditions mul et al 2015 this is expected to become worse in the future with consequences for the food security and economic growth of the six countries mccartney et al 2012 mul et al 2015 we focus on the characterization of streamflow droughts over the period 1979 2013 in terms of the time below a threshold level drought duration and accumulated streamflow deficit drought severity which is derived from the streamflow time series e g melsen and guse 2019 rivera et al 2017 we choose this period due to the availability of the most reliable precipitation data which begins at the start of the satellite period we also assess the relationship between daily streamflow and antecedent precipitation and therefore how meteorological droughts propagate into hydrological droughts because of the lack of coverage in time and space of observed records of streamflow we use simulated runoff from the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface hydrological model liang et al 1994 further we used the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid routing model david et al 2011 to convert the runoff from vic into streamflow these simulations are forced by a gridded gauge satellite reanalysis climate forcing dataset we compare the modeled streamflow against available observations of streamflow to understand the performance of the model and its suitability for looking at drought characteristics across the basin overall the analysis could provide baseline risk information for users and water agencies to better manage water resources develop site specific adaptation measures and support the development of integrated water management and planning strategies to tackle the impacts of droughts under variability in climate and future change 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the volta basin is one of the largest river basins in west africa with an area of 412 772 km2 fig 1 the basin is shared among burkina faso 43 0 of the basin area ghana 41 6 togo 6 4 benin 3 4 mali 3 1 and côte d ivoire 2 5 mul et al 2015 the volta has four major sub basins white volta black volta lower volta and oti river covering an area of 27 36 18 and 19 of the total drainage area respectively gordon et al 2013 mul et al 2015 the climate is highly variable with a clear gradient from south to north as influenced by the movement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and zonal winds which leads to high variability in floods and droughts the climate of the river basin is classified as moist sub humid dry sub humid and semi arid in the south central and north respectively ferreira et al 2019 mul et al 2015 more than 1100 reservoirs large multipurpose irrigation and small impoundments with a storage volume of between 1 and 147 960 mm3 have been constructed during the 1980 2010 s there are 19 planned hydropower dams in the basin due to an increase in water demand for energy agriculture and water supply barry et al 2005 mul et al 2015 the average annual precipitation for the basin over 1979 2013 is 850 mm year with the highest and lowest amounts in the southern up to 1600 mm year and northern up to 400 mm year parts of the basin respectively fig 2a the inter annual variability of precipitation is higher in the lower volta standard deviation up to 250 mm but decreases towards the northern part of the basin fig 2c on average the basin receives about 70 of the total precipitation during july september with little rainfall during the months of november march the northern part receives the majority of precipitation during june september while the southern part receives this during may september jones et al 2017 the northern part is warmer than the southern part with an annual daily average 1979 2013 temperature of about 29 c fig 2b inter annual variability in average temperature is higher in the north standard deviation up to 0 43 c and lower in the south standard deviation up to 0 23 c part of the basin fig 2d 2 2 hydrological modelling and streamflow routing the vic model is a semi distributed model that solves the energy and water balances at the grid scale liang et al 1994 vic organises the spatial domain into different computational cells characterized by land cover type and vertically into soil layers to calculate water budget components such as runoff surface and subsurface evapotranspiration and infiltration the horizontal flow between grid cells is not modeled and it is assumed that water cannot flow back into the soil after reaching the river dang et al 2020 the penman monteith approach is used to compute evapotranspiration the variable infiltration curve is used to represent the spatial distribution of infiltration and surface runoff within the grid cell and the non linear arno recession curve is used for baseflow simulation liang et al 1994 the variable infiltration curve is an important part of vic which drives the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration and runoff depending on the spatial distribution of soil moisture meteorological forcings required by vic are daily precipitation temperature shortwave and longwave radiation wind speed atmospheric pressure and vapour pressure in addition soil e g texture and bulk density saturated conductivity and vegetation e g albedo and leaf area index parameters are required to parametrize the model vic 4 2 the model is calibrated and bias corrected at 0 25 to match global maps of 17 runoff characteristics such as mean annual runoff baseflow index and different percentiles derived from ground observations beck et al 2015 the most sensitive vic parameters for runoff generation were calibrated such as the variable infiltration curve binf soil depth and the maximum soil moisture fraction at which non linear rapidly increasing baseflow begins ds the observation based runoff maps were developed to estimate streamflow at ungauged catchments and more than 3000 stations were used to train a machine learning neural network ensembles and applied globally beck et al 2015 the use of these runoff characteristics improved the performance of hydrological models in simulating streamflow as compared to traditional calibration approaches using limited ground stations lin et al 2019 rapid david et al 2011 is a vector based routing model used to simulate streamflow at potentially thousands of river reaches it applies the muskingum channel routing scheme to calculate the volume of water and streamflow with dimensionless x and time k parameters in addition the model requires a network connectivity file and gridded runoff surface and subsurface which can be computed in arc gis eg https github com esri python toolbox for rapid to assess the performance of vic rapid the modeled streamflow is evaluated against available in situ data on daily and monthly time scales in terms of the correlation coefficient cc percentage bias pbias root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and time series

shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds dataset hydrosheds provides a georeferenced vector and raster stream network and flow directions derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm elevation data https hydrosheds cr usgs gov the location of the reservoirs shown in fig 1 are obtained from the water research institute of ghana although we do not model the hydrological impact of the reservoirs and dam operations we discuss the results in the context of their presence across the basin to assess the potential differences between the model output and the unobserved reality we calculated the degree of regulation dor as the ratio of the reservoir capacity to average annual flow upstream of the reservoir lehner et al 2011 for each reservoir with available capacity information for a given year a higher dor indicates the probability that a substantial amount of flow can be stored for future release which influences flows downstream lehner et al 2011 the dor was then used to inform a qualitative assessment of the performance of the model where the lack of reservoir representation in the model could lead to large uncertainties or errors in the modelled output and drought characteristics observed streamflow data from 39 stations 20 daily and 19 monthly were obtained from the global runoff data centre http www bafg de grdc and the water research institute of ghana tables 1 and 2 the grdc database provides quality controlled historical daily and monthly streamflow to help scientists perform global and local scale hydrological and environmental studies grdc 2019 2 4 drought indices and trend analysis the threshold level approach yevjevich 1967 is used to define streamflow droughts the threshold is derived from the flow duration curve as flow exceeded or equalled for selected percentile thresholds 70 80 and 90 of the time these thresholds are classified as moderate severe and extreme droughts respectively rivera et al 2017 which is an approach that has been widely used to assess streamflow droughts e g fleig et al 2006 wanders et al 2015 rivera et al 2018 compared to standardised indices such as the standardised streamflow index mckee et al 1993 shukla and wood 2008 the threshold level approach allows estimation of streamflow deficit severity which is crucial for water management in sectors such as agriculture and hydropower rivera et al 2018 van loon 2015 streamflow droughts are computed from the daily time series of the modelled years 1979 2013 using the threshold approach the approach defines droughts when the flow is below the given threshold value the threshold values are computed based on a moving quantile where daily threshold values are defined based on the 70th 80th and 90th percentiles of the flow duration curve over a moving window of 30 days that moves through the time series of the study period beyene et al 2014 dierauer and whitfield 2019 hence this method provides different threshold values for every day of the year which remains the same across all years this approach helps to account for the influence of seasonality to identify individual droughts we used a minimum inter event and event duration of 10 and 15 days respectively as recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 2008 and dierauer and whitfield 2019 the event duration avoids counting two adjacent droughts separated by minor fluctuations around the threshold as separate events droughts occurring with less than the minimum inter event days i e 10 days were considered as a single event droughts are assessed in terms of their duration days and severity m3 s further severity and total severity total deficit volume during the drought events are normalised by mean annual flow and catchment area for spatial comparison the moderate severe and extreme droughts are assessed relative to their threshold level this does mean that a moderate drought may contain a severe or extreme drought if values fall below the threshold for these latter types of drought to assess the presence of monotonic downward or upward trends in drought duration days and severity we used the mann kendall test kendall 1975 and the magnitude of the change i e slope is computed using the sen s slope method sen 1968 furthermore we assessed the propagation of drought i e meteorological to hydrological droughts via the relationship between precipitation and streamflow to understand the influence of precipitation variability on the changes in hydrological drought we calculated the 3 7 14 21 30 60 and 90 days moving average of antecedent precipitation averaged over the upstream catchment for catchments smaller than 100 km2 and identified the duration of antecedent precipitation with maximum correlation with streamflow variability the selection of smaller catchments is to reduce the impact of flow travel time and spatially variable precipitation in larger catchments which will affect the relationship between antecedent precipitation and streamflow we then used percentile thresholds as above to identify the start of meteorological and hydrological droughts and calculated the time lag between them as a metric of propagation 3 results 3 1 comparison of observed and modeled data the modeled streamflow data is compared with observed data using the methods described in section 2 2 the performance of the model in general is very good e g cc up to 0 96 and increases from daily to monthly time scale fig 3 provides a summary map of the accuracy of the modeled data compared to station data at daily and monthly scales even though there is a high impact of large reservoirs and dams on the performance of the model such as the akosombo dam with a dor of greater than 250 there is no clear relationship between the skill and dor the dor ranges from 0 1 to 552 the large reservoirs 2000 mm3 show the highest dor 36 compared to the smaller reservoirs the monthly correlation at the basin outlet most southerly station in fig 3b is 0 2 because of the significant influence of the akosombo and other upstream dams that are not accounted for in the model but generally increases upstream and where there are fewer dams the dor of the akosombo dam is about 270 which is consistent with the known and significant impact on downstream flow similarly the pbias and rmse are higher at the outlet but lower at stations with few or no dams upstream for example at station tile no upstream dam the monthly cc pbias and rmse and nse are 0 89 0 7 4 3 m3s 1 and 0 78 respectively moreover for stations with the longest records and fewer data gaps the modeled data capture the daily and monthly low and high flows very well as shown for stations nuwani fig 4a and bittou fig 4b with cc and nse values of 0 91 and 0 83 and 0 85 and 0 63 respectively the reservoir above the station nuwani have a dor of about 36 suggesting that their influence on the downstream flows recorded at these stations is relatively low overall the monthly cc and nse for most of the stations are higher than 0 7 and 0 55 respectively and the reservoirs above these stations have a dor of less than 36 to evaluate the model performance for drought duration and severity we identified seven stations with observed records of greater than 6 years fig 5 the results indicate that the model does reasonably well in representing the average number of drought duration per drought event but with a tendency to underestimate compared to the observations this may be largely due to the impact of dams and reservoirs e g because of the water storage and release for hydropower and diversion to agriculture as well as uncertainties in the modelling for example at station nawuni the observed and modeled streamflow show average drought duration days of 66 and 41 for moderate 72 and 42 for severe and 51 and 30 for extreme droughts respectively fig 5 the presence of upstream dams is expected to impact the drought regime downstream nevertheless the reliability of the modeled data for drought analysis will be significantly lower in catchments with upstream dams and therefore we show the results in this context sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 2 simulated climatology of drought duration and severity the spatial distribution of simulated drought duration and severity averaged over all identified drought events during 1979 2013 is shown in fig 6 the average drought duration is higher in the far south and northern parts of the basin for all threshold levels moderate drought durations fig 6a are lower 30 60 days in the central part 8 n to 11 n but higher 80 130 days in the north north eastern and southern parts of the basin similarly a lower number of severe fig 6b and extreme fig 6c drought durations 20 60 days are simulated in central parts of the basin and increases towards the southern and northern parts of the basin 50 100 days moving from moderate to extreme droughts drought duration decreases as expected but with hotspots of high drought durations persisting in the far north and south the normalised severity severity divided by mean annual daily flow is higher in the north and south east fig 6d f generally reflecting the spatial distribution of the drought duration but with also a west east gradient with higher severity in the east the severity for moderate droughts fig 6d is lower in large parts of the black volta and increases towards the northern part of the basin the severity is higher in the lower volta oti river and large parts of the white volta which shows an increase from the west to the east part of the basin for severe droughts fig 6e similar to moderate droughts the north part of the black volta lower volta and the oti river show a higher severity compared to the rest of the basin moreover the lower volta and oti river show a higher severity for extreme droughts compared to the black and white volta fig 6f in general there is a tendency for longer drought durations and higher severity for river reaches with larger upstream areas which is expected given the lower variability of flows fig 6g i total severity normalized by upstream catchment area is lower in the upper part of the basin 0 25 m3s 1 km2 and increases towards the lower volta up to 5 m3s 1 km2 with an increase in drainage area for moderate fig 6g severe fig 6h and extreme fig 6i droughts a large part of the oti river shows the maximum severity 3 5 m3s 1 km2 compared to the white and black volta compared to moderate and severe droughts the total severity for extreme droughts is lower in the white and black volta with the maximum severity up to 2 m3s 1 km2 in the oti river and lower volta fig 7 shows the same data as scatter plots and highlights the strong relationship between severity and catchment area i e droughts are more severe in larger catchments as the flows are generally higher the figure also shows the normalized severity severity divided by maf versus catchment size to account for this relationship and shows that this becomes closer to a constant value although dependent on the drought threshold for catchments larger than about 2000 3000 km2 fig 7b for smaller catchments there is more diversity in values which likely reflects the much higher variability of flows drought duration tends to vary for larger catchments from about 30 60 days depending on the threshold with a large range in values from 30 to more than 120 days in smaller catchments fig 7c 3 3 trends in drought duration and severity the trend analysis shows spatially varying trends over 1979 2013 in moderate severe and extreme drought duration and severity with statistical significance in a few areas fig 8 relative to the long term mean fig 6a c the upper part of the white volta and the oti river show a decreasing trend in moderate and severe drought durations of up to 5 per drought event conversely large parts of the lower and black volta and downstream of the white volta show an increasing trend up to 1 per event the decreasing trends in moderate drought durations in upstream parts of the white volta and oti river are statistically significant the number of extreme drought duration days shows an increasing trend up to 2 5 per event in the upper parts of the white volta and oti river and large parts of lower volta and a decreasing trend up to 5 per event in the black volta which are significant in a few places drought severity shows decreasing and increasing trends up to 20 per event significant in a few places in the upper and lower parts respectively of the white volta black volta and oti river for moderate and severe droughts the lower volta shows an increasing trend up to 20 per event for moderate severe and extreme droughts for severe droughts a large part of the basin shows an increasing trend of severity whereas the upper part of the black volta shows a decreasing trend of up to 20 per event in general drought durations and severity have decreased in the upper basin and increased in the lower basin particularly for moderate and severe droughts whilst extreme droughts have become longer and more severe in the northeast in reality the trends in many areas will likely be impacted by the presence and operation of upstream dams for which there tends to be a higher observed drought duration and severity compared to the modeled data 3 4 decadal variability in drought duration and severity even though there are increasing and decreasing trends in drought duration and severity there is high decadal variability across the time period to assess this variability we calculated the drought statistics over three decades 1981 1990 1980 s 1991 2000 1990 s and 2001 2010 2000 s the result shows large differences in drought duration and severity between the three decades with spatial variability in the drought characteristics in different decades figs 9 and 10 moderate drought duration is higher during the 1980 s and 2000 s in northern volta compared to the 1990 s fig 9 the white volta shows an increasing tendency from the 1980 2000 s and the black and lower volta basins show high variability between the three decades the maximum number of moderate droughts 100 130 days is observed in southern and northern volta during each decade similar to moderate droughts severe droughts show a high number of drought durations in the north and south part of volta with a reduction during the 1990 s and a maximum of up to 100 130 days in the other decades the duration of extreme droughts is also lower in the 1990 s particularly in the lower volta oti river and white volta the normalised severity similarly shows spatial and temporal variability across the three time periods fig 10 moderate drought severity is higher in the black volta lower volta and oti compared to the white volta in the 1980 s however moderate drought severity in the black volta is lower during the 1990 s and 2000 s the oti river and lower volta show a higher severity in all periods in the 1990 s the severity for severe and extreme droughts is lower in a large part of the volta compared to the 1980 s and 2000 s in general the oti river and lower volta showed a higher severity in all periods compared to the white volta 3 5 streamflow precipitation relationship and drought propagation the correlation with streamflow increases from 1 to 30 days and decreases thereafter the correlation varies depending on the climate and upstream catchment area in wetter and larger catchments 9000 16000 km2 the correlation is very high from 0 74 to 0 84 compared to drier and smaller catchments 130 4500 with correlations from 0 65 to 0 71 for 30 day antecedent precipitation fig 11a an example is provided in fig 11a for 12 river reaches selected from white volta black volta oti river and lower volta which shows that the highest correlation is for a 30 days average the location of the 12 river reachs river id is provided in the suplimentary material sfig 1 moreover there is a clear propagation from meteorological drought to hydrological drought using the same threshold level for the 30 day average precipitation on average the propagation to streamflow droughts start two weeks after the start of the meteorological drought fig 11b but this varies depending on the season wet versus dry and length of the meteorological drought fig 11b also shows negative lag values indicating streamflow drought starts before meteorological droughts longer meteorological droughts increase the duration and severity of streamflow droughts during wetter months streamflow droughts can start up to a month after meteorological droughts during dry months however the lag is much smaller with hydrological droughts starting quickly 1 10 days after meteorological droughts 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainties in the modeled streamflow one of the main challenges in assessing and understanding drought in the region is the limited availability of high quality measured hydro climate data to allow long term analysis and especially across different scales down to the catchment level van huijgevoort et al 2013 hydrological models driven by the most accurate meteorological forcing developed from a combination of remote sensing climate model and observations are a plausible alternative to represent regional terrestrial water cycles for drought analysis van huijgevoort et al 2013 here we used reliable and widely used meteorological forcing datasets available at a high spatial and temporal resolution and for multiple decades to drive a widely applied and tested hydrological model nevertheless there are several uncertainties in the modelling approach which affect the results and their interpretation hydrological droughts are strongly modified by natural conditions such as land cover and soil type as well as human activities such as changes in land use storage and redistribution of water which influence the propagation of precipitation through the hydrological system and modify drought characteristics van loon et al 2016 in the volta basin the increase in water storage and abstraction by riparian countries to meet demand has driven water stress streamflow droughts and competition over water resources van de giesen et al 2001 mul et al 2015 these management activities including the numerous dams and associated reservoirs across the basin which show a dor of between 0 1 and 500 are not represented in the version of the vic model used here therefore the skill of the model in representing actual streamflow particularly in major rivers of the white black oti and lower volta fig 1 is affected by the presence of these hydraulic structures and their impact on streamflow nevertheless the model captures the overall variability and does reasonably well in representing the characteristics of hydrological drought at stations with adequate observed data records and with fewer upstream dams taking one of the stations nawuni catchment area 93 000 km2 with the longest record a low number of data gaps and a large number of upstream dams and reservoirs dor 40 the daily and monthly correlation is higher than 90 and the mean duration for moderate severe and extreme droughts shows an average under estimation of about 20 days given the mean drought duration of about 40 60 days from the model this under estimation is significant and is likely influenced by the lack of representation in the model of upstream water abstraction and water holding by the dams in basins with significant human impacts it is therefore not possible to model drought events with confidence and a new framework is required to assess droughts that takes into account often unknown dam operations and water abstraction van loon et al 2016 the input climate data particularly precipitation provide additional uncertainties although there have been no specific evaluations of mswep for the volta basin that we are aware of it is likely suitable for this application given evaluations for other regions and globally several studies have evaluated mswep in terms of its reliability as compared to station data and against other gridded datasets but also in how well streamflow observations are simulated when used to force a hydrological model which is of interest here mswep captures extreme events in different climate regions and generates streamflow data including high and low flows with higher accuracy compared to other satellite based precipitation datasets tang et al 2019 and provides the highest daily correlation globally beck et al 2016 in addition mswep was found to produce reliable streamflow in the nile basin in ethiopia lakew 2020 and globally lin et al 2019 furthermore vic has a large number of parameters with the most sensitive ones for runoff generation such as the infiltration curve and soil thickness parameters which are somewhat constrained by calibration to the overall streamflow regime but not necessarily to the low flows these may be driven by groundwater sources which are not well represented in the model additional uncertainties in other parameters will contribute to the overall uncertainties 4 2 spatial distribution and propagation of drought the results show diversity in drought characteristics across the basin drought duration days are higher in the north for all threshold levels which reflects the north south climate gradient with streamflow conditions persisting in relatively drier states for longer in the drier conditions of the north the variability in severity is mainly due to the size of the catchment but will also be influenced by the temporal variability in precipitation which is lower in the north and higher in the south drought duration varies from place to place due to many local factors such as air temperature precipitation soil type topography and antecedent conditions that will determine the persistence of anomalies in precipitation as they propagate through the hydrological system in particular differences in the temporal variability of precipitation across the basin will drive differences in drought duration sheffield et al 2004 with low variability in the drier north leading to longer droughts and vice versa in the wetter more variable south the differences in seasonal variability in precipitation may also play a role with the distinct dry season in the north potentially influencing drought duration by extending drought conditions that emerge in the wet season in the south the year round precipitation provides an opportunity to recover droughts that emerge in the wetter part of the year the hotspot of longer droughts and maximum severity in the southeast may be related to the observed increase in dry spell days and decreasing trend in precipitation extremes such as heavy and very heavy rainfall days klassou and komi 2021 the distribution of severity is more complex and depends on how it is normalized but generally follows the pattern of drought duration when normalized by maf and a northwest to southeast gradient when normalized by area we assessed the relationship between precipitation and streamflow by identifying the time scale of antecedent precipitation from 1 to 90 days mean that correlated most strongly with streamflow for all river reaches and found the highest correlation for the 30 day mean for streamflow drought in particular we found a clear propagation from meteorological to hydrological drought with an average lag time of two weeks although with large variation 1 45 days depending on the climate wet or dry and upstream catchment size in general there is a strong relationship between meteorological and hydrological droughts in arid and semi arid areas peters et al 2006 vidal et al 2010 van loon and laaha 2015 with lag times similar to this study the relationship shown here for the volta is weaker in smaller and drier catchments which indicates the additional complexity of the propagation that may also be seasonally dependent other catchment characteristics e g elevation soil type geology and land cover and processes modulate the partitioning of precipitation into evapotranspiration and runoff and the translation into streamflow and importantly in the context of drought the generation of subsurface flows that can maintain streamflow during meteorological drought chiverton et al 2015 tijdeman et al 2018 van oel et al 2018 van tiel et al 2021 this includes the dynamics of soil water content and groundwater storage hughes 1998 that are influenced by soil and aquifer characteristics and the connection to the stream network groundwater droughts will have a longer lag time e g 45 days li et al 2018 caused by the delay in recharge and residence time in the aquifer 4 3 drivers of changes in streamflow drought we found high temporal variability in drought duration and severity across the volta basin during 1979 2013 the maximum severity occurred in the 1980 s which is in line with known climate variability and the decrease in precipitation in the 1970 1980 s the 1980 s were the driest decade in west africa compared to the period of 1901 1970 nicholson and palao 1993 and more than 90 of the basin faced extreme metrological drought van de giesen et al 2010 kasei et al 2009 which led to food insecurity for more than 50 of the population kasei et al 2009 studies have indicated that the droughts in the sahel region in the 1970 s and 1980 s were influenced by anthropogenic warming which caused a shift in sea surface temperatures sst in the indo pacific oceans and tropical atlantic park et al 2016 for example sst based indices such as enso atlantic niño and tropical indian ocean tio tend to show the largest connection to the variability in streamflow extremes across west africa chun et al 2021 in addition increasing ssts in the gulf of guinea and south atlantic ocean have been associated with droughts which is a common feature in the tropics rowell et al 1995 hoerling et al 2006 a clear link between droughts and indian ocean warming has also been shown for the region over the period 1950 1990 hoerling et al 2006 and this is expected to lead to increased droughts in the 21st century with warming of the indian ocean 4 4 implications and future changes overall the model data show an increasing trend in streamflow drought in the lower volta and a decreasing trend in the northeastern part of the basin which is in part a rebound from the dry conditions of the 1980 s trenberth et al 2007 in the volta and west africa in general the amount and duration of daily precipitation has declined since the 1970 s and led to an increase in moderate and severe drought durations kasei et al 2009 oguntunde et al 2017 owusu et al 2008 future climate projections for the volta basin indicate an increase in the magnitude and frequency of droughts oguntunde et al 2020 this will further impact water availability for agriculture energy and other public needs and will be aggravated by the projected increase in population and related demand for water for agriculture energy and food production ipcc 2013 in the volta basin more than 90 of the agricultural land is rainfed and managed by smallholder farmers kasei et al 2009 which makes it more susceptible to the projected change and variability in climate 5 summary and conclusion droughts are one of the main challenges in africa affecting the agriculture and energy sectors and livelihoods of millions of africans particularly those in rural areas which mainly depend on rain fed agriculture due to its natural complexity however it is very difficult to manage monitor and mitigate drought and its impacts the impact of droughts is exacerbated due to the lack of water storage infrastructure and limited knowledge and up to date information on their changes and variability and links to climate drivers as a basis to effectively manage and monitor droughts at a basin and sub catchment level we provided a detailed analysis of variability and changes in droughts based on streamflow data simulated using the vic and rapid modelling system for 10 300 river reaches the application of a high resolution hydrological modelling framework has allowed the assessment of changes and variability in drought duration and severity at a much finer scale than previous studies in the region which helps to identify hotspot areas of drought hazard which can inform the development of adaptation measures accordingly based on the simulated flow drought duration days and severity showed high variability in space and time through the three decades of analysis the number of drought duration days are higher in the north and south and lower in central parts of the basin the oti river and northern volta show the highest severity compared to the black white and lower volta drought duration and severity was generally higher in the 1980 s drought duration and severity generally decreases in the north and northeastern parts of the basin since the 1980 s and increased in the lower part the observed increase in the south up to 2 5 per event and decrease up to 5 per event in the north in drought duration days might not cause a significant impact on the agriculture water supply and energy sectors however the change in severity which is up to 20 per event in the lower volta might cause an impact on the hydroelectric e g akosombo dam and irrigation dams on the other hand existing and planned irrigation and multipurpose dams in the upper part of the black and the north part volta in general will benefit from the decrease in severity as a result of the increase in precipitation in general considering the importance of the basin for water supply irrigation and energy for the six countries that share the basin these changes have implications for how water resources are managed in the basin including the need for early warning strategies to reduce the
