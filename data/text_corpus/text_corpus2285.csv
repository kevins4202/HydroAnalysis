11425,evapotranspiration et is a major component of the hydrologic budget and therefore it requires accurate estimation the agricultural policy environmental extender apex a hydrologic and water quality model developed for evaluating the effect of agricultural production management practices on the environment it has five different methods to simulate et the objectives of this study were to determine the impact of using different et methods in apex on sensitive et parameters in semi arid environments determine reasonable range of values for sensitive parameters and compare performance of these methods using multiple criteria et and crop yield data measured in the lysimeter fields located in the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory bushland texas were used to calibrate and validate the model results indicated that selection of statistical model performance measure and et method affects the number of sensitive parameters and parameter rank the number of sensitive parameters remained relatively stable among et simulation methods but there was large variability in parameter sensitivity ranks it is also important that users carefully choose appropriate statistical measure to use depending on the goals of their study with the exception of maximum rainfall intercept exponent coefficient rainfall scs index coefficient rain intercept coefficient and root growth soil strength all methods had similar ranges of values for the sensitive parameters in general there were no large differences in the performance of et methods however penman monteith method simulated et relatively better than the other methods which may be explained by the fact that it is a physically based method with many weather variables whose data was available for the study area however the study findings indicate that the other et methods can provide satisfactory results in regions with limited weather data abbreviations apex agricultural policy environmental extender

keywords calibration multi comparison criteria et methods sensitivity analysis validation 1 introduction potential impacts of climate variability climate change drought land use change and other environmental factors on agricultural production water quality and water availability can be assessed using hydrologic and water quality models arnold et al 1998 these models range in spatial scale from point to watershed and at temporal scales varying from hourly to annually moriasi et al 2012 results of these models can aid policy makers in selection of cost effective conservation programs to mitigate environmental degradation and non point source nps pollution arabi et al 2012 arnold et al 2012 saleh et al 2012 before using any of these models it is important to understand the processes that influence water budget arnold et al 2015 aouissi et al 2016 water balance studies help to understand the process of water supply and demand and are crucial to agricultural production management and mitigating environmental degradation water balance is impacted by precipitation solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and air temperature plant growth and the movement of sediments nutrients pesticides and pathogens are affected by water balance arnold et al 2012 in agriculture actual evapotranspiration et is a major consumptive use of irrigation water and precipitation gowda et al 2008 and et information is necessary for many app1icationsns in agricultural and natural resource management steiner et al 1991 for reliable water balance estimates and efficient management of managing irrigation projects consideration of potential evapotranspiration etp is an important factor aouissi et al 2016 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 agricultural policy environmental extender apex williams et al 2008 williams and izaurralde 2005 and other hydrological models can be used to estimate water balance key components in many of these models relate to et bhattarai et al 2016 sentelhas et al 2010 which in most cases accounts for the largest component of the water balance marek et al 2016 therefore accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is an essential condition to quantify water balances wagle et al 2016 evaporation and transpiration occur simultaneously in a given landscape and it is difficult to measure both processes separately fisher et al 2005 pandeya and mulligan 2013 thus hydrological models first compute etp and then estimate et by considering available soil water content and land use within the study area aouissi et al 2016 crop et is influenced by crop canopy characteristics plant factors soil condition weather management practices among other factors the main meteorological parameters affecting et are solar radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speed allen et al 1998 the most critical element for sustaining crop production in rain fed agriculture is the availability of water tadesse et al 2015 to satisfy et demand crop growth and better agricultural yields a substantial volume of freshwater is required pandeya and mulligan 2013 however availability of fresh water in semi arid lands is limited to satisfy this evaporative demand and in most cases supplemental irrigation is required to grow crops therefore et and water balance studies are critical in the semiarid texas plains hydrological models such as swat and apex can be used to simulate et in general the swat and apex models use similar etp methods many of the etp methods in swat have been tested in many studies aouissi et al 2016 immerzeel and droogers 2008 nguyen and kappas 2015 wang et al 2006 marek et al 2016 also demonstrated the usefulness of applying swat model to simulate et in the semiarid texas high plains however literature review of apex model found no studies on the performance of various etp methods incorporated within the model therefore this study focuses on the evaluation of etp methods to estimate et apex is a direct extension of environmental policy integrated climate model epic williams 1990 and is a physically based model that may help achieve sustainable agricultural production and better environmental quality similarly it can be used to assess a wide range of alternative manure management scenarios golmohammadi et al 2014 steglich and williams 2013 and to simulate alternative crop systems and their environmental impacts wang et al 2006 according to steglich and williams 2013 apex can simulate long term scenarios stretching up to 4000 years and can assess the impact of different management practices on sediment flow nutrients soil water content and et apex calculates et using different etp methods however there is no published literature comparing the effect of these etp methods on sensitivity of apex model parameters and et simulation performance moreover hydrological models often contain large uncertainties and these can have negative effects on model accuracy song et al 2015 and requires sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is an important first step in model assessment and is the process to quantitatively determine how sensitive model output is to each of the input parameters arnold et al 2012 guzman et al 2015 moriasi et al 2007 zeckoski et al 2015 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the impact of etp methods in apex model on sensitive et parameters 2 determine the reasonable range of values for sensitive parameters based on model calibration and validation results and 3 compare differences and similarities in model simulation performance of etp methods using multiple criteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 evapotranspiration methods according to abbaspour 1991 there are three main categories of et estimation methods models based on the physics of et empirical models based on temperature and empirical correlations that use radiation as well as temperature apex model has five etp methods with at least one method in each of the categories listed table 1 for simplicity the initial short pn and pn m equations are presented in this study instead of the long versions used in apex model williams et al 2012 according to penman 1948 a complete survey of evaporation from bare soil and of transpiration from crops should take account of all relevant factors the pn combines the theoretical aerodynamic and energy approaches to calculate evaporation from saturated surfaces 1 λ e δ r n g υ λ e a δ υ where λe is evaporative latent heat flux mj m 2 d 1 δ is slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve rn is net radiation flux mj m 2 d 1 g is sensible heat flux into the soil mj m 2 d 1 ϒ is psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and ea is vapor transport of flux mm d zotarelli et al 2015 the experimental studies by penman 1948 using eq 1 indicated satisfactory and reasonable results for open water evaporation and for bare soil respectively the pn equation has a sound physical basis and the formula requires observations of net radiation wind temperature and humidity grace and quick 1988 according to monteith 1965 the pn equation is not valid for a surface where the vapor pressure is less than the saturation vapor pressure at surface temperature monteith 1965 addressed this issue by making modifications to the pn method leading to the penman monteith pn m equation eq 2 according to steiner et al 1991 biologically based canopy and physically based aerodynamic resistance expressions were included into the wind function the penman monteith approach includes all factors that control energy exchange and related latent heat flux from uniform areas of vegetation allen et al 1998 as presented by aouissi et al 2016 eq 2 takes the following form 2 λ e δ h n e t g ρ a i r c p e z 0 e z r a δ γ 1 r c r a where λe is the latent heat flux density mj m 2 d 1 e is the depth rate evaporation mm d δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve de dt kpa c 1 hnet is the net

resistance s m 1 and r a is the diffusion resistance of the air layer aerodynamic resistance s m 1 the pn and pn m methods require detailed information that is often not available in most study areas around the world abbaspour 1991 gassman et al 2010 grace and quick 1988 steiner et al 1991 to address this empirical methods such as b r pr t and hrg that use readily available data to estimate et were developed one of the developed models in this categories is the baier robertson method baier and robertson 1965 it uses minimum maximum temperature and regression equations to estimate latent evapotranspiration as follows 3 eo 0 288 tmx 0 144 tmn 0 139 ramx 4 931 where eo is total potential evapotranspiration tmx and tmn are the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures in c and ramx is the clear day radiation at the surface in mj m 2 d 1 this method is mainly for use in cold climates such as canada williams et al 2012 similarly hrg and pr t methods are also relatively simple to estimate etp pr t and hrg methods are based on radiation and temperature and temperature alone respectively weib and menzel 2008 temperature data are easily found and radiation data can be estimated steiner et al 1991 in regions where crops are well watered net radiation is the primary etp estimation factor in the pr t method grace and quick 1988 using this method etp is estimated in apex model as follows williams et al 2012 4 eo 1 28 rn 1 0 ab hv dlt dlt gma where eo is total potential evapotranspiration rn is the net radiation in mj m 2 d 1 ab is the soil albedo hv is the latent heat of vaporization in mj kg 1 dlt is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve in kpa c 1 gma is a psychrometer constant in kpa c 1 in hrg method etp is estimated using only measured temperature hargreaves and samani 1985 however the original hrg method was revised as follows by williams et al 2012 to closely match penman monteith annual eo estimates 5 e o 0 0032 r a m x h v t x 17 8 t m x t

heat of vaporization in mj kg 1 tx is the mean daily air temperature in c for this study only the pn pn m pr t and hrg were used as the b r method is mainly used for cold climate regions 2 2 study area the study area is located near bushland texas 35 19 n 102 10 w 1170 m elevation above mean sea level it consists four research fields designated as nw sw ne and se fig 1 at the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory cprl the nw and sw fields were managed as dryland farming while ne and se fields receive supplemental irrigation each 4 7 ha field is equipped with a weighing lysimeter located at its center the study area has variable climatic pattern and is classified as a semi arid marek et al 1988 the average annual precipitation is approximately 460 mm and ground water added for sustainable crop production in the region marek et al 2016 the annual average mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity for the period 2000 2010 were 14 16 c 21 93 c 6 39 c 18 18 mj m 2 4 65 m s 1 and 56 82 respectively bushland usda ars data lysimeter data collected from the nw field were used for this study from 2000 2010 period cotton sorghum and soybean were grown in rotation during those years a limited number of early season irrigations were applied for seed germination however 2002 2005 and 2009 were left fallow 2 3 input and evaluation data 2 3 1 dem and soil data a 30 m dem digital elevation model was used in this project the slope of the field is below 0 15 dusek et al 1987 based on soil survey geographic database ssurgo usda nrcs the soil type in this study is pullman series that consists very deep well drained and slowly permeable soils the soil physical and chemical data pertaining to the research sites were downloaded by ntt website saleh et al 2011 however some soil physical properties of this series were adjusted to those measured at the usda ars conservation and production marek et al 2016 2 3 2 weather data input daily weather data required by the apex model include solar radiation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed daily weather data were obtained from a 1764 m2 weather station located adjacent to the lysimeter fields dusek et al 1987 the station measures wind speed at 2 and 10 m elevations wind direction solar radiation air and de point temperature relative humidity barometric pressure and water evaporation a detailed description of the weather station and weather data collection equipment can be found in dusek et al 1987 the weather data were compiled from 15 min average files collected over a well watered clipped grass reference surface marek et al 2016 the data were validated in accordance with quality assurance qa and quality control qc techniques provided by marek et al 2014 all weather parameter data were compared with data collected from texas high plains et network marek et al 2005 and correlation between the two datasets were used to fill missing data values the daily weather input file was formatted according to the apex manual and used as an input in ntt interface to build the apex model 2 3 3 measured et crop yield and leaf area index lai for this research study measured evapotranspiration crop yield and leaf area index lai were collected from bushland usda ars cprl daily evapotranspiration were calculated using the daily storage change from the nw lysimeter the lysimeter has a surface area of 9 m2 and the soil depth within the lysimeter is 2 3 m marek et al 1988 soil monoliths are undisturbed masses of soil which are required for soil crop and hydrologic studies schneider et al 1988 the approximate mass of the soil monolith including container mass is 45 mg the lysimeter weighing system and load cell have the ability to distinguish mass changes equivalent to a minimum of 0 05 mm of water marek et al 1988 steiner et al 1991 a detailed description of lysimeter design installation and operation were offered by marek et al 1988 and schneider et al 1988 according to evett et al 2012 et is calculated using the following soil water balance eq 6 6 et i p f r δs where i and p are irrigation and precipitation f is flux into taken as positive or out of the control volume r is the sum of runon and runoff taken as positive when runon is greater than runoff and δs is the change during the time period in soil water stored in the control volume according to evett et al 2012 the weighing lysimeter achieves a much better measurement for rain and irrigation occurrences so long as those events are not large enough to cause runon and runoff compared to tipping bucket rain gage measured crop yield was collected from the nw field soybean yield was not included in this study due to issues related to delayed planting and rain damage in 2010 the average cotton and sorghum yield from 2001 to 2010 were used for the model calibration and validation the average cotton and sorghum yield from 2001 to 2010 was 0 42 t ha 1 and 3 61 t ha 1 respectively for the apex model simulation some crop parameters were modified based on marek et al 2016 study in which the adjusted parameters were satisfactory for predicting et on dryland cropping system a preliminary simulation in this study also indicated over estimation of cotton and sorghum yield therefore fraction of growing season when leaf area declines dlai maximum potential leaf area index dmla and second point on optimal leaf area development curve dlap2 were modified to adjust crop yield and et the dlai dmla and dlap2 values used were 40 1 0 and 30 95 respectively for cotton and 0 6 1 6 and 30 95 respectively for sorghum the same adjusted parameters were used for all etp methods those parameters were related to leaf area index lai which are important to simulate crop growth 2 4 model setup the apex model version 0806 was used in this study inputs required by the model include soil type land use land management a dem of the study area and weather data apex model projects can be built using either arcapex ntt saleh et al 2011 2012 or winapex user interfaces in this study ntt was selected to build the apex project because this is a single field sub area which does not need hydrologic routing from one subarea to another the ntt interface was developed to facilitate assessment of impacts of management it is a web based interface and it has web based linkage to the apex model saleh et al 2011 the study project was built by selecting the nw lysimeter field using ntt map navigation tools based on known location coordinates once the area was delineated and both soil and weather data inputs were selected data on land use and management practices were populated using the ntt interface examples of management operations include crop type tillage method planting date fertilizer type and amount irrigation type and amount harvest date among others 2 5 sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis gsa yuan et al 2015 was conducted using variance based analysis to identify important model parameters for model calibration and to quantify the contribution of change in model parameters to the change in model outputs the apexsensun talebizadeh et al 2017 an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis software package designed for monte carlo based uncertainty analysis saltelli et al 2008 was used for this purpose this method involves selection of different points distributed throughout the ranges of each parameter considered in the sensitivity analysis the standardized regression coefficient src method was used to rank the parameters based on their impact on et simulation the parameters with src 0 05 were considered sensitive nelson et al 2017 initially 49 for hrg and 47 for all other etp methods apexcont and parm file parameters which impact et were used in this study apexcont file contains data parameters that are held constant for all model runs defined in the configuration file parm file contains global apex parameters consisting of mainly equation coefficients twenty thousand model runs were made over the full range of parameter values defined in the apex input manual steglich and williams 2013 to identify the most sensitive parameters the sensitivity of these parameters on et simulation was determined based on the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 performance measures sensitive parameters bases on either nse or pbias were selected and used during model calibration and validation 2 6 calibration and validation approach once sensitive parameters were determined model calibration and validation for et and crop yields was carried out although a number of calibration validation strategies exist daggupati et al 2015 in this study the dataset was divided into two equal parts one used for calibration 2001 2005 and the other used for validation 2006 2010 fifty thousand simulation runs were then made based on a combination of parameter values covering the full range of the selected sensitive parameters and run in a global manner while the rest of the non sensitive parameters were all set to their default values to narrow the range of the parameter values only those model runs with nse values 0 80 and pbias 10 thresholds moriasi et al 2015 in addition to simulated crop yield within 1 standard deviation sd of average measured value for the period of 2001 2010 for both the calibration and validation runs were evaluated the range of yield values considered satisfactory based on crop yield criterion was 0 34 0 50 t ha 1 and 1 96 5 26 t ha 1 for cotton and sorghum respectively these average crop yields were considered reasonable compared to measured average cotton 0 41 t ha 1 and sorghum 3 51 t ha 1 yields in texas from 2001 to 2010 ncc nass the ranges of values of sensitive parameters for model runs that met these preset criteria for each etp method were then determined 2 7 comparison of simulation performance of etp methods comparison of the ability of the etp methods to simulate et was made using quantitative and qualitative model performance criteria based on et and crop yield simulation results of the 50 000 runs described in the calibration and validation approach section statistical measures were used to quantify monthly et and annual crop yield model simulation performance relative to measured data the very good good satisfactory and unacceptable qualitative model simulation performance classifications at thresholds defined by moriasi et al 2015 2016 were also used the comparisons were made at two levels before and after calibration and validation before model calibration and validation comparisons were made based on general statistical measures of spread minimum mean median maximum standard deviation and exceedance probability for computed et nse and pbias values and simulated crop yields for all model runs the et simulation model performance measure nse pbias values and simulated average annual crop yields for each of the 50 000 runs used during calibration and validation periods were ranked in decreasing order and the exceedance probability p calculated as 7 p n n 1 where n is the rank of the simulated value and n is the total number of model runs the p for an outcome of given magnitude is defined as the probability that an outcome of equal or greater magnitude will occur in any single run the p values at selected nse performance rating threshold values for flow of 0 0 unacceptable moriasi et al 2016 0 50 satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 2015 0 70 good moriasi et al 2015 and 0 80 very good moriasi et al 2015 were computed for specific point comparison purpose similarly p values at selected pbias performance rating threshold values for flow of 30 unacceptable moriasi et al 2016 15 satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 2015 10 good moriasi et al 2015 and 5 very good moriasi et al 2015 were computed likewise the p values at arbitrarily selected simulated average annual cotton values of 0 34 t ha 1 20 of mean measured value of 0 42 t ha 1 0 38 t ha 1 10 of mean measured value 0 46 t ha 1 10 of mean measured value 0 50 t ha 1 20 of mean measured value were computed the p values at arbitrarily selected simulated average annual sorghum values of 2 89 t ha 1 20 of mean measured value of 3 61 t ha 1 3 25 t ha 1 10 of mean measured value 3 97 t ha 1 10 of mean measured value 4 33 t ha 1 20 of mean measured value were computed after the calibration and validation comparisons were made based on the model runs that met the preset performance criteria for each of the etp methods in this case comparison were made between simulated and measured monthly daily average et all values were graphed to provide a visual comparison between simulated and measured et according to moriasi et al 2007 model flow simulations are considered satisfactory for pbias 25 therefore the number of months in which simulated et was within 25 of measured values were determined for each etp method 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis results of sensitivity analysis are presented in table 2 there were differences in the number of sensitive parameters and parameter rank with respect to the statistical model performance measure pbias or nse used and the etp method for example the runoff curve number initial abstraction exponent coefficient rainfall and scs index coefficient parameters were sensitive only when pbias was used for the hrg method with the exception of the pn method there were more sensitive parameters determined using the pbias than identified by the nse performance measure according to moriasi et al 2016 nse indicates how well the model simulates temporal variability of the output response of interest during the simulation period while pbias indicates how well the model simulates the average magnitudes for the output response of interest during the same simulation period if the goal of the study is to evaluate at the average magnitude of et for the period of model simulation parameters determined to be sensitive based on pbias are selected if nse is used selected sensitive parameters are those that capture the temporal variability of et during the simulation period both the temporal variability and average long term variability of et were important in this study therefore parameters that determined to be sensitive to either of these performance measures were selected pn m had the highest number 13 of sensitive parameters while pr t and pn had the lowest number 11 of the 49 parameters initially selected and used for sensitivity analysis respectively table 2 there were 10 sensitive parameters common to all methods when either pbais or nse was used soil evaporation plant cover factor was ranked first in hrg pn and pr t methods whereas in pn m method root growth soil strength was ranked first soil evaporation plant cover factor is related to leaf area index lai and root growth soil strength is related to soil mechanical resistance to root growth which also affects the lai as soil strength increases root growth decreases which impact et dry matter and crop yield there were four sensitive parameters that were unique to a particular method the number of years of maximum monthly 0 5 h rainfall available was sensitive in pn m method the hrg method specific equation coefficient and exponent were determined to be very sensitive parameters table 2 3 2 calibration and validation although some daily and annual temporal scale model runs met the preset pbias and crop yield selection criteria none of them met the preset nse criteria results not presented at the daily temporal scale the nse values were 0 5 during both the calibration and validation period for all methods which was lower than the nse value of 0 8 criteria threshold used in this study this poor performance could be due to the fact there was a greater likelihood of encountering extreme differences between measured and simulated et values at the daily time step than would be observed for monthly daily average and annual daily average et values the annual temporal scale achieved good performance only during the calibration period however the nse values for the annual temporal scale during validation period were 0 0 and therefore considered unacceptable moriasi et al 2016 this could be explained by the limited number of annual data points 5 during the calibration period which could have resulted in parameter values not being representative of the different climatic conditions nelson et al 2017 moriasi et al 2015 moriasi et al 2016 for example the model parameters were optimized during calibration period which had an average annual rainfall of 522 mm but the average annual rainfall during validation period was 455 mm a difference of 67 mm per year the results showed that the model performed best at the monthly temporal scale both during calibration and validation for all etp methods therefore only results of monthly model performance are presented for the rest of this study the results of model runs that met all the selection criteria during both the calibration and validation period are presented in table 3 based on the pbias results all etp methods under predicted monthly daily average et more during the drier validation period 8 pbias 10 than during the calibration period 2 pbias 2 table 3 there were no significant differences in nse pbias and crop yield values among etp methods because all methods were subjected to the same preset criteria which eliminated most of the model runs however there were large differences in the number of model runs that met preset criteria for various etp methods during the calibration period the number of successful model runs ranged from 978 using the hrg method to 4045 using the pn m method when both calibration and validation periods were considered the pn m and pn methods had the highest and the lowest number of successful model runs for et estimation respectively table 3 however only 6 4 2 and 1 of the successful model runs during the calibration were successful during the validation period for pn m hrg pr t and pn methods respectively table 3 this indicates that very few successful model runs during calibration were robust enough to simulate et reasonably well under different climatic conditions among these methods pn m showed the greatest ability in acquiring a set of robust parameter values the model runs with highest nse values for each etp method during the calibration and validation periods were selected and used to illustrate the temporal variability of simulated monthly daily average et fig 2 it is observed that all methods simulated et reasonably well in 2002 2005 and 2009 when the fields were fallow however during the calibration period all etp methods underestimated et during the summer months when either cotton or sorghum was grown fig 2 during the validation period the etp methods largely over predicted or under predicted et in the summer months moreover the et patterns of cotton and sorghum were similar fig 2 in 2006 et was overestimated but underestimated in 2007 during the sorghum growing period inconsistent plant stands in 2006 may have contributed to the discrepancies between the measured and simulated et in 2006 marek et al 2016 in order to explain the large under prediction simulated lai were compared against study area measured data the simulated lai was within the minimum and maximum measured values except in 2001 and 2007 results indicated that the lais simulated by all etp methods were significantly lower than the measured values in the 2007 growing season which could account for the under prediction of et fig 2 a very important discrepancy to point is that all models largely underestimated et in 2008 between january and may this is likely due to the fact that no agronomic management practices were selected for apex since no field notes of actual agronomic practices for the study site were recorded during this time 3 3 ranges of values for most sensitive parameters the calibrated and documented ranges of values for the sensitive et parameters for model runs that met the selection criteria using nse pbias and crop yield are presented in table 4 in most cases all etp methods had similar ranges of values for the sensitive parameters however there were large differences in minimum values for the parameters maximum rainfall intercept exponent coefficient rainfall scs index coefficient rain intercept coefficient and root growth soil strength in general pn m resulted in a wider range of values for all parameters compared with other etp methods mainly because it had the highest number of model runs that met the selection criteria table 3 the range of values for successful model runs for each etp method was generally comparable to the apex default values presented in the manual steglich and williams 2013 however the presented ranges should not be adjusted independently but in combination with optimized values for the remaining parameters due to possible interaction among parameters moriasi et al 2016 3 4 comparison of etp methods using different criteria 3 4 1 descriptive statistics and probability exceedance of simulation performance for all model runs the descriptive statistics for monthly et simulation performance and simulated crop yields for all etp methods are presented in table 5 the higher the nse values and the lower the pbias and standard deviation sd values the better the model simulation performance although there were no large differences in the results among etp methods the pn m had 13 best and 7 second best ranks of the 20 descriptive statistics categories covering both nse and pbias table 5 the hrg method had the lowest percentage of the combined best and second best ranks with no best and 3 second best ranks of 20 descriptive statistics the pn m method had the highest median and mean nse values both during the calibration and validation period also the pn m method had the lowest median and mean pbias values both during the calibration and validation period similarly there were no major differences in crop yield values simulated by all etp methods table 5 however the minimum crop values simulated by all etp methods were much lower than the minimum measured values table 5 all etp methods overestimated maximum cotton yields however the maximum sorghum values simulated by all etp methods were close to and within the maximum measured value for both crops the mean values simulated by the pn m method were closest to the measured mean values with differences of 0 03 t ha 1 and 0 33 t ha 1 for cotton and sorghum respectively the p curves of computed nse and pbias model performance values during the calibration and validation period for all etp methods are presented in fig 3 in general the higher the nse and the lower the pbias exceedance probability p values the better the model et simulation performance with respect to nse all etp methods except hrg resulted in more or less the same p curve patterns during calibration fig 3 in general the pn m method had highest while hrg had the lowest p values during the calibration period fig 3 during the validation period the hrg and pn had similar patterns with lower p values while the pn m method had the highest p values fig 3 the upper end values were similar for all etp methods during both the calibration and validation periods with respect to pbias the lower and upper end values were similar for all etp methods during both the calibration and validation periods fig 3 during the calibration period the hrg method had noticeably larger p values compared with other etp methods with the pn m method having the lowest p values fig 3 during the validation period the pn m method had noticeably lower p values compared to the rest of the etp methods with the hrg method still resulting in the highest p values fig 3 a discussion of computed point specific p values at selected nse and pbias performance rating threshold values for comparison purposes follows in general there were no noticeable differences in p values among etp methods at unacceptable and very good performance nse selected threshold values of 0 00 and 0 80 during both the calibration and validation periods fig 3 however there were large differences in p values at the good performance nse threshold value of 0 70 with values ranging from 37 for hrg to 74 for pn m during calibration period and 26 for hrg and 50 for pn m during the validation period fig 3 in addition all etp methods generally had lower p values for all pbias performance thresholds during the calibration period than during the validation period fig 3 there were few differences in p values among etp methods at the good and very good performance pbias threshold values of 10 and 5 during the validation period overall the pn m method had the lowest p values in all pbias performance thresholds except at unacceptable pbias threshold values of 30 during the calibration period for example at the satisfactory performance pbias threshold value of 15 the p values varied from 0 37 for pn m to 0 76 for hrg and from 0 79 for pn m to 0 96 for hrg during the calibration and validation period respectively this implies that 24 of all hrg and 63 of all pn m model runs resulted in pbias values of less or equal to 15 during the calibration period similarly during validation period 4 for hrg and 21 for pn m of all models runs resulted in pbias values of less or equal to 15 during the validation period the p curves of average annual cotton and sorghum yield values simulated by all etp methods are presented in fig 4 overall there were greater differences in the patterns of p curves of average annual yields simulated by different etp methods for cotton than sorghum however the minimum and maximum crop yield values were similar for all etp methods except which hrg had the lowest simulated maximum cotton and sorghum yield values based on the p values for selected simulated average annual cotton and sorghum yields the hrg method had the least probability number of model runs to under predict both cotton 9 and sorghum 10 yields while the pn m method had the greatest probability to under predict cotton 25 and sorghum 20 yields fig 4 however the pn m method had the least probability to over predict both cotton 45 and sorghum 24 while the pn method had the greatest probability to over predict both cotton 78 and sorghum 63 yields if we consider only the number of model runs with simulated cotton yields within 20 of the measured mean value the pn m had the highest 29 of all runs while pn had the lowest 8 when only sorghum yield is considered the hrg had the highest 58 and pn had the lowest 22 of all model runs within 20 of the measured mean value based on these results significantly more model runs simulated sorghum better than cotton if we consider the number of model runs with simulated cotton yield within 10 of the measured mean value pn m had the highest 15 while pn had the lowest 3 when considering simulated sorghum yield within 10 of the measured mean then the pn m had the highest 26 and pn had the lowest 5 number of all model runs 3 4 2 comparison of simulation performance for model runs that met preset criteria the results of the monthly daily average et simulated between 2001 and 2010 by all etp methods for model runs that met the selection criteria are presented in fig 5 also included in these graphs is the median measured monthly daily average et 1 13 mm for the study period and the errors computed as a function of the differences between simulated and measured monthly daily average et values the number of months in which simulated et was within 25 moriasi et al 2007 of the measured value was determined for each etp method and used as a criterion to compare et simulation performance among methods based on the results presented in these figures there were no major noticeable differences in simulated et values the number of months in which these criteria was met varied from 99 using pn m to 79 using pn hrg and pr t methods simulated monthly daily average et within 25 of measured values for 95 and 90 months respectively of the months that met this criterion 62 63 60 and 58 months for pn m hrg pr t and pn respectively had simulated values greater than the median measured et the lack of major differences can be explained by the fact that only results of model runs that met the selection criteria were used 4 conclusions based on the sensitivity analyses the statistical model performance measure pbias or nse and or the etp method used affected the number of sensitive parameters and parameter importance ranking within apex with the exception of the pn method there were more sensitive parameters determined using the pbias than nse performance measure therefore users have to be careful to determine which statistical measure to use depending on the goals of the study parameters that were determined to be sensitive to either of these performance measures were selected to assess the impact on model performance the number of sensitive parameters remained relatively stable varying from 13 using the pn m method to 11 using the pr t method however there was large variability in parameter sensitivity ranks there were large differences in the number of model runs that met preset criteria at monthly temporal scale for various etp methods with pn m having the greatest probability of finding a set of parameter values robust enough to simulate et reasonably well under different climatic conditions with the exception of maximum rainfall intercept exponent coefficient rainfall scs index coefficient rain intercept coefficient and root growth soil strength parameters all etp methods had similar ranges of values for the sensitive parameters the ranges presented in this study should not be adjusted independently but in combination with optimized values for the rest of the parameters due to possible interaction among parameters overall results of model simulation performance of etp methods using multiple criteria showed that pn m simulated et better than the other etp methods however the results indicate that if the model is well calibrated then the other etp methods can result in satisfactory simulation of et especially in

11425,evapotranspiration et is a major component of the hydrologic budget and therefore it requires accurate estimation the agricultural policy environmental extender apex a hydrologic and water quality model developed for evaluating the effect of agricultural production management practices on the environment it has five different methods to simulate et the objectives of this study were to determine the impact of using different et methods in apex on sensitive et parameters in semi arid environments determine reasonable range of values for sensitive parameters and compare performance of these methods using multiple criteria et and crop yield data measured in the lysimeter fields located in the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory bushland texas were used to calibrate and validate the model results indicated that selection of statistical model performance measure and et method affects the number of sensitive parameters and parameter rank the number of sensitive parameters remained relatively stable among et simulation methods but there was large variability in parameter sensitivity ranks it is also important that users carefully choose appropriate statistical measure to use depending on the goals of their study with the exception of maximum rainfall intercept exponent coefficient rainfall scs index coefficient rain intercept coefficient and root growth soil strength all methods had similar ranges of values for the sensitive parameters in general there were no large differences in the performance of et methods however penman monteith method simulated et relatively better than the other methods which may be explained by the fact that it is a physically based method with many weather variables whose data was available for the study

keywords calibration multi comparison criteria et methods sensitivity analysis validation 1 introduction potential impacts of climate variability climate change drought land use change and other environmental factors on agricultural production water quality and water availability can be assessed using hydrologic and water quality models arnold et al 1998 these models range in spatial scale from point to watershed and at temporal scales varying from hourly to annually moriasi et al 2012 results of these models can aid policy makers in selection of cost effective conservation programs to mitigate environmental degradation and non point source nps pollution arabi et al 2012 arnold et al 2012 saleh et al 2012 before using any of these models it is important to understand the processes that influence water budget arnold et al 2015 aouissi et al 2016 water balance studies help to understand the process of water supply and demand and are crucial to agricultural production management and mitigating environmental degradation water balance is impacted by precipitation solar radiation wind speed relative humidity and air temperature plant growth and the movement of sediments nutrients pesticides and pathogens are affected by water balance arnold et al 2012 in agriculture actual evapotranspiration et is a major consumptive use of irrigation water and precipitation gowda et al 2008 and et information is necessary for many app1icationsns in agricultural and natural resource management steiner et al 1991 for reliable water balance estimates and efficient management of managing irrigation projects consideration of potential evapotranspiration etp is an important factor aouissi et al 2016 the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 agricultural policy environmental extender apex williams et al 2008 williams and izaurralde 2005 and other hydrological models can be used to estimate water balance key components in many of these models relate to et bhattarai et al 2016 sentelhas et al 2010 which in most cases accounts for the largest component of the water balance marek et al 2016 therefore accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is an essential condition to quantify water balances wagle et al 2016 evaporation and transpiration occur simultaneously in a given landscape and it is difficult to measure both processes separately fisher et al 2005 pandeya and mulligan 2013 thus hydrological models first compute etp and then estimate et by considering available soil water content and land use within the study area aouissi et al 2016 crop et is influenced by crop canopy characteristics plant factors soil condition weather management practices among other factors the main meteorological parameters affecting et are solar radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit and wind speed allen et al 1998 the most critical element for sustaining crop production in rain fed agriculture is the availability of water tadesse et al 2015 to satisfy et demand crop growth and better agricultural yields a substantial volume of freshwater is required pandeya and mulligan 2013 however availability of fresh water in semi arid lands is limited to satisfy this evaporative demand and in most cases supplemental irrigation is required to grow crops therefore et and water balance studies are critical in the semiarid texas plains hydrological models such as swat and apex can be used to simulate et in general the swat and apex models use similar etp methods many of the etp methods in swat have been tested in many studies aouissi et al 2016 immerzeel and droogers 2008 nguyen and kappas 2015 wang et al 2006 marek et al 2016 also demonstrated the usefulness of applying swat model to simulate et in the semiarid texas high plains however literature review of apex model found no studies on the performance of various etp methods incorporated within the model therefore this study focuses on the evaluation of etp methods to estimate et apex is a direct extension of environmental policy integrated climate model epic williams 1990 and is a physically based model that may help achieve sustainable agricultural production and better environmental quality similarly it can be used to assess a wide range of alternative manure management scenarios golmohammadi et al 2014 steglich and williams 2013 and to simulate alternative crop systems and their environmental impacts wang et al 2006 according to steglich and williams 2013 apex can simulate long term scenarios stretching up to 4000 years and can assess the impact of different management practices on sediment flow nutrients soil water content and et apex calculates et using different etp methods however there is no published literature comparing the effect of these etp methods on sensitivity of apex model parameters and et simulation performance moreover hydrological models often contain large uncertainties and these can have negative effects on model accuracy song et al 2015 and requires sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is an important first step in model assessment and is the process to quantitatively determine how sensitive model output is to each of the input parameters arnold et al 2012 guzman et al 2015 moriasi et al 2007 zeckoski et al 2015 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 determine the impact of etp methods in apex model on sensitive et parameters 2 determine the reasonable range of values for sensitive parameters based on model calibration and validation results and 3 compare differences and similarities in model simulation performance of etp methods using multiple criteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 evapotranspiration methods according to abbaspour 1991 there are three main categories of et estimation methods models based on the physics of et empirical models based on temperature and empirical correlations that use radiation as well as temperature apex model has five etp methods with at least one method in each of the categories listed table 1 for simplicity the initial short pn and pn m equations are presented in this study instead of the long versions used in apex model williams et al 2012 according to penman 1948 a complete survey of evaporation from bare soil and of transpiration from crops should take account of all relevant factors the pn combines the theoretical aerodynamic and energy approaches to calculate evaporation from saturated surfaces 1 λ e δ r n g υ λ e a δ υ where λe is evaporative latent heat flux mj m 2 d 1 δ is slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve rn is net radiation flux mj m 2 d 1 g is sensible heat flux into the soil mj m 2 d 1 ϒ is psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and ea is vapor transport of flux mm d zotarelli et al 2015 the experimental studies by penman 1948 using eq 1 indicated satisfactory and reasonable results for open water evaporation and for bare soil respectively the pn equation has a sound physical basis and the formula requires observations of net radiation wind temperature and humidity grace and quick 1988 according to monteith 1965 the pn equation is not valid for a surface where the vapor pressure is less than the saturation vapor pressure at surface temperature monteith 1965 addressed this issue by making modifications to the pn method leading to the penman monteith pn m equation eq 2 according to steiner et al 1991 biologically based canopy and physically based aerodynamic resistance expressions were included into the wind function the penman monteith approach includes all factors that control energy exchange and related latent heat flux from uniform areas of vegetation allen et al 1998 as presented by aouissi et al 2016 eq 2 takes the following form 2 λ e δ h n e t g ρ a i r c p e z 0 e z r a δ γ

resistance s m 1 and r a is the diffusion resistance of the air layer aerodynamic resistance s m 1 the pn and pn m methods require detailed information that is often not available in most study areas around the world abbaspour 1991 gassman et al 2010 grace and quick 1988 steiner et al 1991 to address this empirical methods such as b r pr t and hrg that use readily available data to estimate et were developed one of the developed models in this categories is the baier robertson method baier and robertson 1965 it uses minimum maximum temperature and regression equations to estimate latent evapotranspiration as follows 3 eo 0 288 tmx 0 144 tmn 0 139 ramx 4 931 where eo is total potential evapotranspiration tmx and tmn are the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures in c and ramx is the clear day radiation at the surface in mj m 2 d 1 this method is mainly for use in cold climates such as canada williams et al 2012 similarly hrg and pr t methods are also relatively simple to estimate etp pr t and hrg methods are based on radiation and temperature and temperature alone respectively weib and menzel 2008 temperature data are easily found and radiation data can be estimated steiner et al 1991 in regions where crops are well watered net radiation is the primary etp estimation factor in the pr t method grace and quick 1988 using this method etp is estimated in apex model as follows williams et al 2012 4 eo 1 28 rn 1 0 ab hv dlt dlt gma where eo is total potential evapotranspiration rn is the net radiation in mj m 2 d 1 ab is the soil albedo hv is the latent heat of vaporization in mj kg 1 dlt is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve in kpa c 1 gma is a psychrometer constant in kpa c 1 in hrg method etp is estimated using only measured temperature hargreaves and samani 1985 however the original hrg method was revised as follows by williams et al 2012 to closely match penman monteith annual eo estimates 5 e o 0 0032 r a m x h v t x 17 8 t m x t

heat of vaporization in mj kg 1 tx is the mean daily air temperature in c for this study only the pn pn m pr t and hrg were used as the b r method is mainly used for cold climate regions 2 2 study area the study area is located near bushland texas 35 19 n 102 10 w 1170 m elevation above mean sea level it consists four research fields designated as nw sw ne and se fig 1 at the usda ars conservation and production research laboratory cprl the nw and sw fields were managed as dryland farming while ne and se fields receive supplemental irrigation each 4 7 ha field is equipped with a weighing lysimeter located at its center the study area has variable climatic pattern and is classified as a semi arid marek et al 1988 the average annual precipitation is approximately 460 mm and ground water added for sustainable crop production in the region marek et al 2016 the annual average mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity for the period 2000 2010 were 14 16 c 21 93 c 6 39 c 18 18 mj m 2 4 65 m s 1 and 56 82 respectively bushland usda ars data lysimeter data collected from the nw field were used for this study from 2000 2010 period cotton sorghum and soybean were grown in rotation during those years a limited number of early season irrigations were applied for seed germination however 2002 2005 and 2009 were left fallow 2 3 input and evaluation data 2 3 1 dem and soil data a 30 m dem digital elevation model was used in this project the slope of the field is below 0 15 dusek et al 1987 based on soil survey geographic database ssurgo usda nrcs the soil type in this study is pullman series that consists very deep well drained and slowly permeable soils the soil physical and chemical data pertaining to the research sites were downloaded by ntt website saleh et al 2011 however some soil physical properties of this series were adjusted to those measured at the usda ars conservation and production marek et al 2016 2 3 2 weather data input daily weather data required by the apex model include solar radiation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature precipitation relative humidity and wind speed daily weather data were obtained from a 1764 m2 weather station located adjacent to the lysimeter fields dusek et al 1987 the station measures wind speed at 2 and 10 m elevations wind direction solar radiation air and de point temperature relative humidity barometric pressure and water evaporation a detailed description of the weather station and weather data collection equipment can be found in dusek et al 1987 the weather data were compiled from 15 min average files collected over a well watered clipped grass reference surface marek et al 2016 the data were validated in accordance with quality assurance qa and quality control qc techniques provided by marek et al 2014 all weather parameter data were compared with data collected from texas high plains et network marek et al 2005 and correlation between the two datasets were used to fill missing data values the daily weather input file was formatted according to the apex manual and used as an input in ntt interface to build the apex model 2 3 3 measured et crop yield and leaf area index lai for this research study measured evapotranspiration crop yield and leaf area index lai were collected from bushland usda ars cprl daily evapotranspiration were calculated using the daily storage change from the nw lysimeter the lysimeter has a surface area of 9 m2 and the soil depth within the lysimeter is 2 3 m marek et al 1988 soil monoliths are undisturbed masses of soil which are required for soil crop and hydrologic studies schneider et al 1988 the approximate mass of the soil monolith including container mass is 45 mg the lysimeter weighing system and load cell have the ability to distinguish mass changes equivalent to a minimum of 0 05 mm of water marek et al 1988 steiner et al 1991 a detailed description of lysimeter design installation and operation were offered by marek et al 1988 and schneider et al 1988 according to evett et al 2012 et is calculated using the following soil water balance eq 6 6 et i p f r δs where i and p are irrigation and precipitation f is flux into taken as positive or out of the control volume r is the sum of runon and runoff taken as positive when runon is greater than runoff and δs is the change during the time period in soil water stored in the control volume according to evett et al 2012 the weighing lysimeter achieves a much better measurement for rain and irrigation occurrences so long as those events are not large enough to cause runon and runoff compared to tipping bucket rain gage measured crop yield was collected from the nw field soybean yield was not included in this study due to issues related to delayed planting and rain damage in 2010 the average cotton and sorghum yield from 2001 to 2010 were used for the model calibration and validation the average cotton and sorghum yield from 2001 to 2010 was 0 42 t ha 1 and 3 61 t ha 1 respectively for the apex model simulation some crop parameters were modified based on marek et al 2016 study in which the adjusted parameters were satisfactory for predicting et on dryland cropping system a preliminary simulation in this study also indicated over estimation of cotton and sorghum yield therefore fraction of growing season when leaf area declines dlai maximum potential leaf area index dmla and second point on optimal leaf area development curve dlap2 were modified to adjust crop yield and et the dlai dmla and dlap2 values used were 40 1 0 and 30 95 respectively for cotton and 0 6 1 6 and 30 95 respectively for sorghum the same adjusted parameters were used for all etp methods those parameters were related to leaf area index lai which are important to simulate crop growth 2 4 model setup the apex model version 0806 was used in this study inputs required by the model include soil type land use land management a dem of the study area and weather data apex model projects can be built using either arcapex ntt saleh et al 2011 2012 or winapex user interfaces in this study ntt was selected to build the apex project because this is a single field sub area which does not need hydrologic routing from one subarea to another the ntt interface was developed to facilitate assessment of impacts of management it is a web based interface and it has web based linkage to the apex model saleh et al 2011 the study project was built by selecting the nw lysimeter field using ntt map navigation tools based on known location coordinates once the area was delineated and both soil and weather data inputs were selected data on land use and management practices were populated using the ntt interface examples of management operations include crop type tillage method planting date fertilizer type and amount irrigation type and amount harvest date among others 2 5 sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis gsa yuan et al 2015 was conducted using variance based analysis to identify important model parameters for model calibration and to quantify the contribution of change in model parameters to the change in model outputs the apexsensun talebizadeh et al 2017 an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis software package designed for monte carlo based uncertainty analysis saltelli et al 2008 was used for this purpose this method involves selection of different points distributed throughout the ranges of each parameter considered in the sensitivity analysis the standardized regression coefficient src method was used to rank the parameters based on their impact on et simulation the parameters with src 0 05 were considered sensitive nelson et al 2017 initially 49 for hrg and 47 for all other etp methods apexcont and parm file parameters which impact et were used in this study apexcont file contains data parameters that are held constant for all model runs defined in the configuration file parm file contains global apex parameters consisting of mainly equation coefficients twenty thousand model runs were made over the full range of parameter values defined in the apex input manual steglich and williams 2013 to identify the most sensitive parameters the sensitivity of these parameters on et simulation was determined based on the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 performance measures sensitive parameters bases on either nse or pbias were selected and used during model calibration and validation 2 6 calibration and validation approach once sensitive parameters were determined model calibration and validation for et and crop yields was carried out although a number of calibration validation strategies exist daggupati et al 2015 in this study the dataset was divided into two equal parts one used for calibration 2001 2005 and the other used for validation 2006 2010 fifty thousand simulation runs were then made based on a combination of parameter values covering the full range of the selected sensitive parameters and run in a global manner while the rest of the non sensitive parameters were all set to their default values to narrow the range of the parameter values only those model runs with nse values 0 80 and pbias 10 thresholds moriasi et al 2015 in addition to simulated crop yield within 1 standard deviation sd of average measured value for the period of 2001 2010 for both the calibration and validation runs were evaluated the range of yield values considered satisfactory based on crop yield criterion was 0 34 0 50 t ha 1 and 1 96 5 26 t ha 1 for cotton and sorghum respectively these average crop yields were considered reasonable compared to measured average cotton 0 41 t ha 1 and sorghum 3 51 t ha 1 yields in texas from 2001 to 2010 ncc nass the ranges of values of sensitive parameters for model runs that met these preset criteria for each etp method were then determined 2 7 comparison of simulation performance of etp methods comparison of the ability of the etp methods to simulate et was made using quantitative and qualitative model performance criteria based on et and crop yield simulation results of the 50 000 runs described in the calibration and validation approach section statistical measures were used to quantify monthly et and annual crop yield model simulation performance relative to measured data the very good good satisfactory and unacceptable qualitative model simulation performance classifications at thresholds defined by moriasi et al 2015 2016 were also used the comparisons were made at two levels before and after calibration and validation before model calibration and validation comparisons were made based on general statistical measures of spread minimum mean median maximum standard deviation and exceedance probability for computed et nse and pbias values and simulated crop yields for all model runs the et simulation model performance measure nse pbias values and simulated average annual crop yields for each of the 50 000 runs used during calibration and validation periods were ranked in decreasing order and the exceedance probability p calculated as 7 p n n 1 where n is the rank of the simulated value and n is the total number of model runs the p for an outcome of given magnitude is defined as the probability that an outcome of equal or greater magnitude will occur in any single run the p values at selected nse performance rating threshold values for flow of 0 0 unacceptable moriasi et al 2016 0 50 satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 2015 0 70 good moriasi et al 2015 and 0 80 very good moriasi et al 2015 were computed for specific point comparison purpose similarly p values at selected pbias performance rating threshold values for flow of 30 unacceptable moriasi et al 2016 15 satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 2015 10 good moriasi et al 2015 and 5 very good moriasi et al 2015 were computed likewise the p values at arbitrarily selected simulated average annual cotton values of 0 34 t ha 1 20 of mean measured value of 0 42 t ha 1 0 38 t ha 1 10 of mean measured value 0 46 t ha 1 10 of mean measured value 0 50 t ha 1 20 of mean measured value were computed the p values at arbitrarily selected simulated average annual sorghum values of 2 89 t ha 1 20 of mean measured value of 3 61 t ha 1 3 25 t ha 1 10 of mean measured value 3 97 t ha 1 10 of mean measured value 4 33 t ha 1 20 of mean measured value were computed after the calibration and validation comparisons were made based on the model runs that met the preset performance criteria for each of the etp methods in this case comparison were made between simulated and measured monthly daily average et all values were graphed to provide a visual comparison between simulated and measured et according to moriasi et al 2007 model flow simulations are considered satisfactory for pbias 25 therefore the number of months in which simulated et was within 25 of measured values were determined for each etp method 3 results and discussion 3 1 sensitivity analysis results of sensitivity analysis are presented in table 2 there were differences in the number of sensitive parameters and parameter rank with respect to the statistical model performance measure pbias or nse used and the etp method for example the runoff curve number initial abstraction exponent coefficient rainfall and scs index coefficient parameters were sensitive only when pbias was used for the hrg method with the exception of the pn method there were more sensitive parameters determined using the pbias than identified by the nse performance measure according to moriasi et al 2016 nse indicates how well the model simulates temporal variability of the output response of interest during the simulation period while pbias indicates how well the model simulates the average magnitudes for the output response of interest during the same simulation period if the goal of the study is to evaluate at the average magnitude of et for the period of model simulation parameters determined to be sensitive based on pbias are selected if nse is used selected sensitive parameters are those that capture the temporal variability of et during the simulation period both the temporal variability and average long term variability of et were important in this study therefore parameters that determined to be sensitive to either of these performance measures were selected pn m had the highest number 13 of sensitive parameters while pr t and pn had the lowest number 11 of the 49 parameters initially selected and used for sensitivity analysis respectively table 2 there were 10 sensitive parameters common to all methods when either pbais or nse was used soil evaporation plant cover factor was ranked first in hrg pn and pr t methods whereas in pn m method root growth soil strength was ranked first soil evaporation plant cover factor is related to leaf area index lai and root growth soil strength is related to soil mechanical resistance to root growth which also affects the lai as soil strength increases root growth decreases which impact et dry matter and crop yield there were four sensitive parameters that were unique to a particular method the number of years of maximum monthly 0 5 h rainfall available was sensitive in pn m method the hrg method specific equation coefficient and exponent were determined to be very sensitive parameters table 2 3 2 calibration and validation although some daily and annual temporal scale model runs met the preset pbias and crop yield selection criteria none of them met the preset nse criteria results not presented at the daily temporal scale the nse values were 0 5 during both the calibration and validation period for all methods which was lower than the nse value of 0 8 criteria threshold used in this study this poor performance could be due to the fact there was a greater likelihood of encountering extreme differences between measured and simulated et values at the daily time step than would be observed for monthly daily average and annual daily average et values the annual temporal scale achieved good performance only during the calibration period however the nse values for the annual temporal scale during validation period were 0 0 and therefore considered unacceptable moriasi et al 2016 this could be explained by the limited number of annual data points 5 during the calibration period which could have resulted in parameter values not being representative of the different climatic conditions nelson et al 2017 moriasi et al 2015 moriasi et al 2016 for example the model parameters were optimized during calibration period which had an average annual rainfall of 522 mm but the average annual rainfall during validation period was 455 mm a difference of 67 mm per year the results showed that the model performed best at the monthly temporal scale both during calibration and validation for all etp methods therefore only results of monthly model performance are presented for the rest of this study the results of model runs that met all the selection criteria during both the calibration and validation period are presented in table 3 based on the pbias results all etp methods under predicted monthly daily average et more during the drier validation period 8 pbias 10 than during the calibration period 2 pbias 2 table 3 there were no significant differences in nse pbias and crop yield values among etp methods because all methods were subjected to the same preset criteria which eliminated most of the model runs however there were large differences in the number of model runs that met preset criteria for various etp methods during the calibration period the number of successful model runs ranged from 978 using the hrg method to 4045 using the pn m method when both calibration and validation periods were considered the pn m and pn methods had the highest and the lowest number of successful model runs for et estimation respectively table 3 however only 6 4 2 and 1 of the successful model runs during the calibration were successful during the validation period for pn m hrg pr t and pn methods respectively table 3 this indicates that very few successful model runs during calibration were robust enough to simulate et reasonably well under different climatic conditions among these methods pn m showed the greatest ability in acquiring a set of robust parameter values the model runs with highest nse values for each etp method during the calibration and validation periods were selected and used to illustrate the temporal variability of simulated monthly daily average et fig 2 it is observed that all methods simulated et reasonably well in 2002 2005 and 2009 when the fields were fallow however during the calibration period all etp methods underestimated et during the summer months when either cotton or sorghum was grown fig 2 during the validation period the etp methods largely over predicted or under predicted et in the summer months moreover the et patterns of cotton and sorghum were similar fig 2 in 2006 et was overestimated but underestimated in 2007 during the sorghum growing period inconsistent plant stands in 2006 may have contributed to the discrepancies between the measured and simulated et in 2006 marek et al 2016 in order to explain the large under prediction simulated lai were compared against study area measured data the simulated lai was within the minimum and maximum measured values except in 2001 and 2007 results indicated that the lais simulated by all etp methods were significantly lower than the measured values in the 2007 growing season which could account for the under prediction of et fig 2 a very important discrepancy to point is that all models largely underestimated et in 2008 between january and may this is likely due to the fact that no agronomic management practices were selected for apex since no field notes of actual agronomic practices for the study site were recorded during this time 3 3 ranges of values for most sensitive parameters the calibrated and documented ranges of values for the sensitive et parameters for model runs that met the selection criteria using nse pbias and crop yield are presented in table 4 in most cases all etp methods had similar ranges of values for the sensitive parameters however there were large differences in minimum values for the parameters maximum rainfall intercept exponent coefficient rainfall scs index coefficient rain intercept coefficient and root growth soil strength in general pn m resulted in a wider range of values for all parameters compared with other etp methods mainly because it had the highest number of model runs that met the selection criteria table 3 the range of values for successful model runs for each etp method was generally comparable to the apex default values presented in the manual steglich and williams 2013 however the presented ranges should not be adjusted independently but in combination with optimized values for the remaining parameters due to possible interaction among parameters moriasi et al 2016 3 4 comparison of etp methods using different criteria 3 4 1 descriptive statistics and probability exceedance of simulation performance for all model runs the descriptive statistics for monthly et simulation performance and simulated crop yields for all etp methods are presented in table 5 the higher the nse values and the lower the pbias and standard deviation sd values the better the model simulation performance although there were no large differences in the results among etp methods the pn m had 13 best and 7 second best ranks of the 20 descriptive statistics categories covering both nse and pbias table 5 the hrg method had the lowest percentage of the combined best and second best ranks with no best and 3 second best ranks of 20 descriptive statistics the pn m method had the highest median and mean nse values both during the calibration and validation period also the pn m method had the lowest median and mean pbias values both during the calibration and validation period similarly there were no major differences in crop yield values simulated by all etp methods table 5 however the minimum crop values simulated by all etp methods were much lower than the minimum measured values table 5 all etp methods overestimated maximum cotton yields however the maximum sorghum values simulated by all etp methods were close to and within the maximum measured value for both crops the mean values simulated by the pn m method were closest to the measured mean values with differences of 0 03 t ha 1 and 0 33 t ha 1 for cotton and sorghum respectively the p curves of computed nse and pbias model performance values during the calibration and validation period for all etp methods are presented in fig 3 in general the higher the nse and the lower the pbias exceedance probability p values the better the model et simulation performance with respect to nse all etp methods except hrg resulted in more or less the same p curve patterns during calibration fig 3 in general the pn m method had highest while hrg had the lowest p values during the calibration period fig 3 during the validation period the hrg and pn had similar patterns with lower p values while the pn m method had the highest p values fig 3 the upper end values were similar for all etp methods during both the calibration and validation periods with respect to pbias the lower and upper end values were similar for all etp methods during both the calibration and validation periods fig 3 during the calibration period the hrg method had noticeably larger p values compared with other etp methods with the pn m method having the lowest p values fig 3 during the validation period the pn m method had noticeably lower p values compared to the rest of the etp methods with the hrg method still resulting in the highest p values fig 3 a discussion of computed point specific p values at selected nse and pbias performance rating threshold values for comparison purposes follows in general there were no noticeable differences in p values among etp methods at unacceptable and very good performance nse selected threshold values of 0 00 and 0 80 during both the calibration and validation periods fig 3 however there were large differences in p values at the good performance nse threshold value of 0 70 with values ranging from 37 for hrg to 74 for pn m during calibration period and 26 for hrg and 50 for pn m during the validation period fig 3 in addition all etp methods generally had lower p values for all pbias performance thresholds during the calibration period than during the validation period fig 3 there were few differences in p values among etp methods at the good and very good performance pbias threshold values of 10 and 5 during the validation period overall the pn m method had the lowest p values in all pbias performance thresholds except at unacceptable pbias threshold values of 30 during the calibration period for example at the satisfactory performance pbias threshold value of 15 the p values varied from 0 37 for pn m to 0 76 for hrg and from 0 79 for pn m to 0 96 for hrg during the calibration and validation period respectively this implies that 24 of all hrg and 63 of all pn m model runs resulted in pbias values of less or equal to 15 during the calibration period similarly during validation period 4 for hrg and 21 for pn m of all models runs resulted in pbias values of less or equal to 15 during the validation period the p curves of average annual cotton and sorghum yield values simulated by all etp methods are presented in fig 4 overall there were greater differences in the patterns of p curves of average annual yields simulated by different etp methods for cotton than sorghum however the minimum and maximum crop yield values were similar for all etp methods except which hrg had the lowest simulated maximum cotton and sorghum yield values based on the p values for selected simulated average annual cotton and sorghum yields the hrg method had the least probability number of model runs to under predict both cotton 9 and sorghum 10 yields while the pn m method had the greatest probability to under predict cotton 25 and sorghum 20 yields fig 4 however the pn m method had the least probability to over predict both cotton 45 and sorghum 24 while the pn method had the greatest probability to over predict both cotton 78 and sorghum 63 yields if we consider only the number of model runs with simulated cotton yields within 20 of the measured mean value the pn m had the highest 29 of all runs while pn had the lowest 8 when only sorghum yield is considered the hrg had the highest 58 and pn had the lowest 22 of all model runs within 20 of the measured mean value based on these results significantly more model runs simulated sorghum better than cotton if we consider the number of model runs with simulated cotton yield within 10 of the measured mean value pn m had the highest 15 while pn had the lowest 3 when considering simulated sorghum yield within 10 of the measured mean then the pn m had the highest 26 and pn had the lowest 5 number of all model runs 3 4 2 comparison of simulation performance for model runs that met preset criteria the results of the monthly daily average et simulated between 2001 and 2010 by all etp methods for model runs that met the selection criteria are presented in fig 5 also included in these graphs is the median measured monthly daily average et 1 13 mm for the study period and the errors computed as a function of the differences between simulated and measured monthly daily average et values the number of months in which simulated et was within 25 moriasi et al 2007 of the measured value was determined for each etp method and used as a criterion to compare et simulation performance among methods based on the results presented in these figures there were no major noticeable differences in simulated et values the number of months in which these criteria was met varied from 99 using pn m to 79 using pn hrg and pr t methods simulated monthly daily average et within 25 of measured values for 95 and 90 months respectively of the months that met this criterion 62 63 60 and 58 months for pn m hrg pr t and pn respectively had simulated values greater than the median measured et the lack of major differences can be explained by the fact that only results of model runs that met the selection criteria were used 4 conclusions based on the sensitivity analyses the statistical model performance measure pbias or nse and or the etp method used affected the number of sensitive parameters and parameter importance ranking within apex with the exception of the pn method there were more sensitive parameters determined using the pbias than nse performance measure therefore users have to be careful to determine which statistical measure to use depending on the goals of the study parameters that were determined to be sensitive to either of these performance measures were selected to assess the impact on model performance the number of sensitive parameters remained relatively stable varying from 13 using the pn m method to 11 using the pr t method however there was large variability in parameter sensitivity ranks there were large differences in the number of model runs that met preset criteria at monthly temporal scale for various etp methods with pn m having the greatest probability of finding a set of parameter values robust enough to simulate et reasonably well under different climatic conditions with the exception of maximum rainfall intercept exponent coefficient rainfall scs index coefficient rain intercept coefficient and root growth soil strength parameters all etp methods had similar ranges of values for the sensitive parameters the ranges presented in this study should not be adjusted independently but in combination with optimized values for the rest of the parameters due to possible interaction among parameters overall results of model simulation performance of etp methods using multiple criteria showed that pn m simulated et better than the other etp methods however the results indicate that if the model is well calibrated then the other etp methods can result in satisfactory simulation of et especially in

11426,irrigation water demand is highly variable and depends on farmer behaviour which affects the performance of irrigation networks the irrigation depth applied to each farm also depends on farmer behaviour and is affected by precise and imprecise variables in this work a hybrid methodology combining artificial neural networks fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms was developed to model farmer behaviour and forecast the daily irrigation depth used by each farmer the models were tested in a real irrigation district located in southwest spain three optimal models for the main crops in the irrigation district were obtained the representability r2 and accuracy of the predictions standard error prediction sep were 0 72 0 87 and 0 72 and 22 20 9 80 and 23 42 for rice maize and tomato crop models respectively keywords irrigation scheduling precision agriculture anfis genetic algorithm optimal input variables 1 introduction climate change and the growing demand for water in some economic sectors such as industry and agriculture are reducing the availability of freshwater irrigated agriculture is the main water user accounting for nearly 70 of total water consumption in the world conforti 2011 the sustainability of irrigated agriculture is strongly linked to the improvement of water use efficiency water demand forecasting could be one of the main tools to accurately design new irrigation systems and improve the management of older pressurized irrigation networks irrigation water demand is highly variable and depends on the behaviour of each farmer which is affected by both measurable variables e g agroclimatic variables or the size of the irrigated area and non measurable variables e g local traditional practices or holidays during the irrigation season fuzzy logic fl is an artificial intelligence ai technique initially developed by zadeh 1965 to explain human intelligence and decision making behaviour fl can be applied as a fuzzy inference system fis designed to transform linguistic concepts into mathematical and computational structures for daily water demand forecasting fis is a rule based system that consists of a rule base a database with membership functions mfs which determine the membership grades of each input variable to each fuzzy set and where the combination of fuzzy rules produces the system results inference system however fis has two major limitations the first restriction is to set the type of membership functions and their optimal number in most works these variables are determined by trial and error so finding an optimal solution is not guaranteed thus one of the most popular approaches to overcome this constraint is the use of genetic fuzzy systems gfss a hybrid combination of fl and genetic algorithms gas in the field of water management ai has been used in probabilistic hydrology prediction zhang et al 2011 groundwater level forecasting shirmohammadi et al 2013 for the prediction of furrow irrigation infiltration mattar et al 2015 or even for the prediction of filtered volume in micro irrigation and sand filter systems puig bargués et al 2012 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and fl techniques have also been applied for the prediction and simulation of groundwater level fluctuations zare and koch 2018 and for irrigation scheduling optimization using a flexible decision support system yang et al 2017 however there are very few useful tools for irrigation district managers and farmers to forecast irrigation depth at farm level in pressurized irrigation networks gfss have already been used for water demand forecasting at the irrigation district level pulido calvo and gutiérrez estrada 2009 but no previous work has used these systems to predict farmer behaviour the second restriction is the inability of fis to automatically select the mf parameters and design the fuzzy rules however anfis which is a combination of artificial neural networks anns and fl overcomes this drawback thus an anfis uses the learning ability of an ann to define fuzzy rules anfis has been used for several applications such as the intelligent allocation of water resources chang et al 2016 and the optimization of reservoir operations safavi et al 2013 but has not yet been applied to characterize farmer behaviour therefore in this work a hybrid methodology that combines gfss and anfis has been developed to forecast the daily amount of water applied by each farmer the non sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 is the multi objective ga included in the gfs developed in this work the methodology has been applied to a real irrigation district in spain to predict farmer behaviour during the 2015 irrigation season 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data source the data recorded in the canal del zujar irrigation district czid of southwest spain was used to develop and test the predictive model built in this work czid is made up of ten independent hydraulic sectors and covers a total irrigated area of 21 141 ha sector ii of the czid was selected for this study the sector covers an irrigated area of 2 691 ha where the main crops are tomato maize grapevine and rice sector ii of the czid has a telemetry system with flowmeters that record hourly flow rates at hydrant level for the 2015 irrigation season hourly records were aggregated at daily level in addition information was also available about crop types and sizes of the farms irrigated by each hydrant daily climate data were obtained from a weather station located in the irrigation sector 2 2 problem approach the irrigation scheduling process consists of two main steps the occurrence of the irrigation event and the amount of water applied in this work a model of farmer behaviour that forecasts the daily irrigation depth applied by each farmer is developed using gfs and anfis the first phase of the model building process is to identify the main input variables a fis is then designed using an anfis model optimized by the nsga ii ga 2 3 model input identification although the construction of forecasting methods requires a huge amount of data the first step in this process is to reduce the dimension of the input space in order to identify the relevant input variables in the whole dataset there are several techniques to do this such as principal components analysis or partial least square cardinal components however when the selected variables are used in nonlinear models model predictions are usually quite poor lin et al 1996 therefore in this work fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces have been used to easily and automatically select the independent significant inputs for the hybrid model following the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 for each potential input variable a plot is initially created that relates each potential input variable to the target variable to be predicted daw daily amount of water applied by each farmer then for each point represented in each plot a fuzzy membership function is created according to the following expression 1 μ v k p i v e x p p i v k p i v b 2 where μ v k represents the fuzzy membership function of point k in the plot which relates the potential input variable v and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer p i v is the potential input variable v p i v k is the value of p i v at point k and b takes a value close to two lin et al 1996 hereafter each fuzzy membership function is defuzzied producing a fuzzy curve cv for each potential input p i v using 2 c v p i v k 1 m d a w k μ v k p i v k 1 m μ v k p i v where m is the total number of points in the space p i v daw and d a w k is the daily amount of water applied by each farmer in point k of the space p i v daw then the mean square error mse is computed for each space p i v c v 3 m s e c v 1 m k 1 m c v p i v k d a w k 2 where m s e c v is the mean square error for the fuzzy curve c v the mse values of each cv are sorted in ascending order if there is a completely random relationship between the pi and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer the fuzzy curve is flat and the msec is large conversely if the msec value is small the relationship between pi and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer is more significant a fuzzy surface is a space with a two dimensional fuzzy curve according to lin et al 1996 a fuzzy surface fsv j is defined as eq 4 4 f s v j p i v p i j k 1 m d a w k μ v k p i v μ j k p i j k 1 m μ v k p i v μ j k p i j where piv and pij are two potential input variables then similarly to eq 3 the mse is computed for the fuzzy surfaces 5 m s e f s v j 1 m k 1 m f s v j p i v p i j d a w k 2 fuzzy curves are initially used to rank all the potential input variables in ascending order the potential input variable with the smallest msec is the most important input variable according to lin et al 1996 20 of the potential input variables with the largest msec are eliminated fuzzy surfaces are then used to find the independent input variables and to eliminate the related input in each step thus in each step new fuzzy surfaces are computed and 20 of the potential input variables with the largest msefs is eliminated 2 4 fuzzy inference system fis due to its unique features in forecasting complex phenomena the fis is one of the best tools for modelling human thinking e g farmers decisions a fuzzy system is a nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs based on a set of if then rules while the antecedent of a rule defines a fuzzy region in the input space e g crop maximum daily temperature weekday etc the consequent specifies the output in a fuzzy region fig 1 shows a flow chart of a typical three step fis the aim of the first step fuzzification is to transfer the input vector into fuzzy if then rules through the mfs and linguistic variables that is a vector with input variables crisp values is turned into linguistic variables e g the value of the variable temperature is 25 c the crisp value becomes the linguistic variable the temperature is high the rule base and the mfs form the knowledge base fig 1 then the optimal design of the knowledge base is established by an ann section 2 5 there are two types of fiss the sugeno takagi ts takagi and sugeno 1985 fis and the mamdani fis mamdani and assilian 1975 the main differences between the two are the way that the outputs fig 1 are determined due to its more compact and computationally efficient representation than mamdani fis ts fis was selected for modelling farmer behaviour the rule s consequent in ts fis can be either a linear equation called first order ts fis or a constant coefficient called zero order ts fis due to the complexity of modelling farmer behaviour a first order ts fis was selected two examples of typical ts fis rules are rule 1 if x is a1 and y is b1 then f1 p1 x q1 y r1 rule 2 if x is a2 and x is b2 then f2 p2 x q2 y r2 where x and y are inputs a b are linguistic variables f is the consequence of each rule and p q and r are parameters which will be determined by an ann in the following section the inference step step 2 uses these fuzzy if then rules to assign a map from fuzzy inputs to fuzzy outputs based on fuzzy composition rules li 2006 for example for maize when the temperature is high fuzzy input the amount of water applied is high fuzzy output the last step defuzzification transfers fuzzy sets into crisp values for example for maize if the temperature is high then the amount of water applied is high fuzzy value and so the applied irrigation depth is 15 mm crisp value 2 5 anfis the main drawback to building a fis is the lack of systematic procedures to define both the mf parameters and the rule base nevertheless anns can learn their structure from the input output sets thus in this work an anfis resulting from the combination of an ann and a fis was created to determine the mf parameters and find the rule base through the ann learning ability to set the relationship between input and output thus the resulting fuzzy rules depend on the input structure the mathematical background of the anfis learning process is detailed in jang et al 1997 the typical structure of an anfis is composed of five layers fig 2 where the adaptive nodes represent different values depending on the input variables and the fixed nodes develop the same function independently of the input variables e g product function in fig 2 squares are adaptive nodes and circles are fixed nodes the number of nodes in the different layers depends on the number of rules considered fig 2 is a simple example of a 5 layer anfis with two inputs the operation of the anfis is described in what follows the nodes of the first layer fuzzification layer use the mfs to get outputs o i j i and j are the node and layer indexes respectively which are calculated according to eqs 6 and 7 6 o i 1 μ a i x f o r i 1 2 7 o i 1 μ b i y f o r i 3 4 where μ a i and μ b i are the membership functions whose optimal typology will be determined by a ga layer 2 is composed of rule nodes that calculate the firing strength of each rule wi as follows 8 o i 2 w i μ a i x μ b i y f o r i 1 2 the average nodes constitute the third layer aimed at calculating the ratio of the i th node firing strength to the sum of all firing strengths this ratio is computed according to the following equation 9 o i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 f o r i 1 2 the following layer layer 4 is the defuzzification layer that consists of the consequent nodes the output of each node represents the contribution of the i th rule to the output model and is computed as follow 10 o i 4 w i f i w i p i x q i y r i f o r i 1 2 in this work the optimal values of p q and r are obtained using two possible learning algorithms thus the learning method is a decision variable of the ga that can choose either the backpropagation method hagan et al 1996 which is used for all parameters of the mfs or the hybrid method backpropagation method least squares method where the backpropagation method is used for the parameters associated with the input mfs and the least squares method is used for the parameters associated with the output mfs the backpropagation method is a steepest descent method in which the mf parameters are moved along the negative of the gradient of the performance function while the least squares method uses the classical least squares problems resolution the final layer layer 5 consists of a single fixed node the output node this layer computes the overall output as the summation of all incoming signals from the previous layer according to the following equation 11 o i 5 f x y i w i f i i w i f i i w i f o r i 1 2 2 6 optimal anfis anfis can determine the rule base and the mf parameters which serve to build the knowledge base of a fis however the number of mfs which divides the universe of discourse of every input the type of mfs that characterizes every linguistic label and the learning method must be previously defined in most works these variables are determined by trial and error in this work however the optimal values of these variables are automatically determined by the multiobjective ga nsga ii deb et al 2002 thus two objective functions f1 and f2 are defined to search for the values of the anfis parameters that better forecast farmer behaviour while f1 maximizes the determination coefficient of the testing process r2 test f2 minimizes the average normalized root mean square error in the same testing process rmsetest the standard error prediction sep is also computed to compare different behavioural models according to ventura et al 1995 sep is calculated as follow 12 s e p 100 v r m s e t e s t where r m s e t e s t is the rmse in the test process mm and v is the average of observed daily water demand of the test set fig 3 shows the flow chart of the optimization process of the anfis model firstly an initial population of npop size is randomly generated by the nsga ii algorithm each chromosome of the initial population represents an anfis model and consists of ninput genes which divide the discourse universe of every input variable ninput genes which define the number and type of mfs of every input variable and an additional gene for the learning method therefore the size of each chromosome is 2 ninput 1 after the initial population is created an anfis model is generated for each chromosome fischr i and the knowledge base is obtained according to equations 6 to 11 every fischr i is trained with a data subset training set which is randomly obtained from the total dataset hereafter in order to assess the reliability of the training process every fischr i is tested by the test set and the objective functions f1 and f2 are calculated depending on their objective function values the chromosomes are then selected and modified crossover and mutation to generate a new set of npop chromosomes the process is repeated over several generations ngen finally the set of npop optimal chromosomes obtained in the last generation defines the pareto front in a multiobjective approach the set of optimal solutions is known as the pareto front and comprises solutions with a wide range of optimal values for the different objectives table 1 shows the decision variables and their positions gene in the chromosome chr of the ga as well as the value ranges that each decision variable can take for the ninput input variables of the predictive model a brief description of each decision variable is also shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model inputs the methodology developed above has been applied to czid described in section 2 1 during the 2015 irrigation season to predict the daily irrigation depth applied by each farmer from the following 18 potential inputs pi selected in line with the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 the potential model inputs are shown in table 2 as these authors suggest 20 of the input variables is reduced in each step of the identification process a summary of the identification process of the model input variables is shown in table 3 finally the following 5 input variables were identified applied irrigation depth on the previous day mm pi17 applied irrigation depth in the two previous days mm pi18 julian day pi13 daily maximum relative humidity pi6 and daily average temperature c pi4 the volume of water that each farmer applies every day depends essentially on the applied irrigation depth on the previous and two previous days which is considered by the variables pi17 and pi18 respectively variable pi13 denotes a direct relationship between the applied irrigation depth crop type and its phenological stage which varies over the irrigation season in addition the farmer s decision regarding the amount of water to apply is frequently conditioned by the farmer s warming sensation and is denoted by variables pi6 and pi4 thus the identified variables define farmer behaviour 3 2 anfis optimization the nsga ii optimized the objective functions f1 and f2 the random initial population consisted of 100 individuals chromosomes that evolved over 40 generations in this case study each chromosome was composed of 11 2 ninput 1 genes because 5 input variables were considered fig 4 shows the pareto front obtained in the 40th generation of the optimization process this figure shows two groups of solutions which are clearly distinct from one another this difference is related to the last gene of the chromosome learning method the first group was trained with the backpropagation method and obtained a single value of 9 61 mm for rmse f2 alternatively the second group which was trained by the backpropagation and least squares hybrid method reached f2 values between 2 41 mm and 3 84 mm furthermore the f1 values r2 test ranged from 0 35 to 0 42 for the first group while the f1 values for the second group ranged from 0 22 to 0 64 therefore the pareto front indicates that the hybrid method is the best learning method for this case study the pareto front shown in fig 4 was obtained by the ga 40th generation using the training and testing sets which contain information about all hydrants independently of the crop associated with each however the irrigation method and the daily water demand for each crop is related to the farmer s behaviour fig 5 as fig 5 shows due to the use different irrigation methods the irrigation depths applied and the temporal distribution of irrigation events for rice were distinct from those applied to maize and tomato as well as the temporal distribution of irrigation events this fact hinders the forecasting process therefore the accuracy of the model prediction can be improved by grouping the training and testing sets according to the irrigation method i e surface irrigation for rice and drip irrigation for maize and tomato and optimizing the anfis models again using the same number of chromosomes in the initial population and generations as in the previous anfis optimization figs 6 a and 6b show the pareto fronts for rice and for maize and tomato respectively for generation 40 the optimal f1 and f2 values were considerably improved with the new training and testing sets the pareto front for rice fig 6a shows that there were more individuals when using the backpropagation learning method than the first optimization process where all crops were trained together this increase in individuals which were trained with the backpropagation learning method is an effect of the change in the size of the training and testing sets in this case the ga algorithm did not have enough irrigation records to obtain better results with this learning method the f1 and f2 values ranged from 0 06 to 0 49 and 12 30 mm to 13 86 mm respectively for the training with the backpropagation learning method for the alternative method the f1 and f2 values ranged from 0 49 to 0 72 and from 2 85 mm to 3 88 mm respectively the pareto front for maize and tomato fig 6b shows that all individuals were trained with the hybrid learning method consequently although the representativeness of the predictive model f1 did not improve significantly compared to the first model fig 4 the accuracy of the predictions increased considerably specifically the f1 and f2 values for the maize tomato model ranged from 0 44 to 0 64 and 2 25 mm to 2 82 mm respectively therefore the accuracy of the maize tomato model obtained in the 40th generation was 41 40 better than the model that included the three crops together in a later generation 40 fig 5 and figs 6a and b highlight that the irrigation method affects the architecture and the results of the predictive model although the irrigation system was similar for maize and tomato both the cultural practices for each crop and farmer behaviour were completely different which were likely to affect the model forecasts to overcome this limitation new training validation and testing sets were created by separating maize and tomato and a new optimization process was carried out considering the same ga parameters generation number size of the initial population etc as in the previous optimization processes figs 7 a and b show the pareto front for maize and tomato respectively like the rice forecast model the size of the training validation and testing sets of the maize model fig 7a allowed some individuals to be trained by the backpropagation learning method in the pareto front the values of the objective functions evaluated by the ga f1 and f2 were clearly conditioned by the learning method if individuals were located far away from the optimal regions of the solution space during the random generation of the initial population the ga was unable to shift solutions towards the optimum s surrounding region this limitation in the generation of the initial population due to the small size of the training validation and testing sets resulted in a pareto front with two clusters for these reasons the size of the initial population should be large enough to distribute individuals evenly throughout the solution space thus for the maize model the f1 values ranged from 0 27 to 0 38 for the backpropagation learning method and from 0 54 to 0 87 for the hybrid learning method the f2 values ranged from 1 30 mm to 2 44 mm for the hybrid learning method and was 13 68 mm for the backpropagation learning method fig 7b shows that for tomato all individuals were trained with the hybrid learning method in this case the tomato forecast model had 254 more recorded irrigation events than the maize model 15 372 irrigation events for tomato versus 4345 irrigation events for maize for this reason the ga was able to eliminate individuals with the backpropagation learning method although some of them were located far from the optimal region during the generation of the initial population specifically the f1 and f2 values for the tomato crop ranged from 0 45 to 0 72 and from 1 97 mm to 2 77 mm respectively table 4 shows the number of observations of the different training validation and testing sets their optimization time requirements and the maximum and minimum sep and r2 values of each pareto front each optimization process always maintained a proportion of 80 10 10 for the training validation and testing sets while the maximum and minimum sep values in the pareto front of the first optimization process rice maize tomato were 110 and 27 52 respectively these values were 108 16 and 22 20 for the rice models respectively and 32 85 and 26 19 for the maize tomato models respectively given that optimization time requirements are mainly related to the number of observations the time requirements for rice were only 95 3 lower than for the first optimization process the segregation of the training validation and testing sets of the maize tomato model into independent sets maize and tomato greatly improved the sep values the minimum sep value for each crop was 9 80 maize and 23 42 tomato however the optimization time requirements were similar or higher than the maize tomato and rice maize tomato models the maximum and minimum r2 values were also improved when each crop was independently trained ranging from 0 062 to 0 72 for the rice model from 0 27 to 0 87 for the maize model and from 0 45 to 0 72 for the tomato model 3 3 optimal anfis models the best individuals anfis models in each optimization process were selected table 5 shows the values of the genes that make up every anfis model as well as their rmse r2 and sep values the number of membership functions of the five input variables are quite small considering that the maximum value was fixed by the ga in 10 and none of them was higher than 4 this indicates that the limits of the first five genes of the chromosome were properly set and the universe of discourse of each input variables were portioned correctly table 6 shows the linguistic variables of each fuzzy set which partitioned each input variable for the best anfis models selected the number of partitions of each universe of discourse depends on the degree of precision required for that variable the larger the number of partitions of an input variable the larger the number of actions that can be carried out in the predictive process based on this variable i e the predicted variable is more conditioned by changes in this input variable the irrigation system the cultural practices and the growth phases of each crop that made up the anfis model 1 were completely different therefore the input variable that relates these crop s characteristics julian day is not a conditioning variable and hence had only a single fuzzy set the partition of the universe of discourse was 1 however in anfis models 2 4 and 5 with single crops the crop phenological state was a determinant to predict the amount of irrigation applied consequently this input variable was divided into four fuzzy sets very low low high and very high these partitions completely match the different phenological states of a crop except for the julian day the fuzzy sets for the variables of anfis model 2 rice were completely different from those of anfis models 4 and 5 maize and tomato respectively thus indicating that the farmers behaviour with these crops was completely different while the daily maximum relative humidity and the daily average temperature take high medium or low values for anfis model 2 these variables only take high or low values in anfis models 4 and 5 anfis models 4 and 5 had similar fuzzy sets in each input variable only the first input variable applied irrigation depth on the previous day took high or low values for anfis model 4 and very low low high or very high for anfis model 5 considering the five anfis models the input variable which influenced farmer behaviour was the daily maximum relative humidity because the universe of discourse was always divided into two or three fuzzy sets the most frequent membership functions of the input variables were trapezoidal and gaussian due to the adaptability of their parameters because of the stiffness of its shape triangular is only used by the third input variable of anfis model 3 the five models selected were trained using the hybrid learning method backpropagation method least squares method and showed a better efficiency than the backpropagation method each crop was managed differently even when the same irrigation method was used thus when two or more crops were used together to train the anfis models its representativeness was much lower than if a single crop had been used anfis model 1 and anfis model 3 were trained with rice maize tomato and maize tomato respectively and their r2 values were 0 64 in both models however when a single crop was used as in anfis model 2 rice anfis model 4 maize and anfis model 5 tomato the r2 values were 0 72 0 87 and 0 72 respectively the accuracy of the prediction was also strongly affected by the crop thus when several crops were considered in the training process the rmse values ranged from 2 25 mm sep value of 26 19 for anfis model 3 to 2 41 mm sep value of 27 52 for anfis model 1 however as the scatterplots in figs 8 a b and c show when the crops were trained independently the rmse and sep values improved 2 85 mm and 22 20 for anfis model 2 fig 8a 1 30 mm and 9 80 for anfis model 4 fig 8b and 1 97 mm and 23 42 for anfis model 5 fig 8c based on these results the three models constitute a powerful tool for both farmers and irrigation district managers in their daily decision making processes firstly irrigation district managers can determine the amount of water to apply at each hydrant beforehand thus making it possible to manage the pumping station in advance and maximize its efficiency moreover in the event of a pumping station failure these models allow scheduling repairs and managing the time required to fix pumps repair equipment and purchase materials by aggregating these models managers can also know the workload of each section of the irrigation network in advance and prevent network failures breakage of valves filters etc which would improve the quality of service to users energy is one of the main production costs and limitations of irrigated agriculture given the accuracy of this tool managers would be able to determine the water and energy demands of the whole irrigation network and contract electrical energy daily on the market to improve the profitability of the irrigation network the implementation of these models on farms means that farmers are able to choose the optimal crop pattern contract the best electricity rates and maintain equipment replace equipment etc which would increase profits fig 9 shows an example of the architecture of the best anfis model anfis model 4 the mfs and the linguistic labels of the five input variables and three examples of the sugeno takagi rules that make up the rule base of the fis anfis model 4 was composed of 96 rules like r3 r27 and r48 anfis models 2 and 5 had a similar architecture with 36 and 192 rules respectively and the mfs and linguistic labels shown in the table 5 and table 6 4 conclusions a model of farmer behaviour to forecast the daily irrigation water used by each farmer has been developed combining artificial neural networks fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms the predictive model was trained validated and tested with the irrigation depths recorded for the three main crops rice maize and tomato cultivated in the canal del zújar irrigation district of southwest spain the results show that farmers behaviour and cultural practices differ depending on the crop even though the irrigation system is the same thus when several crops are trained together the representativeness of the model and the accuracy of the predictions were considerably worse than when each crop was trained independently the r2 values for rice maize and tomato model were 0 72 0 87 and 0 72 respectively and the sep values were 22 20 9 80 and 23 42 for these models respectively the irrigation systems and the size of the training validation and testing sets conditioned the quality of the results thus the rice model was slightly worse than the maize and tomato models both input variables selected in this work and the linguistic variables that portioned the universe of discourse of each of them provided a significant amount of information about how farmers manage their crops this information together with the models developed in this study constitute a powerful tool for irrigation district managers to implement strategies for saving energy and water in the irrigation districts as well as to design new irrigation systems that allow synchronizing the flow rate and pressure rate of hydrants and pumping stations with farmers behaviour and their real water consumption finally by combining these models with new models to predict the hourly distribution of the irrigation depth new strategies for contracting electrical energy could be developed acknowledgments this research was supported by an fpu grant university teacher training from the spanish ministry of education culture and sports to rafael

11426,irrigation water demand is highly variable and depends on farmer behaviour which affects the performance of irrigation networks the irrigation depth applied to each farm also depends on farmer behaviour and is affected by precise and imprecise variables in this work a hybrid methodology combining artificial neural networks fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms was developed to model farmer behaviour and forecast the daily irrigation depth used by each farmer the models were tested in a real irrigation district located in southwest spain three optimal models for the main crops in the irrigation district were obtained the representability r2 and accuracy of the predictions standard error prediction sep were 0 72 0 87 and 0 72 and 22 20 9 80 and 23 42 for rice maize and tomato crop models respectively keywords irrigation scheduling precision agriculture anfis genetic algorithm optimal input variables 1 introduction climate change and the growing demand for water in some economic sectors such as industry and agriculture are reducing the availability of freshwater irrigated agriculture is the main water user accounting for nearly 70 of total water consumption in the world conforti 2011 the sustainability of irrigated agriculture is strongly linked to the improvement of water use efficiency water demand forecasting could be one of the main tools to accurately design new irrigation systems and improve the management of older pressurized irrigation networks irrigation water demand is highly variable and depends on the behaviour of each farmer which is affected by both measurable variables e g agroclimatic variables or the size of the irrigated area and non measurable variables e g local traditional practices or holidays during the irrigation season fuzzy logic fl is an artificial intelligence ai technique initially developed by zadeh 1965 to explain human intelligence and decision making behaviour fl can be applied as a fuzzy inference system fis designed to transform linguistic concepts into mathematical and computational structures for daily water demand forecasting fis is a rule based system that consists of a rule base a database with membership functions mfs which determine the membership grades of each input variable to each fuzzy set and where the combination of fuzzy rules produces the system results inference system however fis has two major limitations the first restriction is to set the type of membership functions and their optimal number in most works these variables are determined by trial and error so finding an optimal solution is not guaranteed thus one of the most popular approaches to overcome this constraint is the use of genetic fuzzy systems gfss a hybrid combination of fl and genetic algorithms gas in the field of water management ai has been used in probabilistic hydrology prediction zhang et al 2011 groundwater level forecasting shirmohammadi et al 2013 for the prediction of furrow irrigation infiltration mattar et al 2015 or even for the prediction of filtered volume in micro irrigation and sand filter systems puig bargués et al 2012 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and fl techniques have also been applied for the prediction and simulation of groundwater level fluctuations zare and koch 2018 and for irrigation scheduling optimization using a flexible decision support system yang et al 2017 however there are very few useful tools for irrigation district managers and farmers to forecast irrigation depth at farm level in pressurized irrigation networks gfss have already been used for water demand forecasting at the irrigation district level pulido calvo and gutiérrez estrada 2009 but no previous work has used these systems to predict farmer behaviour the second restriction is the inability of fis to automatically select the mf parameters and design the fuzzy rules however anfis which is a combination of artificial neural networks anns and fl overcomes this drawback thus an anfis uses the learning ability of an ann to define fuzzy rules anfis has been used for several applications such as the intelligent allocation of water resources chang et al 2016 and the optimization of reservoir operations safavi et al 2013 but has not yet been applied to characterize farmer behaviour therefore in this work a hybrid methodology that combines gfss and anfis has been developed to forecast the daily amount of water applied by each farmer the non sorting genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 is the multi objective ga included in the gfs developed in this work the methodology has been applied to a real irrigation district in spain to predict farmer behaviour during the 2015 irrigation season 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data source the data recorded in the canal del zujar irrigation district czid of southwest spain was used to develop and test the predictive model built in this work czid is made up of ten independent hydraulic sectors and covers a total irrigated area of 21 141 ha sector ii of the czid was selected for this study the sector covers an irrigated area of 2 691 ha where the main crops are tomato maize grapevine and rice sector ii of the czid has a telemetry system with flowmeters that record hourly flow rates at hydrant level for the 2015 irrigation season hourly records were aggregated at daily level in addition information was also available about crop types and sizes of the farms irrigated by each hydrant daily climate data were obtained from a weather station located in the irrigation sector 2 2 problem approach the irrigation scheduling process consists of two main steps the occurrence of the irrigation event and the amount of water applied in this work a model of farmer behaviour that forecasts the daily irrigation depth applied by each farmer is developed using gfs and anfis the first phase of the model building process is to identify the main input variables a fis is then designed using an anfis model optimized by the nsga ii ga 2 3 model input identification although the construction of forecasting methods requires a huge amount of data the first step in this process is to reduce the dimension of the input space in order to identify the relevant input variables in the whole dataset there are several techniques to do this such as principal components analysis or partial least square cardinal components however when the selected variables are used in nonlinear models model predictions are usually quite poor lin et al 1996 therefore in this work fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces have been used to easily and automatically select the independent significant inputs for the hybrid model following the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 for each potential input variable a plot is initially created that relates each potential input variable to the target variable to be predicted daw daily amount of water applied by each farmer then for each point represented in each plot a fuzzy membership function is created according to the following expression 1 μ v k p i v e x p p i v k p i v b 2 where μ v k represents the fuzzy membership function of point k in the plot which relates the potential input variable v and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer p i v is the potential input variable v p i v k is the value of p i v at point k and b takes a value close to two lin et al 1996 hereafter each fuzzy membership function is defuzzied producing a fuzzy curve cv for each potential input p i v using 2 c v p i v k 1 m d a w k μ v k p i v k 1 m μ v k p i v where m is the total number of points in the space p i v daw and d a w k is the daily amount of water applied by each farmer in point k of the space p i v daw then the mean square error mse is computed for each space p i v c v 3 m s e c v 1 m k 1 m c v p i v k d a w k 2 where m s e c v is the mean square error for the fuzzy curve c v the mse values of each cv are sorted in ascending order if there is a completely random relationship between the pi and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer the fuzzy curve is flat and the msec is large conversely if the msec value is small the relationship between pi and the daily amount of water applied by each farmer is more significant a fuzzy surface is a space with a two dimensional fuzzy curve according to lin et al 1996 a fuzzy surface fsv j is defined as eq 4 4 f s v j p i v p i j k 1 m d a w k μ v k p i v μ j k p i j k 1 m μ v k p i v μ j k p i j where piv and pij are two potential input variables then similarly to eq 3 the mse is computed for the fuzzy surfaces 5 m s e f s v j 1 m k 1 m f s v j p i v p i j d a w k 2 fuzzy curves are initially used to rank all the potential input variables in ascending order the potential input variable with the smallest msec is the most important input variable according to lin et al 1996 20 of the potential input variables with the largest msec are eliminated fuzzy surfaces are then used to find the independent input variables and to eliminate the related input in each step thus in each step new fuzzy surfaces are computed and 20 of the potential input variables with the largest msefs is eliminated 2 4 fuzzy inference system fis due to its unique features in forecasting complex phenomena the fis is one of the best tools for modelling human thinking e g farmers decisions a fuzzy system is a nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs based on a set of if then rules while the antecedent of a rule defines a fuzzy region in the input space e g crop maximum daily temperature weekday etc the consequent specifies the output in a fuzzy region fig 1 shows a flow chart of a typical three step fis the aim of the first step fuzzification is to transfer the input vector into fuzzy if then rules through the mfs and linguistic variables that is a vector with input variables crisp values is turned into linguistic variables e g the value of the variable temperature is 25 c the crisp value becomes the linguistic variable the temperature is high the rule base and the mfs form the knowledge base fig 1 then the optimal design of the knowledge base is established by an ann section 2 5 there are two types of fiss the sugeno takagi ts takagi and sugeno 1985 fis and the mamdani fis mamdani and assilian 1975 the main differences between the two are the way that the outputs fig 1 are determined due to its more compact and computationally efficient representation than mamdani fis ts fis was selected for modelling farmer behaviour the rule s consequent in ts fis can be either a linear equation called first order ts fis or a constant coefficient called zero order ts fis due to the complexity of modelling farmer behaviour a first order ts fis was selected two examples of typical ts fis rules are rule 1 if x is a1 and y is b1 then f1 p1 x q1 y r1 rule 2 if x is a2 and x is b2 then f2 p2 x q2 y r2 where x and y are inputs a b are linguistic variables f is the consequence of each rule and p q and r are parameters which will be determined by an ann in the following section the inference step step 2 uses these fuzzy if then rules to assign a map from fuzzy inputs to fuzzy outputs based on fuzzy composition rules li 2006 for example for maize when the temperature is high fuzzy input the amount of water applied is high fuzzy output the last step defuzzification transfers fuzzy sets into crisp values for example for maize if the temperature is high then the amount of water applied is high fuzzy value and so the applied irrigation depth is 15 mm crisp value 2 5 anfis the main drawback to building a fis is the lack of systematic procedures to define both the mf parameters and the rule base nevertheless anns can learn their structure from the input output sets thus in this work an anfis resulting from the combination of an ann and a fis was created to determine the mf parameters and find the rule base through the ann learning ability to set the relationship between input and output thus the resulting fuzzy rules depend on the input structure the mathematical background of the anfis learning process is detailed in jang et al 1997 the typical structure of an anfis is composed of five layers fig 2 where the adaptive nodes represent different values depending on the input variables and the fixed nodes develop the same function independently of the input variables e g product function in fig 2 squares are adaptive nodes and circles are fixed nodes the number of nodes in the different layers depends on the number of rules considered fig 2 is a simple example of a 5 layer anfis with two inputs the operation of the anfis is described in what follows the nodes of the first layer fuzzification layer use the mfs to get outputs o i j i and j are the node and layer indexes respectively which are calculated according to eqs 6 and 7 6 o i 1 μ a i x f o r i 1 2 7 o i 1 μ b i y f o r i 3 4 where μ a i and μ b i are the membership functions whose optimal typology will be determined by a ga layer 2 is composed of rule nodes that calculate the firing strength of each rule wi as follows 8 o i 2 w i μ a i x μ b i y f o r i 1 2 the average nodes constitute the third layer aimed at calculating the ratio of the i th node firing strength to the sum of all firing strengths this ratio is computed according to the following equation 9 o i 3 w i w i w 1 w 2 f o r i 1 2 the following layer layer 4 is the defuzzification layer that consists of the consequent nodes the output of each node represents the contribution of the i th rule to the output model and is computed as follow 10 o i 4 w i f i w i p i x q i y r i f o r i 1 2 in this work the optimal values of p q and r are obtained using two possible learning algorithms thus the learning method is a decision variable of the ga that can choose either the backpropagation method hagan et al 1996 which is used for all parameters of the mfs or the hybrid method backpropagation method least squares method where the backpropagation method is used for the parameters associated with the input mfs and the least squares method is used for the parameters associated with the output mfs the backpropagation method is a steepest descent method in which the mf parameters are moved along the negative of the gradient of the performance function while the least squares method uses the classical least squares problems resolution the final layer layer 5 consists of a single fixed node the output node this layer computes the overall output as the summation of all incoming signals from the previous layer according to the following equation 11 o i 5 f x y i w i f i i w i f i i w i f o r i 1 2 2 6 optimal anfis anfis can determine the rule base and the mf parameters which serve to build the knowledge base of a fis however the number of mfs which divides the universe of discourse of every input the type of mfs that characterizes every linguistic label and the learning method must be previously defined in most works these variables are determined by trial and error in this work however the optimal values of these variables are automatically determined by the multiobjective ga nsga ii deb et al 2002 thus two objective functions f1 and f2 are defined to search for the values of the anfis parameters that better forecast farmer behaviour while f1 maximizes the determination coefficient of the testing process r2 test f2 minimizes the average normalized root mean square error in the same testing process rmsetest the standard error prediction sep is also computed to compare different behavioural models according to ventura et al 1995 sep is calculated as follow 12 s e p 100 v r m s e t e s t where r m s e t e s t is the rmse in the test process mm and v is the average of observed daily water demand of the test set fig 3 shows the flow chart of the optimization process of the anfis model firstly an initial population of npop size is randomly generated by the nsga ii algorithm each chromosome of the initial population represents an anfis model and consists of ninput genes which divide the discourse universe of every input variable ninput genes which define the number and type of mfs of every input variable and an additional gene for the learning method therefore the size of each chromosome is 2 ninput 1 after the initial population is created an anfis model is generated for each chromosome fischr i and the knowledge base is obtained according to equations 6 to 11 every fischr i is trained with a data subset training set which is randomly obtained from the total dataset hereafter in order to assess the reliability of the training process every fischr i is tested by the test set and the objective functions f1 and f2 are calculated depending on their objective function values the chromosomes are then selected and modified crossover and mutation to generate a new set of npop chromosomes the process is repeated over several generations ngen finally the set of npop optimal chromosomes obtained in the last generation defines the pareto front in a multiobjective approach the set of optimal solutions is known as the pareto front and comprises solutions with a wide range of optimal values for the different objectives table 1 shows the decision variables and their positions gene in the chromosome chr of the ga as well as the value ranges that each decision variable can take for the ninput input variables of the predictive model a brief description of each decision variable is also shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 model inputs the methodology developed above has been applied to czid described in section 2 1 during the 2015 irrigation season to predict the daily irrigation depth applied by each farmer from the following 18 potential inputs pi selected in line with the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 the potential model inputs are shown in table 2 as these authors suggest 20 of the input variables is reduced in each step of the identification process a summary of the identification process of the model input variables is shown in table 3 finally the following 5 input variables were identified applied irrigation depth on the previous day mm pi17 applied irrigation depth in the two previous days mm pi18 julian day pi13 daily maximum relative humidity pi6 and daily average temperature c pi4 the volume of water that each farmer applies every day depends essentially on the applied irrigation depth on the previous and two previous days which is considered by the variables pi17 and pi18 respectively variable pi13 denotes a direct relationship between the applied irrigation depth crop type and its phenological stage which varies over the irrigation season in addition the farmer s decision regarding the amount of water to apply is frequently conditioned by the farmer s warming sensation and is denoted by variables pi6 and pi4 thus the identified variables define farmer behaviour 3 2 anfis optimization the nsga ii optimized the objective functions f1 and f2 the random initial population consisted of 100 individuals chromosomes that evolved over 40 generations in this case study each chromosome was composed of 11 2 ninput 1 genes because 5 input variables were considered fig 4 shows the pareto front obtained in the 40th generation of the optimization process this figure shows two groups of solutions which are clearly distinct from one another this difference is related to the last gene of the chromosome learning method the first group was trained with the backpropagation method and obtained a single value of 9 61 mm for rmse f2 alternatively the second group which was trained by the backpropagation and least squares hybrid method reached f2 values between 2 41 mm and 3 84 mm furthermore the f1 values r2 test ranged from 0 35 to 0 42 for the first group while the f1 values for the second group ranged from 0 22 to 0 64 therefore the pareto front indicates that the hybrid method is the best learning method for this case study the pareto front shown in fig 4 was obtained by the ga 40th generation using the training and testing sets which contain information about all hydrants independently of the crop associated with each however the irrigation method and the daily water demand for each crop is related to the farmer s behaviour fig 5 as fig 5 shows due to the use different irrigation methods the irrigation depths applied and the temporal distribution of irrigation events for rice were distinct from those applied to maize and tomato as well as the temporal distribution of irrigation events this fact hinders the forecasting process therefore the accuracy of the model prediction can be improved by grouping the training and testing sets according to the irrigation method i e surface irrigation for rice and drip irrigation for maize and tomato and optimizing the anfis models again using the same number of chromosomes in the initial population and generations as in the previous anfis optimization figs 6 a and 6b show the pareto fronts for rice and for maize and tomato respectively for generation 40 the optimal f1 and f2 values were considerably improved with the new training and testing sets the pareto front for rice fig 6a shows that there were more individuals when using the backpropagation learning method than the first optimization process where all crops were trained together this increase in individuals which were trained with the backpropagation learning method is an effect of the change in the size of the training and testing sets in this case the ga algorithm did not have enough irrigation records to obtain better results with this learning method the f1 and f2 values ranged from 0 06 to 0 49 and 12 30 mm to 13 86 mm respectively for the training with the backpropagation learning method for the alternative method the f1 and f2 values ranged from 0 49 to 0 72 and from 2 85 mm to 3 88 mm respectively the pareto front for maize and tomato fig 6b shows that all individuals were trained with the hybrid learning method consequently although the representativeness of the predictive model f1 did not improve significantly compared to the first model fig 4 the accuracy of the predictions increased considerably specifically the f1 and f2 values for the maize tomato model ranged from 0 44 to 0 64 and 2 25 mm to 2 82 mm respectively therefore the accuracy of the maize tomato model obtained in the 40th generation was 41 40 better than the model that included the three crops together in a later generation 40 fig 5 and figs 6a and b highlight that the irrigation method affects the architecture and the results of the predictive model although the irrigation system was similar for maize and tomato both the cultural practices for each crop and farmer behaviour were completely different which were likely to affect the model forecasts to overcome this limitation new training validation and testing sets were created by separating maize and tomato and a new optimization process was carried out considering the same ga parameters generation number size of the initial population etc as in the previous optimization processes figs 7 a and b show the pareto front for maize and tomato respectively like the rice forecast model the size of the training validation and testing sets of the maize model fig 7a allowed some individuals to be trained by the backpropagation learning method in the pareto front the values of the objective functions evaluated by the ga f1 and f2 were clearly conditioned by the learning method if individuals were located far away from the optimal regions of the solution space during the random generation of the initial population the ga was unable to shift solutions towards the optimum s surrounding region this limitation in the generation of the initial population due to the small size of the training validation and testing sets resulted in a pareto front with two clusters for these reasons the size of the initial population should be large enough to distribute individuals evenly throughout the solution space thus for the maize model the f1 values ranged from 0 27 to 0 38 for the backpropagation learning method and from 0 54 to 0 87 for the hybrid learning method the f2 values ranged from 1 30 mm to 2 44 mm for the hybrid learning method and was 13 68 mm for the backpropagation learning method fig 7b shows that for tomato all individuals were trained with the hybrid learning method in this case the tomato forecast model had 254 more recorded irrigation events than the maize model 15 372 irrigation events for tomato versus 4345 irrigation events for maize for this reason the ga was able to eliminate individuals with the backpropagation learning method although some of them were located far from the optimal region during the generation of the initial population specifically the f1 and f2 values for the tomato crop ranged from 0 45 to 0 72 and from 1 97 mm to 2 77 mm respectively table 4 shows the number of observations of the different training validation and testing sets their optimization time requirements and the maximum and minimum sep and r2 values of each pareto front each optimization process always maintained a proportion of 80 10 10 for the training validation and testing sets while the maximum and minimum sep values in the pareto front of the first optimization process rice maize tomato were 110 and 27 52 respectively these values were 108 16 and 22 20 for the rice models respectively and 32 85 and 26 19 for the maize tomato models respectively given that optimization time requirements are mainly related to the number of observations the time requirements for rice were only 95 3 lower than for the first optimization process the segregation of the training validation and testing sets of the maize tomato model into independent sets maize and tomato greatly improved the sep values the minimum sep value for each crop was 9 80 maize and 23 42 tomato however the optimization time requirements were similar or higher than the maize tomato and rice maize tomato models the maximum and minimum r2 values were also improved when each crop was independently trained ranging from 0 062 to 0 72 for the rice model from 0 27 to 0 87 for the maize model and from 0 45 to 0 72 for the tomato model 3 3 optimal anfis models the best individuals anfis models in each optimization process were selected table 5 shows the values of the genes that make up every anfis model as well as their rmse r2 and sep values the number of membership functions of the five input variables are quite small considering that the maximum value was fixed by the ga in 10 and none of them was higher than 4 this indicates that the limits of the first five genes of the chromosome were properly set and the universe of discourse of each input variables were portioned correctly table 6 shows the linguistic variables of each fuzzy set which partitioned each input variable for the best anfis models selected the number of partitions of each universe of discourse depends on the degree of precision required for that variable the larger the number of partitions of an input variable the larger the number of actions that can be carried out in the predictive process based on this variable i e the predicted variable is more conditioned by changes in this input variable the irrigation system the cultural practices and the growth phases of each crop that made up the anfis model 1 were completely different therefore the input variable that relates these crop s characteristics julian day is not a conditioning variable and hence had only a single fuzzy set the partition of the universe of discourse was 1 however in anfis models 2 4 and 5 with single crops the crop phenological state was a determinant to predict the amount of irrigation applied consequently this input variable was divided into four fuzzy sets very low low high and very high these partitions completely match the different phenological states of a crop except for the julian day the fuzzy sets for the variables of anfis model 2 rice were completely different from those of anfis models 4 and 5 maize and tomato respectively thus indicating that the farmers behaviour with these crops was completely different while the daily maximum relative humidity and the daily average temperature take high medium or low values for anfis model 2 these variables only take high or low values in anfis models 4 and 5 anfis models 4 and 5 had similar fuzzy sets in each input variable only the first input variable applied irrigation depth on the previous day took high or low values for anfis model 4 and very low low high or very high for anfis model 5 considering the five anfis models the input variable which influenced farmer behaviour was the daily maximum relative humidity because the universe of discourse was always divided into two or three fuzzy sets the most frequent membership functions of the input variables were trapezoidal and gaussian due to the adaptability of their parameters because of the stiffness of its shape triangular is only used by the third input variable of anfis model 3 the five models selected were trained using the hybrid learning method backpropagation method least squares method and showed a better efficiency than the backpropagation method each crop was managed differently even when the same irrigation method was used thus when two or more crops were used together to train the anfis models its representativeness was much lower than if a single crop had been used anfis model 1 and anfis model 3 were trained with rice maize tomato and maize tomato respectively and their r2 values were 0 64 in both models however when a single crop was used as in anfis model 2 rice anfis model 4 maize and anfis model 5 tomato the r2 values were 0 72 0 87 and 0 72 respectively the accuracy of the prediction was also strongly affected by the crop thus when several crops were considered in the training process the rmse values ranged from 2 25 mm sep value of 26 19 for anfis model 3 to 2 41 mm sep value of 27 52 for anfis model 1 however as the scatterplots in figs 8 a b and c show when the crops were trained independently the rmse and sep values improved 2 85 mm and 22 20 for anfis model 2 fig 8a 1 30 mm and 9 80 for anfis model 4 fig 8b and 1 97 mm and 23 42 for anfis model 5 fig 8c based on these results the three models constitute a powerful tool for both farmers and irrigation district managers in their daily decision making processes firstly irrigation district managers can determine the amount of water to apply at each hydrant beforehand thus making it possible to manage the pumping station in advance and maximize its efficiency moreover in the event of a pumping station failure these models allow scheduling repairs and managing the time required to fix pumps repair equipment and purchase materials by aggregating these models managers can also know the workload of each section of the irrigation network in advance and prevent network failures breakage of valves filters etc which would improve the quality of service to users energy is one of the main production costs and limitations of irrigated agriculture given the accuracy of this tool managers would be able to determine the water and energy demands of the whole irrigation network and contract electrical energy daily on the market to improve the profitability of the irrigation network the implementation of these models on farms means that farmers are able to choose the optimal crop pattern contract the best electricity rates and maintain equipment replace equipment etc which would increase profits fig 9 shows an example of the architecture of the best anfis model anfis model 4 the mfs and the linguistic labels of the five input variables and three examples of the sugeno takagi rules that make up the rule base of the fis anfis model 4 was composed of 96 rules like r3 r27 and r48 anfis models 2 and 5 had a similar architecture with 36 and 192 rules respectively and the mfs and linguistic labels shown in the table 5 and table 6 4 conclusions a model of farmer behaviour to forecast the daily irrigation water used by each farmer has been developed combining artificial neural networks fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms the predictive model was trained validated and tested with the irrigation depths recorded for the three main crops rice maize and tomato cultivated in the canal del zújar irrigation district of southwest spain the results show that farmers behaviour and cultural practices differ depending on the crop even though the irrigation system is the same thus when several crops are trained together the representativeness of the model and the accuracy of the predictions were considerably worse than when each crop was trained independently the r2 values for rice maize and tomato model were 0 72 0 87 and 0 72 respectively and the sep values were 22 20 9 80 and 23 42 for these models respectively the irrigation systems and the size of the training validation and testing sets conditioned the quality of the results thus the rice model was slightly worse than the maize and tomato models both input variables selected in this work and the linguistic variables that portioned the universe of discourse of each of them provided a significant amount of information about how farmers manage their crops this information together with the models developed in this study constitute a powerful tool for irrigation district managers to implement strategies for saving energy and water in the irrigation districts as well as to design new irrigation systems that allow synchronizing the flow rate and pressure rate of hydrants and pumping stations with farmers behaviour and their real water consumption finally by combining these models with new models to predict the hourly distribution of the irrigation depth new strategies for contracting electrical energy could be developed acknowledgments this research was supported by an fpu grant university teacher training from the spanish ministry of education culture and sports to rafael

11427,plant growth and grain yield of various upland crops in response to zeolite application have been extensively studied but little information is available on the impact of zeolite application on rice grown in the lowlands under water stress a two year experiment was conducted using lysimeters in the field to evaluate the influence of zeolite application 15 t ha 1 on phenology grain yield and grain quality in a local rice cultivar shennong 9765 under three irrigation regimes cf continuous flooding irrigation iawd improved alternate wetting and drying irrigation and awd alternate wetting

grain quality in rice keywords zeolite alternate wetting and drying irrigation grain quality water use photosynthetic traits 1 introduction rice is the most important staple food worldwide providing about 20 of the daily calorie intake for half of the world s population khush 2013 rice is a water intensive crop that often requires 2 3 times more water than other cereal crops such as maize and wheat bouman et al 2007 the sustainability of rice production is being threatened by the increasing water scarcity rijsberman 2006 in addition rice production needs to increase substantially to feed the growing population in the coming decades van ittersum et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to develop water efficient irrigation strategies to reduce water use while maintaining or improving grain yield carrijo et al 2017 in recent years many irrigation water saving strategies have been pioneered and promoted including aerobic rice bouman et al 2007 non flooded mulching cultivation zhang et al 2008a intensification system zhao et al 2009 and alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd ye et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015 carrijo et al 2017 the most commonly practiced water saving technique is awd irrigation feng et al 2007 which can reduce irrigation water by 15 30 cabangon et al 2004 yang et al 2004 belder et al 2005 relative to continuous flooding irrigation cf but its effect on rice grain yield is an issue whether awd leads to yield loss or not mainly depends on the degree and frequency of soil drying between irrigation intervals and at what crop growth stage water stress occurs lampayan et al 2015 chi et al 2003 developed the improved alternate wetting and drying irrigation iawd that not only reduces irrigation water but increases grain yield in general the threshold of soil water potential swp in awd irrigation is fixed but can vary with growth stage under iawd irrigation depending on the sensitivity of rice to water stress at specific growth stages soil amendments are an effective method for mitigating the adverse impact of water stress on plants by improving soil physical properties polat et al 2004 natural zeolite as an inorganic soil conditioner has been widely used to improve the growth and yield of upland crops due to its high cation exchange capacity and intensive affinity for nutrients and water malekian et al 2011 aghaalikhani et al 2012 hazrati et al 2017 several studies have reported that zeolite mixed with urea increased rice grain yields in flooded paddy fields kavoosi 2007 gevrek et al 2009 sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 zeolite application at 5 15 t ha 1 on silty loam soil increased rice grain yield by 14 9 compared with the non zeolite amendment chen et al 2017 colombani et al 2014 showed that soil amended with zeolite reduced water and nitrogen losses relative to the unamended soil zeolite can hold water up to 60 of its weight due to its porous crystal structure polat et al 2004 and lose and gain water reversibly without changing structure sangeetha and baskar 2016 zeolite application can alleviate the adverse effects of water stress on plant growth due to its ability to absorb and control the release of water and in turn increase water availability to plants under drought conditions gholizadeh et al 2010 najafinezhad et al 2015 zeolite as a soil amendment for crop production improved water availability and increased water use efficiency wue in strawberry abdi et al 2006 while the positive effect of zeolite application in various upland crops during drying conditions has been extensively reported little information is available on the response of lowland rice under awd irrigation to zeolite application whether zeolite can alleviate the adverse effects of periodic drying conditions under awd on rice growth and benefit yield performance need to be addressed next to grain yield grain quality in rice is another important factor for determining economic returns for rice growers moreover consumers progressively prefer the high quality of rice with the improvement of economic level and enhanced purchasing power of many people in china zhang et al 2008b rice quality is determined both genetically and environmentally krishnan and surya rao 2005 soil water status has a remarkable impact on rice grain quality particularly during grain filling dingkuhn and le gal 1996 changing production practices from conventional flooded management to awd irrigation often improves the milled rice rate head rice rate gel consistency and protein content yang et al 2007 huang et al 2008 zhang et al 2008b the application of zeolite to soil increases water availability and nutrient retention polat et al 2004 which may impact rice grain quality by changing the soil water and nitrogen status during grain filling therefore it is essential to elucidate the response of rice grain quality traits to zeolite application under awd to better understand the underlying effects of zeolite in lowland rice production in this study we hypothesized that the addition of zeolite to lowland rice fields would improve morphological and physiological traits grain yield and grain quality in rice the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of zeolite application on rice growth grain yield and quality under various irrigation regimes 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and materials the

zeolite application rates and three replications lysimeters was used in both years the main plots were three irrigation regimes cf iawd chi et al 2003 and awd the sub plots were zeolite application at two levels z0 0 and z15 15 t ha 1 as recommended by chen et al 2017 the lysimeters 2 5 m long 2 m wide 1 8 m deep were constructed from concrete blocks and sealed with waterproof paint to prevent seepage between plots there were 18 lysimeters 3 irrigations 2 zeolite rates 3 replicates used for the experiment a mobile rainout shelter was equipped above the plots to rigorously control the soil water content in the plots the plots were irrigated using a pipe installed with a water meter as the lysimeters had closed bottoms 2 mm day 1 of water was drained into the gallery by opening the drainage outlet installed 1 8 m below the soil surface to simulate field conditions zeolite was applied to the puddled plots and mixed into the soil to a depth of 5 cm with a rake to determine the effect of zeolite application in the following growing season zeolite was only applied in the first year the 2015 experimental plots were the same as those in 2014 except there was no addition of zeolite details of the irrigation regimes are described in table 2 the soil water potential swp at 15 cm depth was monitored daily at 8 00 and 14 00 using soil moisture tensiometers made by the institute of soil science of chinese academy of sciences nanjing china installed in the iawd and awd plots when the swp dropped between the lowest and highest thresholds in the iawd plots or to the thresholds in the awd plots or the water depth in the cf plots dropped to the lowest water depth the plot was irrigated to the highest water depths shown in table 2 the amount of irrigation water was estimated using volumetric water meters in addition when pesticides and fertilizers were applied the plots must maintain standing water for a few days daily meteorological data including air temperature and rainfall were recorded by an automatic weather station located 500 m from the experimental site fig 1 seedlings were raised in the seedbed with sowing dates of 25 april 2014 and 30 april 2015 and transplanted on 20 may 2014 and 24 may 2015 with a hill spacing of 30 cm 15 cm with four seedlings per hill for mid late season rice in this area farmers generally apply 210 kg ha 1 n

tillering phosphorus was applied as a basal dressing of 60 kg ha 1 insects and diseases were intensively controlled throughout the season with chemicals weeds were controlled manually no noticeable crop damage was observed in either year 2 3 calculation of water use the total seasonal water use for rice was calculated using the following equation chen et al 2017 1 et p i k w0 wy where et is total water use mm p is volume of precipitation mm i is volume of total irrigation water mm k is groundwater recharge mm w0 and wy is soil water storage of the field before land soaking and after harvesting respectively p and k are both zero as the lysimeters are equipped with an automatic rain shelter and sealed at the bottom the difference between w0 and wy is calculated as follows 2 w0 wy

morphological and physiological measurements a chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta camera co osaka japan was used to determine spad values from the three uppermost fully expanded leaves on each plant at the tillering jointing booting and heading flowering stages three plants were measured in each plot with three spad values taken around the midpoint of each leaf blade 3 cm apart from one side of the midrib twenty seven spad values were averaged for each plot lai was determined using an accupar ceptometer model lp 80 decagon devices inc at the tillering jointing booting heading flowering and

breakdown in the iawd and awd treatments increased by 29 4 and 39 3 in 2014 and 20 3 and 18 8 in 2015 respectively relative to the cf treatment regardless of zeolite application the iawd and awd treatments decreased setback by 46 4 and 59 1 in 2014 and 81 3 and 82 2 in 2015 respectively compared with the cf treatment the iawdz15 treatment in 2014 and iawdz0 treatment in 2015 had the lowest values for setback table 6 3 5 principal components analysis pca for rice quality traits the pca results identified three principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 explaining 90 6 of the total variation in rice quality traits table 7 the first principal component pc1 represented 60 3 of the variability with coefficients ranging from 0 96 to 0 98 and accounted mainly for milled rice rate head rice rate appearance quality traits chalky rice rate and chalkiness and some starch viscosity properties peak viscosity breakdown cool viscosity and setback pc2 explained 18 8 of the variability derived from brown rice rate pasting temperature and peak time pc3 represented 11 5 of the variability and mainly accounted for hot viscosity and consistence the correlations between normalized pc1 vs pc2 and pc2 vs pc3 are shown in fig 3 the length of each loading arrow indicates the degree of correlation between each quality trait and the pcs for example brr was loaded positively on pc1 and pc2 with coefficients of 0 58 and 0 78 respectively whereas mrr was loaded positively on pc1 0 93 but negatively on pc2 0 19 table 7 hrr was loaded positively on pc1 and negatively on pc2 and pc3 appearance quality traits crr and chalkiness were loaded positively on pc2 and pc3 but negatively on pc1 peak viscosity and breakdown were loaded positively on pc1 and pc2 cool viscosity setback peak time hot viscosity and consistence were loaded negatively on pc1 and pc2 and either positively or negatively on pc3 while pasting temperature was loaded negatively on pc1 and positively on pc2 and pc3 the highly positive correlation between irrigation regimes and pc1 suggests that mrr hrr appearance quality traits and most of the starch viscosity properties were positively influenced by the change in irrigation regimes from cf to iawd or awd fig 3a and the relatively low positive correlation between zeolite and pc1 indicates that zeolite application may have affected some of these traits such as hrr crr and chalkiness which were confirmed by anova tables 5 and 6 although highly negatively correlated with pc2 the application of zeolite had no significant impact on brown rice rate pasting temperature or peaking time 4 discussion 4 1 effect of zeolite and irrigation management on lai leaf spad values and pn in rice zeolite has been extensively used as a soil amendment to improve plant growth and increase crop yield in different soil types due to its ability to retain water and nutrients from the soil previous studies have reported that zeolite application increased lai in different crops mohammad et al 2005 kavoosi 2007 aghaalikhani et al 2012 khan et al 2013 in the current study zeolite application at 15 t ha 1 enhanced the maximum lai in rice at the jointing booting stage by 17 2 mean of two years relative to the non zeolite treatment this was confirmed by aghaalikhani et al 2012 who suggested that the enhanced lai is due to more nitrogen being slowly released by zeolite under n deficienct conditions gholamhoseini et al 2013 reported that zeolite increased lai by improving nitrogen availability during plant growth and lai was highly correlated with total dry weight such that an increased lai caused by zeolite might increase grain yield however the iawd and awd treatments decreased the maximum lai at the jointing booting stage relative to the cf treatment in both years table 3 this is in line with wopereis et al 1996 who suggested that decreased lai with a reduction in irrigation water use may result from a reduction in leaf expansion since the leaf expansion process is extremely sensitive to water deficit in rice however zhou et al 2006 suggested that the lai in rice should be maintained within an appropriate range to obtain high grain yield which could explain why the iawd treatment did not impact grain yield with decreased lai compared with the cf treatment zeolite application increased leaf spad values in rice at the jointing booting and heading flowering stages in both years which is in agreement with previous studies aghaalikhani et al 2012 zanjani et al 2012 najafinezhad et al 2015 with the leaf spad values positively correlated with leaf n content the increase in spad value with zeolite application may be attributed to its unique nh4 retention capacity which increased nitrogen uptake by plants this was also confirmed by bybordi et al 2018 who suggested that zeolite increased chlorophyll content spad values by improving water and nitrogen supply moreover the increased spad values might be because zeolite takes up nutrients such as zinc iron and manganese from the soil and makes them available to the plants leading to enhanced chlorophyll synthesis fallah et al 2007 at the heading flowering stage in both years leaf spad values declined in the awd treatment but did not change in the iawd treatment relative to the cf treatment table 3 reductions in leaf chlorophyll content spad values under water stress have been reported in other crops such as wheat paknejad et al 2007 and cotton massacci et al 2008 which may be the result of limited water and nutrient supply under water stress leading to the degradation of chlorophyll pigments and therefore decreased chlorophyll contents sairam and srivastava 2002 in addition the higher spad values in the iawd than awd treatment indicate that leaf senescence occurred earlier in the awd treatment the photosynthetic rate pn of rice leaves at the heading flowering stage increased significantly with zeolite application in both years table 4 similar results were observed by bybordi and ebrahimian 2013 in canola who attributed the increase in pn to improved n uptake and soil water conservation as nitrogen and water play a crucial role on photosynthesis furthermore the significant positive correlation between pn and chlorophyll contents illustrates that the increased leaf n contents spad values induced by zeolite addition increased photosynthetic rates fig 2b in addition de smedt et al 2017 surmised that the increased pn in apple trees and tomato plants induced by zeolite might be due to the zeolite adsorbing more co2 molecules which increased co2 concentration and enhanced the photosynthetic process photosynthesis is susceptible to water stress wingler et al 1999 in our study pn declined in the awd treatment but was maintained in the iawd treatment in both years relative to the cf treatment table 4 similar results were observed by zhou et al 2017 who reported that pn decreased with increasing water deficit however the similar pn in the iawd and cf treatments may be due to the less severe threshold of swp 5 to 10 kpa at the heading flowering stage in the iawd treatment 4 2 effect of zeolite and irrigation management on rice grain yield the application of zeolite 4 8 t ha 1 and nitrogen acted as a slow release fertilizer increased yields in wheat 13 15 eggplant 19 55 carrots 63 and apples 13 38 torii 1978 various rates of zeolite applied to paddy fields have increased rice grain yield kavoosi 2007 gevrek et al 2009 sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 chen et al 2017 in the present study zeolite application increased rice grain yield by 7 5 mean of two years relative to the non zeolite control one possible explanation is that the zeolite could take up the nh4 immediately after urea hydrolysis to be released and absorbed by plants before nitrification rather than being more prone to nitrification in the non zeolite control which would favor plant growth and increase grain yield malekian et al 2011 the enhanced nh4 retention by zeolite could be attributed to an improved cation exchange capacity cec in soil gholamhoseini et al 2013 our previous study chen et al 2017 reported increases in cec exchangeable potassium and residual mineral n of 20 1 44 6 14 2 35 8 and 25 8 81 0 respectively in soil amended with 5 15 t ha 1 of zeolite furthermore the positive effect of zeolite on these soil properties was observed in the second year without an additional application in this study improved grain yields in the second year without additional zeolite application suggests that the zeolite effect is maintained for at least two years the long term effect of zeolite on paddy fields needs to be determined additionally the yield increasing mechanism of zeolite could be further explained by the response of photosynthetic traits a significant increase in pn at the heading flowering stage in response to zeolite application may enhance grain yield due to the increased synthesis of assimilates jabran et al 2017 or the significant positive correlation between grain yield and photosynthetic rate fig 2a moreover in 2014 zeolite cost about 26 usd t 1 in china our recommended zeolite application rate 15 t ha 1 would cost an additional 390 usd ha 1 15 t 26 usd over the two years with no zeolite added in the second year in 2014 and 2015 rice sold for about 500 usd t 1 in china hence the benefit of increased grain yield 1 5 t ha 1 sum of two years due to zeolite application 15 t ha 1 equated to 750 usd ha 1 1 5 t 500 usd making zeolite application rate of 15 t ha 1 a profitable option in this region the effect of awd irrigation on rice grain yield remains unresolved in one study a moderate awd improved rice root growth accelerated grain filling and increased grain yield zhang et al 2009 belder et al 2004 reported that no significant effect of awd on grain yield bouman and tuong 2001 summarized 31 published experiments on awd 92 of which resulted in yield penalties ranging from 0 to 70 relative to continuously flooded irrigation in the present study the awd treatment with an swp threshold of 15 kpa reduced grain yield by 15 4 means of two years relative to the cf treatment which is in line with zhou et al 2017 who reported that grain yield declined significantly under moderate water deficit with an swp threshold of 15 5 kpa relative to the well watered treatment however these results differ from those of carrijo et al 2017 who reported no significant yield penalty in an awd imposed treatment with a threshold of swp 20 kpa relative to the cf treatment the discrepancy is possibly due to differences in the timing of irrigation soil properties and climatic conditions n fertilizer management and rice varieties bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 in terms of soil properties the yields could be severely reduced in heavy soils where the roots are damaged under drying soil which ultimately reduces rice growth sanchez 1973a b moreover the yield reduction under awd might because the periodic irrigation and drought cycling reduced plant n uptake by intensifying n losses through increased nitrification and denitrification liu et al 2010 however no significant differences in grain yield were observed between the iawd and cf treatments under the iawd regime the swp threshold at the heading flowering stage was about 5 to 10 kpa which may benefit rice growth compared with 15 kpa in the awd regime because rice is extremely sensitive to water deficit at this stage and severe water stress will have adverse effects on its growth cruz and o toole 1984 ekanayake et al 1989 at late tillering the threshold of swp in the iawd regime was about 25 to 35 kpa which might have inhibited redundant unproductive tillers such that more nutrients and water were allocated to productive tillers which ultimately increased grain yield the results herein showed that iawd treatment which set the threshold of swp based on the sensitivity of rice to water stress at specific growth stages could maintain comparable grain yield with the cf treatment in general the iawd regime is a more suitable water saving technique for achieving the dual goal of saving irrigation water and maintaining grain yield in this area 4 3 effect of zeolite and irrigation management on rice grain quality the beneficial effects of zeolite application on growth and yield of lowland rice have been increasingly reported gevrek et al 2009 sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 chen et al 2017 however little information is available on its effect on grain quality in rice our study revealed that the zeolite application significantly improved hrr crr and chalkiness of rice grains but had no effect on starch viscosity properties as rice quality is thought to be determined both genetically and environmentally any improvements with zeolite application may result from enhanced nitrogen and water availability to plants zeolite was reported to increase hrr of rice grain by about 61 gevrek et al 2009 this could be attributed to enhanced nitrogen availability since hrr increased with increasing nitrogen levels pan et al 2009 in the present study the reduction in chalky rice rate and chalkiness induced by zeolite may have resulted from the nitrogen absorbed by zeolite being slowly released and taken up by the rice plant to support a more stable grain filling process he et al 1997 zhong et al 2007 these results were inconsistent with chen et al 2016 who found no significant effect of zeolite on these rice quality traits milling appearance or cooking quality the discrepancy in the performance of zeolite application on rice quality might be due to differences in rice varieties soil texture climatic conditions and so on cheng et al 2003 indicated that water management had a significant influence on rice grain quality moderate awd irrigation significantly increased brown rice rate milled rice rate and head rice rate yet reduced chalky rice rate and chalkiness compared with flooded treatment yang et al 2007 huang et al 2008 zhang et al 2008b similarly the iawd and awd regimes in our study significantly increased milled rice rate and head rice rate but decreased chalky rice rate and chalkiness when compared with the cf regimes this suggests that milling and appearance quality of rice grain improved under iwad and awd treatments also peak viscosity and breakdown significantly increased while setback declined markedly in the iawd and awd treatments relative to the cf treatment these findings are supported by cai et al 2006 who reported that peak viscosity and breakdown increased while setback decreased in the water stress treatment under high n the increased peak viscosity hot viscosity cool viscosity and setback in 2014 relative to those in 2015 may have resulted from temperature differences during grain filling about 70 dat fig 1 higher values of peak viscosity and breakdown and lower values of hot viscosity cool viscosity and setback may be related to better tasting rice shu et al 1998 han et al 2004 however the effects of water stress on rice grain quality are not well known the enhanced enzyme activities of sucrose synthase sus adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase agp starch synthase sts and starch branching enzyme sbe in grains exposed to moderate awd during grain filling might be responsible for the improved rice grain quality as these enzymes are involved in the sucrose starch pathways in grain zhang et al 2008b hurkman et al 2003 the improved starch viscosity properties influenced by irrigation regimes could be because water availability influenced the chain lengths of the amylopectin molecule bryant et al 2012 therefore both the iawd and awd regimes could improve rice grain quality 5 conclusions zeolite application at 15 t ha 1 significantly increased grain yield and improved grain quality by increasing head rice rate and decreasing chalky rice rate and chalkiness compared with the non zeolite control the yield increase induced by zeolite amendment could be attributed to improved lai leaf spad values and photosynthetic rate at the heading flowering stage iawd developed based on the sensitivity of rice to water stress at specific growth stages is more favorable to rice growth and resulted in enhanced grain yield compared to awd our study indicated that moderate water stress could improve rice grain quality in general the adoption of iawd with zeolite application at 15 t ha 1 could improve grain yield and quality with less water use acknowledgments the study was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 51679142 and 51709173 and the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest of china no 201303125 
11427,plant growth and grain yield of various upland crops in response to zeolite application have been extensively studied but little information is available on the impact of zeolite application on rice grown in the lowlands under water stress a two year experiment was conducted using lysimeters in the field to evaluate the influence of zeolite application 15 t ha 1 on phenology grain yield and grain quality in a local rice cultivar shennong 9765 under three irrigation regimes cf continuous flooding irrigation iawd improved alternate wetting and drying irrigation and awd alternate wetting and drying irrigation regardless of water supply zeolite application significantly increased leaf area index lai at all the measured stages except for tillering spad values at the jointing booting and heading flowering stages photosynthetic rate pn at heading flowering stage and grain yield and water use efficiency wue moreover zeolite addition significantly increased the head rice rate and decreased the chalk rice rate and chalkiness the iawd and cf treatments had similar spad values and pn at the heading flowering stage and grain yield while the awd treatment significantly reduced those values relative to the cf treatment the iawd and awd treatments significantly increased wue milled rice rate head rice rate peak viscosity and breakdown but decreased water use lai chalky rice rate chalkiness cool viscosity and setback these results suggest that the adoption of iawd with 15 t ha 1 of zeolite application could reduce irrigation water use increase grain yield and improve grain quality in rice keywords zeolite alternate wetting and drying irrigation grain quality water use photosynthetic traits 1 introduction rice is the most important staple food worldwide providing about 20 of the daily calorie intake for half of the world s population khush 2013 rice is a water intensive crop that often requires 2 3 times more water than other cereal crops such as maize and wheat bouman et al 2007 the sustainability of rice production is being threatened by the increasing water scarcity rijsberman 2006 in addition rice production needs to increase substantially to feed the growing population in the coming decades van ittersum et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to develop water efficient irrigation strategies to reduce water use while maintaining or improving grain yield carrijo et al 2017 in recent years many irrigation water saving strategies have been pioneered and promoted including aerobic rice bouman et al 2007 non flooded mulching cultivation zhang et al 2008a intensification system zhao et al 2009 and alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd ye et al 2013 lampayan et al 2015 carrijo et al 2017 the most commonly practiced water saving technique is awd irrigation feng et al 2007 which can reduce irrigation water by 15 30 cabangon et al 2004 yang et al 2004 belder et al 2005 relative to continuous flooding irrigation cf but its effect on rice grain yield is an issue whether awd leads to yield loss or not mainly depends on the degree and frequency of soil drying between irrigation intervals and at what crop growth stage water stress occurs lampayan et al 2015 chi et al 2003 developed the improved alternate wetting and drying irrigation iawd that not only reduces irrigation water but increases grain yield in general the threshold of soil water potential swp in awd irrigation is fixed but can vary with growth stage under iawd irrigation depending on the sensitivity of rice to water stress at specific growth stages soil amendments are an effective method for mitigating the adverse impact of water stress on plants by improving soil physical properties polat et al 2004 natural zeolite as an inorganic soil conditioner has been widely used to improve the growth and yield of upland crops due to its high cation exchange capacity and intensive affinity for nutrients and water malekian et al 2011 aghaalikhani et al 2012 hazrati et al 2017 several studies have reported that zeolite mixed with urea increased rice grain yields in flooded paddy fields kavoosi 2007 gevrek et al 2009 sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 zeolite application at 5 15 t ha 1 on silty loam soil increased rice grain yield by 14 9 compared with the non zeolite amendment chen et al 2017 colombani et al 2014 showed that soil amended with zeolite reduced water and nitrogen losses relative to the unamended soil zeolite can hold water up to 60 of its weight due to its porous crystal structure polat et al 2004 and lose and gain water reversibly without changing structure sangeetha and baskar 2016 zeolite application can alleviate the adverse effects of water stress on plant growth due to its ability to absorb and control the release of water and in turn increase water availability to plants under drought conditions gholizadeh et al 2010 najafinezhad et al 2015 zeolite as a soil amendment for crop production improved water availability and increased water use efficiency wue in strawberry abdi et al 2006 while the positive effect of zeolite application in various upland crops during drying conditions has been extensively reported little information is available on the response of lowland rice under awd irrigation to zeolite application whether zeolite can alleviate the adverse effects of periodic drying conditions under awd on rice growth and benefit yield performance need to be addressed next to grain yield grain quality in rice is another important factor for determining economic returns for rice growers moreover consumers progressively prefer the high quality of rice with the improvement of economic level and enhanced purchasing power of many people in china zhang et al 2008b rice quality is determined both genetically and environmentally krishnan and surya rao 2005 soil water status has a remarkable impact on rice grain quality particularly during grain filling dingkuhn and le gal 1996 changing production practices from conventional flooded management to awd irrigation often improves the milled rice rate head rice rate gel consistency and protein content yang et al 2007 huang et al 2008 zhang et al 2008b the application of zeolite to soil increases water availability and nutrient retention polat et al 2004 which may impact rice grain quality by changing the soil water and nitrogen status during grain filling therefore it is essential to elucidate the response of rice grain quality traits to zeolite application under awd to better understand the underlying effects of zeolite in lowland rice production in this study we hypothesized that the addition of zeolite to lowland rice fields would improve morphological and physiological traits grain yield and grain quality in rice the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of zeolite application on rice growth grain yield and quality under various irrigation regimes 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and materials the experiment was carried out in non weighing lysimeters at the center irrigation experiment station of liaoning province china 42 08 57 n 120 30 45 e 47 m altitude during two rice growing seasons may to october 2014 and 2015 the study area has a temperate continental monsoon climate with 7 5 c average annual air temperature average annual rainfall is 672 9 mm with the main rainy season from june to

zeolite application rates and three replications lysimeters was used in both years the main plots were three irrigation regimes cf iawd chi et al 2003 and awd the sub plots were zeolite application at two levels z0 0 and z15 15 t ha 1 as recommended by chen et al 2017 the lysimeters 2 5 m long 2 m wide 1 8 m deep were constructed from concrete blocks and sealed with waterproof paint to prevent seepage between plots there were 18 lysimeters 3 irrigations 2 zeolite rates 3 replicates used for the experiment a mobile rainout shelter was equipped above the plots to rigorously control the soil water content in the plots the plots were irrigated using a pipe installed with a water meter as the lysimeters had closed bottoms 2 mm day 1 of water was drained into the gallery by opening the drainage outlet installed 1 8 m below the soil surface to simulate field conditions zeolite was applied to the puddled plots and mixed into the soil to a depth of 5 cm with a rake to determine the effect of zeolite application in the following growing season zeolite was only applied in the first year the 2015 experimental plots were the same as those in 2014 except there was no addition of zeolite details of the irrigation regimes are described in table 2 the soil water potential swp at 15 cm depth was monitored daily at 8 00 and 14 00 using soil moisture tensiometers made by the institute of soil science of chinese academy of sciences nanjing china installed in the iawd and awd plots when the swp dropped between the lowest and highest thresholds in the iawd plots or to the thresholds in the awd plots or the water depth in the cf plots dropped to the lowest water depth the plot was irrigated to the highest water depths shown in table 2 the amount of irrigation water was estimated using volumetric water meters in addition when pesticides and fertilizers were applied the plots must maintain standing water for a few days daily meteorological data including air temperature and rainfall were recorded by an automatic weather station located 500 m from the experimental site fig 1 seedlings were raised in the seedbed with sowing dates of 25 april 2014 and 30 april 2015 and transplanted on 20 may 2014 and 24 may 2015 with a hill spacing of 30 cm 15 cm with four seedlings per hill for mid late season rice in this area farmers generally apply 210 kg ha 1 n 60 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 75 kg ha 1 k2o annually n as urea was applied in three parts 43 as basal 43 at tillering and 14 at panicle initiation potassium was applied in two parts 50 as basal and 50 at tillering phosphorus was applied as a basal dressing of 60 kg ha 1 insects and diseases were intensively controlled throughout the season with chemicals weeds were controlled manually no noticeable crop damage was observed in either year 2 3 calculation of water use the total seasonal water use for rice was calculated using the following equation chen et al 2017 1 et p i k w0 wy where et is total water use mm p is volume of precipitation mm i is volume of total irrigation water mm k is groundwater recharge mm w0 and wy is soil water storage of the field before land soaking and after harvesting respectively p and k are both zero as the lysimeters are equipped with an automatic rain shelter and sealed at the bottom the difference between w0 and wy is calculated as follows 2 w0 wy iy i0 where i0 is the amount of irrigation water for land soaking to form a stable water depth of 5 cm and iy is the amount of irrigation water used to obtain the same water depth after harvesting 2 4 morphological and physiological measurements a chlorophyll meter spad 502 minolta camera co osaka japan was used to determine spad values from the three uppermost fully expanded leaves on each plant at the tillering jointing booting and heading flowering stages three plants were measured in each plot with three spad values taken around the midpoint of each leaf blade 3 cm apart from one side of the midrib twenty seven spad values were averaged for each plot lai was determined using an accupar ceptometer model lp 80 decagon devices inc at the tillering jointing booting heading flowering and milky ripening stages a li cor 6400 portable photosynthesis measurement system li cor lincoln ne usa was used to measure leaf photosynthesis at 57 and 61 days after transplanting dat in 2014 and 56 and 59 dat in 2015 when swps were approximately 5 kpa and 15 kpa during the heading flowering stage in the iawd and awd treatments respectively the uppermost fully expanded leaf was measured between 9

vp 32 t yamamoto japan to generate milled rice the brown rice rate brr milled rice rate mrr and head rice rate hrr were expressed as percentages of total grain weights the chalky rice rate crr and chalkiness were determined using a rice inspector es 1000 shizuoka japan a tornado crush mill jfs 13 a qingdao joyjun medical products china was used to produce rice flour for the determination of starch viscosity properties rice starch viscosity properties were determined using a rapid visco analyzer rva 4 newport scientific australia and analyzed with thermal cycle for windows twc software as described by han et al 2004 viscosity values were recorded as rapid viscosity units rvu the constituents of starch viscosity properties include peak viscosity hot viscosity cool viscosity breakdown setback peak time pasting temperature and consistence the breakdown value was calculated by subtracting hot viscosity from peak viscosity the setback value was calculated by subtracting peak viscosity from cool viscosity and the consistence value was calculated by subtracting hot viscosity from cool viscosity 2 6 statistical analysis data for each year were analyzed separately using the sas glm procedure sas ver 9 4 for a split plot design with irrigation regime as the main factor and zeolite application as the sub factor mean values were calculated from the three replicates for each trait

values for setback table 6 3 5 principal components analysis pca for rice quality traits the pca results identified three principal components pcs with eigenvalues 1 explaining 90 6 of the total variation in rice quality traits table 7 the first principal component pc1 represented 60 3 of the variability with coefficients ranging from 0 96 to 0 98 and accounted mainly for milled rice rate head rice rate appearance quality traits chalky rice rate and chalkiness and some starch viscosity properties peak viscosity breakdown cool viscosity and setback pc2 explained 18 8 of the variability derived from brown rice rate pasting temperature and peak time pc3 represented 11 5 of the variability and mainly accounted for hot viscosity and consistence the correlations between normalized pc1 vs pc2 and pc2 vs pc3 are shown in fig 3 the length of each loading arrow indicates the degree of correlation between each quality trait and the pcs for example brr was loaded positively on pc1 and pc2 with coefficients of 0 58 and 0 78 respectively whereas mrr was loaded positively on pc1 0 93 but negatively on pc2 0 19 table 7 hrr was loaded positively on pc1 and negatively on pc2 and pc3 appearance quality traits crr and chalkiness were loaded positively on pc2 and pc3 but negatively on pc1 peak viscosity and breakdown were loaded positively on pc1 and pc2 cool viscosity setback peak time hot viscosity and consistence were loaded negatively on pc1 and pc2 and either positively or negatively on pc3 while pasting temperature was loaded negatively on pc1 and positively on pc2 and pc3 the highly positive correlation between irrigation regimes and pc1 suggests that mrr hrr appearance quality traits and most of the starch viscosity properties were positively influenced by the change in irrigation regimes from cf to iawd or awd fig 3a and the relatively low positive correlation between zeolite and pc1 indicates that zeolite application may have affected some of these traits such as hrr crr and chalkiness which were confirmed by anova tables 5 and 6 although highly negatively correlated with pc2 the application of zeolite had no significant impact on brown rice rate pasting temperature or peaking time 4 discussion 4 1 effect of zeolite and irrigation management on lai leaf spad values and pn in rice zeolite has been extensively used as a soil amendment to improve plant growth and increase crop yield in different soil types due to its ability to retain water and nutrients from the soil previous studies have reported that zeolite application increased lai in different crops mohammad et al 2005 kavoosi 2007 aghaalikhani et al 2012 khan et al 2013 in the current study zeolite application at 15 t ha 1 enhanced the maximum lai in rice at the jointing booting stage by 17 2 mean of two years relative to the non zeolite treatment this was confirmed by aghaalikhani et al 2012 who suggested that the enhanced lai is due to more nitrogen being slowly released by zeolite under n deficienct conditions gholamhoseini et al 2013 reported that zeolite increased lai by improving nitrogen availability during plant growth and lai was highly correlated with total dry weight such that an increased lai caused by zeolite might increase grain yield however the iawd and awd treatments decreased the maximum lai at the jointing booting stage relative to the cf treatment in both years table 3 this is in line with wopereis et al 1996 who suggested that decreased lai with a reduction in irrigation water use may result from a reduction in leaf expansion since the leaf expansion process is extremely sensitive to water deficit in rice however zhou et al 2006 suggested that the lai in rice should be maintained within an appropriate range to obtain high grain yield which could explain why the iawd treatment did not impact grain yield with decreased lai compared with the cf treatment zeolite application increased leaf spad values in rice at the jointing booting and heading flowering stages in both years which is in agreement with previous studies aghaalikhani et al 2012 zanjani et al 2012 najafinezhad et al 2015 with the leaf spad values positively correlated with leaf n content the increase in spad value with zeolite application may be attributed to its unique nh4 retention capacity which increased nitrogen uptake by plants this was also confirmed by bybordi et al 2018 who suggested that zeolite increased chlorophyll content spad values by improving water and nitrogen supply moreover the increased spad values might be because zeolite takes up nutrients such as zinc iron and manganese from the soil and makes them available to the plants leading to enhanced chlorophyll synthesis fallah et al 2007 at the heading flowering stage in both years leaf spad values declined in the awd treatment but did not change in the iawd treatment relative to the cf treatment table 3 reductions in leaf chlorophyll content spad values under water stress have been reported in other crops such as wheat paknejad et al 2007 and cotton massacci et al 2008 which may be the result of limited water and nutrient supply under water stress leading to the degradation of chlorophyll pigments and therefore decreased chlorophyll contents sairam and srivastava 2002 in addition the higher spad values in the iawd than awd treatment indicate that leaf senescence occurred earlier in the awd treatment the photosynthetic rate pn of rice leaves at the heading flowering stage increased significantly with zeolite application in both years table 4 similar results were observed by bybordi and ebrahimian 2013 in canola who attributed the increase in pn to improved n uptake and soil water conservation as nitrogen and water play a crucial role on photosynthesis furthermore the significant positive correlation between pn and chlorophyll contents illustrates that the increased leaf n contents spad values induced by zeolite addition increased photosynthetic rates fig 2b in addition de smedt et al 2017 surmised that the increased pn in apple trees and tomato plants induced by zeolite might be due to the zeolite adsorbing more co2 molecules which increased co2 concentration and enhanced the photosynthetic process photosynthesis is susceptible to water stress wingler et al 1999 in our study pn declined in the awd treatment but was maintained in the iawd treatment in both years relative to the cf treatment table 4 similar results were observed by zhou et al 2017 who reported that pn decreased with increasing water deficit however the similar pn in the iawd and cf treatments may be due to the less severe threshold of swp 5 to 10 kpa at the heading flowering stage in the iawd treatment 4 2 effect of zeolite and irrigation management on rice grain yield the application of zeolite 4 8 t ha 1 and nitrogen acted as a slow release fertilizer increased yields in wheat 13 15 eggplant 19 55 carrots 63 and apples 13 38 torii 1978 various rates of zeolite applied to paddy fields have increased rice grain yield kavoosi 2007 gevrek et al 2009 sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 chen et al 2017 in the present study zeolite application increased rice grain yield by 7 5 mean of two years relative to the non zeolite control one possible explanation is that the zeolite could take up the nh4 immediately after urea hydrolysis to be released and absorbed by plants before nitrification rather than being more prone to nitrification in the non zeolite control which would favor plant growth and increase grain yield malekian et al 2011 the enhanced nh4 retention by zeolite could be attributed to an improved cation exchange capacity cec in soil gholamhoseini et al 2013 our previous study chen et al 2017 reported increases in cec exchangeable potassium and residual mineral n of 20 1 44 6 14 2 35 8 and 25 8 81 0 respectively in soil amended with 5 15 t ha 1 of zeolite furthermore the positive effect of zeolite on these soil properties was observed in the second year without an additional application in this study improved grain yields in the second year without additional zeolite application suggests that the zeolite effect is maintained for at least two years the long term effect of zeolite on paddy fields needs to be determined additionally the yield increasing mechanism of zeolite could be further explained by the response of photosynthetic traits a significant increase in pn at the heading flowering stage in response to zeolite application may enhance grain yield due to the increased synthesis of assimilates jabran et al 2017 or the significant positive correlation between grain yield and photosynthetic rate fig 2a moreover in 2014 zeolite cost about 26 usd t 1 in china our recommended zeolite application rate 15 t ha 1 would cost an additional 390 usd ha 1 15 t 26 usd over the two years with no zeolite added in the second year in 2014 and 2015 rice sold for about 500 usd t 1 in china hence the benefit of increased grain yield 1 5 t ha 1 sum of two years due to zeolite application 15 t ha 1 equated to 750 usd ha 1 1 5 t 500 usd making zeolite application rate of 15 t ha 1 a profitable option in this region the effect of awd irrigation on rice grain yield remains unresolved in one study a moderate awd improved rice root growth accelerated grain filling and increased grain yield zhang et al 2009 belder et al 2004 reported that no significant effect of awd on grain yield bouman and tuong 2001 summarized 31 published experiments on awd 92 of which resulted in yield penalties ranging from 0 to 70 relative to continuously flooded irrigation in the present study the awd treatment with an swp threshold of 15 kpa reduced grain yield by 15 4 means of two years relative to the cf treatment which is in line with zhou et al 2017 who reported that grain yield declined significantly under moderate water deficit with an swp threshold of 15 5 kpa relative to the well watered treatment however these results differ from those of carrijo et al 2017 who reported no significant yield penalty in an awd imposed treatment with a threshold of swp 20 kpa relative to the cf treatment the discrepancy is possibly due to differences in the timing of irrigation soil properties and climatic conditions n fertilizer management and rice varieties bouman and tuong 2001 belder et al 2004 in terms of soil properties the yields could be severely reduced in heavy soils where the roots are damaged under drying soil which ultimately reduces rice growth sanchez 1973a b moreover the yield reduction under awd might because the periodic irrigation and drought cycling reduced plant n uptake by intensifying n losses through increased nitrification and denitrification liu et al 2010 however no significant differences in grain yield were observed between the iawd and cf treatments under the iawd regime the swp threshold at the heading flowering stage was about 5 to 10 kpa which may benefit rice growth compared with 15 kpa in the awd regime because rice is extremely sensitive to water deficit at this stage and severe water stress will have adverse effects on its growth cruz and o toole 1984 ekanayake et al 1989 at late tillering the threshold of swp in the iawd regime was about 25 to 35 kpa which might have inhibited redundant unproductive tillers such that more nutrients and water were allocated to productive tillers which ultimately increased grain yield the results herein showed that iawd treatment which set the threshold of swp based on the sensitivity of rice to water stress at specific growth stages could maintain comparable grain yield with the cf treatment in general the iawd regime is a more suitable water saving technique for achieving the dual goal of saving irrigation water and maintaining grain yield in this area 4 3 effect of zeolite and irrigation management on rice grain quality the beneficial effects of zeolite application on growth and yield of lowland rice have been increasingly reported gevrek et al 2009 sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 chen et al 2017 however little information is available on its effect on grain quality in rice our study revealed that the zeolite application significantly improved hrr crr and chalkiness of rice grains but had no effect on starch viscosity properties as rice quality is thought to be determined both genetically and environmentally any improvements with zeolite application may result from enhanced nitrogen and water availability to plants zeolite was reported to increase hrr of rice grain by about 61 gevrek et al 2009 this could be attributed to enhanced nitrogen availability since hrr increased with increasing nitrogen levels pan et al 2009 in the present study the reduction in chalky rice rate and chalkiness induced by zeolite may have resulted from the nitrogen absorbed by zeolite being slowly released and taken up by the rice plant to support a more stable grain filling process he et al 1997 zhong et al 2007 these results were inconsistent with chen et al 2016 who found no significant effect of zeolite on these rice quality traits milling appearance or cooking quality the discrepancy in the performance of zeolite application on rice quality might be due to differences in rice varieties soil texture climatic conditions and so on cheng et al 2003 indicated that water management had a significant influence on rice grain quality moderate awd irrigation significantly increased brown rice rate milled rice rate and head rice rate yet reduced chalky rice rate and chalkiness compared with flooded treatment yang et al 2007 huang et al 2008 zhang et al 2008b similarly the iawd and awd regimes in our study significantly increased milled rice rate and head rice rate but decreased chalky rice rate and chalkiness when compared with the cf regimes this suggests that milling and appearance quality of rice grain improved under iwad and awd treatments also peak viscosity and breakdown significantly increased while setback declined markedly in the iawd and awd treatments relative to the cf treatment these findings are supported by cai et al 2006 who reported that peak viscosity and breakdown increased while setback decreased in the water stress treatment under high n the increased peak viscosity hot viscosity cool viscosity and setback in 2014 relative to those in 2015 may have resulted from temperature differences during grain filling about 70 dat fig 1 higher values of peak viscosity and breakdown and lower values of hot viscosity cool viscosity and setback may be related to better tasting rice shu et al 1998 han et al 2004 however the effects of water stress on rice grain quality are not well known the enhanced enzyme activities of sucrose synthase sus adenosine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase agp starch synthase sts and starch branching enzyme sbe in grains exposed to moderate awd during grain filling might be responsible for the improved rice grain quality as these enzymes are involved in the sucrose starch pathways in grain zhang et al 2008b hurkman et al 2003 the improved starch viscosity properties influenced by irrigation regimes could be because water availability influenced the chain lengths of the amylopectin molecule bryant et al 2012 therefore both the iawd and awd regimes could improve rice grain quality 5 conclusions zeolite application at 15 t ha 1 significantly increased grain yield and improved grain quality by increasing head rice rate and decreasing chalky rice rate and chalkiness compared with the non zeolite control the yield increase induced by zeolite amendment could be attributed to improved lai leaf spad values and photosynthetic rate at the heading flowering stage iawd developed based on the sensitivity of rice to water stress at specific growth stages is more favorable to rice growth and resulted in enhanced grain yield compared to awd our study indicated that moderate water stress could improve rice grain quality in general the adoption of iawd with zeolite application at 15 t ha 1 could improve grain yield and quality with less water use acknowledgments the study was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china nos 51679142 and 51709173 and the special fund for agro scientific research in the public interest of china no 201303125 
11428,two new methodologies for the calculation of the probability p of operation of each outlet in on demand irrigation networks are developed in this work the first one was based on the investigation of the factors irrigation interval and time of irrigation which co modulate the probability p under real network operating conditions it computes p as the weighted arithmetic mean of the values of probability with weights its relative frequencies of appearance after classifying the different irrigation intervals this methodology is proposed for the calculation of p especially at the project design stage but also for the creation of databases as well as the second one the comparison with clément s methodology with the experimental data from the triennial survey on an irrigation network of yiannitsa former lake s networks showed that the new method can approach satisfactory well the reality contrary the results of clément s methodology were far removed from reality because the hypothesis on which it is based that each day during the peak period is an equally likely irrigation day for each user who operates independently from the others in a random manner doesn t get confirmed as expected in irrigation practices the second method is based on the time between two consecutive demands which is also a result of the empirical way of managing irrigation water at irrigation unit level and it calculates the probability by the mean of this time this methodology for the calculation of the probability p in irrigation networks operating on demand during the peak irrigation period is proposed only for the creation of databases in a simple and economical way keywords on demand pressurized irrigation networks farm level irrigation water management irrigation

1 introduction in on demand pressurized irrigation networks the probability p of operation of each outlet which appears in the demanding discharge formulas clément 1955 1966 mavropoulos 1992 is calculated by the relationship 1 p d s c r c the value of parameters s c c r are defined according to the criteria mentioned by bonnal 1966 1971 malossi 1970 clément and galand 1979 mavropoulos 1997 and others while the value of the d is initially calculated but in the end it is formed by the network s efficiency in these networks the probability p has a dominant role because from its value depends the number of simultaneously functioning outlets m as results from the demanding formulas and the corresponding design flow q m c therefore it is of major importance that the calculation of the probability p is done by a methodology that combines the main factors that co modulate its value in the peak irrigation period using the necessary technical contrivances in order to describe their special relations in a quantitative way thus the studied network will be able to meet the expected irrigation needs during its operating period without exceeding the acceptable over coverage or non response limits in this category belongs the methodology that is proposed in this paper for the calculation of the probability p at the design stage of an on demand irrigation network roscher 1973 used the birth and death process for determine the working probability p of an outlet in an on demand irrigation network with the relationship 2 p λ λ μ this relationship is encountered in the works of boissezon and hait 1965 clément 1966 mavropoulos 1992 etc where gets fully developed the birth and death process in on demand irrigation networks for the calculation of discharges mavropoulos 1992 designed a model of increase by irrigation and reduction by crop evapotranspiration of the soil moisture and he was leaded to the relationship 3 p t i r r r i r r which is another expression of p at outlet level it must be noted though that the above eqs 2 and 3 are equivalent to eq 1 consequently eq 1 remains the only one used for the application of the demanding discharge formulas clément 1955 1966 and mavropoulos 1992 applications of eq 1 in the same or another form appear in various research papers such as pulido calvo et al 1998 in water delivery system planning considering irrigation simultaneity they concluded among other things that the irrigation simultaneity gave a higher system capacity than the approaches based on assuming that all hours of irrigation day are equally probable monserrat et al 2004 in analysis of clément s first formula for irrigation distribution networks they concluded among other things that a the discharge demanded by an outlet is not constant in the period studied one month a mean coefficient of variation of 25 was obtained for this value b there is a significant variation in discharge between daytime and nighttime so the probability of an hydrant opening is not uniform throughout the day and c the outlets do not operate randomly but do operate independently rodríguez et al 2007 in model to forecast maximum flows in on demand irrigation distribution networks comparing their results to those obtained by clément s and mavropoulos s formulas they concluded that the statistical methods slightly underestimate the demand because demand tends to be concentrated at two peak times during the day one at mid morning and another in the late afternoon nonetheless the design flow obtained by the models is valid for designing the system studying the demand frequencies they concluded that a better fit is achieved when a more flexible distribution such as the gamma distribution is used no other method for the calculation of the probability p from any researcher at least known have been proposed to be used in the above demanding discharge formulas however other methods have been proposed for the calculation of a probability of operation of an outlet in order to determine the design flow in on demand irrigation networks by other models and methodologies that are of no interest to this work such a relationship is for example the one of moreno et al 2005 4 p d n e c e s s a r y d a y s t o i r r i g a t e t h e p l o t r i i r at plot level whose duration of irrigation application exceeds the daily operation of the network but it is suggested to use this relationship in the random daily demand curves methodology which they developed to calculate the design flow in on demand irrigation networks this methodology according to the authors can enable the design of a flow from the peak flow curve joining the points of maximum flow of each random daily demand curve this means that it is necessary to generate a large number of these curves in order to do so the operation time of the network is divided into intervals in which the outlet opening can occur with the same probability i g of 15 min the generated flow distribution is considered to fit a normal distribution with parameters μ mean and σ standard deviation for each one of the intervals in which the operation time has been divided so the design flow can be obtained with an acceptable quality of operation they concluded that a the initial hypothesis in which clément s methodology is based can be rejected b by using clément s methodology an underestimation of about 35 40 is made due to the use of the probability p of the outlet opening and c by applying the random daily demand curves methodology the results were similar to the measured data that were obtained in this paper a new methodology is proposed for the calculation of the probability p in an on demand irrigation network in the project design stage that approximates satisfactorily well the reality and shows thus also the acceptable limits of the construction cost of the project this methodology is also proposed for the calculation of the probability p in on demand irrigation networks in operation during the peak irrigation period for the creation of databases another different method can also interpret sufficiently well the empirical irrigation water management at farm level in on demand irrigation networks and it is proposed to be applied only for the creation of databases the two new methodologies for calculating the probability p during the peak water demand period are documented based on the results of a research detailed presentation of which can be found in the works mavropoulos 1992 mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 and are necessarily compared only to the methodology of clément 2 materials and methods 2 1 area of research work the experimental work had taken place in the network s area of the pumping irrigation station σ9 of yiannitsa former lake s networks which belong to the irrigation networks of the plain of thessaloniki this area in all its extent has smooth relief plain area and high territorial homogeneity the basic physico chemical characteristics and drainage of soils have already been extensively reported mavropoulos 1992 mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 the basic characteristics of the network are nominal discharge of the pumping station 420 l s 1 with 4 units 104 l s 1 manometric head 60 m and total power 440 kw with 110 kw per unit nominal discharge of outlet was determined at 6 l s 1 and a downstream pressure of 35 m other characteristics of the network which concern this work are mentioned where it is firstly imposed their short presentation 2 2 design research the methodology to conduct the experiment was to collect all the necessary discrete and continuous data e g record of the values of the requested discharge of the pumping irrigation station ʃ9 inventory of the outlets of each hydrant and the number and the extent of the parcels served by each of them record of the nozzles shape and the measure of the operating pressures and the diameters of these in the various systems of irrigation inventory of the crops to verify the laws and evaluate both the demand and probability formulas during the peak irrigation from 11 july to 10 august these data related to the main irrigation conditions which affected the water demand and their combination regulated the required discharge and the operation of the network in general and they have already been mentioned in detail mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 2 3 calculation of probability p 2 3 1 calculation of probability p with clément methodology this is the methodology mentioned in paragraph 1 and for which an extensive analysis is made in paragraph 4 due to the significant variations in the value of the parameters of eq 1 between those of the experimental data and those of the design flow 2 3 2 new methods for determine the probability p the two new methodologies express each in its own way the probability p as it is formed under the actual operating conditions of an on demand irrigation network by the main factors irrigation interval and time of irrigation of the network crops these methodologies are the follows calculation of the working probability of an outlet based on the time between two consecutive demands calculation of the working probability of an outlet as a weighted mean of its values by irrigation interval class with weights corresponding to their respective frequencies the steps followed in each methodology to calculate the probability p of operation of an outlet are described herein in the immediately following analysis calculation of the probability p that an outlet is open with the time interval between two successive demands the probability p that the outlet is open is connected to the time interval t between two successive demands with the relationship 5 p e ω t this relationship is a component of mavropoulos s formula 1992 6 q n p c 0 5284 n p q c t a λ 3 and it can be numbered separately or it can be incorporated in the formula the graph of this relationship appears in fig 1 in this power function where ω is a constant positive number the p is defined for t in the domain from 0 to since to each value of t in this domain corresponds exactly one value of the function with range of values 0 1 that gets easily obtained and thus greatly aids the researcher the eq 6 is based on the hypothesis that all the outlets of the network are independent of each other and that they operate in a random manner during the network s operation in the peak period with a mean probability p of opening this hypothesis is true at any point of application of the formula leaving the outlets downstream of any point to function completely independently of one another the time interval t between two consecutive demands two consecutively opened outlets follows the typical exponential distribution and the demand discharge q is connected with it through the weibull distribution the parameter a that is showed in eq 6 is the shape parameter of the weibull distribution in order to simplify the arithmetic operations it is suggested that this parameter as parameter of the above formula takes the value α 2 or α 4 for network operation below 24 or equal to 24 h each day respectively and for p 0 5 for p 0 5 eq 6 is independent of the value of α for p 0 5 which rarely happens in practice and for network operation below 24 or equal to 24 h each day α 4 or α 2respectively the formula cannot take into account uncontrollable factors just like any other model that may have an impact on the demand phenomenon thus since the operation of the outlets in an on demand irrigation network is literally in the hands of the irrigators rather than the operator of the network it is introduced the correction factor λ 3 only in the second term of the second part of the model which represents exactly the generally non random behavior of the irrigators this coefficient have dimensions h 1 a so that the model can have dimensional homogeneity and it should take values 1 λ 3 2 depending on the personal sparing assessment made by the designer of each study the uncontrolled factors expressed by the coefficient λ 3 concern network interruptions that may cause a demand accumulation respectively to their duration the grower leaders that also may cause a demand accumulation proportionally to their number and influence collective outlets collective irrigation systems which lead to users interdependence that may lead to a more frequent use of the outlets etc which the model cannot take into account just like any other one in this relationship the time t between consecutive demands is regular in accordance with the standard of poisson process that was followed in the establishment of the demand formula whereas in reality this time is irregular and thus represented by the mean value therefore this eq 5 can be used in a practical way for the calculation of the working probability p of an outlet estimating statistically the time t in zones sub zones and sectors in a sufficiently large number of networks operating on demand during the peak water requirement period for this purpose in any irrigation network operating on demand which is chosen to be studied the outlets which operate in the day of research get recorded in order of appearance during the period of peak water requirements based on this recording series are calculated the intervals between two consecutive appearances in minutes for each day then the average of all time intervals gets calculated which will be used for estimate the mean probability of operation of each outlet in the considered day by eq 5 to use eq 5 as it is there must be a conversion of the measurement units from min to hour otherwise if one wants to use the time measurements t not for calculations but e g for half an hour he must use eq 5 in the form p e ω 2 t etc the mean of the working probability of an outlet of the experimental network during the period of peak plant water requirements arises as the mean of probability values of either only the days of peak water demand or from all of the days of the network operation during the considered period the first case is proposed when the daily fluctuations of the working probability of an outlet are large or very large while the second case when they are small or moderate as the researcher himself estimates it is noted that the factors that differentiate the time intervals t between two successive requests are mainly the different irrigation interval and the time of irrigation of the crops these variations are larger among the four irrigation interval classes small moderate large very large and less pronounced inside each irrigation interval class thus if e g in an on demand irrigation network exist crops of mostly small and moderate irrigation intervals then because of the frequent irrigations the intervals t between two successive requests should be expected to be significantly smaller t 1 h p 0 5 than those in case of crops of large and very large irrigation interval t 1 h p 0 5 therefore since the working probability p of an outlet is expressed by the exponential function 5 and the values of time t are mainly formed by the irrigation interval and time of irrigation another way for the calculation of p would be a relationship in which p is derived from the different combinations of the above factors for example another relationship alternative to eq 5 would be the one to give directly one and only one value of probability p that corresponds to one and only one sum of a combination of these factors p f σ from the many in practice and theoretically infinite combinations with defined merely devices for the describing special relations in a quantitative fashion of the irrigation interval and the irrigation time in an on demand pressurized irrigation network in this case these would be two methodologies that would each express each in its own distinct way the main factors that co modulate the working probability of an outlet in an on demand pressurized irrigation network this alternative to the above first methodology for the calculation of the working probability of an outlet is the following calculation of the probability that an outlet is open as weighted arithmetic mean philosophy of the methodology what is original about this methodology is that it accepts that at the outlet level in an on demand irrigation network the working probability of each outlet depends on the irrigation interval of the crops served by the outlet since the total of n equally likely irrigation days depends mainly from this interval thus knowing that the time day of irrigation of the crop served by each outlet of the network is one day out of total of n equally likely irrigation days it is possible to calculate its probability of operation with the classic definition and then calculate the mean probability p i 1 2 3 4 by category of irrigation interval of the network crops therefore because each category of irrigation interval of the crops in an on demand irrigation network has a different weight in the formation of the mean value of the probability p as resulting from what was said in the previous methodology the connection of the values p ι i 1 2 3 4 with weighs the corresponding frequencies f i i 1 2 3 4 gives the requested weighted arithmetic mean of p basis of the methodology the fundamental principles on which the methodology is based are as follows 1st the on demand pressurized irrigation network operates on a 24 h basis during the peak irrigation period to blunt the daily peaks of water demand especially when irrigation is applied by self propelled sprinklers or other self propelled irrigation systems unless it s not allowed due to natural causes 2nd all the days and hours of operation of the network during the peak water demand period are considered to be of the same preference for using the network by all irrigators for the irrigation of any crop of the network so the irrigation of each crop of the network may begin at any time of any day during the operation of the network and continues onto the next or the following days for large irrigation units without interruption irrigation with self propelled sprinkler systems yet in fact the irrigators do not have the same preference of utilization of the network during the 24 h period nor during the peak season of irrigation the different sprinkler systems self propelled sprinklers hand move gun type sprinkler hand move portable aluminum lateral systems etc the organization of irrigations at farm level by one s own or collective means the organization of irrigations at collective outlet level the presence of irrigation leaders the sensitivity of crops to strong winds and heatwaves as well as the personal life of the irrigators differentiate the beginning and the end of the irrigations for example according to mavropoulos 1992 under the greek conditions in the network s area of the pumping irrigation station σ9 during the two years 1988 89 almost all the irrigators avoided to start an irrigation from 00 00 until 06 00 while those using hand move gun type sprinkler and hand move portable aluminum lateral systems they preferred not to use the network at night usually from 21 00 to 07 00 bartzoudis 1989 relatively with the day of irrigation distinguishes the following three consecutive 24 h intervals a the bright part of the day during which the changes of the irrigation stops can be done without any problem e g from 06 00 to 21 00 for the conditions of the prefecture of pella where the network is located b the first night part of the day during which there can be only interruption of the irrigation e g from 21 00 to 24 00 c the second night part of the day during which it must be considered practically impossible to intervene in irrigation 3rd the irrigation interval of each crop in each irrigation unit depends on soil plant and climatic factors as well as agricultural and irrigation practices and is calculated relationship 7 r i r r f a θ p a w r d e t c θ r a w e t c with the exception of climate factors all others generally differ significantly from irrigation unit to irrigation unit shaping different irrigation intervals even for the same crop based on what has been said above in order to calculate the value of the p that will be used in the demand discharge formula 6 in the beginning the irrigation interval of each crop gets calculated in each irrigation unit in an on demand irrigation network either by eq 7 either it is determined empirically as it is usually done in practice then all the irrigation intervals of the crops of the network are grouped into four categories as it is usually the case in practice and at each of them get associated only the outlets of the network that serve the crops of the specific category of irrigation interval thus as mentioned above outlets that serve even the same crop can be classified into different groups of outlets based on the irrigation interval group which includes the irrigation interval of the crop in the various irrigation units when more than one crop coexists in an irrigation unit then the serving outlet is considered to serve only the crops occupying the largest area of the irrigation unit and their irrigation intervals can be classified into a single group so the outlet is classified in the corresponding outlet category if this cannot be done then it is assumed that the outlet serves only the crop that occupies the largest area of the irrigation unit and it is grouped in the outlet group corresponding to the irrigation interval of that crop in both cases mentioned above if the term largest area doesn t mean a significantly larger area than the rest of the irrigation unit but the crop irrigation intervals fall into a smaller group of irrigation interval the classification of the outlet in the corresponding group is fine otherwise for the sake of greater network safety it is considered that the outlet serves crops whose irrigation intervals are classified in a smaller group of irrigation interval the four categories of irrigation intervals of crops are generally the following 1 small irrigation interval around half week 4 days 2 moderate irrigation interval around a week class interval 4 10 days and class mark 7 days 3 large irrigation interval around two weeks class interval 11 17 days and class mark 14 days 4 very large irrigation interval around three weeks class interval 18 24 days and class mark 21 days based on the above the mean of the classical probabilities p ι i 1 2 3 4 of appearance of the respective four irrigation interval categories of crops gets associated with weights the outlets n ι i 1 2 3 4 serving the crops of the respective categories considering empirically and intuitively as equally likely only the few days around the end of each larger than the small irrigation interval and the hours of each one of these as it was described in the previous paragraph the probability p a of irrigation of the given crop according to the classical definition of probability is 8 p a n a n p random experiment establishment of the new relationship finding the mean of the values of irrigation probability of each irrigation interval group indicates several repetitions of a random experiment to which the discrete random variable p is connected and so it will be expected that the different values of p ι i 1 2 3 4 will appear with the respective percentages of frequency f i i 1 2 3 4 this random experiment can only be the following let s suppose there is an irrigation network operating on demand with n homogeneous outlets installed in the irrigation zone let s suppose now that a researcher determines from the outset the commonly accepted number of days for each irrigation interval and calculates the respective probabilities as above the researcher visits randomly the m open outlets not necessarily simultaneously operating varying in number almost every day m replications of the same random experiment in an irrigation network operating on demand during the period of peak water requirements in each visit independent random experiment he poses at the user of the functioning outlet knowing the irrigation schedule of his crops the following questions and notes his reasoned answers 1 why is the irrigation applied today the scheduled s day 2 why did you expedite e days the irrigation 3 why did you delay for d days the irrigation the aim is to calculate the mean of the irrigation probability values p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 for each category of crop irrigation interval for all the days of the peak irrigation period of the considered network in this way by knowing the number of outlets n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 that serve each crop category by the separate field irrigation schedules and associating them as weights with the corresponding values p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 gets calculated the weighted mean of the probability p of operation of an outlet in the network for this purpose the next steps are followed step 1 he notes the number of the equally likely irrigation days for each irrigation and for each day separately based on the answers he got i e n s 1 or n e 1 or n d 1 step 2 he classifies the number of equally likely irrigation days for each irrigation interval category for each day and he calculates the weighted mean of the number of equally likely irrigation days for each category step 3 he calculates the mean of the number of equally likely irrigation days for each irrigation interval category for all the days of the peak irrigation period based on the daily weighted mean and finally by using eq 8 he calculates the mean of the values of irrigation probability p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 of each category at the considered network it is suggested to transfer the raw data of the daily responses of the irrigators in a table as the following table 1 and to express the weighted mean of the equally likely irrigation days correct to 2 or 3 decimal places if it is taken into consideration that each one of the mean irrigation probabilities p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 coincides with the probability of operation of the outlets serving the crops of each irrigation interval class in the sense that the irrigation of a crop is identical with the operation of the outlet that serves it then if each day of the peak irrigation period it is given to each value p ι i 1 2 3 4 a different weight expressed by the weights m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 then the weighted arithmetic mean of the probability that an outlet is open in the network is 9 p m 1 p 1 m 2 p 2 m 3 p 3 m 4 p 4 m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 i 1 4 m ι p ι i 1 4 m ι σ m p m when natural phenomena such as water scarcity strong winds heatwaves with duration intensity and frequency that do not allow to irrigate with sprinkler systems for about two hours or more each day during the peak irrigation period impose network operation below 24 h each day then the second part of eq 9 must be multiplied by the factor 1 r where r network operating hours 24 h so eq 9 is written in the form 10 p m 1 p 1 m 2 p 2 m 3 p 3 m 4 p 4 m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 1 r 1 r i 1 4 m ι p ι i 1 4 m ι 1 r σ m p m the eq 10 for all the peak period of irrigation and for all of the outlets of the network becomes 11 p n 1 p 1 n 2 p 2 n 3 p 3 n 4 p 4 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 1 r 1 r i 1 4 n ι p ι i 1 4 n ι 1 r σ n p n when all the probabilities p i p constant for r 1 the result is p p at this point it should be pointed out that the above random experiment is indeed rational but to be also effective the following conditions should exist 1st all the individual irrigation schedules of the network crops for each crop and plot case separately should be developed by the producers themselves as each one perceives the farm level irrigation water management evaluating all the factors related to the irrigation of its crops soil crop climate irrigation method with or without help from an irrigation specialist these irrigation schedules for each crop and plot should be recorded and be at the disposal of both the producers and the researcher 2nd all the irrigation dates of each crop in each plot of the network should be recorded with their start time by the researcher 3rd all the days of rushing or delay of an irrigation should be recorded by the researcher for each crop and plot case separately along with the reasons that imposed such a modification when all the above conditions cannot exist then the only way for someone to obtain the necessary experimental data for the application of eq 11 is described in the following paragraph 3 the eq 11 by replace the n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 outlets that are used as weights with the relative frequencies f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 of the extents of the network with crops of corresponding irrigation intervals takes the form 12 p n 1 p 1 n 2 p 2 n 3 p 3 n 4 p 4 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 1 r 1 r i 1 4 n ι p ι i 1 4 n ι 1 r σ n p n for this relative frequency fi the following properties apply 0 fi 1 where i 1 2 3 4 and f1 f2 f3 f4 1 which is considered sufficient to associate the classical probabilities with their respective appearance frequencies which are used as weights it should be underlined that with regard to the operation utilization coefficient of the network r according to the first principle of the methodology the pressurized irrigation network operates on a 24 h basis r 1 irrespectively of any needs and desires raised by the producers it is a critical factor which requires the careful evaluation of its parameters natural causes only before it is introduced into the relation 11 or in its form 12 for the design of networks operating on free demand the eq 11 or the form 12 is an original method for the calculation of the probability p of particular importance which appears to approximate sufficiently well the reality with or even without experimental data indeed in the conditions under which the crops irrigation interval and time which have the greatest role in shaping the probability p are defined in an on demand irrigation network the time of irrigation never has the same starting point some irrigations are applied on the predefined days other earlier and other later than the predetermined in this way it is really favored the expected randomization so that a simultaneous operation of all outlets doesn t occur it is also noted that another advantage of the relationship 11 or its form 12 of particular importance in the project design stage is that it also reveals the limits of the construction cost that are acceptable for the design of an on demand irrigation network under real conditions beyond which its place necessarily takes a network operated by rotation it is finally noted that in case that the irrigations get realized based on the irrigation schedule then eq 11 or the form 12 for p ι 1 i 1 2 3 4 gives p 1 which is fully in line with the basic property of probabilities 0 p 1 and eq 11 gets a complete axiomatic likely theoretical value such an event p 1 can happen but under conditions that are extremely unlikely to occur almost impossible in practice in the irrigation zone perimeter of a pressurized irrigation network operating on demand 3 results 3 1 calculation of the probability p 3 1 1 calculation of the probability p with eq 1 the results of the calculations of the probability p with eq 1 during the peak irrigation periods 1988 89 for each 10 day separately are shown in table 2 mavropoulos 1992 with the survey s additional information relating to the values of its parameters additional information specific continuous irrigation discharge d the average specific continuous irrigation discharge d 0 72 l s 1 ha 1 was calculated for the case of concentration of the most demanding crops alfalfa etc zeris and sotiriades 1976 and not of the prevalence of a crop such as cotton in fact in the irrigation zone of the network the cultivation of cotton was predominating with 86 31 and 83 89 in 1988 and 1989 respectively while the remaining percentage constitute the crops peas sugar beet maize tobacco vegetables alfalfa industrial tomato peach and whet in 1988 to which maize vegetables and soybean crops were added in 1989 after harvest of the winter wheat in the evapotranspiration of the crops had also contributed the groundwater table which was calculated using the field water balance and was found 26 20 and 27 01 for the years 1988 and 1989 while for the year 1990 was used the average 26 60 of these years reducing respectively the crop water requirements irrigation unit sc the net area is 270 ha which according to the local land reclamation organization l l r o of giannitsa which is responsible for the network is divided into 150 plots that belong to 271 owners so the irrigation unit instead of the design s s c 3 ha with 1 2 or 3 main parcels and not more than 4 or 5 was 2 329 2 331 and 2 232 ha for the years 1988 1989 and 1990 respectively in accordance with the structure of the crops and the number of active outlets 113 in 1988 and 1989 and 110 in 1990 discharge of an outlet c the discharge of an outlet instead of 6 l s 1 with flow limiting device of the study was measured 9 7 l s 1 and 10 6 l s 1 without flow limiting device in 1988 and 1989 respectively for the following reasons flow limiters have been arbitrarily removed from the outlets by the network users in order to be able to apply water to their crops with whichever irrigation system they had chosen to use thus the discharge of each outlet was provided in accordance with the irrigation system with which each time the water was applied to the served crops producers were applying irrigation water in their crops preferably with large self propelled sprinklers with a frequency of 80 4 in 1988 and 78 8 in 1989 while the others had a frequency of hand move gun type sprinkler 15 2 and 13 6 hand move portable aluminum lateral systems 4 4 and 7 6 in 1988 and 1989 respectively however the operation of the network was satisfactory thanks to the very small inclinations of the axes of the conduits around 2 for the upstream branches and 4 for the downstream branches and the discipline among the users who by satisfying adequately the hydraulic conditions discharge and pressure of the self propelled sprinklers were contributing to the smooth operation of the network on a 24 h a day basis percentage of outlets that was monitored the outlet monitoring percentage was 41 6 and 52 2 in 1988 and 1989 respectively out of a total of 59 hydrants of the network with 113 outlets 54 of two outlets and 5 of one outlet all with four outlets specifications duration of operation of the network during the peak irrigation period the network was designed for an 18 h operation but it worked 24 h a day thanks to the self propelled sprinklers with which the irrigation water was mainly applied to the crops of the network 3 1 2 calculation of the probability p with eq 5 raw data for the application of eq 5 should be available the recorded values of the exact opening time of each monitored outlet in the order of their occurrence but it wasn t possible to obtain such data because any records that weren t recorded by the researcher himself due to lack of time they were supposed to be obtained by the irrigators who for their own reasons didn t respond to the researcher s request 3 1 3 calculation of the probability p with eq 11 for the application of eq 11 the following steps are needed calculation of the probability of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops and selection or calculation of the number of outlets serving each category of irrigation interval of the network crops calculation of the probability of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops the calculation of the irrigation probability of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops is based on the number of possible equally likely irrigation days of the respective category a calculation of the possible equally likely irrigation days for each category of irrigation interval of the network crops this number of possible equally likely irrigation days is taken from the results of the random experiment according to what has been said in the paragraph calculation of the probability that an outlet is open as weighted arithmetic mean but the conditions for the application of the random experiment didn t exist in the region of the research work in this area each producer at the start of each irrigation period evaluates all the factors related to the irrigation and defines the farm level irrigation strategy that he will follow based mainly on the agro technical training empirical knowledge and perception that he has of the irrigations and not on measurements of the relative physical parameters he plans a draft irrigation schedule for each crop and plot case separately he doesn t noted it anywhere but he just keeps it in mind and constantly changes it during the irrigation period based on the status of plants and soil the prevailing weather conditions etc the above thinking process of farmers that is common everywhere in greece is the one that modifies the network operation conditions so that it gets adapted at each moment to the requirements of the users who want to apply the individual irrigation schedules of their crops whenever and for as long as each of them decides additionally the majority of the producers is characterized by suspicion works in an unorganized way behaves superficially etc under those circumstances there cannot be personalized convincing answers referring to whether the irrigation was made the predefined day or there was a certain expedite or delay and why in order to solve this problem the researcher found with difficulties admittedly and spoke with producers who were distinguished for their reliability for their diligence and their seriousness on the whole issue of the development of an irrigation strategy of the network crops from these discussions he concluded that the number of equally likely irrigation days for each category of irrigation interval of the network crops seems to be as follows for small irrigation interval around half a week the irrigation is applied the scheduled day for moderate irrigation interval around a week the irrigation is applied the scheduled day or one day earlier for large irrigation interval around two weeks the irrigation is applied one to two days earlier or one day later than planned and for very long irrigation interval around three weeks the irrigation is applied one to two or even three days earlier or one to two days later than planned b calculation of the irrigation probability of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops considering empirically and intuitively as equally likely only few days as described above and all the hours of each one of them the irrigation probability p ι 1 i 1 2 3 4 of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops according to eq 8 is for n 1 and n a 1 p 1 1 1 1 for small irrigation interval for n 2 and n a 1 p 2 1 2 0 50 for moderate irrigation interval for n 4 and n a 1 p 3 1 4 0 25 for large irrigation for n 6 and n a 1 p 4 1 6 0 17 for very large irrigation interval selection or calculation of the number of outlets serving the crops of each category of irrigation interval of the network this number in the absence of irrigation schedules of the network crops coincides with the frequency of each irrigation interval of the crops as resulting from the grouping of records of irrigation interval of different network crops a selection of the recorded irrigation intervals who had been applied at the network crops and classification by category raw data from the recording of the execution date of each irrigation made by using the outlets that were being monitored by the researcher the irrigation interval that was applied r irr α at the network crops as recorded in chronological order is given in table 3 frequency table the data grouping in table 3 on the base of the four categories of irrigation interval gives the next table 4 the data grouping as it was said is done in order to cover the absence of the irrigation schedules of the network crops that the methodology requires to be classified in four categories in reality some irrigations were indeed applied according to the program that had in mind the farmers especially those of small or moderate irrigation interval and therefore they were grouped aright while others were applied earlier or later and therefore they were grouped in a smaller or a greater irrigation interval of course there is an exception in the case of small irrigation interval that cannot become smaller and of very large that cannot become larger but we can accept that the fluctuations of the number of outlets in each irrigation interval category within the limits of the population of network s outlets affect minimally the value of the probability p that an outlet is open b calculation of the number of outlets per category of irrigation interval of the network crops according to what was said above this number coincides with the frequency of each irrigation interval category of the different crops of the network table 4 however since the frequencies of table 4 are derived from a portion of the population of the outlets of the network namely from two random samples one from each experimental year since the cotton cultivation was predominant in the irrigation zone of the network as mentioned in paragraph 3 1 1 since the two random samples were part of the 41 6 and 52 2 of the outlets population of the network in 1988 and 1989 respectively as noted in paragraph 3 1 1 without significant error it can be accepted that in practice they represent the entire population of the network s outlets for the irrigation of all of the crops the conclusion is that for the year 1988 the 3 outlets for large and the 1 for very long irrigation interval can be extrapolated to 85 outlets for large and 28 for very long irrigation interval and for the 1989 the 2 outlets for moderate irrigation interval the 4 large and the 1 for very long irrigation interval can be extrapolated to 32 outlets for moderate 65 large and 16 for very long irrigation interval calculation of the weighted mean of the probability p that an outlet is open therefore eq 11 taking into account the number n 1 0with coefficient weight p 1 1 n 2 0 with coefficient p 2 0 5 n 3 85 with coefficient p 3 0 25 and n 4 28with coefficient p 4 0 17 and with r 24 h r 24 h r 1 gives for the year 1988 a value for the probability p of operation of an outlet equal to p 85 0 25 28 0 17 113 1 1 0 23 in the same way the probability p that an outlet is open calculated by using the values n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 for the year 1989 is equal to p 32 0 5 65 0 25 16 0 17 113 1 1 0 31 3 2 calculation of the peak flow by the demand formulas according to the first formula of clément 13 q n p c u 1 n p q c 2 with which were

6 3 4 concise comparison table of the experimental data in order to facilitate the whole analysis in the next paragraph 4 and to decide which methodology of calculation of the probability p the proposed one or those of clément is the best to be used for predicting flows in on demand irrigation networks it is considered opportune to form the follow table 6 that shows the contrast of the different methodologies using the experimental data 4 discussion 4 1 probability p 4 1 1 calculation of the probability p with clément methodology the experimental procedure seems to verify the validity of the theory of probability in on demand irrigation networks mavropoulos 1992 mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 but the calculation of the probability p with the eq 1 created doubts for its accuracy these doubts arise from the fact that while the probability p in accordance with the design of the project zeris and sotiriades 1976 and with what has been said in paragraph 3 1 1 was calculated by the eq 1 for the peak water use month july as follows p d e s i g n 0 72 30 0 75 6 0 48 0 50 contrariwise for the first two years of the triennial experimental work this probability for the same month of peak water use calculated by the same relationship as shown in table 2 was p 1988 0 126 and p 1989 0 111 it was observed a large variation fall in the value of the probability p that an outlet is open from that of the project s design due to the significant modification in the value of all the terms of the second part of eq 1 during the month of peak water demand such a downward trend of the value of the probability p that an outlet is open in an on demand pressurized irrigation network raises questions about the rational approach of the calculation of the probability p with eq 1 there is a need for a penetrating look into the exact meaning of the concept of probability p in on demand pressurized irrigation networks for this purpose it is first necessary to demonstrate whether eq 1 is valid or not and if so it is required a detailed examination of all the criteria based on which the values s c r c and d are determined for the calculation of the probability p that an outlet is open in order to avoid such large differences between assumptions and reality the eq 1 is derived from the classical definition of probability clément 1966 14 p t t therefore eq 1 is not unfounded but in the theory of probability the classical definition of probability refers to a finite sample space and is based on the concept of equally likely results of an experiment which is not sufficiently clear therefore there is a problem with the case of equally likely so one must investigate the conditions under which this method of calculation of the probability p of operation of each outlet is applied so the words equally likely may not be so vague by examining eq 1 one observes that the values given in the parameters that get involved express personal assessments of the designer in his attempt to form a value of p such that the designed network can be adapted as best as possible in economic operational and agronomic terms in the conditions of the serving farms thus the designer by basing the calculation of the probability p on the extent of the irrigation unit s c and the discharge of an outlet c which he himself defines doesn t keep up with reality as this reality is shaped by the water management at irrigation unit level by each user because these parameters are not related to the probability p but to the duration of irrigation application t irr as arises by the following analysis for example let s suppose that eq 1 is applied in the network s area of the pumping irrigation station σ9 under the following two circumstances the designer in order to reduce the network s construction cost sub triples the number of irrigation hydrants tripling the size of the irrigation unit the theory of probability would not allow it because p d s c r c 0 072 90 0 75 6 1 44 1 w h i c h i s a b s u r d the designer in order to meet the demands of network users triples the nominal discharge of the outlets to sub triple the time of irrigation of the irrigation unit the probability that an outlet is open would fall in the value of p d s c r c 0 072 30 0 75 18 0 16 w h i c h f a r m e r s d o n o t u n d e r s tan d this means generalizing that by increasing the size of the nominal discharge c the probability p gets reduced but in the users mind is the duration of irrigation t irr that gets reduced and not the probability p which can t be perceived by the users the users without knowing anything about formulas perceive rightly the reality and act accordingly in fact the basic parameters c and s c of the design of on demand irrigation networks are related to the duration of the irrigation with a sprinkler system as it is simply shown by the relationship 15 t i r r 10 e a f a θ p a w r d s c c and not to the time of irrigation that is the moment when an outlet opens as eq 1 shows neither eq 14 from which was derived eq 1 helps to investigate the aspects of the problem of the calculation of the probability p in fact in this definition the values t and t are determined beforehand without experimentation and all the results are considered equally likely if indeed all the outlets in an on demand irrigation network have equally probabilities of operation at the time t then this definition leads to the correct answer but is it possible in a random experiment of this nature that the results are indeed always equally likely no in no case all the days on which the network operates cannot be equally likely for any outlet of the network as it will be shown in the following analysis with the help of eq 3 from the above analysis arises that the calculation of the probability p with the classical definition of probability is not fully defined it appears that there are other factors that are not taken into account until today and are related to the probability p it is necessary if possible to reveal all the factors and the ways in which they jointly shape the average probability of operation of each outlet these factors if they cannot be defined in terms easily understandable they should be explained and illustrated as simple as possible in this effort of analysis and investigation of the phenomenon of the working probability of an outlet particular contribution has the following relationship mavropoulos 1992 3 p t i r r r i r r which is equivalent to eq 1 and can also occur from the relation roscher 1973 2 p λ λ μ in fact considering e g an outlet serving a crop and interpreting the terms of eq 3 t irr which is the duration of irrigation application eq 15 and r irr which is the maximum irrigation interval of the crop calculated by eq 7 one observes the following in irrigation practice after an irrigation no farmer does even think about applying the next one if with the passage of days the end of the maximum irrigation interval determined by himself isn t approaching then and only then without hesitation he expedites or with great caution delays the application of irrigation according to the estimations that he makes for the status of plants and soil the weather conditions etc therefore the days which may be regarded as equally likely to irrigate a crop is clearly less than those of each empirical maximum irrigation interval it is almost always the predetermined days to be chosen when the irrigation interval is small and a few days around the end of each larger than the small irrigation interval for many growers neither all the hours of each day are equally likely for irrigation the above irrigation concept and practices of water management at irrigation unit level by each user are widespread among all irrigators at least in greece it s a general behavior of the irrigators which varies from region to region depending mainly on the soil and climate in each area the cultivation techniques applied the agro technical training and the empirical knowledge and perception about the irrigations thus eq 3 therefore also the equivalents 1 2 and 14 does not give solutions in the real world of irrigations because it greatly increases the total of the number of possible equally likely days for crop irrigation equating it with the maximum irrigation interval and thus reduces the value of the working probability p of an outlet 4 1 2 calculation of the probability p with the new methodologies concerning the new methodologies the mean probability p gets calculated simply and economically as it is formed by the main factors irrigation interval and time of irrigation of the crops in an on demand irrigation network under actual network operating conditions in each experimental year the above factors express in particular the various combinations of crop and soil characteristics under the prevailing climatic conditions in the irrigation zone of the network as well as also the cultivation and irrigation practices applied within the irrigation zone each experimental year therefore particular importance have only the experimental data of the years in which among the crops of the network s irrigation zone there is a concentration of high demand crops during the peak consumption period as well as those of the years of domination in this zone of a single crop of no low water requirements the selection of the probability p that best suits the under design on demand irrigation network is based on the probable high concentration of the most demanding crops in the expected cropping pattern within the irrigation zone under the zone s soil and climatic conditions but also under the agricultural conditions and irrigation practices applied in the area for this selection it is important to map the physical characteristics and properties of the soil of the network s irrigation zone texture profile depth layers structure at the level of an irrigation unit where crops of different characteristics are expected to be installed upper parts of structure of the crops stages of crop development depth and spread of the roots under similar or different cultivation and irrigation practices this information under the prevailing climatic conditions of the area of the network are the one that determines the irrigation interval and the time of irrigation of the crops as these two irrigation parameters get perceived by the producers to understand how the farmers perceive these two pillars that co shape the probability p it is a good idea for the researcher to find and talk with discerning reliable and experienced producers about the whole issue of the water management at irrigation unit level for crop irrigation in the designed network thus the designer will be able to assume which could be the frequency distributions of crop irrigation intervals taking into account the depth of soil and crop roots the peak season of irrigation in the area of the studied network and which could be the equally likely irrigation days in each irrigation interval thus he can approach satisfactory well the reality by applying the relationship 11 even without experimental data it just is enough to compare the irrigation interval which also closely influences the time of irrigation that he determines himself from the values of the relevant parameters that are available to those determined by the producers according to their own criteria this is the only way to understand the behavior of irrigators concerning the use of the outlets operated or under design in on demand irrigation networks in whose hands lies or will lie respectively its operation it would be desirable if such a mapping of the irrigation zone or at least some sort of detailed soil survey existed for the experimental networks if an irrigation zone presents important soil differences over large areas then these should be separated in irrigation sub zones or sectors based on the soil depth shallow moderately deep deep very deep and on the basic soil textural groups sandy soils loamy soils clayey soils concerning the results from the application of eq 11 for the calculation of the probability p from table 6 arises that for the period from july 20 to august 8 1988 it was calculated in p 1988 0 23 for the period from july 16 to august 4 1989 in p 1989 0 31 while for the same peak water requirement periods it was calculated with eq 1 for the year 1988 in p 1988 0 117 for the year 1989 in p 1988 0 115 contrary to the design value for the peak month of water requirement july which was calculated with eq 1 in p d e s i g n 0 50 it was observed i e a very large variation fall in the values of the probability p calculated from the experimental data from that of the project design derived by the same eq 1 this fall in value of probability p is fully justified in the previous discussion above about clément s methodology eq 1 and confirms the conclusion of the discussion that it reduces the value of the probability p under actual operating conditions in networks operating on demand yet how much as far as it concerns the proposed methodology eq 11 we can observe that the value of p for 1988 is twice that of clément s 2 0 117 0 234 and for 1989 it is about three times higher 3 0 115 0 345 but with these elevated values does it approach and how much the actual value of the probability p or does it exceed it whether or not the proposed methodology eq 11 approximates the reality it will become apparent from the comparison of the discharges observed during the three year research work and those calculated by the demand discharge formulas by the first of clément and that of mavropoulos this claim arises from the fact that the experimental data from this research work showed that the theory of probabilities has validity in the irrigation networks operating on demand mavropoulos 1992 mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 4 2 discharges requested from the pumping irrigation station σ9 and calculated by the demand discharge formulas of clément and mavropoulos according to what has been said above for the calculation of the probability p with clément s methodology no additional comment is needed but concerning our second methodology one observes the following the differences between the discharge values 189 248 that were observed and 370 that was calculated by the formula of mavropoulos for the year 1988 and between 254 245 and 523 respectively for 1989 at the time intervals shown in the comparative table 6 vary widely from 33 to 49 and from 52 to 53 2 in the first and second comparison respectively such large differences raise questions about the application of the proposed method of probability calculation eq 11 and require investigation of their causes these differences occurred due to the following reasons 1st avoidance of the third and final irrigation of cotton the cultivation of cotton was dominant in the area as mentioned in paragraph 3 1 1 and many cotton growers avoided carrying out the third and last irrigation of this crop as it s shown in table 3 the avoidance stems from the fear of a probable delay in the maturation of bools or of their exposure to the pink worm and from the risk of rot if after the irrigation ensue rains a danger that grows prohibitively as time passes from the 2 nd irrigation always in july so they deactivate their outlets decreasing according to the number of closed outlets the requested supply by the pumping station consequently the number of the outlets for operation is much smaller than the considered n 2nd the small duration of irrigation application of the crops the irrigation units were small as shown in table 2 and many of them were further fragmented as arises from what was said in paragraph 3 1 1 so since the net area of 270 ha of the irrigation pumping station σ9 was divided into 150 plots that belonged to 271 owners each owner had an average of about 1 ha the duration of irrigation application of such small parcels is short and therefore reduces to a certain extent the number of simultaneously functioning outlets since they neither have a common start nor a common end of operation this reduction also entails a corresponding reduction in the required supply from the pumping station of the network 3rd the contribution of the groundwater table to the evapotranspiration of crops the dissimilar contribution of the groundwater table to the evapotranspiration of the crops of the network slightly alters their requirements in irrigation water from one outlet to another this reduces the duration of irrigation application in each irrigation system depending on the size of the contribution therefore those who irrigate crops that are most favored by this contribution put the irrigation systems off sooner and thus reduce to some extent the number of simultaneously operating outlets with the same effect as above from the above typical calculation procedure of the probability p with experimental data as shown in paragraph 3 1 3 and the necessary clarifications even without quantitative data arises that the new method for the calculation of p approximates sufficiently well the reality this efficiency owes to the fact that the calculation of p is made by using the irrigation interval and time of irrigation i e by combining two coefficients which express the major soil plant climatic agro technical etc factors which have impact on the water distribution on free demand in contrast eq 1 equivalent of 2 3 and 14 fails precisely because it ignores many of the above factors as explained in detail in this paper as regards the differences between the discharges that occurred at the time intervals shown in the comparative table 6 and those calculated with the first formula of clément they fluctuate less than in the case of application of mavropoulos s formula this is fully expected from those who know the behavior of these demand formulas particularly from what has already been extensively explained mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 finally it appears from table 6 that the average maximum flow rate requested by the pumping station per two hours during the peak irrigation period did not exceed 62 262 l s 1 of the nominal pumping supply 420 l s 1 this was due to 1st the avoidance of the third and final irrigation of cotton 2nd the small duration of irrigation application of the crops and 3rd the contribution of the groundwater table to the evapotranspiration of crops for the reasons mentioned above but also due to 4th the application of water 24 h a day basis with self propelled sprinklers which as shown in paragraph 3 1 1 were the mainly used irrigation system in the area of the network and normalized the water demand peaks instantaneous and daily the whole discussion in the light of critical analysis showed as better the proposed methodology eq 11 for predicting the flows in on demand irrigation networks which approaches satisfactorily the reality versus clément s methodology eq 1 that deviates greatly from it 5 conclusions in this paper it is proposed eq 11 or its form 12 for the calculation of the probability p that an outlet is open in the design stage of on demand irrigation networks it is sufficient for the designer to have in his hands a soil survey and mapping of the irrigation zone of the studied network at the level of the irrigation unit in order to know the soil s physical characteristics and properties profile depth layers structure texture etc the eq 11 was established on the investigation of the factors irrigation interval and time of irrigation which co modulate the probability p under the empirical management of the irrigation water at the level of the irrigation unit of the network and it calculates the p as the weighted mean of its mean values by category of irrigation interval with weights the respective number of operating outlets this methodology at the project design stage also reveals the acceptable limits of the construction cost of a network under real conditions beyond of which limits it gets preferred a network operated by rotation the eq 11 can also be used in a simple and economical way to obtain experimental data from on demand irrigation networks to calculate the probability p for the creation of historical databases the experimental results showed that the proposed methodology eq 11 approaches sufficiently well the reality in opposition to that of clément s eq 1 which deviates from it the critical analysis of clément s methodology revealed that in the design stage for the definition of p with eq 1 the parameters sc and c are not related to the probability p but to the duration of irrigation application the eq 5 is based on the time between two successive requests and can be used only for the creation of historical databases in a simple and economical way as well as eq 11 these two proposals open up a new field of research in on demand pressurized irrigation networks to devise a better model for the working probability p of an outlet funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
11428,two new methodologies for the calculation of the probability p of operation of each outlet in on demand irrigation networks are developed in this work the first one was based on the investigation of the factors irrigation interval and time of irrigation which co modulate the probability p under real network operating conditions it computes p as the weighted arithmetic mean of the values of probability with weights its relative frequencies of appearance after classifying the different irrigation intervals this methodology is proposed for the calculation of p especially at the project design stage but also for the creation of databases as well as the second one the comparison with clément s methodology with the experimental data from the triennial survey on an irrigation network of yiannitsa former lake s networks showed that the new method can approach satisfactory well the reality contrary the results of clément s methodology were far removed from reality because the hypothesis on which it is based that each day during the peak period is an equally likely irrigation day for each user who operates independently from the others in a random manner doesn t get confirmed as expected in irrigation practices the second method is based on the time between two consecutive demands which is also a result of the empirical way of managing irrigation water at irrigation unit level and it calculates the probability by the mean of this time this methodology for the calculation of the probability p in irrigation networks operating on demand during the peak irrigation period is proposed only for the creation of databases in a simple and economical way keywords on demand pressurized irrigation networks farm level irrigation water management irrigation

1 introduction in on demand pressurized irrigation networks the probability p of operation of each outlet which appears in the demanding discharge formulas clément 1955 1966 mavropoulos 1992 is calculated by the relationship 1 p d s c r c the value of parameters s c c r are defined according to the criteria mentioned by bonnal 1966 1971 malossi 1970 clément and galand 1979 mavropoulos 1997 and others while the value of the d is initially calculated but in the end it is formed by the network s efficiency in these networks the probability p has a dominant role because from its value depends the number of simultaneously functioning outlets m as results from the demanding formulas and the corresponding design flow q m c therefore it is of major importance that the calculation of the probability p is done by a methodology that combines the main factors that co modulate its value in the peak irrigation period using the necessary technical contrivances in order to describe their special relations in a quantitative way thus the studied network will be able to meet the expected irrigation needs during its operating period without exceeding the acceptable over coverage or non response limits in this category belongs the methodology that is proposed in this paper for the calculation of the probability p at the design stage of an on demand irrigation network roscher 1973 used the birth and death process for determine the working probability p of an outlet in an on demand irrigation network with the relationship 2 p λ λ μ this relationship is encountered in the works of boissezon and hait 1965 clément 1966 mavropoulos 1992 etc where gets fully developed the birth and death process in on demand irrigation networks for the calculation of discharges mavropoulos 1992 designed a model of increase by irrigation and reduction by crop evapotranspiration of the soil moisture and he was leaded to the relationship 3 p t i r r r i r r which is another expression of p at outlet level it must be noted though that the above eqs 2 and 3 are equivalent to eq 1 consequently eq 1 remains the only one used for the application of the demanding discharge formulas clément 1955 1966 and mavropoulos 1992 applications of eq 1 in the same or another form appear in various research papers such as pulido calvo et al 1998 in water delivery system planning considering irrigation simultaneity they concluded among other things that the irrigation simultaneity gave a higher system capacity than the approaches based on assuming that all hours of irrigation day are equally probable monserrat et al 2004 in analysis of clément s first formula for irrigation distribution networks they concluded among other things that a the discharge demanded by an outlet is not constant in the period studied one month a mean coefficient of variation of 25 was obtained for this value b there is a significant variation in discharge between daytime and nighttime so the probability of an hydrant opening is not uniform throughout the day and c the outlets do not operate randomly but do operate independently rodríguez et al 2007 in model to forecast maximum flows in on demand irrigation distribution networks comparing their results to those obtained by clément s and mavropoulos s formulas they concluded that the statistical methods slightly underestimate the demand because demand tends to be concentrated at two peak times during the day one at mid morning and another in the late afternoon nonetheless the design flow obtained by the models is valid for designing the system studying the demand frequencies they concluded that a better fit is achieved when a more flexible distribution such as the gamma distribution is used no other method for the calculation of the probability p from any researcher at least known have been proposed to be used in the above demanding discharge formulas however other methods have been proposed for the calculation of a probability of operation of an outlet in order to determine the design flow in on demand irrigation networks by other models and methodologies that are of no interest to this work such a relationship is for example the one of moreno et al 2005 4 p d n e c e s s a r y d a y s t o i r r i g a t e t h e p l o t r i i r at plot level whose duration of irrigation application exceeds the daily operation of the network but it is suggested to use this relationship in the random daily demand curves methodology which they developed to calculate the design flow in on demand irrigation networks this methodology according to the authors can enable the design of a flow from the peak flow curve joining the points of maximum flow of each random daily demand curve this means that it is necessary to generate a large number of these curves in order to do so the operation time of the network is divided into intervals in which the outlet opening can occur with the same probability i g of 15 min the generated flow distribution is considered to fit a normal distribution with parameters μ mean and σ standard deviation for each one of the intervals in which the operation time has been divided so the design flow can be obtained with an acceptable quality of operation they concluded that a the initial hypothesis in which clément s methodology is based can be rejected b by using clément s methodology an underestimation of about 35 40 is made due to the use of the probability p of the outlet opening and c by applying the random daily demand curves methodology the results were similar to the measured data that were obtained in this paper a new methodology is proposed for the calculation of the probability p in an on demand irrigation network in the project design stage that approximates satisfactorily well the reality and shows thus also the acceptable limits of the construction cost of the project this methodology is also proposed for the calculation of the probability p in on demand irrigation networks in operation during the peak irrigation period for the creation of databases another different method can also interpret sufficiently well the empirical irrigation water management at farm level in on demand irrigation networks and it is proposed to be applied only for the creation of databases the two new methodologies for calculating the probability p during the peak water demand period are documented based on the results of a research detailed presentation of which can be found in the works mavropoulos 1992 mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 and are necessarily compared only to the methodology of clément 2 materials and methods 2 1 area of research work the experimental work had taken place in the network s area of the pumping irrigation station σ9 of yiannitsa former lake s networks which belong to the irrigation networks of the plain of thessaloniki this area in all its extent has smooth relief plain area and high territorial homogeneity the basic physico chemical characteristics and drainage of soils have already been extensively reported mavropoulos 1992 mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 the basic characteristics of the network are nominal discharge of the pumping station 420 l s 1 with 4 units 104 l s 1 manometric head 60 m and total power 440 kw with 110 kw per unit nominal discharge of outlet was determined at 6 l s 1 and a downstream pressure of 35 m other characteristics of the network which concern this work are mentioned where it is firstly imposed their short presentation 2 2 design research the methodology to conduct the experiment was to collect all the necessary discrete and continuous data e g record of the values of the requested discharge of the pumping irrigation station ʃ9 inventory of the outlets of each hydrant and the number and the extent of the parcels served by each of them record of the nozzles shape and the measure of the operating pressures and the diameters of these in the various systems of irrigation inventory of the crops to verify the laws and evaluate both the demand and probability formulas during the peak irrigation from 11 july to 10 august these data related to the main irrigation conditions which affected the water demand and their combination regulated the required discharge and the operation of the network in general and they have already been mentioned in detail mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 2 3 calculation of probability p 2 3 1 calculation of probability p with clément methodology this is the methodology mentioned in paragraph 1 and for which an extensive analysis is made in paragraph 4 due to the significant variations in the value of the parameters of eq 1 between those of the experimental data and those of the design flow 2 3 2 new methods for determine the probability p the two new methodologies express each in its own way the probability p as it is formed under the actual operating conditions of an on demand irrigation network by the main factors irrigation interval and time of irrigation of the network crops these methodologies are the follows calculation of the working probability of an outlet based on the time between two consecutive demands calculation of the working probability of an outlet as a weighted mean of its values by irrigation interval class with weights corresponding to their respective frequencies the steps followed in each methodology to calculate the probability p of operation of an outlet are described herein in the immediately following analysis calculation of the probability p that an outlet is open with the time interval between two successive demands the probability p that the outlet is open is connected to the time interval t between two successive demands with the relationship 5 p e ω t this relationship is a component of mavropoulos s formula 1992 6 q n p c 0 5284 n p q c t a λ 3 and it can be numbered separately or it can be incorporated in the formula the graph of this relationship appears in fig 1 in this power function where ω is a constant positive number the p is defined for t in the domain from 0 to since to each value of t in this domain corresponds exactly one value of the function with range of values 0 1 that gets easily obtained and thus greatly aids the researcher the eq 6 is based on the hypothesis that all the outlets of the network are independent of each other and that they operate in a random manner during the network s operation in the peak period with a mean probability p of opening this hypothesis is true at any point of application of the formula leaving the outlets downstream of any point to function completely independently of one another the time interval t between two consecutive demands two consecutively opened outlets follows the typical exponential distribution and the demand discharge q is connected with it through the weibull distribution the parameter a that is showed in eq 6 is the shape parameter of the weibull distribution in order to simplify the arithmetic operations it is suggested that this parameter as parameter of the above formula takes the value α 2 or α 4 for network operation below 24 or equal to 24 h each day respectively and for p 0 5 for p 0 5 eq 6 is independent of the value of α for p 0 5 which rarely happens in practice and for network operation below 24 or equal to 24 h each day α 4 or α 2respectively the formula cannot take into account uncontrollable factors just like any other model that may have an impact on the demand phenomenon thus since the operation of the outlets in an on demand irrigation network is literally in the hands of the irrigators rather than the operator of the network it is introduced the correction factor λ 3 only in the second term of the second part of the model which represents exactly the generally non random behavior of the irrigators this coefficient have dimensions h 1 a so that the model can have dimensional homogeneity and it should take values 1 λ 3 2 depending on the personal sparing assessment made by the designer of each study the uncontrolled factors expressed by the coefficient λ 3 concern network interruptions that may cause a demand accumulation respectively to their duration the grower leaders that also may cause a demand accumulation proportionally to their number and influence collective outlets collective irrigation systems which lead to users interdependence that may lead to a more frequent use of the outlets etc which the model cannot take into account just like any other one in this relationship the time t between consecutive demands is regular in accordance with the standard of poisson process that was followed in the establishment of the demand formula whereas in reality this time is irregular and thus represented by the mean value therefore this eq 5 can be used in a practical way for the calculation of the working probability p of an outlet estimating statistically the time t in zones sub zones and sectors in a sufficiently large number of networks operating on demand during the peak water requirement period for this purpose in any irrigation network operating on demand which is chosen to be studied the outlets which operate in the day of research get recorded in order of appearance during the period of peak water requirements based on this recording series are calculated the intervals between two consecutive appearances in minutes for each day then the average of all time intervals gets calculated which will be used for estimate the mean probability of operation of each outlet in the considered day by eq 5 to use eq 5 as it is there must be a conversion of the measurement units from min to hour otherwise if one wants to use the time measurements t not for calculations but e g for half an hour he must use eq 5 in the form p e ω 2 t etc the mean of the working probability of an outlet of the experimental network during the period of peak plant water requirements arises as the mean of probability values of either only the days of peak water demand or from all of the days of the network operation during the considered period the first case is proposed when the daily fluctuations of the working probability of an outlet are large or very large while the second case when they are small or moderate as the researcher himself estimates it is noted that the factors that differentiate the time intervals t between two successive requests are mainly the different irrigation interval and the time of irrigation of the crops these variations are larger among the four irrigation interval classes small moderate large very large and less pronounced inside each irrigation interval class thus if e g in an on demand irrigation network exist crops of mostly small and moderate irrigation intervals then because of the frequent irrigations the intervals t between two successive requests should be expected to be significantly smaller t 1 h p 0 5 than those in case of crops of large and very large irrigation interval t 1 h p 0 5 therefore since the working probability p of an outlet is expressed by the exponential function 5 and the values of time t are mainly formed by the irrigation interval and time of irrigation another way for the calculation of p would be a relationship in which p is derived from the different combinations of the above factors for example another relationship alternative to eq 5 would be the one to give directly one and only one value of probability p that corresponds to one and only one sum of a combination of these factors p f σ from the many in practice and theoretically infinite combinations with defined merely devices for the describing special relations in a quantitative fashion of the irrigation interval and the irrigation time in an on demand pressurized irrigation network in this case these would be two methodologies that would each express each in its own distinct way the main factors that co modulate the working probability of an outlet in an on demand pressurized irrigation network this alternative to the above first methodology for the calculation of the working probability of an outlet is the following calculation of the probability that an outlet is open as weighted arithmetic mean philosophy of the methodology what is original about this methodology is that it accepts that at the outlet level in an on demand irrigation network the working probability of each outlet depends on the irrigation interval of the crops served by the outlet since the total of n equally likely irrigation days depends mainly from this interval thus knowing that the time day of irrigation of the crop served by each outlet of the network is one day out of total of n equally likely irrigation days it is possible to calculate its probability of operation with the classic definition and then calculate the mean probability p i 1 2 3 4 by category of irrigation interval of the network crops therefore because each category of irrigation interval of the crops in an on demand irrigation network has a different weight in the formation of the mean value of the probability p as resulting from what was said in the previous methodology the connection of the values p ι i 1 2 3 4 with weighs the corresponding frequencies f i i 1 2 3 4 gives the requested weighted arithmetic mean of p basis of the methodology the fundamental principles on which the methodology is based are as follows 1st the on demand pressurized irrigation network operates on a 24 h basis during the peak irrigation period to blunt the daily peaks of water demand especially when irrigation is applied by self propelled sprinklers or other self propelled irrigation systems unless it s not allowed due to natural causes 2nd all the days and hours of operation of the network during the peak water demand period are considered to be of the same preference for using the network by all irrigators for the irrigation of any crop of the network so the irrigation of each crop of the network may begin at any time of any day during the operation of the network and continues onto the next or the following days for large irrigation units without interruption irrigation with self propelled sprinkler systems yet in fact the irrigators do not have the same preference of utilization of the network during the 24 h period nor during the peak season of irrigation the different sprinkler systems self propelled sprinklers hand move gun type sprinkler hand move portable aluminum lateral systems etc the organization of irrigations at farm level by one s own or collective means the organization of irrigations at collective outlet level the presence of irrigation leaders the sensitivity of crops to strong winds and heatwaves as well as the personal life of the irrigators differentiate the beginning and the end of the irrigations for example according to mavropoulos 1992 under the greek conditions in the network s area of the pumping irrigation station σ9 during the two years 1988 89 almost all the irrigators avoided to start an irrigation from 00 00 until 06 00 while those using hand move gun type sprinkler and hand move portable aluminum lateral systems they preferred not to use the network at night usually from 21 00 to 07 00 bartzoudis 1989 relatively with the day of irrigation distinguishes the following three consecutive 24 h intervals a the bright part of the day during which the changes of the irrigation stops can be done without any problem e g from 06 00 to 21 00 for the conditions of the prefecture of pella where the network is located b the first night part of the day during which there can be only interruption of the irrigation e g from 21 00 to 24 00 c the second night part of the day during which it must be considered practically impossible to intervene in irrigation 3rd the irrigation interval of each crop in each irrigation unit depends on soil plant and climatic factors as well as agricultural and irrigation practices and is calculated relationship 7 r i r r f a θ p a w r d e t c θ r a w e t c with the exception of climate factors all others generally differ significantly from irrigation unit to irrigation unit shaping different irrigation intervals even for the same crop based on what has been said above in order to calculate the value of the p that will be used in the demand discharge formula 6 in the beginning the irrigation interval of each crop gets calculated in each irrigation unit in an on demand irrigation network either by eq 7 either it is determined empirically as it is usually done in practice then all the irrigation intervals of the crops of the network are grouped into four categories as it is usually the case in practice and at each of them get associated only the outlets of the network that serve the crops of the specific category of irrigation interval thus as mentioned above outlets that serve even the same crop can be classified into different groups of outlets based on the irrigation interval group which includes the irrigation interval of the crop in the various irrigation units when more than one crop coexists in an irrigation unit then the serving outlet is considered to serve only the crops occupying the largest area of the irrigation unit and their irrigation intervals can be classified into a single group so the outlet is classified in the corresponding outlet category if this cannot be done then it is assumed that the outlet serves only the crop that occupies the largest area of the irrigation unit and it is grouped in the outlet group corresponding to the irrigation interval of that crop in both cases mentioned above if the term largest area doesn t mean a significantly larger area than the rest of the irrigation unit but the crop irrigation intervals fall into a smaller group of irrigation interval the classification of the outlet in the corresponding group is fine otherwise for the sake of greater network safety it is considered that the outlet serves crops whose irrigation intervals are classified in a smaller group of irrigation interval the four categories of irrigation intervals of crops are generally the following 1 small irrigation interval around half week 4 days 2 moderate irrigation interval around a week class interval 4 10 days and class mark 7 days 3 large irrigation interval around two weeks class interval 11 17 days and class mark 14 days 4 very large irrigation interval around three weeks class interval 18 24 days and class mark 21 days based on the above the mean of the classical probabilities p ι i 1 2 3 4 of appearance of the respective four irrigation interval categories of crops gets associated with weights the outlets n ι i 1 2 3 4 serving the crops of the respective categories considering empirically and intuitively as equally likely only the few days around the end of each larger than the small irrigation interval and the hours of each one of these as it was described in the previous paragraph the probability p a of irrigation of the given crop according to the classical definition of probability is 8 p a n a n p random experiment establishment of the new relationship finding the mean of the values of irrigation probability of each irrigation interval group indicates several repetitions of a random experiment to which the discrete random variable p is connected and so it will be expected that the different values of p ι i 1 2 3 4 will appear with the respective percentages of frequency f i i 1 2 3 4 this random experiment can only be the following let s suppose there is an irrigation network operating on demand with n homogeneous outlets installed in the irrigation zone let s suppose now that a researcher determines from the outset the commonly accepted number of days for each irrigation interval and calculates the respective probabilities as above the researcher visits randomly the m open outlets not necessarily simultaneously operating varying in number almost every day m replications of the same random experiment in an irrigation network operating on demand during the period of peak water requirements in each visit independent random experiment he poses at the user of the functioning outlet knowing the irrigation schedule of his crops the following questions and notes his reasoned answers 1 why is the irrigation applied today the scheduled s day 2 why did you expedite e days the irrigation 3 why did you delay for d days the irrigation the aim is to calculate the mean of the irrigation probability values p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 for each category of crop irrigation interval for all the days of the peak irrigation period of the considered network in this way by knowing the number of outlets n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 that serve each crop category by the separate field irrigation schedules and associating them as weights with the corresponding values p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 gets calculated the weighted mean of the probability p of operation of an outlet in the network for this purpose the next steps are followed step 1 he notes the number of the equally likely irrigation days for each irrigation and for each day separately based on the answers he got i e n s 1 or n e 1 or n d 1 step 2 he classifies the number of equally likely irrigation days for each irrigation interval category for each day and he calculates the weighted mean of the number of equally likely irrigation days for each category step 3 he calculates the mean of the number of equally likely irrigation days for each irrigation interval category for all the days of the peak irrigation period based on the daily weighted mean and finally by using eq 8 he calculates the mean of the values of irrigation probability p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 of each category at the considered network it is suggested to transfer the raw data of the daily responses of the irrigators in a table as the following table 1 and to express the weighted mean of the equally likely irrigation days correct to 2 or 3 decimal places if it is taken into consideration that each one of the mean irrigation probabilities p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 coincides with the probability of operation of the outlets serving the crops of each irrigation interval class in the sense that the irrigation of a crop is identical with the operation of the outlet that serves it then if each day of the peak irrigation period it is given to each value p ι i 1 2 3 4 a different weight expressed by the weights m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 then the weighted arithmetic mean of the probability that an outlet is open in the network is 9 p m 1 p 1 m 2 p 2 m 3 p 3 m 4 p 4 m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 i 1 4 m ι p ι i 1 4 m ι σ m p m when natural phenomena such as water scarcity strong winds heatwaves with duration intensity and frequency that do not allow to irrigate with sprinkler systems for about two hours or more each day during the peak irrigation period impose network operation below 24 h each day then the second part of eq 9 must be multiplied by the factor 1 r where r network operating hours 24 h so eq 9 is written in the form 10 p m 1 p 1 m 2 p 2 m 3 p 3 m 4 p 4 m 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 1 r 1 r i 1 4 m ι p ι i 1 4 m ι 1 r σ m p m the eq 10 for all the peak period of irrigation and for all of the outlets of the network becomes 11 p n 1 p 1 n 2 p 2 n 3 p 3 n 4 p 4 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 1 r 1 r i 1 4 n ι p ι i 1 4 n ι 1 r σ n p n when all the probabilities p i p constant for r 1 the result is p p at this point it should be pointed out that the above random experiment is indeed rational but to be also effective the following conditions should exist 1st all the individual irrigation schedules of the network crops for each crop and plot case separately should be developed by the producers themselves as each one perceives the farm level irrigation water management evaluating all the factors related to the irrigation of its crops soil crop climate irrigation method with or without help from an irrigation specialist these irrigation schedules for each crop and plot should be recorded and be at the disposal of both the producers and the researcher 2nd all the irrigation dates of each crop in each plot of the network should be recorded with their start time by the researcher 3rd all the days of rushing or delay of an irrigation should be recorded by the researcher for each crop and plot case separately along with the reasons that imposed such a modification when all the above conditions cannot exist then the only way for someone to obtain the necessary experimental data for the application of eq 11 is described in the following paragraph 3 the eq 11 by replace the n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 outlets that are used as weights with the relative frequencies f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 of the extents of the network with crops of corresponding irrigation intervals takes the form 12 p n 1 p 1 n 2 p 2 n 3 p 3 n 4 p 4 n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 1 r 1 r i 1 4 n ι p ι i 1 4 n ι 1 r σ n p n for this relative frequency fi the following properties apply 0 fi 1 where i 1 2 3 4 and f1 f2 f3 f4 1 which is considered sufficient to associate the classical probabilities with their respective appearance frequencies which are used as weights it should be underlined that with regard to the operation utilization coefficient of the network r according to the first principle of the methodology the pressurized irrigation network operates on a 24 h basis r 1 irrespectively of any needs and desires raised by the producers it is a critical factor which requires the careful evaluation of its parameters natural causes only before it is introduced into the relation 11 or in its form 12 for the design of networks operating on free demand the eq 11 or the form 12 is an original method for the calculation of the probability p of particular importance which appears to approximate sufficiently well the reality with or even without experimental data indeed in the conditions under which the crops irrigation interval and time which have the greatest role in shaping the probability p are defined in an on demand irrigation network the time of irrigation never has the same starting point some irrigations are applied on the predefined days other earlier and other later than the predetermined in this way it is really favored the expected randomization so that a simultaneous operation of all outlets doesn t occur it is also noted that another advantage of the relationship 11 or its form 12 of particular importance in the project design stage is that it also reveals the limits of the construction cost that are acceptable for the design of an on demand irrigation network under real conditions beyond which its place necessarily takes a network operated by rotation it is finally noted that in case that the irrigations get realized based on the irrigation schedule then eq 11 or the form 12 for p ι 1 i 1 2 3 4 gives p 1 which is fully in line with the basic property of probabilities 0 p 1 and eq 11 gets a complete axiomatic likely theoretical value such an event p 1 can happen but under conditions that are extremely unlikely to occur almost impossible in practice in the irrigation zone perimeter of a pressurized irrigation network operating on demand 3 results 3 1 calculation of the probability p 3 1 1 calculation of the probability p with eq 1 the results of the calculations of the probability p with eq 1 during the peak irrigation periods 1988 89 for each 10 day separately are shown in table 2 mavropoulos 1992 with the survey s additional information relating to the values of its parameters additional information specific continuous irrigation discharge d the average specific continuous irrigation discharge d 0 72 l s 1 ha 1 was calculated for the case of concentration of the most demanding crops alfalfa etc zeris and sotiriades 1976 and not of the prevalence of a crop such as cotton in fact in the irrigation zone of the network the cultivation of cotton was predominating with 86 31 and 83 89 in 1988 and 1989 respectively while the remaining percentage constitute the crops peas sugar beet maize tobacco vegetables alfalfa industrial tomato peach and whet in 1988 to which maize vegetables and soybean crops were added in 1989 after harvest of the winter wheat in the evapotranspiration of the crops had also contributed the groundwater table which was calculated using the field water balance and was found 26 20 and 27 01 for the years 1988 and 1989 while for the year 1990 was used the average 26 60 of these years reducing respectively the crop water requirements irrigation unit sc the net area is 270 ha which according to the local land reclamation organization l l r o of giannitsa which is responsible for the network is divided into 150 plots that belong to 271 owners so the irrigation unit instead of the design s s c 3 ha with 1 2 or 3 main parcels and not more than 4 or 5 was 2 329 2 331 and 2 232 ha for the years 1988 1989 and 1990 respectively in accordance with the structure of the crops and the number of active outlets 113 in 1988 and 1989 and 110 in 1990 discharge of an outlet c the discharge of an outlet instead of 6 l s 1 with flow limiting device of the study was measured 9 7 l s 1 and 10 6 l s 1 without flow limiting device in 1988 and 1989 respectively for the following reasons flow limiters have been arbitrarily removed from the outlets by the network users in order to be able to apply water to their crops with whichever irrigation system they had chosen to use thus the discharge of each outlet was provided in accordance with the irrigation system with which each time the water was applied to the served crops producers were applying irrigation water in their crops preferably with large self propelled sprinklers with a frequency of 80 4 in 1988 and 78 8 in 1989 while the others had a frequency of hand move gun type sprinkler 15 2 and 13 6 hand move portable aluminum lateral systems 4 4 and 7 6 in 1988 and 1989 respectively however the operation of the network was satisfactory thanks to the very small inclinations of the axes of the conduits around 2 for the upstream branches and 4 for the downstream branches and the discipline among the users who by satisfying adequately the hydraulic conditions discharge and pressure of the self propelled sprinklers were contributing to the smooth operation of the network on a 24 h a day basis percentage of outlets that was monitored the outlet monitoring percentage was 41 6 and 52 2 in 1988 and 1989 respectively out of a total of 59 hydrants of the network with 113 outlets 54 of two outlets and 5 of one outlet all with four outlets specifications duration of operation of the network during the peak irrigation period the network was designed for an 18 h operation but it worked 24 h a day thanks to the self propelled sprinklers with which the irrigation water was mainly applied to the crops of the network 3 1 2 calculation of the probability p with eq 5 raw data for the application of eq 5 should be available the recorded values of the exact opening time of each monitored outlet in the order of their occurrence but it wasn t possible to obtain such data because any records that weren t recorded by the researcher himself due to lack of time they were supposed to be obtained by the irrigators who for their own reasons didn t respond to the researcher s request 3 1 3 calculation of the probability p with eq 11 for the application of eq 11 the following steps are needed calculation of the probability of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops and selection or calculation of the number of outlets serving each category of irrigation interval of the network crops calculation of the probability of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops the calculation of the irrigation probability of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops is based on the number of possible equally likely irrigation days of the respective category a calculation of the possible equally likely irrigation days for each category of irrigation interval of the network crops this number of possible equally likely irrigation days is taken from the results of the random experiment according to what has been said in the paragraph calculation of the probability that an outlet is open as weighted arithmetic mean but the conditions for the application of the random experiment didn t exist in the region of the research work in this area each producer at the start of each irrigation period evaluates all the factors related to the irrigation and defines the farm level irrigation strategy that he will follow based mainly on the agro technical training empirical knowledge and perception that he has of the irrigations and not on measurements of the relative physical parameters he plans a draft irrigation schedule for each crop and plot case separately he doesn t noted it anywhere but he just keeps it in mind and constantly changes it during the irrigation period based on the status of plants and soil the prevailing weather conditions etc the above thinking process of farmers that is common everywhere in greece is the one that modifies the network operation conditions so that it gets adapted at each moment to the requirements of the users who want to apply the individual irrigation schedules of their crops whenever and for as long as each of them decides additionally the majority of the producers is characterized by suspicion works in an unorganized way behaves superficially etc under those circumstances there cannot be personalized convincing answers referring to whether the irrigation was made the predefined day or there was a certain expedite or delay and why in order to solve this problem the researcher found with difficulties admittedly and spoke with producers who were distinguished for their reliability for their diligence and their seriousness on the whole issue of the development of an irrigation strategy of the network crops from these discussions he concluded that the number of equally likely irrigation days for each category of irrigation interval of the network crops seems to be as follows for small irrigation interval around half a week the irrigation is applied the scheduled day for moderate irrigation interval around a week the irrigation is applied the scheduled day or one day earlier for large irrigation interval around two weeks the irrigation is applied one to two days earlier or one day later than planned and for very long irrigation interval around three weeks the irrigation is applied one to two or even three days earlier or one to two days later than planned b calculation of the irrigation probability of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops considering empirically and intuitively as equally likely only few days as described above and all the hours of each one of them the irrigation probability p ι 1 i 1 2 3 4 of each category of irrigation interval of the network crops according to eq 8 is for n 1 and n a 1 p 1 1 1 1 for small irrigation interval for n 2 and n a 1 p 2 1 2 0 50 for moderate irrigation interval for n 4 and n a 1 p 3 1 4 0 25 for large irrigation for n 6 and n a 1 p 4 1 6 0 17 for very large irrigation interval selection or calculation of the number of outlets serving the crops of each category of irrigation interval of the network this number in the absence of irrigation schedules of the network crops coincides with the frequency of each irrigation interval of the crops as resulting from the grouping of records of irrigation interval of different network crops a selection of the recorded irrigation intervals who had been applied at the network crops and classification by category raw data from the recording of the execution date of each irrigation made by using the outlets that were being monitored by the researcher the irrigation interval that was applied r irr α at the network crops as recorded in chronological order is given in table 3 frequency table the data grouping in table 3 on the base of the four categories of irrigation interval gives the next table 4 the data grouping as it was said is done in order to cover the absence of the irrigation schedules of the network crops that the methodology requires to be classified in four categories in reality some irrigations were indeed applied according to the program that had in mind the farmers especially those of small or moderate irrigation interval and therefore they were grouped aright while others were applied earlier or later and therefore they were grouped in a smaller or a greater irrigation interval of course there is an exception in the case of small irrigation interval that cannot become smaller and of very large that cannot become larger but we can accept that the fluctuations of the number of outlets in each irrigation interval category within the limits of the population of network s outlets affect minimally the value of the probability p that an outlet is open b calculation of the number of outlets per category of irrigation interval of the network crops according to what was said above this number coincides with the frequency of each irrigation interval category of the different crops of the network table 4 however since the frequencies of table 4 are derived from a portion of the population of the outlets of the network namely from two random samples one from each experimental year since the cotton cultivation was predominant in the irrigation zone of the network as mentioned in paragraph 3 1 1 since the two random samples were part of the 41 6 and 52 2 of the outlets population of the network in 1988 and 1989 respectively as noted in paragraph 3 1 1 without significant error it can be accepted that in practice they represent the entire population of the network s outlets for the irrigation of all of the crops the conclusion is that for the year 1988 the 3 outlets for large and the 1 for very long irrigation interval can be extrapolated to 85 outlets for large and 28 for very long irrigation interval and for the 1989 the 2 outlets for moderate irrigation interval the 4 large and the 1 for very long irrigation interval can be extrapolated to 32 outlets for moderate 65 large and 16 for very long irrigation interval calculation of the weighted mean of the probability p that an outlet is open therefore eq 11 taking into account the number n 1 0with coefficient weight p 1 1 n 2 0 with coefficient p 2 0 5 n 3 85 with coefficient p 3 0 25 and n 4 28with coefficient p 4 0 17 and with r 24 h r 24 h r 1 gives for the year 1988 a value for the probability p of operation of an outlet equal to p 85 0 25 28 0 17 113 1 1 0 23 in the same way the probability p that an outlet is open calculated by using the values n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 for the year 1989 is equal to p 32 0 5 65 0 25 16 0 17 113 1 1 0 31 3 2 calculation of the peak flow by the demand formulas according to the first formula of clément 13 q n p c u 1 n p q c 2 with which were

6 3 4 concise comparison table of the experimental data in order to facilitate the whole analysis in the next paragraph 4 and to decide which methodology of calculation of the probability p the proposed one or those of clément is the best to be used for predicting flows in on demand irrigation networks it is considered opportune to form the follow table 6 that shows the contrast of the different methodologies using the experimental data 4 discussion 4 1 probability p 4 1 1 calculation of the probability p with clément methodology the experimental procedure seems to verify the validity of the theory of probability in on demand irrigation networks mavropoulos 1992 mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 but the calculation of the probability p with the eq 1 created doubts for its accuracy these doubts arise from the fact that while the probability p in accordance with the design of the project zeris and sotiriades 1976 and with what has been said in paragraph 3 1 1 was calculated by the eq 1 for the peak water use month july as follows p d e s i g n 0 72 30 0 75 6 0 48 0 50 contrariwise for the first two years of the triennial experimental work this probability for the same month of peak water use calculated by the same relationship as shown in table 2 was p 1988 0 126 and p 1989 0 111 it was observed a large variation fall in the value of the probability p that an outlet is open from that of the project s design due to the significant modification in the value of all the terms of the second part of eq 1 during the month of peak water demand such a downward trend of the value of the probability p that an outlet is open in an on demand pressurized irrigation network raises questions about the rational approach of the calculation of the probability p with eq 1 there is a need for a penetrating look into the exact meaning of the concept of probability p in on demand pressurized irrigation networks for this purpose it is first necessary to demonstrate whether eq 1 is valid or not and if so it is required a detailed examination of all the criteria based on which the values s c r c and d are determined for the calculation of the probability p that an outlet is open in order to avoid such large differences between assumptions and reality the eq 1 is derived from the classical definition of probability clément 1966 14 p t t therefore eq 1 is not unfounded but in the theory of probability the classical definition of probability refers to a finite sample space and is based on the concept of equally likely results of an experiment which is not sufficiently clear therefore there is a problem with the case of equally likely so one must investigate the conditions under which this method of calculation of the probability p of operation of each outlet is applied so the words equally likely may not be so vague by examining eq 1 one observes that the values given in the parameters that get involved express personal assessments of the designer in his attempt to form a value of p such that the designed network can be adapted as best as possible in economic operational and agronomic terms in the conditions of the serving farms thus the designer by basing the calculation of the probability p on the extent of the irrigation unit s c and the discharge of an outlet c which he himself defines doesn t keep up with reality as this reality is shaped by the water management at irrigation unit level by each user because these parameters are not related to the probability p but to the duration of irrigation application t irr as arises by the following analysis for example let s suppose that eq 1 is applied in the network s area of the pumping irrigation station σ9 under the following two circumstances the designer in order to reduce the network s construction cost sub triples the number of irrigation hydrants tripling the size of the irrigation unit the theory of probability would not allow it because p d s c r c 0 072 90 0 75 6 1 44 1 w h i c h i s a b s u r d the designer in order to meet the demands of network users triples the nominal discharge of the outlets to sub triple the time of irrigation of the irrigation unit the probability that an outlet is open would fall in the value of p d s c r c 0 072 30 0 75 18 0 16 w h i c h f a r m e r s d o n o t u n d e r s tan d this means generalizing that by increasing the size of the nominal discharge c the probability p gets reduced but in the users mind is the duration of irrigation t irr that gets reduced and not the probability p which can t be perceived by the users the users without knowing anything about formulas perceive rightly the reality and act accordingly in fact the basic parameters c and s c of the design of on demand irrigation networks are related to the duration of the irrigation with a sprinkler system as it is simply shown by the relationship 15 t i r r 10 e a f a θ p a w r d s c c and not to the time of irrigation that is the moment when an outlet opens as eq 1 shows neither eq 14 from which was derived eq 1 helps to investigate the aspects of the problem of the calculation of the probability p in fact in this definition the values t and t are determined beforehand without experimentation and all the results are considered equally likely if indeed all the outlets in an on demand irrigation network have equally probabilities of operation at the time t then this definition leads to the correct answer but is it possible in a random experiment of this nature that the results are indeed always equally likely no in no case all the days on which the network operates cannot be equally likely for any outlet of the network as it will be shown in the following analysis with the help of eq 3 from the above analysis arises that the calculation of the probability p with the classical definition of probability is not fully defined it appears that there are other factors that are not taken into account until today and are related to the probability p it is necessary if possible to reveal all the factors and the ways in which they jointly shape the average probability of operation of each outlet these factors if they cannot be defined in terms easily understandable they should be explained and illustrated as simple as possible in this effort of analysis and investigation of the phenomenon of the working probability of an outlet particular contribution has the following relationship mavropoulos 1992 3 p t i r r r i r r which is equivalent to eq 1 and can also occur from the relation roscher 1973 2 p λ λ μ in fact considering e g an outlet serving a crop and interpreting the terms of eq 3 t irr which is the duration of irrigation application eq 15 and r irr which is the maximum irrigation interval of the crop calculated by eq 7 one observes the following in irrigation practice after an irrigation no farmer does even think about applying the next one if with the passage of days the end of the maximum irrigation interval determined by himself isn t approaching then and only then without hesitation he expedites or with great caution delays the application of irrigation according to the estimations that he makes for the status of plants and soil the weather conditions etc therefore the days which may be regarded as equally likely to irrigate a crop is clearly less than those of each empirical maximum irrigation interval it is almost always the predetermined days to be chosen when the irrigation interval is small and a few days around the end of each larger than the small irrigation interval for many growers neither all the hours of each day are equally likely for irrigation the above irrigation concept and practices of water management at irrigation unit level by each user are widespread among all irrigators at least in greece it s a general behavior of the irrigators which varies from region to region depending mainly on the soil and climate in each area the cultivation techniques applied the agro technical training and the empirical knowledge and perception about the irrigations thus eq 3 therefore also the equivalents 1 2 and 14 does not give solutions in the real world of irrigations because it greatly increases the total of the number of possible equally likely days for crop irrigation equating it with the maximum irrigation interval and thus reduces the value of the working probability p of an outlet 4 1 2 calculation of the probability p with the new methodologies concerning the new methodologies the mean probability p gets calculated simply and economically as it is formed by the main factors irrigation interval and time of irrigation of the crops in an on demand irrigation network under actual network operating conditions in each experimental year the above factors express in particular the various combinations of crop and soil characteristics under the prevailing climatic conditions in the irrigation zone of the network as well as also the cultivation and irrigation practices applied within the irrigation zone each experimental year therefore particular importance have only the experimental data of the years in which among the crops of the network s irrigation zone there is a concentration of high demand crops during the peak consumption period as well as those of the years of domination in this zone of a single crop of no low water requirements the selection of the probability p that best suits the under design on demand irrigation network is based on the probable high concentration of the most demanding crops in the expected cropping pattern within the irrigation zone under the zone s soil and climatic conditions but also under the agricultural conditions and irrigation practices applied in the area for this selection it is important to map the physical characteristics and properties of the soil of the network s irrigation zone texture profile depth layers structure at the level of an irrigation unit where crops of different characteristics are expected to be installed upper parts of structure of the crops stages of crop development depth and spread of the roots under similar or different cultivation and irrigation practices this information under the prevailing climatic conditions of the area of the network are the one that determines the irrigation interval and the time of irrigation of the crops as these two irrigation parameters get perceived by the producers to understand how the farmers perceive these two pillars that co shape the probability p it is a good idea for the researcher to find and talk with discerning reliable and experienced producers about the whole issue of the water management at irrigation unit level for crop irrigation in the designed network thus the designer will be able to assume which could be the frequency distributions of crop irrigation intervals taking into account the depth of soil and crop roots the peak season of irrigation in the area of the studied network and which could be the equally likely irrigation days in each irrigation interval thus he can approach satisfactory well the reality by applying the relationship 11 even without experimental data it just is enough to compare the irrigation interval which also closely influences the time of irrigation that he determines himself from the values of the relevant parameters that are available to those determined by the producers according to their own criteria this is the only way to understand the behavior of irrigators concerning the use of the outlets operated or under design in on demand irrigation networks in whose hands lies or will lie respectively its operation it would be desirable if such a mapping of the irrigation zone or at least some sort of detailed soil survey existed for the experimental networks if an irrigation zone presents important soil differences over large areas then these should be separated in irrigation sub zones or sectors based on the soil depth shallow moderately deep deep very deep and on the basic soil textural groups sandy soils loamy soils clayey soils concerning the results from the application of eq 11 for the calculation of the probability p from table 6 arises that for the period from july 20 to august 8 1988 it was calculated in p 1988 0 23 for the period from july 16 to august 4 1989 in p 1989 0 31 while for the same peak water requirement periods it was calculated with eq 1 for the year 1988 in p 1988 0 117 for the year 1989 in p 1988 0 115 contrary to the design value for the peak month of water requirement july which was calculated with eq 1 in p d e s i g n 0 50 it was observed i e a very large variation fall in the values of the probability p calculated from the experimental data from that of the project design derived by the same eq 1 this fall in value of probability p is fully justified in the previous discussion above about clément s methodology eq 1 and confirms the conclusion of the discussion that it reduces the value of the probability p under actual operating conditions in networks operating on demand yet how much as far as it concerns the proposed methodology eq 11 we can observe that the value of p for 1988 is twice that of clément s 2 0 117 0 234 and for 1989 it is about three times higher 3 0 115 0 345 but with these elevated values does it approach and how much the actual value of the probability p or does it exceed it whether or not the proposed methodology eq 11 approximates the reality it will become apparent from the comparison of the discharges observed during the three year research work and those calculated by the demand discharge formulas by the first of clément and that of mavropoulos this claim arises from the fact that the experimental data from this research work showed that the theory of probabilities has validity in the irrigation networks operating on demand mavropoulos 1992 mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 4 2 discharges requested from the pumping irrigation station σ9 and calculated by the demand discharge formulas of clément and mavropoulos according to what has been said above for the calculation of the probability p with clément s methodology no additional comment is needed but concerning our second methodology one observes the following the differences between the discharge values 189 248 that were observed and 370 that was calculated by the formula of mavropoulos for the year 1988 and between 254 245 and 523 respectively for 1989 at the time intervals shown in the comparative table 6 vary widely from 33 to 49 and from 52 to 53 2 in the first and second comparison respectively such large differences raise questions about the application of the proposed method of probability calculation eq 11 and require investigation of their causes these differences occurred due to the following reasons 1st avoidance of the third and final irrigation of cotton the cultivation of cotton was dominant in the area as mentioned in paragraph 3 1 1 and many cotton growers avoided carrying out the third and last irrigation of this crop as it s shown in table 3 the avoidance stems from the fear of a probable delay in the maturation of bools or of their exposure to the pink worm and from the risk of rot if after the irrigation ensue rains a danger that grows prohibitively as time passes from the 2 nd irrigation always in july so they deactivate their outlets decreasing according to the number of closed outlets the requested supply by the pumping station consequently the number of the outlets for operation is much smaller than the considered n 2nd the small duration of irrigation application of the crops the irrigation units were small as shown in table 2 and many of them were further fragmented as arises from what was said in paragraph 3 1 1 so since the net area of 270 ha of the irrigation pumping station σ9 was divided into 150 plots that belonged to 271 owners each owner had an average of about 1 ha the duration of irrigation application of such small parcels is short and therefore reduces to a certain extent the number of simultaneously functioning outlets since they neither have a common start nor a common end of operation this reduction also entails a corresponding reduction in the required supply from the pumping station of the network 3rd the contribution of the groundwater table to the evapotranspiration of crops the dissimilar contribution of the groundwater table to the evapotranspiration of the crops of the network slightly alters their requirements in irrigation water from one outlet to another this reduces the duration of irrigation application in each irrigation system depending on the size of the contribution therefore those who irrigate crops that are most favored by this contribution put the irrigation systems off sooner and thus reduce to some extent the number of simultaneously operating outlets with the same effect as above from the above typical calculation procedure of the probability p with experimental data as shown in paragraph 3 1 3 and the necessary clarifications even without quantitative data arises that the new method for the calculation of p approximates sufficiently well the reality this efficiency owes to the fact that the calculation of p is made by using the irrigation interval and time of irrigation i e by combining two coefficients which express the major soil plant climatic agro technical etc factors which have impact on the water distribution on free demand in contrast eq 1 equivalent of 2 3 and 14 fails precisely because it ignores many of the above factors as explained in detail in this paper as regards the differences between the discharges that occurred at the time intervals shown in the comparative table 6 and those calculated with the first formula of clément they fluctuate less than in the case of application of mavropoulos s formula this is fully expected from those who know the behavior of these demand formulas particularly from what has already been extensively explained mavropoulos and lotidi 2016 finally it appears from table 6 that the average maximum flow rate requested by the pumping station per two hours during the peak irrigation period did not exceed 62 262 l s 1 of the nominal pumping supply 420 l s 1 this was due to 1st the avoidance of the third and final irrigation of cotton 2nd the small duration of irrigation application of the crops and 3rd the contribution of the groundwater table to the evapotranspiration of crops for the reasons mentioned above but also due to 4th the application of water 24 h a day basis with self propelled sprinklers which as shown in paragraph 3 1 1 were the mainly used irrigation system in the area of the network and normalized the water demand peaks instantaneous and daily the whole discussion in the light of critical analysis showed as better the proposed methodology eq 11 for predicting the flows in on demand irrigation networks which approaches satisfactorily the reality versus clément s methodology eq 1 that deviates greatly from it 5 conclusions in this paper it is proposed eq 11 or its form 12 for the calculation of the probability p that an outlet is open in the design stage of on demand irrigation networks it is sufficient for the designer to have in his hands a soil survey and mapping of the irrigation zone of the studied network at the level of the irrigation unit in order to know the soil s physical characteristics and properties profile depth layers structure texture etc the eq 11 was established on the investigation of the factors irrigation interval and time of irrigation which co modulate the probability p under the empirical management of the irrigation water at the level of the irrigation unit of the network and it calculates the p as the weighted mean of its mean values by category of irrigation interval with weights the respective number of operating outlets this methodology at the project design stage also reveals the acceptable limits of the construction cost of a network under real conditions beyond of which limits it gets preferred a network operated by rotation the eq 11 can also be used in a simple and economical way to obtain experimental data from on demand irrigation networks to calculate the probability p for the creation of historical databases the experimental results showed that the proposed methodology eq 11 approaches sufficiently well the reality in opposition to that of clément s eq 1 which deviates from it the critical analysis of clément s methodology revealed that in the design stage for the definition of p with eq 1 the parameters sc and c are not related to the probability p but to the duration of irrigation application the eq 5 is based on the time between two successive requests and can be used only for the creation of historical databases in a simple and economical way as well as eq 11 these two proposals open up a new field of research in on demand pressurized irrigation networks to devise a better model for the working probability p of an outlet funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
11429,the effect of shallow and deep roots on compensatory growth of potted corn seedlings during post drought rewatering was investigated on the basis of leaf cytokinin induced by roots two treatment conditions namely root cutting and nitrate no3 addition were used in the study results showed that drought stress retained corn growth in the absence of root cutting rewatering increased the net photosynthetic rates of corn and induced compensatory growth however under root cutting no compensatory growth occurred in the rewatered corns in the absence of root cutting significantly higher zeatin riboside zr concentrations in the leaves and xylem saps were recorded under rewatering treatment than under wet treatment however these results were not observed under root cutting owing to loss of deep roots furthermore corns with deep roots added with no3 showed significantly higher zr concentration in the leaves and xylem saps than those with shallow roots added with no3 high leaf cytokinin concentration is known to induce rapid corn growth thus no compensatory growth occurred during post drought rewatering in corns with few deep roots likely due to lack of leaf cytokinin enhancement induced by deep roots keywords corn cytokinin compensatory growth during post drought rewatering seedling stage root cutting deep roots 1 introduction plants adapt to drought stress by reducing growth and then accelerating growth when sufficient water becomes available consequently the reduced growth is offset or even surpassed under sufficient water supply this is central to the theory of plant compensatory growth during post drought rewatering given this theory regulated deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation technologies have been extensively used in water saving agriculture cui et al 2009 pèrez pèrez et al 2008 ballester et al 2013 intrigliolo et al 2013 shao et al 2010 therefore compensatory growth of post drought rewatering is highly important for water saving agriculture many scholars have explored the mechanism underlying crop compensatory growth during post drought rewatering in cotton wheat maize and kentucky bluegrass various factors including photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance fertiliser use and anti aging properties have been found to play a role luo et al 2016 wang et al 2011 yao et al 2012 ghahfarokhi et al 2015 xu et al 2011 some studies have revealed that cytokinin is closely related to plant growth photosynthesis anti aging leaf stomatal conductance and nitrogen fertiliser use rubio wilhelmi et al 2014 tamaki and mercier 2007 lu et al 2009 aloia et al 2011 therefore exploring the mechanism of cytokinin induced compensatory growth may be a worthwhile endeavor indeed wang et al 2016a studied plant growth hormones and found that leaf cytokinin levels which are influenced greatly by roots contribute to corn compensatory growth during post drought rewatering kirkegaard et al 2007 conducted a field experiment on wheat water use and demonstrated that a relatively small amount of subsoil water is highly valuable for grain yield liu et al 2015 investigated the combined effects of soil moisture and physical parameters on winter wheat production similarly the group observed that roots growing in deep soil layers improve the water use efficiency as well as drought resistance of winter wheat however zhou et al 2009 found that two ridges and furrows mulched by one plastic film with maize planted in the furrow could increase maize yield this observation was associated with enhanced topsoil moisture in the planting zone li et al 1999 also reported that plastic film mulching could partly increase the yield of spring wheat because of increased moisture in the upper 5 cm of the soil roots in the topsoil or deep soil both hold a close relationship with crop water use however no study has explored the relationship between crop compensatory growth mechanism of post drought rewatering and topsoil or deep soil roots investigating the effect of cytokinin on corn growth on the basis of shallow and deep roots should provide further insight into this mechanism in the present study corn zea mays l at the seedling stage was selected for studying compensatory growth of post drought rewatering in pots corn the world s third largest and china s principal crop consumes large quantities of water for this reason corn productivity in northern china is usually constrained by water shortage augmenting water use efficiency is the key to improving corn production in the region to achieve our research object which is to determine the effect of deep roots on corn compensatory growth of post drought rewatering on the basis of leaf cytokinin induced by roots root cutting in corns was conducted to allow shallow roots to secret cytokinin then we compared the effects of cytokinins secreted by shallow roots and the whole roots on corn growth of post drought rewatering to determine the connection between cytokinins secreted by deep roots and compensatory growth concentrations of gibberellic acid ga3 abscisic acid aba indole 3 acetic acid iaa and zeatin riboside zr in the leaves zr and aba concentrations in the xylem saps and the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance gs were also determined to attain our goal 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the study was carried out in the experimental farm of henan university of science and technology the farm 34 32 n 112 16 e altitude 138 m was located in luoyang city of henan province and experiences a warm temperate continental monsoon climate its annual rainfall and temperature are 601 mm and 14 2 c respectively the corn cultivar zhendan 958 which is widely planted in china was used in the study because of its high drought resistance and wide adaptability given their rapid growth and easily detectable growth variation the present study adopted corns at the seedling stage as test material to investigate the compensatory growth mechanism specifically root growth in corn seedlings is also easily detectable and controlled the study was conducted under a rain shelter with potting filled with sand and two experimental setups which involved root cutting exp 1 and no3 addition exp 2 were prepared sand was employed to allow water solution to permeate easily and rinse the mineral nutrient content the pots used in exp 1 were 20 0 cm in pot mouth diameter 16 5 cm in pot floor diameter 22 3 cm in height and 20 cm in sand height meanwhile nested pots were used for exp 2 with pot b placed inside pot a fig 1 pot a was 28 23 and 14 cm in pot mouth diameter pot floor diameter and height respectively by contrast the floor of pot b was removed and the pot mouth diameter pot floor diameter and height were 22 12 and 14 5 cm respectively the filled sand in pot a had a height of 10 cm the sand height was 12 cm when measured from the top sand level in pot b to the floor of pot a a 4 cm height separated pot b from the floor of pot a twelve evenly distributed small holes were punched through the floor of pot a to allow water to flow through in exp 1 and 2 the pots were watered daily with modified hoagland solution to ensure normal corn growth the modified hoagland solution contained 5 mm k 8 mm ca 1 mm p 1 mm mg 89 μm fe 18 μm mn 0 9 μm cu 1 75 μm zn and 15 mm no3 in april 2017 a total of 200 and 150 pots were prepared for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively the experiment was carried out from april 20 to june 3 for a total of 44 days on 20 april six corn seeds each were planted in both exp 1and exp 2 after 6 days seedlings emerged then 6 days after emergence only two seedlings with strong growth were selected from the two setups and the other seedlings were pulled out the two remaining seedlings were grown for 12 days and 36 and 27 pots with uniformly grown seedlings were selected for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively 2 1 1 exp 1 design in exp 1 the 36 pots were divided into four groups with 9 pots each two growth periods of drought stress and rewatering were established in these pots for 10 days each at the beginning of rewatering the corn seedlings were at 28 days after seedling emergence in the drought stress period the first and second groups received sufficient water supply and the third and fourth groups were under drought stress in the rewatering period all groups received sufficient water supply at the end of the drought stress period root cutting was conducted in the second and fourth groups thus exp 1 involved four treatments of 9 pots each designated as follows 1 wetness wt 2 wetness with cut roots wc 3 rewatering dt and 4 rewatering with cut roots dc root cutting was performed in order to decrease root length by removing relatively deep roots at the bottom of the pot the procedure was performed as follows the pots were cut transversely through roughly the middle into halves using a thin back knife with 10 cm sand height in the upper half and 10 cm sand height in the lower half fig 2 during root cutting the pots were kept stable to avoid sand disturbance and then the upper and lower halves of roots were kept in place using transparent adhesive tape wetness and drought stress were obtained by weighing and adding water to maintain the soil water content swc at 75 80 and 50 55 respectively of field water capacity fwc from 6 00 am to 9 00 pm the pots were weighed to determine swc every 5 h when swc dropped below 75 of fwc water was added to maintain the water content at 75 80 of the fwc to induce drought stress no water was added to the soil on the first 2 3 days to allow the soil water to dissipate then the pots were weighed and water was used to maintain the swc at 50 55 of fwc according to xiong et al 2007 the swc at each treatment hour was calculated on the basis of the following formula 1 1 s w c w t w d w e w p w d fwc 100 where wt is the temporary whole pot weight wd is the net weight of dried sand in the pot we is the weight of empty pot and wp is the estimated fresh weight fw of all plants in the pot the estimated fw of all plants in one pot was determined inadvance on extra pots in each test period pn tr and gs were measured in each treatment at the end of the drought stress period and at 2 4 6 8 and 10 days after rewatering at the end of the drought stress period and at 5 and10 d after rewatering three pots from each treatment were taken to the laboratory with the purpose of measuring biomass plant hormones no3 content leaf water content the average daily temperatures were 21 c 24 c and 28 c from seeding to the beginning of the drought stress period during drought stress period and during rewatering period respectively during the rewatering period it was sunny most of the time but some days were cloudy towards the end 2 1 2 exp 2 design in exp 2 the selected 27 pots were divided into three groups with 9 pots each at the end of the drought stress period of exp 1 all pots in exp 2 were rinsed with distilled water to remove any trace of inorganic nitrogen in the sand then all exp 2 groups received sufficient water supply like in exp 1 for 10 days which was designated as the nitrate addition period similar with exp 1 at the beginning of nitrate addition the age of corn seedlings were 28 days after seedling emergence during this nitrate addition period pots a and b in the first group were both watered with modified hoagland solution without no3 in the second group modified hoagland solutions with and without 15 mm no3 were added to pots b and a respectively in the third group modified hoagland solutions with and without 15 mm no3 were prepared and added to pots a and b respectively therefore three treatments of wetness were obtained from exp 2 and these treatments included 1 no addition of no3 to the roots hz 2 addition of no3 to the shallow roots ht and 3 addition of no3 to the deep roots hf through preliminary experiments in this study we found that the roots of the corn planted in the pots grew downward first then once the roots approached the pot floor they elongated horizontally along the bottom of the pot towards the inner pot wall instead of growing downward consequently the roots that grew into deep soil were mostly distributed in the bottom area near the pot wall when no3 containing solution was added to pot b most of the no3 was expected to come in contact only with the relatively shallow roots then gravity would cause the solution to penetrate downward and flow out from the pots by contrast when no3 containing solution was added to pot a the no3 was expected to only come in contact with the relatively deep roots at the bottom area near the pot wall in brief the nested design of pot b in pot a was used to achieve no3 delivery separately to shallow and deep roots before addition of no3 and at 2 4 6 8 and 10 days after addition of no3 pn tr and gs were measured for each treatment group before addition of no3 and at 5 and 10 d after addition of no3 three pots from each treatment were taken to laboratory to test no3 content and plant hormone 2 2 measurements and data analysis 2 2 1 biomass nitrate content and photosynthetic rate the roots of the corn seedlings were separated from soil by washing biomass was determined by drying fresh root stem and leaf samples in a forced air oven at 65 c for 72 h the no3 contents in leaf tissues and xylem sap were measured using the salicylic acid method and the leaf water content were measured using the drying method li et al 2000 the pn tr and sc were determined at 11 00 am using an li 6400 photosynthesis equipment xylem sap extraction was measured by weighing as follows the aboveground part of the seedlings was clipped at the stem base then stem wounds were covered immediately with approximately 0 2 g of absorbent cotton wrapped tightly with plastic sheeting to prevent water evaporation after 12 h the cotton was reweighed the increase in weight of absorbent cotton was considered to be the amount of xylem sap obtained from the roots the sap volume was determined by dividing the calculated increase in weight with 1 g cm3 next cotton was placed and compacted at the bottom of a 10 ml syringe with a piston the sap from each sample was then pooled in a 5 ml centrifuge tube then the collected xylem sap was used to determine the concentrations of no3 zr and aba in it 2 2 2 hormones after extraction of the xylem sap 0 5 ml of xylem sap was immediately injected into a solid phase extraction c 18 column waters corporation usa blow dried with nitrogen and then stored at 80 c for future measurement of hormone concentrations fresh leaf samples 1 3 g were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 30 min and then stored at 80 c for the same purpose each frozen leaf sample was cut into several pieces and approximately 0 7 g was weighed and mixed with 80 methanol containing 1 mmol l di tert butyl 4 methylphenol the mixture was ground into a homogenate in a water bath and extracted at 4 c for 4 h the samples were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 15 min and then precipitated the supernatant was then subsequently collected the precipitate was extracted with 80 methanol for 1 h and the supernatant was collected again the supernatants were pooled injected into a solid phase extraction c 18 column and then blow dried with nitrogen the residues of leaf and xylem sap extract samples were dissolved in 0 01 mol l phosphate buffer solution ph 7 4 the concentrations of iaa ga3 aba and zr were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa in accordance with previously described methods teng et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 zhu et al 2005 mouse monoclonal antigens and antibodies against iaa ga3 aba and zr as well as the immunoglobulin g igg horseradish peroxidase used in elisa were produced at the phytohormone research institute of china agricultural university iaa ga3 aba and zr levels were then studied using the hormone test kit produced by the institute as described in previousplant hormone studies teng et al 2006 zhu et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 yang et al 2001 elisa was performed in a 96 well microtitration plate each well was coated with 100 μl of coating buffer 1 5 g l na2co3 2 93 g l nahco3 and 0 02 g l nan3 at ph 9 6 with 0 25 μg ml hormone antigens the coated plates were incubated at 37 c for 4 h to determine the ga3 aba and zr concentrations we incubated the plates at 4 c to measure iaa concentration we incubated the plates overnight at 4 c and kept the plates at room temperature for 30 min to 40 min after washing four times with phosphate buffered saline pbs tween 20 0 1 v v ph 7 4 each well was filled with 50 μl of either corn sample extract or iaa ga3 aba and zr standards 0 ng ml to 2000 ng ml dilution range and 50 μl of 20 μg ml antibodies against iaa ga3 aba and zr the plates were incubated for 3 h at 28 c to determine ga3 aba and zr concentrations and overnight at 4 c to determine iaa concentration the plates were then washed four times with pbs tween 20 0 1 v v ph 7 4 igg horseradish peroxidase substrate 100 μlof 1 25 μg ml was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 30 c plates were rinsed five times with pbs tween 20 buffer and 100 μl color appearing solution containing 1 5 mg ml 1 o phenylenediamine and 0 008 v v h2o2 were then added to each well when 2000 ng ml and 0 ng ml of the standard showed pale and deep colors in the wells respectively the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 6 n h2so4 per well color development in each well was detected using an elisa reader model dg 5023 huadong electron tube factory nanjing china at an optical density of a490 the concentrations of iaa ga3 aba andzr in the leaves and the concentrations of aba and zr in the xylem sap were calculated as previously described by weiler et al 1981 the percentage recoveries of iaa ga3 aba and zr which were determined by adding known quantities of the standard hormone to a split extract were 79 2 78 6 80 2 and 83 0 respectively these results indicate the absence of non specific inhibitors in the extracts the specificity and other possible non specific immunoreactive interference of the monoclonal antibodies used here have been previously examined by wu et al 1988 zhang et al 1991 and he 1993 before xylem sapextraction absorbent cotton was soaked in methanol and air dried thrice to reduce contamination in aba and zr measurements no significant difference in the xylem sap aba and zr concentrations was noted between absorbent cotton and vacuum extraction p 0 05 thus absorbent cotton use only slightly affected the aba and zr measurements in the vacuum extraction method a silicon tube wastightly attached to the cut portion of corn seedlings which was then squeezed to vent air and tied with string at the other end after 12 h the solution in the silicon tube was collected the abbreviations used in the text are listed in table 1 values in the graphs represent averages and were analyzed using microsoft excel 2007 the least significant difference test was used to perform multiple comparisons among treatment groups and the threshold for statistical significance was set at p 05 3 result 3 1 exp 1 3 1 1 biomass the aboveground biomass and total biomass were significantly higher in wt and wc than in dt and dc before rewatering fig 3 this result indicated that drought stress inhibited corn growth when the reduced biomass of rewatering corns caused by drought stress is made up or exceeded during the rewatering period compensatory growth occurs at 10 days after rewatering no significant difference in the aboveground and total biomasses was noted between wt and dt this result indicated that without root cutting rewatering treatment achieved a faster growth rate than wet treatment with compensatory growth in the rewatered corns at 5 and 10 days after rewatering the aboveground and total biomasses remained significantly higher in wc than in dc thus under root cutting no compensatory growth occurred due to root cutting the root biomass were significantly lower in wc than in wt and in dc than in dt at 5 and 10 days after rewatering in addition the aboveground biomass was significantly higher in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering which indicated that root cutting inhibited corn growth either under wetness or rewatering thus root cutting had a negative effect on compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering because of its retarding of corn growth 3 1 2 photosynthetic characteristics significantly higher pn tr and gs were observed in wt than in dt and wc than in dc before rewatering fig 4 in addition significantly lower pn tr and gs were observed in wc than in wt and in dc than in dt during the rewatering period these results showed that drought stress and root cutting both decreased the pn tr and gs of corn after rewatering there were significantly higher pn and gs in dt than in wt until 6 days after rewatering no significant differences in pn and gs were observed between wt and dt at 8 and 10 days after rewatering therefore in the absence of root cutting rewatering could increase pn and gs however these effects tended to weaken over time in the absence of root cutting rewatering had little influence on tr at 2 and 4 days after rewatering significantly high pn occurred in dc than in wc but there were significantly lower pn in dc than in wc at 6 and 8 days after rewatering therefore with root cutting rewatering could not exert regular influence on pn in addition under the condition of root cutting rewatering had little effect on tr and gs due to cloudy weather the pn tr and gs of all treatment groups decreased substantially at the end of the rewatering period 3 1 3 leaf water content xylem sap quantity and nitrate content as showed by fig 5 drought stress decreased leaf water content and rewatering recovered them within a short amount of time before rewatering there was significantly higher leaf water content in wt than in dt and in wc than in dc after two days no significant differences was found between these treatments similarly root cutting decreased leaf water content temporarily but it was restored quickly at 2 days after rewatering significantly higher leaf water content occurred in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc there were no significant differences between these treatments at 4 days after rewatering until the end of the rewatering period results indicated that drought stress and root cutting both decreased the quantity of xylem sap before rewatering significantly higher amounts of xylem sap were seen in wt and wc than in dt and dc fig 6 at 5 and 10 days after rewatering significantly higher amounts of xylem sap occurred in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc at 5 and 10 d after rewatering the no3 contents of leaves were significantly higher in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc fig 7 which indicated that root cutting could decrease the no3 content of leaves a significantly lower no3 content of xylem sap was noted in wc than in wt and in dc thhan in dt at 5 days after rewatering indicating that root cutting resulted in significantly lower no3 content of xylem sap during the rewatering period the main reason for this was that once a root of corn seedling was cut due to being luck of relatively deep roots its uptake pattern got affected compared to normal root as deep roots with larger numbers of root tips feature a close relationship with water and mineral nutrient uptake in addition the result also showed that rewatering had only a modest effect on the no3 content of leaves and xylem saps 3 1 4 plant hormones as shownin figs 8 and 9 drought stress decreased the iaa and ga3 contents and increased the aba content in leaves and xylem saps however post drought rewatering altered this effect the leaf iaa and ga3 contents were significantly lower in dt and dc than in wt and wc before rewatering but were not significantly lower in dt and dc than in wt and wc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering similarly the leaf aba content and the aba content in xylem sap were significantly higher in dt and dc than in wt and wc before rewatering however these variables were not significantly higher in dt and dc than in wt and wc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering root cutting only exerted slight influence on leaf iaa ga3 and aba contents and the aba content in xylem sap the leaf zr content and the zr content of xylem sap were significantly higher in wt and wc than in dt and dc before rewatering zr is the main form of cytokinin in plants the results showed that drought stress decreased the cytokinin contents of leaves and xylem sap at 5 and 10 days after rewatering the two indexes were significantly higher in dt than in wt therefore post drought rewatering without root cutting may have increased the leaf zr content and the zr content of xylem sap however this phenomenon did not occur under the condition of root cutting the leaf zr content and the zr content of xylem sap were significantly higher in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering this confirmed that root cutting decreased the cytokinin concentration in the leaves and xylem saps 3 2 exp 2 3 2 1 photosynthetic characteristic as shown in fig 10 a significantly higher pn was observed in hf than in ht and in hz at 4 days after no3 addition until the end of no3 addition and in ht than in hz at 6 days after no3 addition until the end of no3 addition these observations indicated that no3 addition to roots increased the net photosynthetic rate of corn its addition to deep roots also had a larger effect than no3 addition to shallow roots similarly this phenomenon also occurred in gs and tr given the cloudy weather remarkable declines for pn tr and gs of all treatment groups occurred at the end of the rewatering period 3 2 2 xylem sap quantity and nitrate content as showed by fig 11 there were significantly higher xylem sap quantity in hf than in ht and hz and in ht than in hz at 10 days after no3 addition at 10 d after no3 addition the leaf no3 content and the no3 content of xylem sap were significantly higher in hf than in ht and hz and in ht than in hz fig 12 therefore the no3 addition to roots significantly influenced the increasing xylem sap quantity and the increasing of no3 content in the leaves and xylem saps no3 addition to deep roots also resulted in a larger effect than no3 addition to shallow roots 3 2 3 plant hormones the leaf zr content and the xylem sap zr content were significantly higher in hf and ht than in hz and in hf than in ht at 5 and 10 days after adding no3 respectively figs 13 and 14 this result showed that no3 addition to roots could increase the cytokinin content of the leaves and xylem saps furthermore no3 addition to deep roots exerted a larger effect on increase in the zr contents of leaves and xylem saps than no3 addition to shallow roots moreover no3 addition to roots slightly influenced the leaf iaa ga3 and aba contents as well as aba content in xylem sap 4 discussion 4 1 compensatory growth and cytokinin wang et al 2016a found that cytokinin concentration in leaves closely correlated with compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering in corn a similar relationship was observed in exp 1 in the current study the close connection between compensatory growth and cytokinin levels was demonstrated by the result that post drought rewatering induced compensatory growth in rewatered corns that had not been subjected to root cutting simultaneously higher leaf cytokinin concentration was measured in these rewatered corns relative to wet corns firstly compensatory growth after post drought rewatering is essentially the rapid production and accumulation of organic matter via leaf photosynthesis in exp 1 compared with wt high pn occurred in dt during rewatring period thus rewatering can increase the accumulation of organic substances in rewatering corns by photosynthesis compared with wet corns in the absence of root cutting this condition facilitated the compensatory growth secondly several scholars have reported that cytokinin helps increase photosynthetic activity tamaki and mercier 2007 sakakibara et al 2006 kobayashi et al 2012 kobayashi et al 2010 similarly in exp 1 the high cytokinin levels in rewatering corns without root cutting can also increase leaf photosynthetic rate in exp 1 a significantly higher gs was observed in dt than in wt during rewatering period indicating that in the absence of root cutting high stomatal conductance occurred in rewatered corns this condition was closely related to their leaf cytokinin concentration and was benefitted the increasing net photosynthetic rate of rewatering corns relative to wet corns cytokinin regulates stomatal conductance in plants and leaf stomatal opening contributes to plant photosynthesis moreover cytokinin can increase cell number and enlarge cell volume which are beneficial for the accumulation of photosynthetic products by contrast in exp 1 no post drought rewatering compensatory growth occurred under root cutting and no difference was observed in cytokinin concentration in leaves between rewatered treatment and wet treatment furthermore no difference in photosynthetic rate was observed between rewatered corns and wet corns 4 2 roots and cytokinin in general plant roots are the primary sites of cytokininsynthesis from which cytokinin is transported in the xylem sap to aboveground stems and leaves and then accumulates in the leaves dodd 2005 zaicovski et al 2008 lu et al 2009 in exp 1 high cytokinin concentration of xylem sap in rewatered corns indicated that their roots were more capable of secreting cytokinin than wet corns in the absence of root cutting this would certainly have an effect on their leaf cytokinin concentration this may be why high leaf cytokinin cencentration occurred in these rewatered corns xylem sap quantity is an important index that indicates plant root activity and its ability to transfer root secretions and mineral nutrition from roots to shoots which is an important factor influencing plant growth larbi et al 2010 atkinson et al 2008 oh et al 2008 accumulation of cytokinin in the leaves is induced when more xylem sap is transported to the leaves in exp 1 in the absence of root cutting no difference was observed in xylem sap quantity between rewatered and wet corns dodd et al 2004 found that sap exuding from de topped root systems travels at a much lower rate than the transpirationalflow rate in peas they proposed that transpiration should be fully considered for cytokinin traveling to shoots via the xylem sap our results showed that the rewatering and wet corns had the same transpirationalrate in exp 1 these results further showed that secretion of cytokinin in roots was a determining factor influencing leaf cytokinin concenntration in the absence of root cutting in addition in exp 1 both under wet and rewatering conditions corns with root cutting had low cytokinin concentration in xylem sap low xylem sap quantity and low transpirational rate relative to corns without root cutting these factors were all disadvantageous for cytokinnin traveling from roots to leaves this may be why low leaf cytokinin concentration occurred in these corns these results also support the idea that leaf cytokinnin concentration is influenced by roots 4 3 deep roots in exp 2 corns with no3 added to deep roots were more prone to produce cytokinin than those with no3 added to shallow roots this was demonstrated by the result that higher cytokinin concentration of xylem sap occurred when no3 was added to deep roots relative to shallow roots shallow roots grow early and hence generate old roots deep roots develop later with larger numbers of new roots and root tips which benefits root function in general new roots and root tips present exuberant vitality with much meristem and might serve as a cytokinin producing part no3 directly induces variations incytokinin content in many plants criado et al 2009 lu et al 2009 wang et al 2013 consequently no3 addition to deep roots stimulates the roots to produce more cytokinin than that produced under no3 addition to shallow roots moreover the corns with no3 added to deep roots had significantly higher transpiration rate and xylem sap quantity than corns with no3 added to shallow roots both of which can contribute to the transport of cytokinin from roots to leaves thus higher leaf cytokinin concentration was observed in the corns with no3 added to deep roots than to shallow roots in exp 2 similar to corns with no3 added to shallow roots in exp 2 in exp 1 root cutting caused nearly complete loss of deep roots which is unfavourable for root cytokinin production the same cytokinin concentrations of xylem sap occurred in the rewatering and wet corns under root cutting moreover the transpirational rate and xylem sap quantity were also the same in the rewatered and wet corns thus the rewatered and wet corns had the same leaf cytokinin concentration with root cutting in exp 1 further supporting that leaf cytokinin concentration is influenced by roots guo et al 2016 conducted a study on the water uptake mechanisms in the roots of winter wheat at different irrigation depths their results revealed that improving water use by deep soil enhanced water use efficiency wang et al 2016b found that soil moisture at 50 cm depth correlated better with winter wheat yield than soil moisture at 10 and 20 cm depths their findings support our results in high lighting the significance of deep roots in crop water use in addition in exp 1 after rewatering no increase in iaa or ga3 concentration was observed under rewatering treatment relative to that in wet treatment without root cutting ga3 and iaa were beneficial for compensatory growth to a certain degree various hormones including auxin gibberellin and cytokinin jointly participate in regulation of plant growth the contribution of shallow roots to compensatory growth of post drought rewatering is not insignificant the results of exp 2 revealed that shallow roots can produce cytokinin nevertheless deep roots produce cytokinin more easily and efficiently which greatly benefit the fast growth of corn thus deep roots play a dominant role in compensatory growth during post drought rewatering compared to shallow roots 4 4 ecological mechanism if a small amount of water reaches corns under drought stress only the surface soil will be wet and such surface soil water evaporates easily this occurrence is highly disadvantageous for corn compensatory growth under post drought rewatering conversely sufficient water supply can ensure continued corn compensatory growth when a large amount of water reaches the corn under drought stress water penetrates into deep soil and may cause the roots in deep soil to detect water these roots in deep soil then exert influence over leaves through cytokinin productions to promote compensatory growth this may be an ecological strategy adopted by plants to use deep roots to exert influence on leaves to regulate compensatory growth corns growing in the field possess roots that grow far deeper into the soil compared to corns plantedin pots and corn root growth is influenced by many factors including growth stages and soil fertility thus the problem of corn compensatory growth after post drought rewatering based on cytokinin is much more complex in deep roots in the field than in pots such problem is hence worth further probing and developing 5 conclusion in this study drought stress inhibited corn seedling growth and decreased their net photosynthetic rate in the absence of root cutting rewatering increased corn seedling growth and their net photosynthetic rate corn compensatory growth of post drought rewatering occurred under no root cutting but not under root cutting without root cutting rewatering caused high cytokinin concentration in the leaves and xylem saps and the high cytokinin concentration in the leaves increased corn seedling growth however given the small number of deep roots under root cutting rewatering did not enhance the cytokinin concentration in leaves and xylem saps overall no compensatory growth of post drought rewatering occurred in corns with few deep roots and deep roots played a key role in compensatory growth via induction of leaf cytokinin acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china program u1304326 the creative talents program of science and technology of

11429,the effect of shallow and deep roots on compensatory growth of potted corn seedlings during post drought rewatering was investigated on the basis of leaf cytokinin induced by roots two treatment conditions namely root cutting and nitrate no3 addition were used in the study results showed that drought stress retained corn growth in the absence of root cutting rewatering increased the net photosynthetic rates of corn and induced compensatory growth however under root cutting no compensatory growth occurred in the rewatered corns in the absence of root cutting significantly higher zeatin riboside zr concentrations in the leaves and xylem saps were recorded under rewatering treatment than under wet treatment however these results were not observed under root cutting owing to loss of deep roots furthermore corns with deep roots added with no3 showed significantly higher zr concentration in the leaves and xylem saps than those with shallow roots added with no3 high leaf cytokinin concentration is known to induce rapid corn growth thus no compensatory growth occurred during post drought rewatering in corns with few deep roots likely due to lack of leaf cytokinin enhancement induced by deep roots keywords corn cytokinin compensatory growth during post drought rewatering seedling stage root cutting deep roots 1 introduction plants adapt to drought stress by reducing growth and then accelerating growth when sufficient water becomes available consequently the reduced growth is offset or even surpassed under sufficient water supply this is central to the theory of plant compensatory growth during post drought rewatering given this theory regulated deficit irrigation and deficit irrigation technologies have been extensively used in water saving agriculture cui et al 2009 pèrez pèrez et al 2008 ballester et al 2013 intrigliolo et al 2013 shao et al 2010 therefore compensatory growth of post drought rewatering is highly important for water saving agriculture many scholars have explored the mechanism underlying crop compensatory growth during post drought rewatering in cotton wheat maize and kentucky bluegrass various factors including photosynthetic rate stomatal conductance fertiliser use and anti aging properties have been found to play a role luo et al 2016 wang et al 2011 yao et al 2012 ghahfarokhi et al 2015 xu et al 2011 some studies have revealed that cytokinin is closely related to plant growth photosynthesis anti aging leaf stomatal conductance and nitrogen fertiliser use rubio wilhelmi et al 2014 tamaki and mercier 2007 lu et al 2009 aloia et al 2011 therefore exploring the mechanism of cytokinin induced compensatory growth may be a worthwhile endeavor indeed wang et al 2016a studied plant growth hormones and found that leaf cytokinin levels which are influenced greatly by roots contribute to corn compensatory growth during post drought rewatering kirkegaard et al 2007 conducted a field experiment on wheat water use and demonstrated that a relatively small amount of subsoil water is highly valuable for grain yield liu et al 2015 investigated the combined effects of soil moisture and physical parameters on winter wheat production similarly the group observed that roots growing in deep soil layers improve the water use efficiency as well as drought resistance of winter wheat however zhou et al 2009 found that two ridges and furrows mulched by one plastic film with maize planted in the furrow could increase maize yield this observation was associated with enhanced topsoil moisture in the planting zone li et al 1999 also reported that plastic film mulching could partly increase the yield of spring wheat because of increased moisture in the upper 5 cm of the soil roots in the topsoil or deep soil both hold a close relationship with crop water use however no study has explored the relationship between crop compensatory growth mechanism of post drought rewatering and topsoil or deep soil roots investigating the effect of cytokinin on corn growth on the basis of shallow and deep roots should provide further insight into this mechanism in the present study corn zea mays l at the seedling stage was selected for studying compensatory growth of post drought rewatering in pots corn the world s third largest and china s principal crop consumes large quantities of water for this reason corn productivity in northern china is usually constrained by water shortage augmenting water use efficiency is the key to improving corn production in the region to achieve our research object which is to determine the effect of deep roots on corn compensatory growth of post drought rewatering on the basis of leaf cytokinin induced by roots root cutting in corns was conducted to allow shallow roots to secret cytokinin then we compared the effects of cytokinins secreted by shallow roots and the whole roots on corn growth of post drought rewatering to determine the connection between cytokinins secreted by deep roots and compensatory growth concentrations of gibberellic acid ga3 abscisic acid aba indole 3 acetic acid iaa and zeatin riboside zr in the leaves zr and aba concentrations in the xylem saps and the net photosynthetic rate pn transpiration rate tr and stomatal conductance gs were also determined to attain our goal 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the study was carried out in the experimental farm of henan university of science and technology the farm 34 32 n 112 16 e altitude 138 m was located in luoyang city of henan province and experiences a warm temperate continental monsoon climate its annual rainfall and temperature are 601 mm and 14 2 c respectively the corn cultivar zhendan 958 which is widely planted in china was used in the study because of its high drought resistance and wide adaptability given their rapid growth and easily detectable growth variation the present study adopted corns at the seedling stage as test material to investigate the compensatory growth mechanism specifically root growth in corn seedlings is also easily detectable and controlled the study was conducted under a rain shelter with potting filled with sand and two experimental setups which involved root cutting exp 1 and no3 addition exp 2 were prepared sand was employed to allow water solution to permeate easily and rinse the mineral nutrient content the pots used in exp 1 were 20 0 cm in pot mouth diameter 16 5 cm in pot floor diameter 22 3 cm in height and 20 cm in sand height meanwhile nested pots were used for exp 2 with pot b placed inside pot a fig 1 pot a was 28 23 and 14 cm in pot mouth diameter pot floor diameter and height respectively by contrast the floor of pot b was removed and the pot mouth diameter pot floor diameter and height were 22 12 and 14 5 cm respectively the filled sand in pot a had a height of 10 cm the sand height was 12 cm when measured from the top sand level in pot b to the floor of pot a a 4 cm height separated pot b from the floor of pot a twelve evenly distributed small holes were punched through the floor of pot a to allow water to flow through in exp 1 and 2 the pots were watered daily with modified hoagland solution to ensure normal corn growth the modified hoagland solution contained 5 mm k 8 mm ca 1 mm p 1 mm mg 89 μm fe 18 μm mn 0 9 μm cu 1 75 μm zn and 15 mm no3 in april 2017 a total of 200 and 150 pots were prepared for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively the experiment was carried out from april 20 to june 3 for a total of 44 days on 20 april six corn seeds each were planted in both exp 1and exp 2 after 6 days seedlings emerged then 6 days after emergence only two seedlings with strong growth were selected from the two setups and the other seedlings were pulled out the two remaining seedlings were grown for 12 days and 36 and 27 pots with uniformly grown seedlings were selected for exp 1 and exp 2 respectively 2 1 1 exp 1 design in exp 1 the 36 pots were divided into four groups with 9 pots each two growth periods of drought stress and rewatering were established in these pots for 10 days each at the beginning of rewatering the corn seedlings were at 28 days after seedling emergence in the drought stress period the first and second groups received sufficient water supply and the third and fourth groups were under drought stress in the rewatering period all groups received sufficient water supply at the end of the drought stress period root cutting was conducted in the second and fourth groups thus exp 1 involved four treatments of 9 pots each designated as follows 1 wetness wt 2 wetness with cut roots wc 3 rewatering dt and 4 rewatering with cut roots dc root cutting was performed in order to decrease root length by removing relatively deep roots at the bottom of the pot the procedure was performed as follows the pots were cut transversely through roughly the middle into halves using a thin back knife with 10 cm sand height in the upper half and 10 cm sand height in the lower half fig 2 during root cutting the pots were kept stable to avoid sand disturbance and then the upper and lower halves of roots were kept in place using transparent adhesive tape wetness and drought stress were obtained by weighing and adding water to maintain the soil water content swc at 75 80 and 50 55 respectively of field water capacity fwc from 6 00 am to 9 00 pm the pots were weighed to determine swc every 5 h when swc dropped below 75 of fwc water was added to maintain the water content at 75 80 of the fwc to induce drought stress no water was added to the soil on the first 2 3 days to allow the soil water to dissipate then the pots were weighed and water was used to maintain the swc at 50 55 of fwc according to xiong et al 2007 the swc at each treatment hour was calculated on the basis of the following formula 1 1 s w c w t w d w e w p w d fwc 100 where wt is the temporary whole pot weight wd is the net weight of dried sand in the pot we is the weight of empty pot and wp is the estimated fresh weight fw of all plants in the pot the estimated fw of all plants in one pot was determined inadvance on extra pots in each test period pn tr and gs were measured in each treatment at the end of the drought stress period and at 2 4 6 8 and 10 days after rewatering at the end of the drought stress period and at 5 and10 d after rewatering three pots from each treatment were taken to the laboratory with the purpose of measuring biomass plant hormones no3 content leaf water content the average daily temperatures were 21 c 24 c and 28 c from seeding to the beginning of the drought stress period during drought stress period and during rewatering period respectively during the rewatering period it was sunny most of the time but some days were cloudy towards the end 2 1 2 exp 2 design in exp 2 the selected 27 pots were divided into three groups with 9 pots each at the end of the drought stress period of exp 1 all pots in exp 2 were rinsed with distilled water to remove any trace of inorganic nitrogen in the sand then all exp 2 groups received sufficient water supply like in exp 1 for 10 days which was designated as the nitrate addition period similar with exp 1 at the beginning of nitrate addition the age of corn seedlings were 28 days after seedling emergence during this nitrate addition period pots a and b in the first group were both watered with modified hoagland solution without no3 in the second group modified hoagland solutions with and without 15 mm no3 were added to pots b and a respectively in the third group modified hoagland solutions with and without 15 mm no3 were prepared and added to pots a and b respectively therefore three treatments of wetness were obtained from exp 2 and these treatments included 1 no addition of no3 to the roots hz 2 addition of no3 to the shallow roots ht and 3 addition of no3 to the deep roots hf through preliminary experiments in this study we found that the roots of the corn planted in the pots grew downward first then once the roots approached the pot floor they elongated horizontally along the bottom of the pot towards the inner pot wall instead of growing downward consequently the roots that grew into deep soil were mostly distributed in the bottom area near the pot wall when no3 containing solution was added to pot b most of the no3 was expected to come in contact only with the relatively shallow roots then gravity would cause the solution to penetrate downward and flow out from the pots by contrast when no3 containing solution was added to pot a the no3 was expected to only come in contact with the relatively deep roots at the bottom area near the pot wall in brief the nested design of pot b in pot a was used to achieve no3 delivery separately to shallow and deep roots before addition of no3 and at 2 4 6 8 and 10 days after addition of no3 pn tr and gs were measured for each treatment group before addition of no3 and at 5 and 10 d after addition of no3 three pots from each treatment were taken to laboratory to test no3 content and plant hormone 2 2 measurements and data analysis 2 2 1 biomass nitrate content and photosynthetic rate the roots of the corn seedlings were separated from soil by washing biomass was determined by drying fresh root stem and leaf samples in a forced air oven at 65 c for 72 h the no3 contents in leaf tissues and xylem sap were measured using the salicylic acid method and the leaf water content were measured using the drying method li et al 2000 the pn tr and sc were determined at 11 00 am using an li 6400 photosynthesis equipment xylem sap extraction was measured by weighing as follows the aboveground part of the seedlings was clipped at the stem base then stem wounds were covered immediately with approximately 0 2 g of absorbent cotton wrapped tightly with plastic sheeting to prevent water evaporation after 12 h the cotton was reweighed the increase in weight of absorbent cotton was considered to be the amount of xylem sap obtained from the roots the sap volume was determined by dividing the calculated increase in weight with 1 g cm3 next cotton was placed and compacted at the bottom of a 10 ml syringe with a piston the sap from each sample was then pooled in a 5 ml centrifuge tube then the collected xylem sap was used to determine the concentrations of no3 zr and aba in it 2 2 2 hormones after extraction of the xylem sap 0 5 ml of xylem sap was immediately injected into a solid phase extraction c 18 column waters corporation usa blow dried with nitrogen and then stored at 80 c for future measurement of hormone concentrations fresh leaf samples 1 3 g were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 30 min and then stored at 80 c for the same purpose each frozen leaf sample was cut into several pieces and approximately 0 7 g was weighed and mixed with 80 methanol containing 1 mmol l di tert butyl 4 methylphenol the mixture was ground into a homogenate in a water bath and extracted at 4 c for 4 h the samples were centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 15 min and then precipitated the supernatant was then subsequently collected the precipitate was extracted with 80 methanol for 1 h and the supernatant was collected again the supernatants were pooled injected into a solid phase extraction c 18 column and then blow dried with nitrogen the residues of leaf and xylem sap extract samples were dissolved in 0 01 mol l phosphate buffer solution ph 7 4 the concentrations of iaa ga3 aba and zr were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa in accordance with previously described methods teng et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 zhu et al 2005 mouse monoclonal antigens and antibodies against iaa ga3 aba and zr as well as the immunoglobulin g igg horseradish peroxidase used in elisa were produced at the phytohormone research institute of china agricultural university iaa ga3 aba and zr levels were then studied using the hormone test kit produced by the institute as described in previousplant hormone studies teng et al 2006 zhu et al 2005 zhang et al 2009 yang et al 2001 elisa was performed in a 96 well microtitration plate each well was coated with 100 μl of coating buffer 1 5 g l na2co3 2 93 g l nahco3 and 0 02 g l nan3 at ph 9 6 with 0 25 μg ml hormone antigens the coated plates were incubated at 37 c for 4 h to determine the ga3 aba and zr concentrations we incubated the plates at 4 c to measure iaa concentration we incubated the plates overnight at 4 c and kept the plates at room temperature for 30 min to 40 min after washing four times with phosphate buffered saline pbs tween 20 0 1 v v ph 7 4 each well was filled with 50 μl of either corn sample extract or iaa ga3 aba and zr standards 0 ng ml to 2000 ng ml dilution range and 50 μl of 20 μg ml antibodies against iaa ga3 aba and zr the plates were incubated for 3 h at 28 c to determine ga3 aba and zr concentrations and overnight at 4 c to determine iaa concentration the plates were then washed four times with pbs tween 20 0 1 v v ph 7 4 igg horseradish peroxidase substrate 100 μlof 1 25 μg ml was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 30 c plates were rinsed five times with pbs tween 20 buffer and 100 μl color appearing solution containing 1 5 mg ml 1 o phenylenediamine and 0 008 v v h2o2 were then added to each well when 2000 ng ml and 0 ng ml of the standard showed pale and deep colors in the wells respectively the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 6 n h2so4 per well color development in each well was detected using an elisa reader model dg 5023 huadong electron tube factory nanjing china at an optical density of a490 the concentrations of iaa ga3 aba andzr in the leaves and the concentrations of aba and zr in the xylem sap were calculated as previously described by weiler et al 1981 the percentage recoveries of iaa ga3 aba and zr which were determined by adding known quantities of the standard hormone to a split extract were 79 2 78 6 80 2 and 83 0 respectively these results indicate the absence of non specific inhibitors in the extracts the specificity and other possible non specific immunoreactive interference of the monoclonal antibodies used here have been previously examined by wu et al 1988 zhang et al 1991 and he 1993 before xylem sapextraction absorbent cotton was soaked in methanol and air dried thrice to reduce contamination in aba and zr measurements no significant difference in the xylem sap aba and zr concentrations was noted between absorbent cotton and vacuum extraction p 0 05 thus absorbent cotton use only slightly affected the aba and zr measurements in the vacuum extraction method a silicon tube wastightly attached to the cut portion of corn seedlings which was then squeezed to vent air and tied with string at the other end after 12 h the solution in the silicon tube was collected the abbreviations used in the text are listed in table 1 values in the graphs represent averages and were analyzed using microsoft excel 2007 the least significant difference test was used to perform multiple comparisons among treatment groups and the threshold for statistical significance was set at p 05 3 result 3 1 exp 1 3 1 1 biomass the aboveground biomass and total biomass were significantly higher in wt and wc than in dt and dc before rewatering fig 3 this result indicated that drought stress inhibited corn growth when the reduced biomass of rewatering corns caused by drought stress is made up or exceeded during the rewatering period compensatory growth occurs at 10 days after rewatering no significant difference in the aboveground and total biomasses was noted between wt and dt this result indicated that without root cutting rewatering treatment achieved a faster growth rate than wet treatment with compensatory growth in the rewatered corns at 5 and 10 days after rewatering the aboveground and total biomasses remained significantly higher in wc than in dc thus under root cutting no compensatory growth occurred due to root cutting the root biomass were significantly lower in wc than in wt and in dc than in dt at 5 and 10 days after rewatering in addition the aboveground biomass was significantly higher in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering which indicated that root cutting inhibited corn growth either under wetness or rewatering thus root cutting had a negative effect on compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering because of its retarding of corn growth 3 1 2 photosynthetic characteristics significantly higher pn tr and gs were observed in wt than in dt and wc than in dc before rewatering fig 4 in addition significantly lower pn tr and gs were observed in wc than in wt and in dc than in dt during the rewatering period these results showed that drought stress and root cutting both decreased the pn tr and gs of corn after rewatering there were significantly higher pn and gs in dt than in wt until 6 days after rewatering no significant differences in pn and gs were observed between wt and dt at 8 and 10 days after rewatering therefore in the absence of root cutting rewatering could increase pn and gs however these effects tended to weaken over time in the absence of root cutting rewatering had little influence on tr at 2 and 4 days after rewatering significantly high pn occurred in dc than in wc but there were significantly lower pn in dc than in wc at 6 and 8 days after rewatering therefore with root cutting rewatering could not exert regular influence on pn in addition under the condition of root cutting rewatering had little effect on tr and gs due to cloudy weather the pn tr and gs of all treatment groups decreased substantially at the end of the rewatering period 3 1 3 leaf water content xylem sap quantity and nitrate content as showed by fig 5 drought stress decreased leaf water content and rewatering recovered them within a short amount of time before rewatering there was significantly higher leaf water content in wt than in dt and in wc than in dc after two days no significant differences was found between these treatments similarly root cutting decreased leaf water content temporarily but it was restored quickly at 2 days after rewatering significantly higher leaf water content occurred in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc there were no significant differences between these treatments at 4 days after rewatering until the end of the rewatering period results indicated that drought stress and root cutting both decreased the quantity of xylem sap before rewatering significantly higher amounts of xylem sap were seen in wt and wc than in dt and dc fig 6 at 5 and 10 days after rewatering significantly higher amounts of xylem sap occurred in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc at 5 and 10 d after rewatering the no3 contents of leaves were significantly higher in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc fig 7 which indicated that root cutting could decrease the no3 content of leaves a significantly lower no3 content of xylem sap was noted in wc than in wt and in dc thhan in dt at 5 days after rewatering indicating that root cutting resulted in significantly lower no3 content of xylem sap during the rewatering period the main reason for this was that once a root of corn seedling was cut due to being luck of relatively deep roots its uptake pattern got affected compared to normal root as deep roots with larger numbers of root tips feature a close relationship with water and mineral nutrient uptake in addition the result also showed that rewatering had only a modest effect on the no3 content of leaves and xylem saps 3 1 4 plant hormones as shownin figs 8 and 9 drought stress decreased the iaa and ga3 contents and increased the aba content in leaves and xylem saps however post drought rewatering altered this effect the leaf iaa and ga3 contents were significantly lower in dt and dc than in wt and wc before rewatering but were not significantly lower in dt and dc than in wt and wc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering similarly the leaf aba content and the aba content in xylem sap were significantly higher in dt and dc than in wt and wc before rewatering however these variables were not significantly higher in dt and dc than in wt and wc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering root cutting only exerted slight influence on leaf iaa ga3 and aba contents and the aba content in xylem sap the leaf zr content and the zr content of xylem sap were significantly higher in wt and wc than in dt and dc before rewatering zr is the main form of cytokinin in plants the results showed that drought stress decreased the cytokinin contents of leaves and xylem sap at 5 and 10 days after rewatering the two indexes were significantly higher in dt than in wt therefore post drought rewatering without root cutting may have increased the leaf zr content and the zr content of xylem sap however this phenomenon did not occur under the condition of root cutting the leaf zr content and the zr content of xylem sap were significantly higher in wt than in wc and in dt than in dc at 5 and 10 days after rewatering this confirmed that root cutting decreased the cytokinin concentration in the leaves and xylem saps 3 2 exp 2 3 2 1 photosynthetic characteristic as shown in fig 10 a significantly higher pn was observed in hf than in ht and in hz at 4 days after no3 addition until the end of no3 addition and in ht than in hz at 6 days after no3 addition until the end of no3 addition these observations indicated that no3 addition to roots increased the net photosynthetic rate of corn its addition to deep roots also had a larger effect than no3 addition to shallow roots similarly this phenomenon also occurred in gs and tr given the cloudy weather remarkable declines for pn tr and gs of all treatment groups occurred at the end of the rewatering period 3 2 2 xylem sap quantity and nitrate content as showed by fig 11 there were significantly higher xylem sap quantity in hf than in ht and hz and in ht than in hz at 10 days after no3 addition at 10 d after no3 addition the leaf no3 content and the no3 content of xylem sap were significantly higher in hf than in ht and hz and in ht than in hz fig 12 therefore the no3 addition to roots significantly influenced the increasing xylem sap quantity and the increasing of no3 content in the leaves and xylem saps no3 addition to deep roots also resulted in a larger effect than no3 addition to shallow roots 3 2 3 plant hormones the leaf zr content and the xylem sap zr content were significantly higher in hf and ht than in hz and in hf than in ht at 5 and 10 days after adding no3 respectively figs 13 and 14 this result showed that no3 addition to roots could increase the cytokinin content of the leaves and xylem saps furthermore no3 addition to deep roots exerted a larger effect on increase in the zr contents of leaves and xylem saps than no3 addition to shallow roots moreover no3 addition to roots slightly influenced the leaf iaa ga3 and aba contents as well as aba content in xylem sap 4 discussion 4 1 compensatory growth and cytokinin wang et al 2016a found that cytokinin concentration in leaves closely correlated with compensatory growth upon post drought rewatering in corn a similar relationship was observed in exp 1 in the current study the close connection between compensatory growth and cytokinin levels was demonstrated by the result that post drought rewatering induced compensatory growth in rewatered corns that had not been subjected to root cutting simultaneously higher leaf cytokinin concentration was measured in these rewatered corns relative to wet corns firstly compensatory growth after post drought rewatering is essentially the rapid production and accumulation of organic matter via leaf photosynthesis in exp 1 compared with wt high pn occurred in dt during rewatring period thus rewatering can increase the accumulation of organic substances in rewatering corns by photosynthesis compared with wet corns in the absence of root cutting this condition facilitated the compensatory growth secondly several scholars have reported that cytokinin helps increase photosynthetic activity tamaki and mercier 2007 sakakibara et al 2006 kobayashi et al 2012 kobayashi et al 2010 similarly in exp 1 the high cytokinin levels in rewatering corns without root cutting can also increase leaf photosynthetic rate in exp 1 a significantly higher gs was observed in dt than in wt during rewatering period indicating that in the absence of root cutting high stomatal conductance occurred in rewatered corns this condition was closely related to their leaf cytokinin concentration and was benefitted the increasing net photosynthetic rate of rewatering corns relative to wet corns cytokinin regulates stomatal conductance in plants and leaf stomatal opening contributes to plant photosynthesis moreover cytokinin can increase cell number and enlarge cell volume which are beneficial for the accumulation of photosynthetic products by contrast in exp 1 no post drought rewatering compensatory growth occurred under root cutting and no difference was observed in cytokinin concentration in leaves between rewatered treatment and wet treatment furthermore no difference in photosynthetic rate was observed between rewatered corns and wet corns 4 2 roots and cytokinin in general plant roots are the primary sites of cytokininsynthesis from which cytokinin is transported in the xylem sap to aboveground stems and leaves and then accumulates in the leaves dodd 2005 zaicovski et al 2008 lu et al 2009 in exp 1 high cytokinin concentration of xylem sap in rewatered corns indicated that their roots were more capable of secreting cytokinin than wet corns in the absence of root cutting this would certainly have an effect on their leaf cytokinin concentration this may be why high leaf cytokinin cencentration occurred in these rewatered corns xylem sap quantity is an important index that indicates plant root activity and its ability to transfer root secretions and mineral nutrition from roots to shoots which is an important factor influencing plant growth larbi et al 2010 atkinson et al 2008 oh et al 2008 accumulation of cytokinin in the leaves is induced when more xylem sap is transported to the leaves in exp 1 in the absence of root cutting no difference was observed in xylem sap quantity between rewatered and wet corns dodd et al 2004 found that sap exuding from de topped root systems travels at a much lower rate than the transpirationalflow rate in peas they proposed that transpiration should be fully considered for cytokinin traveling to shoots via the xylem sap our results showed that the rewatering and wet corns had the same transpirationalrate in exp 1 these results further showed that secretion of cytokinin in roots was a determining factor influencing leaf cytokinin concenntration in the absence of root cutting in addition in exp 1 both under wet and rewatering conditions corns with root cutting had low cytokinin concentration in xylem sap low xylem sap quantity and low transpirational rate relative to corns without root cutting these factors were all disadvantageous for cytokinnin traveling from roots to leaves this may be why low leaf cytokinin concentration occurred in these corns these results also support the idea that leaf cytokinnin concentration is influenced by roots 4 3 deep roots in exp 2 corns with no3 added to deep roots were more prone to produce cytokinin than those with no3 added to shallow roots this was demonstrated by the result that higher cytokinin concentration of xylem sap occurred when no3 was added to deep roots relative to shallow roots shallow roots grow early and hence generate old roots deep roots develop later with larger numbers of new roots and root tips which benefits root function in general new roots and root tips present exuberant vitality with much meristem and might serve as a cytokinin producing part no3 directly induces variations incytokinin content in many plants criado et al 2009 lu et al 2009 wang et al 2013 consequently no3 addition to deep roots stimulates the roots to produce more cytokinin than that produced under no3 addition to shallow roots moreover the corns with no3 added to deep roots had significantly higher transpiration rate and xylem sap quantity than corns with no3 added to shallow roots both of which can contribute to the transport of cytokinin from roots to leaves thus higher leaf cytokinin concentration was observed in the corns with no3 added to deep roots than to shallow roots in exp 2 similar to corns with no3 added to shallow roots in exp 2 in exp 1 root cutting caused nearly complete loss of deep roots which is unfavourable for root cytokinin production the same cytokinin concentrations of xylem sap occurred in the rewatering and wet corns under root cutting moreover the transpirational rate and xylem sap quantity were also the same in the rewatered and wet corns thus the rewatered and wet corns had the same leaf cytokinin concentration with root cutting in exp 1 further supporting that leaf cytokinin concentration is influenced by roots guo et al 2016 conducted a study on the water uptake mechanisms in the roots of winter wheat at different irrigation depths their results revealed that improving water use by deep soil enhanced water use efficiency wang et al 2016b found that soil moisture at 50 cm depth correlated better with winter wheat yield than soil moisture at 10 and 20 cm depths their findings support our results in high lighting the significance of deep roots in crop water use in addition in exp 1 after rewatering no increase in iaa or ga3 concentration was observed under rewatering treatment relative to that in wet treatment without root cutting ga3 and iaa were beneficial for compensatory growth to a certain degree various hormones including auxin gibberellin and cytokinin jointly participate in regulation of plant growth the contribution of shallow roots to compensatory growth of post drought rewatering is not insignificant the results of exp 2 revealed that shallow roots can produce cytokinin nevertheless deep roots produce cytokinin more easily and efficiently which greatly benefit the fast growth of corn thus deep roots play a dominant role in compensatory growth during post drought rewatering compared to shallow roots 4 4 ecological mechanism if a small amount of water reaches corns under drought stress only the surface soil will be wet and such surface soil water evaporates easily this occurrence is highly disadvantageous for corn compensatory growth under post drought rewatering conversely sufficient water supply can ensure continued corn compensatory growth when a large amount of water reaches the corn under drought stress water penetrates into deep soil and may cause the roots in deep soil to detect water these roots in deep soil then exert influence over leaves through cytokinin productions to promote compensatory growth this may be an ecological strategy adopted by plants to use deep roots to exert influence on leaves to regulate compensatory growth corns growing in the field possess roots that grow far deeper into the soil compared to corns plantedin pots and corn root growth is influenced by many factors including growth stages and soil fertility thus the problem of corn compensatory growth after post drought rewatering based on cytokinin is much more complex in deep roots in the field than in pots such problem is hence worth further probing and developing 5 conclusion in this study drought stress inhibited corn seedling growth and decreased their net photosynthetic rate in the absence of root cutting rewatering increased corn seedling growth and their net photosynthetic rate corn compensatory growth of post drought rewatering occurred under no root cutting but not under root cutting without root cutting rewatering caused high cytokinin concentration in the leaves and xylem saps and the high cytokinin concentration in the leaves increased corn seedling growth however given the small number of deep roots under root cutting rewatering did not enhance the cytokinin concentration in leaves and xylem saps overall no compensatory growth of post drought rewatering occurred in corns with few deep roots and deep roots played a key role in compensatory growth via induction of leaf cytokinin acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china program u1304326 the creative talents program of science and technology of
