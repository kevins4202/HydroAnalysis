efficiency on the microbial electrode interface here an innovative cathode enhanced eocfb mes was constructed with nano fe3o4 modification and applied for in situ remediation both at lab scale 6 l 62 day operation and demonstration scale 2300 m2 1 year operation the cathode enhanced ecofb mes exhibited superior removal in toc 81 43 2 05 tn 85 12 1 46 and tp 59 80 2 27 much better than those of original ecofb mes and anode enhanced ecofb mes in the laboratory test meanwhile cathode enhanced ecofb mes boosted current output by 33 than that of original ecofb mes which made a great contribution to the improvement of ectopic electronic compensation for pollutant decontamination notably cathode enhanced ecofb mes presented high efficiency stability and durability in the demonstration test and fulfilled the average concentration of cod 9 5 2 81 mg l tn 1 00 0 21 mg l and tp 0 10 0 04 mg l of effluent water to meet the grade iii gb 3838 2002 with stable operation stage based on the kosim

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rising population and urbanization the growing pollutants from urban sewage plants and municipal sewage discharges cause serious urban surface water pollution the polluted surface water severely endangers the water ecology health and safety effective restoration of micro polluted surface water is becoming increasingly intense walker et al 2019 in consideration of the advantages of low carbon sustainability energy free and in situ restoration ecological restoration technologies e g constructed wetland ecological floating bed and microbial technologies are widely studied in surface water treatment zhang et al 2020 among these the ecological floating bed ecofb gradually attracts increasing attention due to its instinctive properties of efficient space utilization and external esthetic values benvenuti et al 2018 samal et al 2019 as demonstrated plant uptake and microbial degradation are mainly responsible for pollutant removal in ecofb hu et al 2020 however the separated location of bio carriers and plant roots in traditional ecofb results in the lack of a coupling function between bio carriers and hydrophytes limiting the exertion of its potential samal et al 2019 in addition the lower microbial biomass caused by infrequent attachment sites on floating bed for microorganisms also weakens the efficiency of ecofb garbett 2005 these indicate that the traditional ecofb has a large room for improvement in pollutant removal performance various strengthening methods have been proposed such as introducing aeration devices elastic packing submerged plants and additional bacteria into the traditional ecofb to solve the aforementioned problems these methods visibly promote the attachment of microorganisms and adsorption of pollutants thereby enhancing the pollutant degradation capacity song et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 but the functional biofilm in these systems often requires a long formation period in its start up stage which may directly influence the further practical application in surface water restoration recently with the capacity of quick functional bacteria enrichment and biofilm formation microbial electrochemical system mes shows great application potential in the in situ surface water ecological restoration qiu et al 2020 to couple with ecofb the anode and cathode of mes are selected to arrange in sediment and water respectively which fully exploits the electron ectopic compensation function of mes and realizes simultaneous removal of pollutants in both sediment and water li et al 2017 meanwhile a positive relationship has been observed between the cathode and plant root specifically 1 the electric field of mes can improve the root growth to enhance the ability of pollutants uptake zhou et al 2018 2 the root exudates could provide additional electron donors or electron mediators to facilitate electron transfer at the electrode interface ji et al 2022 therefore ecofb coupled with mes ecofb mes can be seemed as a promising process for in situ surface water restoration technology yet has rarely been reported the performance of ecofb mes is largely dictated by the extracellular electron transfer eet efficiency of mes especially in engineering applications currently carbon electrodes such as carbon cloth cc and carbon fiber cf are the most suitable electrode candidate materials for the fabrication of engineering scale mes due to their high stability low cost and good biocompatibility nevertheless their limited surface area and electrocatalytic activities are unfavorable to the formation of biofilms and interfacial electron transfer therefore the modification of carbon electrodes by nanomaterials has been proposed as a promising and efficient strategy to enhance electron transfer between microbes and the electrode li et al 2021b zhang et al 2018 current researches on electrode modification mainly focus on anode modification and nano iron oxides e g fe3o4 fe2o3 etc are considered as attractive materials because of their high specific surface area simple synthesis excellent catalytic activity and good biocompatibility jian et al 2020 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2018 the modified anode can facilitate the interfacial electron transfer at the anode stimulating electron generation and transfer to the cathode for the cathodic reduction process nevertheless the electron utilization efficiency of the cathode is often limited by the abundance of electroactive bacteria eab which is considered as the electron acceptor to complete oxygen reduction denitrification and other processes shen et al 2022 this limitation hinders the optimization of the performance in a modified anode enhanced ecofb mes system and from another perspective emphasizes the decisive role of cathode in ecofb mes and the necessity of its modification in optimizing the system in this case cathode modification is regarded as an appealing method to maximize the improvement of ecofb mes by enhancing the electron uptake efficiency of cathode and accelerating the biocathode formation at the cathode however there are scarce relevant researches on the cathode enhanced ecofb mes the enhancing mechanism of the modified cathode is still obscure and remained to be unveiled moreover the engineering application of the cathode enhanced ecofb mes in the practical application has been barely reported in practical surface water remediation based on the consideration of the above issues this study aims to explore the potential of cathode modification enhancing ecofb mes in surface water restoration and the possibility of its application in practical engineering projects firstly a novel nano fe3o4 modified cathode enhancing ecofb mes was innovatively constructed for the treatment of micro polluted surface water then the performance of the obtained ecofb mes was systematically evaluated by both laboratory and field scale experiments finally the involved mechanism of ecofb mes for enhancement of pollutant degradation was revealed by microbial community and functional genes analysis this study not only provides an insightful strategy for designing a more efficient ecofb mes but also offers operational experiences for practical engineering applications of ecofb mes in surface water restoration 2 materials and

500 ω 200 ω and 100 ω for more than 8 day of stable operation to evaluate the pollutant removal and bioelectricity generation 2 3 the construction and operation of demonstration scale ecofb mes the cathode enhanced ecofb mes with demonstration scale was operated in 2300 m2 of an urban pond of memorial hall of martyrs in nanning city guangxi province fig 2 a and 2b the cathode enhanced ecofb mes was constructed in the ecological floating bed with an area of 96 6 m2 in the demonstration application fig 2b the fecbs were evenly fixed at the bottom of ecofb as cathodes with a density of 8 pieces

connected with an adjustable resistance box range 0 9999 ω and connected with a titanium wire with a diameter of 0 5 mm the calamus was selected with about 75 plants per square meter and the changes of the calamus during the operation were shown in fig 2c there were three operation stages with different operation conditions table 1 1 stage 1 start up period of the system operated in the open circuit condition with 13 weeks to cultivate and accumulate electrode biofilm 2 stage 2 12 weeks then executed the gradient resistance strategy in the order of 1000 ω 500 ω 200 ω 100 ω 50 ω 20 ω and 10 ω and operated for 2 weeks under each external resistance condition to domesticate the biofilm at high current density 3 stage 3 26 weeks operated with the external resistance of 10 ω for the highest power density of ecofb mes the influent water quality in different stages was shown in table 2 2 4 analysis and calculation different methods were utilized to detect pollutants in the lab and demonstration experiments due to the limited testing conditions in the demonstration application total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn of laboratory samples were measured for higher accuracy

n5 665 n analytik jena ag germany do concentration and ph of demonstration water were measured with a portable analyzer hq40d hach co ltd usa qiu et al 2023 the pollutant treatment load of cathode enhanced ecofb mes was evaluated with the meteorological data of nanning and field test data by kosim model hannover germany qiu et al 2022 and detailed calculation process was described in text s2 in addition the biological toxicity with fe3o4 modified electrodes was evaluated with vibrio fischeri method abbas et al 2018 aruoja et al 2015 voltage u was measured by voltage sensors and recorded with

performed by sangon biotech co ltd the original sequencing data were analyzed by the cloud platform of shanghai majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd liang et al 2019 the abundance of functional genes relevant to electron transfer and nitrogen metabolism were predicted with picrust2 based on 16 s rrna gene abundance combined with kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 modified electrodes the sem images displayed even distribution of nanoparticles with a diameter of 100 nm 200 nm on the surface of carbon fiber in carbon brush fig 3 a and carbon cloth fig 3d from the result of elements mapping in fig 3b 3c 3e and 3f abundant fe and o elements were observed throughout the nanoparticle identifying the nature of iron based nanomaterial fig 3g showed the typical diffraction peaks of fe3o4 at 2θ of 30 076 35 426 43 053 53 411 56 935 and 62 520 corresponding to 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 facets jcpds19 0629 these results indicated that the successful fabrication of fe3o4 was uniformly loaded onto carbon fibers xps and eds were further conducted to explore the composition of the obtained fe3o4 modified carbon fiber the xps high resolution spectra of the fe 2p spectrum of fe3o4 fig 3h contained the main peaks corresponding to fe2 at 710 5 ev fe 2p3 2 and 725 3 ev fe 2p1 2 and the other two peaks corresponding to fe3 at 712 1 ev fe 2p3 2 and 725 3 ev fe 2p1 2 ma et al 2017 the area ratio of fe2 to fe3 was close to 1 2 similar to the atom ratio in fe3o4 further supporting the existence of fe3o4 as identified by xrd patterns however the atomic ratios of fe and o in carbon cloth and carbon brush were both 1 2 67 fig s1 this little excess stoichiometric ratio of oxygen might owe to the introduction of the acid pretreatment process which could boost the interfacial electron transfer between the microorganism and the electrode li et al 2019 in addition the high content of oxygen containing groups contributed to improving the hydrophilicity of fecc seen from the lower contact angle of fecc than that of cc 41 5 vs 144 1 fig 3i the improved hydrophilicity could facilitate the bacteria adhesion to establish functional biofilm li et al 2020a 2020b above results revealed that uniform fe3o4 modified engineering scale carbon electrodes were successfully prepared with high oxygen content and high hydrophilicity which would act as the key module for the construction of ecofb mes to restore micro polluted urban surface water 3 2 performance assessment of cc fecb in lab scale 3 2 1 carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance fe3o4 enhanced ecofb mess were constructed at laboratory scale to investigate pollution removal as the basis for further practical applications five reactors were evaluated towards the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal performances with different resistances 1000 ω 500 ω 200 ω 100 ω overall all reactors obtained the highest toc and tn removal with 200 ω thus 200 ω was determined as the optimal external resistance in the following experiments fig s2 interestingly obvious differences in pollutant removal performance were observed in the five reactors seen from fig s2 the cathode enhanced ecofb mes stood out from the five reactors attaining the lowest effluent concentration of toc tn and tp as well as realizing the water quality improvement from grade v to grade iii discharge cod 20 mg l tn 1 mg l tp 0 2 mg l gb 3838 2002 of surface water environmental quality standard of china sweqs specifically toc tn and tp removals in cc fecb were 81 43 2 05 85 12 1 46 and 59 80 2 27 fig 4 a 4b and 4c increased by 4 31 12 38 and 19 83 than those in cc cb respectively notably the performance of cc fecb surpassed fecc cb with 5 78 higher tn removal and 5 07 higher tp removal indicating that fe3o4 application in modifying cathodes could contribute more effectively to the enhancement of ecofb mes rather than modifying anodes moreover cc fecb showed a comparable pollutant removal with fecc fecb confirming that the fe3o4 modified cathode played a prominent role in the improvement of ecofb mes on pollutant removal this phenomenon has never been reported in previous literatures the cathode modified enhanced ecofb mes might be a brand new strategy for practical application in the remediation process of micro polluted surface water to further reveal the advantage of fe3o4 modified cathode for tn removal in ecofb mes nitrogen with different forms were particularly studied in different ecofb mess fig 4d showed that the nh4 n concentration of effluent in cc fecb continuously decreased to the value of 0 041 0 002 mg l after an operation cycle which had a negligible difference with that in cc cb 0 048 0 006 mg l no2 n also showed a similar content change during the operation cycle and there was no evident difference in concentration all 0 015 mg l among the four ecofb mess however cc fecb exhibited higher nitrification efficiency than cc cb and fecc cb with no3 n effluent concentration of 0 371 0 010 mg l being 29 93 and 12 97 lower than that of cc cb and fecc cb respectively meanwhile its no3 n concentration was comparable with fecc fecb which solidly identified the major contribution of fe3o4 modified cathode in ecofb mes in aerobic condition nh4 n and no2 n in ecofb mes tended to transform to no3 n and reached relatively low concentrations suggesting that tn removal mainly depended on the removal of no3 n by microbial denitrification in ecofb mes the higher tn removal in cc fecb indicated greater contribution of fe3o4 modified cathode to the denitrification process qingwei and weihong 2022 3 2 2 bioelectricity generation tn removal is often limited by the lack of carbon sources as electron donors in low carbon surface water ecofb mes can realize ectopic electronic compensation eec by transferring electrons from anode in sediment to the cathode for tn removal improvement thus the electrochemical performance was tightly related to the tn removal in ecofb mes the output voltage electrode potential current density and power density were measured and analyzed to assess the different effects of fe3o4 modified electrodes on electrochemical performance fig 5 during the operation cc fecb showed a remarkable improvement in output voltage current density and power density than cc cb and fecc cb specifically the average open circuit voltage ocv of cc fecb was 707 00 40 14 mv fig 5a being 206 25 mv 97 50 mv and 22 75 mv higher than that of cc cb 500 75 59 86 mv cc fecb 609 50 40 35 mv and fecc fecb 684 25 53 65 mv respectively this phenomenon demonstrated that fe3o4 modified cathode could shorten the start up time of ecofb mes yu et al 2019 under the condition of 200 ω for best contaminant removal the output voltage of cc fecb 288 0 42 63 mv was 36 39 higher than that of cc cb and the corresponding current density of cc fecb reached 36 01 5 33 ma m2 which could be regarded as a remarkable enhancement for current output in ecofb mes moreover cc fecb kept a continuous improvement in current density when the resistance decreased from 200 ω to 100 ω while the current density of fecc cb showed a slight decrease it was since the electron consumption efficiency on cathode was lower than the electron producing efficiency on fe3o4 modified anode in fecc cb leading to insufficient utilization of the generated electrons therefore the interfacial electron transfer of cathode could be reasonably inferred as the limiting factor for the improvement of overall electrochemical performance although fecc fecb was slightly superior to cc fecb in terms of current output there was no obvious difference observed in tn removal between these two systems indicating that cc fecb was more efficient in ectopic electronic compensation for tn removal and more sustainable in ecological remediation under limited substrate conditions in addition the maximum power density pmax obtained from the polarization curve of 29 39 0 29 mw m2 1 99 times than 14 79 0 45 mw m2 of cc cb further confirmed the significant improvement effect on power generation of cc fecb figs 5d and s3 such excellent electron transfer efficiency of ecofb mes with fe3o4 modified cathodes enabled the simultaneous promotion of pollutant removal both in water and sediment 3 2 3 microbial community analysis pollutant removal and bioelectricity generation were tightly associated with the functional bacteria including nitrogen converting bacteria ncb and electroactive bacteria eab hence electrodic microbial community was analyzed at genus level to reveal the enhancement mechanism of fe3o4 modified electrodes in ecofb mes the alpha diversity indexes of the anode and cathode from the four ecofb mes were listed in table 3 the gene library coverage of each sample was in excess of 0 98 indicating that the depth of sequencing in each sample could cover the vast majority of species in all samples zhou et al 2014 the sobs results suggested that fe3o4 modification was favorable to microbial attachment yang et al 2022 meanwhile the shannon index ace index and chao 1 index and simpson index all demonstrated that microbial diversity and richness were more abundant in samples within fe3o4 modification yang et al 2022 whichfurther confirmed that fe3o4 could contribute to enhancing the microbial diversity and abundance of electrodic biofilms in ecofb mes bacterial phyla of the cathode samples in ecofb mess were analyzed in phylum level fig 6 a in cc fecb proteobacteria 66 77 actinobacteriota 10 38 bacteroidota 5 96 chloroflexi 5 57 acidobacteriota 3 18 and firmicutes 1 43 were the dominant bacteria in the cathode sample among them chloroflexi with the function of autotrophic denitrification deng et al 2020 ge et al 2020 were 1 80 times than that of cc cb 3 08 in terms of relative abundance of cathode samples contributing to enhancing the nitrogen conversion capacity actinobacteriota tao et al 2022c which involved in bioelectricity generation and nitrogen cycle obtained a sensible enrichment in the cathode samples of cc fecb 10 38 than that of cc cb 6 98 these results demonstrated the crucial role of fe3o4 in enriching the abundance of eab and ncb for superior cathodic electrochemical performance and tn removal in ecofb mes moreover from the results of genus level identification by heatmap analysis fig 6b a series of nitrogen converting bacteria including unclassified f comamonadaceae sotres et al 2016 desulfobacterium zhong et al 2020 pseudomonas liang et al 2019 pseudarthrobacter wu et al 2020 were abundantly enriched in cc fecb capable of achieving superior tn removal in cc fecb than that of cc cb this further confirmed the vital function of fe3o4 in the enrichment of denitrifying microorganisms at the cathode to improve tn removal in short the electron transfer at the cathode interface and cathodic nitrogen conversion efficiency were both strengthened in cc fecb which was consistent with the satisfactory pollutant removal performance of cc fecb as mentioned above as for anode samples in phylum level fig 6c displayed that fecc cb and fecc fecb obtained dramatic enrichment of chloroflexi and desulfobacterota than those of cc cb again confirming that fe3o4 made an essential contribution to the enrichment of eab and nitrifying bacteria notably in cc fecb the abundance of chloroflexi deng et al 2020 ge et al 2020 and desulfobacterota ren et al 2022 capable of electron generation in anode samples were 2 02 folds and 2 28 folds of those of cc cb and nitrospirota tao et al 2022b with nitrification function also possessed higher abundance in cc fecb than cc cb fig 6c these phenomenons indicated that cc fecb possessed great efficiency of nitrification in sediment as well as electron generation by anodic biofilm even without anode modification interestingly it was noteworthy that the abundance of anodic eab in cc fecb was well comparable to that of fecc cb seen from fig 6c the increased electron utilization capacity of ncb and eab at the cathode stimulates the increased electron production capacity at the anode leading to an enrichment of electron producing bacteria at the anode in cc fecb this combined enhancing effect of both electrodes in cc fecb resulted in performance not inferior to fecc cb further proving that the cathode modification was the determining factor to improve electrochemical performance and pollution removal of the whole system in addition at genus level taking pseudomonas which both belonged to eab as the strong evidence fig 6d its enrichment in anode can enhance the efficiency of electron production in cc fecb thus the increased electron generation by anodic eab can facilitate the eec in cathode leading to better tn removal performance of cc fecb the enhancement of both denitrification and electron transfer efficiency further emphasized the significance of cathode modification for optimizing ecofb mes summing up the above evaluations of pollutant removal electrochemical performance and microbial community analysis in lab tests the cathode enhanced ecofb mes cc fecb could be preliminarily determined as the optimal ecofb mes with comprehensive advantages it provided the basis for subsequent engineering scale tests on the application of cc fecb in practical surface water remediation 3 2 4 ecological safety evaluation with satisfying eec efficiency cc fecb could be regarded as a promising ecological remediation system for practical water remediation applications however the ecological safety of nano fe3o4 modified electrode application must be considered the vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition assay was selected to acess the eco safety of cc fecb as fig s4a displayed the luminescence intensity increased at 5 min with different external resistances due to the multiplication of vibrio fischeri also it exhibited a slight decrease in different external resistances in 15 min with inhibition all lower than 4 confirming the eco safety of cc fecb during the operation in addition the total iron ion concentration in the effluent was about 3 μg l fig s4b during the operation much lower than the grade iii standard of the sweqs gb 3838 2002 discharge 0 3 mg l all above results provided strong evidence for the reliable ecological safety of fe3o4 modified cathodes and further illustrated the feasibility and great potential of cc fecb in engineering applications based on the efficient eec efficiency and excellent ecological safety cc fecb was scaled up for application in the test of urban water remediation 3 3 performance evaluation of cc fecb in urban water remediation 3 3 1 remediation performance the engineering scale of cc fecb was constructed and operated in a 2300 m2 urban micro polluted surface water grade iv sweqs for 1 year fig 7 during the first 56 days of the start up period stage 1 the cathode enhanced ecofb mes presented inefficient removal in terms of cod and tn fig 7a specifically the average cod concentration 21 50 10 33 mg l failed to meet the grade iv water standards in the early stage 1 0 56 d and tn removal was only 12 50 with a concentration of 2 8 mg l in outflow of after the 4 week operation these results could be probably attributed to the immature cathodic biofilms and low uptake capacity of plant roots also the electron transfer from anode to cathode was blocked by the open circuit operating conditions in stage 1 causing inhibition of the pollutant removal efficiency after the circuit closed and function biofilm gradually formated in stage 2 the cod and tn concentrations of effluent rapidly stabilized to 8 07 2 46 mg l and 0 62 0 27 mg l up to the standard of grade iii discharge cod 20 mg l tn 1 mg l gb 3838 2002 during the long term operation fig 7a notably the system also displayed a satisfying tn removal even under high tn concentration concretely achieving 65 38 of tn removal when the influent tn concentration was at the highest 2 9 mg l in stage 2 furthermore cc fecb also performed highly stable and efficient pollutant removal in stage 3 with overall effluent quality up to grade iii in particular despite the reduction of biofilm activity caused by the sudden temperature drop and the introduction of more pollutants by continuous precipitation from 294 d to 328 d fig s5 the tn removal performance of cc fecb was still able to recover in the subsequent operation period this result confirmed the stability and durability of cathode enhanced ecofb mes in practical application beside great performance in cod and tn removal cc fecb also exhibited highly efficient tp removal during the whole operation period it may thank to the promotion of fe3o4 modification cathode in bacterial attachment and enrichment of eab zheng et al 2022 that facilitated the biotransformation of tp ivanov et al 2005 overall the long term stable effluent meeting the grade iii with high cod tn and tp removal efficiency could prove cc fecb to be provided with high efficiency stability and durability in demonstration application do and ph were also important indicators of water quality in practical water remediation and could directly affect the performance of cc fecb as shown in fig 7b do and ph were monitored near and far away from the cathode lower do at the cathode 6 mg l than that in water 7 mg l at the same depth indicated that the microbial metabolism at the cathode was more vigorous meanwhile ph near the cathode was slightly lower than that far away from the cathode caused by the small molecule of acids which were mainly produced by microbial metabolism and secretion of plant roots kouzuma et al 2014 the do and ph which meet the grade iii standards diredtlyreflectd a healthy urban water ecology with the remediation of cc fecb in the 1 year operation furthermore the pollutant removal load of cc fecb was also evaluated by combining the practical test data with model calculation data kosim text s1 and tab s2 in this demonstration application the imported pollutants were mainly from three parts inflow water rainwater surface runoff and sediment diffusion the total amount removal of cod and tn in the 1 year operation were 1255 77 and 88 62 kg hence cod removal load of cathode enhanced ecofb mes was obtained with 37 14 g cod d m2 2 12 times and 2 25 times of that in previous reports of efb mfcs 17 54 g cod d m2 43 25 l yang et al 2021a and 16 5 g cod d m2 0 648 m3 saeed et al 2022 respectively in addition tn removal load of cc fecb 2 62 g tn d m2 was 4 03 times higher than that of surface flow constructed wetland 0 65 0 58 g tn d m2 1040 m2 wei et al 2020 in the remediation of micro polluted water to further discuss the advantages of cc fecb in applications the application cost of economics of cc fecb was analyzed and discussed as described in text s3 in comparison with cc cb the construction cost of cc fecb increased by 3 44 m2 and the removal absolute values of toc tn and tp increased by 2 39 8 33 and 8 07 respectively which highlight the advantage in application cost of cathode enhanced ecofb mes in the practical application above outstanding advantages of high stability strong resistance to pollutant loads shocks excellent efficiency and superior cost advantage of the cathode enhanced ecofb mes made it a very promising candidate technology for ecological remediation in the engineering application 3 3 2 electrochemical performance the electrochemical performance of mes will decay by system scale up from laboratory scale to demonstration scale logan et al 2015 therefore the electrochemical performance of the demonstration scale cathode enhanced ecofb mes was evaluated through long term detection the output voltage current density electrode potential and power density of cc fecb were analyzed and illustrated in figs 8 and s6 the open circuit voltage ocv fig 8 increased from 456 mv at the beginning of stage 1 to 796 mv at the end of stage 1 owing to the increase of electrode potential absolute value fig s6 indicating that the eab gradually accumulated on the electrodes wang et al 2018 when the external resistance decreased from 1000 ω stage 2 to 10 ω stage 3 the current density of cc fecb increased from 0 156 0 002 ma m2 to 8 324 1 063 ma m2 beside a similar boost was also found in the maximum power density pmax from 1 90 mw m2 stage 1 to 3 67 mw m2 stage 3 the boost of current density and power density could be ascribed to the enhanced capability of electron production by continuous enrichment of eab as the external resistance dropped pinto et al 2011 with the same external resistance 200 ω the current density sharply decreased from 62 519 8 988 ma m2 laboratory scale to 0 648 0 008 ma m2 demonstration scale because of the massive ohmic losses in large scale configuration dewan et al 2008 liu et al 2008 although the demonstration scale cathode enhanced ecofb mes only obtained pmax of 3 700 mw m2 much lower than that of lab scale system due to the visible power loss in the scale up of mes dewan et al 2008 it was still comparable to the reported efb mes 6 03 mw m2 yang et al 2021a since its pmax was obtained under an effective volume of only 43 25 l notably the current output of cc fecb still remained stable and efficient despite the obvious variations in water quality and temperature in long term operation suggesting great potential of this system for practical water restoration applications 3 3 3 microbial succession microbial community of the anode and cathode were analyzed to determine the function succession of cc fecb in the long term operation interestingly after a 3 month operation the plant root and cathode were entwined forming a plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode fig s7 which may enhance the tight interaction between root bacteria and cathode bacteria samal et al 2019 due to the high diversity of biofilm with a low abundance in this demonstration test bacteria relative abundances 1 with bioelectricity generation and nitrogen conversion functions at the genus level were added up to obtain the relative abundance of eab and ncb respectively fig 9 details in tab s4 as shown in fig 9a the relative abundance of eab decreased from 5 16 to 4 66 in the anode from stage 1 to stage 2 this was due to the continuous consumption of organic matter in sediment as the toc decreased from 2 24 0 02 to 0 85 0 01 fig s8 so that it cannot provide sufficient electron donors for the anodic eab ewing et al 2017 meanwhile attributed to the promotion of the eab enrichment with fe3o4 modification the cathodic eab showed a visible increase from 4 66 to 14 37 in relative abundance by reducing the abundance of anodic eab the power output showed a sensible improvement from stage 1 to stage 2 fig 8 which was consistent with the abundance changes in cathodic eab this phenomenon implied the importance of cathodic eab for regulating the overall electrochemical performance in stage 3 the abundance of eab was decreased in both cathode 3 96 and anode 2 69 while maintaining a comparable power output to that in stage 2 fig 9a it can be probably explained by the improvement of electron transfer efficiency on the bacteria electrode interface especially on the cathodic interface in addition plant root exudates can also serve as substrates and mediators for accelerating electron transfer at the cathodic interface thus enhancing the power output of cc fecb chiranjeevi et al 2019 microorganisms on the plant root are also able to establish a collaborative relationship with cathodic eab of positive effect on bioelectricity generation in agreement with previous results srivastava et al 2019 yang et al 2021b based on the result of microbial succession cc fecb can enrich eab to form stable and efficient electroactive biofilm in urban water for long term operation so as to achieve continuous electron compensation from sediment to low carbon water for the stability of in situ remediation performance the nitrogen removal potential of cc fecb was improved by the significantly enhanced abundance of ncb in the anode cathode and root from stage 1 to stage 3 fig 9b in particular the ncb on cathode showed greater abundance than those on anode and plant root after the 1 year operation confirming the decisive role of cathode bacteria in nitrogen removal through microbial nitrogen metabolism in cc fecb moreover the gradually accumulated ncb on the cathode led to the increased relative abundance of ncb and presented the highest abundance of 26 21 in stage 3 which suggested the continuous improvement obtained in nitrogen removal performance of cathode fig 9b beside the plant root was also demonstrated to enhance the nitrogen removal by presenting a synergistic interaction with the cathode in nitrogen removal based on the observed similar composition of ncb e g pirellula and pir4 lineage in plant root and cathode eab e g pseudomonas pirellula unclassified f rhodobacteraceae norank f sc i 84 and ncb e g aquicella dechloromonas thiobacillus were simultaneously enriched in both laboratory scale and demonstration scale systems with different abundance this allowed the inference that the electrode biofilm remained to serve the function of bioelectricity production and nitrogen conversion when cc fecb scaled up in summary the enrichment of eab and ncb in cc fecb was achieved after the long term operation and it satisfyingly strengthened the capability of bioelectricity generation and nitrogen removal the cc fecb was again proved to maintain high stability in practical surface water remediation 3 3 4 key functional genes expression the key functional genes in electron transfer process and nitrogen metabolism in cc fecb were further analyzed to reveal the functional succession in the practical application for long term operation fig 10 in the electron transfer process quinone oxidoreductase can catalyze the conversion between nadh and nad and cytochrome c oxidase can directly transfer electrons from respiration substrates to electron acceptors distributed in the cell membrane in stage 1 the genes encoding quinone oxidoreductase nuoa nuob nuoc nuod nuoe nuof nuog nuoh nuoi nuoj nuok nuol nuom nuon nuocd and nuobcd and cytochrome c oxidase coxa coxb coxc coxd and coxac were obtained the highest expression on the anode probably caused by the highest abundance of eab fig 10a indicating the anode biofilm owned the highest electron generating capacity at the same stage weak efficiency of electron transfer between the cathodic biofilm and the cathode could be drawn from the observation of low gene expression on the cathode this may owe to the blocked electron transfer from anode to cathode caused by open circuit condition in stage 1 thus reducing the electron donator for cathodic bacteria fig 10a however after the closed circuit operation the genes encoding quinone oxidoreductase and cytochrome c oxidase obviously decreased in anode while increased in cathode fig 10a this phenomenon illustrated that the efficiency of electron transfer was reduced on the anode but enhanced on the cathode given the same electron flux at anode and cathode this difference in gene expression could demonstrate the lower electron consumption rate at the cathode than the electron production rate at the anode which could further confirm that cathode was the limiting factor in the improvement of current generation in cc fecb in view of the decreased abundance of eab from stage 2 to stage 3 in cathode fe3o4 modification may be responsible for the promotion of the increase in relevant gene expression song et al 2019 overall fe3o4 modification contributed to increasing the gene expression of cathode microorganisms thus enhancing the efficiency of electron utilization at the cathode and ensuring stable and efficient ectopic electron transfer in practical water remediation for long term operation in natural surface water nitrogen removal is accomplished via biological metabolic pathways including denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnra and assimilatory nitrate reduction anra liang et al 2021 scott et al 2008 tao et al 2022a denitrification is driven by key enzymes including nitrate reductase nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase liang et al 2023 from the result depicted in fig 10b that the genes coding for the above enzymes in denitrification showed sensible increasing copies from stage 1 to stage 3 in the cathode and plant root it could be implied that the denitrification capacity of cc fecb was constantly improved during the long term operation beside napab and narghi coding for nitrate reductase in cathode presented a greater abundance than root samples and this result suggested that nitrate was more favorable to convert to nitrite in cathode than in plant root during denitrification wang et al 2020 moreover the increased copies of nirs nirk norb norc and nosz further evidenced the increasing capability of the conversion of nitrite to nitrogen in cathode and plant root after the 1 year operation wu et al 2017 thereby strengthening denitrification for higher tn removal in practical application in the dnra process the nitrite reductase nirb nird catalyzed the conversion of nitrite to ammonia manifested as the increasing abundance in plant roots and cathode in the demonstration operation fig 10b corresponding to the change of nitrate reductase this result confirmed that the nitrate metabolism was enhanced in the plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode through dnra pathway favoring the improvement of nitrogen removal from the practical water however in anra process fig 10b ferredoxin nitrate reductase narb and ferredoxin nitrite reductase nara of plant root presented greater copies in stage 1 and stage 2 than those in stage 3 beneficial to generate more organic ammonia for plant growth the copies of narb and nara sharply decreased in stage 3 when the plants got mature as fig 2c showed this result reflected that the dominant pathway of nitrate reduction in the plant root shifted from andr to denitrification and dnar from stage 2 to stage 3 which can be regarded as the succession of the biological nitrogen metabolic pathway in the plant roots notably with stable copies of functional genes in anra and dnra processes the functional genes for denitrification obtained a continuous boost in copies possibly due to the facilitation of fe3o4 modification on cathode xie et al 2021 in general the high efficiency of eec for nitrogen removal was consistent with the overall high copies of key functional genes for electron transfer and nitrogen metabolism and the high efficiency of eec for nitrogen removal in long term operation was due to the promotion of the key functional gene expression for electron transfer and nitrogen metabolism by fe3o4 modification on cathode 3 4 mechanism of eec for nitrogen removal in cc fecb according to operational evaluation at the laboratory scale and demonstration scale the cathode enhanced ecofb mes cc fecb performed a sensible improvement in terms of decontamination and bioelectricity production efficiency its enhancing mechanism was proposed and illustrated in fig 11 in ecofb mes electrons are generated by electroactive bacteria through the oxidation of organic matter in sediment and then transferred to the cathode across the external circuit the cathodic bacteria can take up the electrons from the cathode to reduce nitrate at the cathode interface thereby achieving electron ectopic compensation for decontamination fe3o4 can reduce the electron transfer resistance to facilitate interfacial electron transfer thus both anode and cathode modification with fe3o4 are able to enhance the efficiency of ectopic electron transfer in ecofb mes yet it should be stressed that the cathode modified ecofb mes performed a more visible improvement of ectopic electron transfer efficiency than the anode modified ecofb mes did considering the different impacts of fe3o4 modification on anode and cathode for interfacial electron transfer the improvement of cathodic electron utilization is more decisive than that of anodic electron generation on the efficiency enhancement of ectopic electron transfer which strongly emphasizes the significance of cathode modification moreover the cathode modified with nano fe3o4 enables to create a favorable living habitat for enriching eab e g pseudomonas pseudarthrobacter and defluviimonas and ncb e g pseudomonas pseudarthrobacter and unclassified f comamonadaceae to facilitate the pollutant removal notably benefiting from fe3o4 some denitrifying bacteria can obtain electrons more efficiently from cathodic eab or directly from cathode to promote denitrification in the condition of electron donor lacking by ectopic electron compensation furthermore fe3o4 for cathode modification can also facilitate the expression of key functional genes concerning electron transfer and nitrogen metabolism in plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode to further ensure the high efficiency and stability in long term engineering application for in situ remediation in summary the fe3o4 modified cathode can greatly boost the eec efficiency in eocfb mes by enriching eab and ncb at cathode as well as promoting the key gene expression for electron transfer and denitrification in plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode this mechanism was the key to guaranteeing great pollutant removal performance of eocfb mes which laid the crucial foundation for realizing stable and durable engineering application of eocfb mes for urban water remediation 4 conclusion in this study an innovative fe3o4 modified cathode enhanced ecofb mes cc fecb was constructed and evaluated both at laboratory and demonstration scales in the laboratory test the removal efficiency of toc tn and tp in cc fecb achieved 81 43 2 05 85 12 1 46 and 59 80 2 27 increased by 4 31 12 38 and 19 83 respectively than those in original ecofb mes cc cb which were also superior to the anode enhanced eocfb mes fecc cb beside the output voltages current density and power density of cc fecb were obviously improved by the fe3o4 modified cathode considering the outstanding performance of cc fecb among all eocfb mess cc fecb was selected for engineering application in a 2300 m2 pond for 1 year operation with the treatment of cc fecb effluent water met the grade iii gb 3838 2002 in stable operation and the removal load of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus of cc fecb reached 37 14 g cod d m2 2 62 g tn d m2 and 0 55 g tp d m2 importantly cc fecb maintained the high abundance of eab and ncb in microbial succession during long term operation thus exhibiting high stability and great resistance against the influences of temperature fluctuation and precipitation overall the cathode enhanced ecofb mes was confirmed with great value and prospect in further practical engineering applications through mechanism analysis the crucial role of cathode modification with fe3o4 was demonstrated that modified cathode remarkably enhanced the enrichment of eab and ncb as well as the expression genes of electron transfer and denitrification in the plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode thus improving the ectopic electron compensation for decontamination in the in situ water remediation this study successfully realized the full scale engineering applications of cathode enhanced ecofb mes at the same time promoted the development of microbial

14810,ecological floating bed coupled with microbial electrochemical system ecofb mes has great application potential in micro polluted water remediation yet limited by low electron transfer efficiency on the microbial electrode interface here an innovative cathode enhanced eocfb mes was constructed with nano fe3o4 modification and applied for in situ remediation both at lab scale 6 l 62 day operation and demonstration scale 2300 m2 1 year operation the cathode enhanced ecofb mes exhibited superior removal in toc 81 43 2 05 tn 85 12 1 46 and tp 59 80 2 27 much better than those of original ecofb mes and anode enhanced ecofb mes in the laboratory test meanwhile cathode enhanced ecofb mes boosted current output by 33 than that of original ecofb mes which made a great contribution to the improvement of ectopic electronic compensation for pollutant decontamination notably cathode enhanced ecofb mes presented high efficiency stability and durability in the demonstration test and fulfilled the average concentration of cod 9 5 2 81 mg l tn 1 00 0 21 mg l and tp 0 10 0 04 mg l of effluent water to meet the grade iii gb 3838 2002 with stable operation stage based on the kosim

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the rising population and urbanization the growing pollutants from urban sewage plants and municipal sewage discharges cause serious urban surface water pollution the polluted surface water severely endangers the water ecology health and safety effective restoration of micro polluted surface water is becoming increasingly intense walker et al 2019 in consideration of the advantages of low carbon sustainability energy free and in situ restoration ecological restoration technologies e g constructed wetland ecological floating bed and microbial technologies are widely studied in surface water treatment zhang et al 2020 among these the ecological floating bed ecofb gradually attracts increasing attention due to its instinctive properties of efficient space utilization and external esthetic values benvenuti et al 2018 samal et al 2019 as demonstrated plant uptake and microbial degradation are mainly responsible for pollutant removal in ecofb hu et al 2020 however the separated location of bio carriers and plant roots in traditional ecofb results in the lack of a coupling function between bio carriers and hydrophytes limiting the exertion of its potential samal et al 2019 in addition the lower microbial biomass caused by infrequent attachment sites on floating bed for microorganisms also weakens the efficiency of ecofb garbett 2005 these indicate that the traditional ecofb has a large room for improvement in pollutant removal performance various strengthening methods have been proposed such as introducing aeration devices elastic packing submerged plants and additional bacteria into the traditional ecofb to solve the aforementioned problems these methods visibly promote the attachment of microorganisms and adsorption of pollutants thereby enhancing the pollutant degradation capacity song et al 2020 zhao et al 2022 but the functional biofilm in these systems often requires a long formation period in its start up stage which may directly influence the further practical application in surface water restoration recently with the capacity of quick functional bacteria enrichment and biofilm formation microbial electrochemical system mes shows great application potential in the in situ surface water ecological restoration qiu et al 2020 to couple with ecofb the anode and cathode of mes are selected to arrange in sediment and water respectively which fully exploits the electron ectopic compensation function of mes and realizes simultaneous removal of pollutants in both sediment and water li et al 2017 meanwhile a positive relationship has been observed between the cathode and plant root specifically 1 the electric field of mes can improve the root growth to enhance the ability of pollutants uptake zhou et al 2018 2 the root exudates could provide additional electron donors or electron mediators to facilitate electron transfer at the electrode interface ji et al 2022 therefore ecofb coupled with mes ecofb mes can be seemed as a promising process for in situ surface water restoration technology yet has rarely been reported the performance of ecofb mes is largely dictated by the extracellular electron transfer eet efficiency of mes especially in engineering applications currently carbon electrodes such as carbon cloth cc and carbon fiber cf are the most suitable electrode candidate materials for the fabrication of engineering scale mes due to their high stability low cost and good biocompatibility nevertheless their limited surface area and electrocatalytic activities are unfavorable to the formation of biofilms and interfacial electron transfer therefore the modification of carbon electrodes by nanomaterials has been proposed as a promising and efficient strategy to enhance electron transfer between microbes and the electrode li et al 2021b zhang et al 2018 current researches on electrode modification mainly focus on anode modification and nano iron oxides e g fe3o4 fe2o3 etc are considered as attractive materials because of their high specific surface area simple synthesis excellent catalytic activity and good biocompatibility jian et al 2020 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2018 the modified anode can facilitate the interfacial electron transfer at the anode stimulating electron generation and transfer to the cathode for the cathodic reduction process nevertheless the electron utilization efficiency of the cathode is often limited by the abundance of electroactive bacteria eab which is considered as the electron acceptor to complete oxygen reduction denitrification and other processes shen et al 2022 this limitation hinders the optimization of the performance in a modified anode enhanced ecofb mes system and from another perspective emphasizes the decisive role of cathode in ecofb mes and the necessity of its modification in optimizing the system in this case cathode modification is regarded as an appealing method to maximize the improvement of ecofb mes by enhancing the electron uptake efficiency of cathode and accelerating the biocathode formation at the cathode however there are scarce relevant researches on the cathode enhanced ecofb mes the enhancing mechanism of the modified cathode is still obscure and remained to be unveiled moreover the engineering application of the cathode enhanced ecofb mes in the practical application has been barely reported in practical surface water remediation based on the consideration of the above issues this study aims to explore the potential of cathode modification enhancing ecofb mes in surface water restoration and the possibility of its application in practical engineering projects firstly a novel nano fe3o4 modified cathode enhancing ecofb mes was innovatively constructed for the treatment of micro polluted surface water then the performance of the obtained ecofb mes was systematically evaluated by both laboratory and field scale experiments finally the involved mechanism of ecofb mes for enhancement of pollutant degradation was revealed by microbial community and functional genes analysis this study not only provides an insightful strategy for designing a more efficient ecofb mes but also offers operational experiences for practical engineering applications of ecofb mes in surface water restoration 2 materials and

cathode enhanced ecofb mes with demonstration scale was operated in 2300 m2 of an urban pond of memorial hall of martyrs in nanning city guangxi province fig 2 a and 2b the cathode enhanced ecofb mes was constructed in the ecological floating bed with an area of 96 6 m2 in the demonstration application fig 2b the fecbs were evenly fixed at the bottom of ecofb as cathodes with a density of 8 pieces

of the calamus during the operation were shown in fig 2c there were three operation stages with different operation conditions table 1 1 stage 1 start up period of the system operated in the open

relevant to electron transfer and nitrogen metabolism were predicted with picrust2 based on 16 s rrna gene abundance combined with kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 modified electrodes the sem images displayed even distribution of nanoparticles with a diameter of 100 nm 200 nm on the surface of carbon fiber in carbon brush fig 3 a and carbon cloth fig 3d from the result of elements mapping in fig 3b 3c 3e and 3f abundant fe and o elements were observed throughout the nanoparticle identifying the nature of iron based nanomaterial fig 3g showed the typical diffraction peaks of fe3o4 at 2θ of 30 076 35 426 43 053 53 411 56 935 and 62 520 corresponding to 2 2 0 3 1 1 4 0 0 4 2 2 5 1 1 and 4 4 0 facets jcpds19 0629 these results indicated that the successful fabrication of fe3o4 was uniformly loaded onto carbon fibers xps and eds were further conducted to explore the composition of the obtained fe3o4 modified carbon fiber the xps high resolution spectra of the fe 2p spectrum of fe3o4 fig 3h contained the main peaks corresponding to fe2 at 710 5 ev fe 2p3 2 and 725 3 ev fe 2p1 2 and the other two peaks corresponding to fe3 at 712 1 ev fe 2p3 2 and 725 3 ev fe 2p1 2 ma et al 2017 the area ratio of fe2 to fe3 was close to 1 2 similar to the atom ratio in fe3o4 further supporting the existence of fe3o4 as identified by xrd patterns however the atomic ratios of fe and o in carbon cloth and carbon brush were both 1 2 67 fig s1 this little excess stoichiometric ratio of oxygen might owe to the introduction of the acid pretreatment process which could boost the interfacial electron transfer between the microorganism and the electrode li et al 2019 in addition the high content of oxygen containing groups contributed to improving the hydrophilicity of fecc seen from the lower contact angle of fecc than that of cc 41 5 vs 144 1 fig 3i the improved hydrophilicity could facilitate the bacteria adhesion to establish functional biofilm li et al 2020a 2020b above results revealed that uniform fe3o4 modified engineering scale carbon electrodes were successfully prepared with high oxygen content and high hydrophilicity which would act as the key module for the construction of ecofb mes to restore micro polluted urban surface water 3 2 performance assessment of cc fecb in lab scale 3 2 1 carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance fe3o4 enhanced ecofb mess were constructed at laboratory scale to investigate pollution removal as the basis for further practical applications five reactors were evaluated towards the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus removal performances with different resistances 1000 ω 500 ω 200 ω 100 ω overall all reactors obtained the highest toc and tn removal with 200 ω thus 200 ω was determined as the optimal external resistance in the following experiments fig s2 interestingly obvious differences in pollutant removal performance were observed in the five reactors seen from fig s2 the cathode enhanced ecofb mes stood out from the five reactors attaining the lowest effluent concentration of toc tn and tp as well as realizing the water quality improvement from grade v to grade iii discharge cod 20 mg l tn 1 mg l tp 0 2 mg l gb 3838 2002 of surface water environmental quality standard of china sweqs specifically toc tn and tp removals in cc fecb were 81 43 2 05 85 12 1 46 and 59 80 2 27 fig 4 a 4b and 4c increased by 4 31 12 38 and 19 83 than those in cc cb respectively notably the performance of cc fecb surpassed fecc cb with 5 78 higher tn removal and 5 07 higher tp removal indicating that fe3o4 application in modifying cathodes could contribute more effectively to the enhancement of ecofb mes rather than modifying anodes moreover cc fecb showed a comparable pollutant removal with fecc fecb confirming that the fe3o4 modified cathode played a prominent role in the improvement of ecofb mes on pollutant removal this phenomenon has never been reported in previous literatures the cathode modified enhanced ecofb mes might be a brand new strategy for practical application in the remediation process of micro polluted surface water to further reveal the advantage of fe3o4 modified cathode for tn removal in ecofb mes nitrogen with different forms were particularly studied in different ecofb mess fig 4d showed that the nh4 n concentration of effluent in cc fecb continuously decreased to the value of 0 041 0 002 mg l after an operation cycle which had a negligible difference with that in cc cb 0 048 0 006 mg l no2 n also showed a similar content change during the operation cycle and there was no evident difference in concentration all 0 015 mg l among the four ecofb mess however cc fecb exhibited higher nitrification efficiency than cc cb and fecc cb with no3 n effluent concentration of 0 371 0 010 mg l being 29 93 and 12 97 lower than that of cc cb and fecc cb respectively meanwhile its no3 n concentration was comparable with fecc fecb which solidly identified the major contribution of fe3o4 modified cathode in ecofb mes in aerobic condition nh4 n and no2 n in ecofb mes tended to transform to no3 n and reached relatively low concentrations suggesting that tn removal mainly depended on the removal of no3 n by microbial denitrification in ecofb mes the higher tn removal in cc fecb indicated greater contribution of fe3o4 modified cathode to the denitrification process qingwei and weihong 2022 3 2 2 bioelectricity generation tn removal is often limited by the lack of carbon sources as electron donors in low carbon surface water ecofb mes can realize ectopic electronic compensation eec by transferring electrons from anode in sediment to the cathode for tn removal improvement thus the electrochemical performance was tightly related to the tn removal in ecofb mes the output voltage electrode potential current density and power density were measured and analyzed to assess the different effects of fe3o4 modified electrodes on electrochemical performance fig 5 during the operation cc fecb showed a remarkable improvement in output voltage current density and power density than cc cb and fecc cb specifically the average open circuit voltage ocv of cc fecb was 707 00 40 14 mv fig 5a being 206 25 mv 97 50 mv and 22 75 mv higher than that of cc cb 500 75 59 86 mv cc fecb 609 50 40 35 mv and fecc fecb 684 25 53 65 mv respectively this phenomenon demonstrated that fe3o4 modified cathode could shorten the start up time of ecofb mes yu et al 2019 under the condition of 200 ω for best contaminant removal the output voltage of cc fecb 288 0 42 63 mv was 36 39 higher than that of cc cb and the corresponding current density of cc fecb reached 36 01 5 33 ma m2 which could be regarded as a remarkable enhancement for current output in ecofb mes moreover cc fecb kept a continuous improvement in current density when the resistance decreased from 200 ω to 100 ω while the current density of fecc cb showed a slight decrease it was since the electron consumption efficiency on cathode was lower than the electron producing efficiency on fe3o4 modified anode in fecc cb leading to insufficient utilization of the generated electrons therefore the interfacial electron transfer of cathode could be reasonably inferred as the limiting factor for the improvement of overall electrochemical performance although fecc fecb was slightly superior to cc fecb in terms of current output there was no obvious difference observed in tn removal between these two systems indicating that cc fecb was more efficient in ectopic electronic compensation for tn removal and more sustainable in ecological remediation under limited substrate conditions in addition the maximum power density pmax obtained from the polarization curve of 29 39 0 29 mw m2 1 99 times than 14 79 0 45 mw m2 of cc cb further confirmed the significant improvement effect on power generation of cc fecb figs 5d and s3 such excellent electron transfer efficiency of ecofb mes with fe3o4 modified cathodes enabled the simultaneous promotion of pollutant removal both in water and sediment 3 2 3 microbial community analysis pollutant removal and bioelectricity generation were tightly associated with the functional bacteria including nitrogen converting bacteria ncb and electroactive bacteria eab hence electrodic microbial community was analyzed at genus level to reveal the enhancement mechanism of fe3o4 modified electrodes in ecofb mes the alpha diversity indexes of the anode and cathode from the four ecofb mes were listed in table 3 the gene library coverage of each sample was in excess of 0 98 indicating that the depth of sequencing in each sample could cover the vast majority of species in all samples zhou et al 2014 the sobs results suggested that fe3o4 modification was favorable to microbial attachment yang et al 2022 meanwhile the shannon index ace index and chao 1 index and simpson index all demonstrated that microbial diversity and richness were more abundant in samples within fe3o4 modification yang et al 2022 whichfurther confirmed that fe3o4 could contribute to enhancing the microbial diversity and abundance of electrodic biofilms in ecofb mes bacterial phyla of the cathode samples in ecofb mess were analyzed in phylum level fig 6 a in cc fecb proteobacteria 66 77 actinobacteriota 10 38 bacteroidota 5 96 chloroflexi 5 57 acidobacteriota 3 18 and firmicutes 1 43 were the dominant bacteria in the cathode sample among them chloroflexi with the function of autotrophic denitrification deng et al 2020 ge et al 2020 were 1 80 times than that of cc cb 3 08 in terms of relative abundance of cathode samples contributing to enhancing the nitrogen conversion capacity actinobacteriota tao et al 2022c which involved in bioelectricity generation and nitrogen cycle obtained a sensible enrichment in the cathode samples of cc fecb 10 38 than that of cc cb 6 98 these results demonstrated the crucial role of fe3o4 in enriching the abundance of eab and ncb for superior cathodic electrochemical performance and tn removal in ecofb mes moreover from the results of genus level identification by heatmap analysis fig 6b a series of nitrogen converting bacteria including unclassified f comamonadaceae sotres et al 2016 desulfobacterium zhong et al 2020 pseudomonas liang et al 2019 pseudarthrobacter wu et al 2020 were abundantly enriched in cc fecb capable of achieving superior tn removal in cc fecb than that of cc cb this further confirmed the vital function of fe3o4 in the enrichment of denitrifying microorganisms at the cathode to improve tn removal in short the electron transfer at the cathode interface and cathodic nitrogen conversion efficiency were both strengthened in cc fecb which was consistent with the satisfactory pollutant removal performance of cc fecb as mentioned above as for anode samples in phylum level fig 6c displayed that fecc cb and fecc fecb obtained dramatic enrichment of chloroflexi and desulfobacterota than those of cc cb again confirming that fe3o4 made an essential contribution to the enrichment of eab and nitrifying bacteria notably in cc fecb the abundance of chloroflexi deng et al 2020 ge et al 2020 and desulfobacterota ren et al 2022 capable of electron generation in anode samples were 2 02 folds and 2 28 folds of those of cc cb and nitrospirota tao et al 2022b with nitrification function also possessed higher abundance in cc fecb than cc cb fig 6c these phenomenons indicated that cc fecb possessed great efficiency of nitrification in sediment as well as electron generation by anodic biofilm even without anode modification interestingly it was noteworthy that the abundance of anodic eab in cc fecb was well comparable to that of fecc cb seen from fig 6c the increased electron utilization capacity of ncb and eab at the cathode stimulates the increased electron production capacity at the anode leading to an enrichment of electron producing bacteria at the anode in cc fecb this combined enhancing effect of both electrodes in cc fecb resulted in performance not inferior to fecc cb further proving that the cathode modification was the determining factor to improve electrochemical performance and pollution removal of the whole system in addition at genus level taking pseudomonas which both belonged to eab as the strong evidence fig 6d its enrichment in anode can enhance the efficiency of electron production in cc fecb thus the increased electron generation by anodic eab can facilitate the eec in cathode leading to better tn removal performance of cc fecb the enhancement of both denitrification and electron transfer efficiency further emphasized the significance of cathode modification for optimizing ecofb mes summing up the above evaluations of pollutant removal electrochemical performance and microbial community analysis in lab tests the cathode enhanced ecofb mes cc fecb could be preliminarily determined as the optimal ecofb mes with comprehensive advantages it provided the basis for subsequent engineering scale tests on the application of cc fecb in practical surface water remediation 3 2 4 ecological safety evaluation with satisfying eec efficiency cc fecb could be regarded as a promising ecological remediation system for practical water remediation applications however the ecological safety of nano fe3o4 modified electrode application must be considered the vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition assay was selected to acess the eco safety of cc fecb as fig s4a displayed the luminescence intensity increased at 5 min with different external resistances due to the multiplication of vibrio fischeri also it exhibited a slight decrease in different external resistances in 15 min with inhibition all lower than 4 confirming the eco safety of cc fecb during the operation in addition the total iron ion concentration in the effluent was about 3 μg l fig s4b during the operation much lower than the grade iii standard of the sweqs gb 3838 2002 discharge 0 3 mg l all above results provided strong evidence for the reliable ecological safety of fe3o4 modified cathodes and further illustrated the feasibility and great potential of cc fecb in engineering applications based on the efficient eec efficiency and excellent ecological safety cc fecb was scaled up for application in the test of urban water remediation 3 3 performance evaluation of cc fecb in urban water remediation 3 3 1 remediation performance the engineering scale of cc fecb was constructed and operated in a 2300 m2 urban micro polluted surface water grade iv sweqs for 1 year fig 7 during the first 56 days of the start up period stage 1 the cathode enhanced ecofb mes presented inefficient removal in terms of cod and tn fig 7a specifically the average cod concentration 21 50 10 33 mg l failed to meet the grade iv water standards in the early stage 1 0 56 d and tn removal was only 12 50 with a concentration of 2 8 mg l in outflow of after the 4 week operation these results could be probably attributed to the immature cathodic biofilms and low uptake capacity of plant roots also the electron transfer from anode to cathode was blocked by the open circuit operating conditions in stage 1 causing inhibition of the pollutant removal efficiency after the circuit closed and function biofilm gradually formated in stage 2 the cod and tn concentrations of effluent rapidly stabilized to 8 07 2 46 mg l and 0 62 0 27 mg l up to the standard of grade iii discharge cod 20 mg l tn 1 mg l gb 3838 2002 during the long term operation fig 7a notably the system also displayed a satisfying tn removal even under high tn concentration concretely achieving 65 38 of tn removal when the influent tn concentration was at the highest 2 9 mg l in stage 2 furthermore cc fecb also performed highly stable and efficient pollutant removal in stage 3 with overall effluent quality up to grade iii in particular despite the reduction of biofilm activity caused by the sudden temperature drop and the introduction of more pollutants by continuous precipitation from 294 d to 328 d fig s5 the tn removal performance of cc fecb was still able to recover in the subsequent operation period this result confirmed the stability and durability of cathode enhanced ecofb mes in practical application beside great performance in cod and tn removal cc fecb also exhibited highly efficient tp removal during the whole operation period it may thank to the promotion of fe3o4 modification cathode in bacterial attachment and enrichment of eab zheng et al 2022 that facilitated the biotransformation of tp ivanov et al 2005 overall the long term stable effluent meeting the grade iii with high cod tn and tp removal efficiency could prove cc fecb to be provided with high efficiency stability and durability in demonstration application do and ph were also important indicators of water quality in practical water remediation and could directly affect the performance of cc fecb as shown in fig 7b do and ph were monitored near and far away from the cathode lower do at the cathode 6 mg l than that in water 7 mg l at the same depth indicated that the microbial metabolism at the cathode was more vigorous meanwhile ph near the cathode was slightly lower than that far away from the cathode caused by the small molecule of acids which were mainly produced by microbial metabolism and secretion of plant roots kouzuma et al 2014 the do and ph which meet the grade iii standards diredtlyreflectd a healthy urban water ecology with the remediation of cc fecb in the 1 year operation furthermore the pollutant removal load of cc fecb was also evaluated by combining the practical test data with model calculation data kosim text s1 and tab s2 in this demonstration application the imported pollutants were mainly from three parts inflow water rainwater surface runoff and sediment diffusion the total amount removal of cod and tn in the 1 year operation were 1255 77 and 88 62 kg hence cod removal load of cathode enhanced ecofb mes was obtained with 37 14 g cod d m2 2 12 times and 2 25 times of that in previous reports of efb mfcs 17 54 g cod d m2 43 25 l yang et al 2021a and 16 5 g cod d m2 0 648 m3 saeed et al 2022 respectively in addition tn removal load of cc fecb 2 62 g tn d m2 was 4 03 times higher than that of surface flow constructed wetland 0 65 0 58 g tn d m2 1040 m2 wei et al 2020 in the remediation of micro polluted water to further discuss the advantages of cc fecb in applications the application cost of economics of cc fecb was analyzed and discussed as described in text s3 in comparison with cc cb the construction cost of cc fecb increased by 3 44 m2 and the removal absolute values of toc tn and tp increased by 2 39 8 33 and 8 07 respectively which highlight the advantage in application cost of cathode enhanced ecofb mes in the practical application above outstanding advantages of high stability strong resistance to pollutant loads shocks excellent efficiency and superior cost advantage of the cathode enhanced ecofb mes made it a very promising candidate technology for ecological remediation in the engineering application 3 3 2 electrochemical performance the electrochemical performance of mes will decay by system scale up from laboratory scale to demonstration scale logan et al 2015 therefore the electrochemical performance of the demonstration scale cathode enhanced ecofb mes was evaluated through long term detection the output voltage current density electrode potential and power density of cc fecb were analyzed and illustrated in figs 8 and s6 the open circuit voltage ocv fig 8 increased from 456 mv at the beginning of stage 1 to 796 mv at the end of stage 1 owing to the increase of electrode potential absolute value fig s6 indicating that the eab gradually accumulated on the electrodes wang et al 2018 when the external resistance decreased from 1000 ω stage 2 to 10 ω stage 3 the current density of cc fecb increased from 0 156 0 002 ma m2 to 8 324 1 063 ma m2 beside a similar boost was also found in the maximum power density pmax from 1 90 mw m2 stage 1 to 3 67 mw m2 stage 3 the boost of current density and power density could be ascribed to the enhanced capability of electron production by continuous enrichment of eab as the external resistance dropped pinto et al 2011 with the same external resistance 200 ω the current density sharply decreased from 62 519 8 988 ma m2 laboratory scale to 0 648 0 008 ma m2 demonstration scale because of the massive ohmic losses in large scale configuration dewan et al 2008 liu et al 2008 although the demonstration scale cathode enhanced ecofb mes only obtained pmax of 3 700 mw m2 much lower than that of lab scale system due to the visible power loss in the scale up of mes dewan et al 2008 it was still comparable to the reported efb mes 6 03 mw m2 yang et al 2021a since its pmax was obtained under an effective volume of only 43 25 l notably the current output of cc fecb still remained stable and efficient despite the obvious variations in water quality and temperature in long term operation suggesting great potential of this system for practical water restoration applications 3 3 3 microbial succession microbial community of the anode and cathode were analyzed to determine the function succession of cc fecb in the long term operation interestingly after a 3 month operation the plant root and cathode were entwined forming a plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode fig s7 which may enhance the tight interaction between root bacteria and cathode bacteria samal et al 2019 due to the high diversity of biofilm with a low abundance in this demonstration test bacteria relative abundances 1 with bioelectricity generation and nitrogen conversion functions at the genus level were added up to obtain the relative abundance of eab and ncb respectively fig 9 details in tab s4 as shown in fig 9a the relative abundance of eab decreased from 5 16 to 4 66 in the anode from stage 1 to stage 2 this was due to the continuous consumption of organic matter in sediment as the toc decreased from 2 24 0 02 to 0 85 0 01 fig s8 so that it cannot provide sufficient electron donors for the anodic eab ewing et al 2017 meanwhile attributed to the promotion of the eab enrichment with fe3o4 modification the cathodic eab showed a visible increase from 4 66 to 14 37 in relative abundance by reducing the abundance of anodic eab the power output showed a sensible improvement from stage 1 to stage 2 fig 8 which was consistent with the abundance changes in cathodic eab this phenomenon implied the importance of cathodic eab for regulating the overall electrochemical performance in stage 3 the abundance of eab was decreased in both cathode 3 96 and anode 2 69 while maintaining a comparable power output to that in stage 2 fig 9a it can be probably explained by the improvement of electron transfer efficiency on the bacteria electrode interface especially on the cathodic interface in addition plant root exudates can also serve as substrates and mediators for accelerating electron transfer at the cathodic interface thus enhancing the power output of cc fecb chiranjeevi et al 2019 microorganisms on the plant root are also able to establish a collaborative relationship with cathodic eab of positive effect on bioelectricity generation in agreement with previous results srivastava et al 2019 yang et al 2021b based on the result of microbial succession cc fecb can enrich eab to form stable and efficient electroactive biofilm in urban water for long term operation so as to achieve continuous electron compensation from sediment to low carbon water for the stability of in situ remediation performance the nitrogen removal potential of cc fecb was improved by the significantly enhanced abundance of ncb in the anode cathode and root from stage 1 to stage 3 fig 9b in particular the ncb on cathode showed greater abundance than those on anode and plant root after the 1 year operation confirming the decisive role of cathode bacteria in nitrogen removal through microbial nitrogen metabolism in cc fecb moreover the gradually accumulated ncb on the cathode led to the increased relative abundance of ncb and presented the highest abundance of 26 21 in stage 3 which suggested the continuous improvement obtained in nitrogen removal performance of cathode fig 9b beside the plant root was also demonstrated to enhance the nitrogen removal by presenting a synergistic interaction with the cathode in nitrogen removal based on the observed similar composition of ncb e g pirellula and pir4 lineage in plant root and cathode eab e g pseudomonas pirellula unclassified f rhodobacteraceae norank f sc i 84 and ncb e g aquicella dechloromonas thiobacillus were simultaneously enriched in both laboratory scale and demonstration scale systems with different abundance this allowed the inference that the electrode biofilm remained to serve the function of bioelectricity production and nitrogen conversion when cc fecb scaled up in summary the enrichment of eab and ncb in cc fecb was achieved after the long term operation and it satisfyingly strengthened the capability of bioelectricity generation and nitrogen removal the cc fecb was again proved to maintain high stability in practical surface water remediation 3 3 4 key functional genes expression the key functional genes in electron transfer process and nitrogen metabolism in cc fecb were further analyzed to reveal the functional succession in the practical application for long term operation fig 10 in the electron transfer process quinone oxidoreductase can catalyze the conversion between nadh and nad and cytochrome c oxidase can directly transfer electrons from respiration substrates to electron acceptors distributed in the cell membrane in stage 1 the genes encoding quinone oxidoreductase nuoa nuob nuoc nuod nuoe nuof nuog nuoh nuoi nuoj nuok nuol nuom nuon nuocd and nuobcd and cytochrome c oxidase coxa coxb coxc coxd and coxac were obtained the highest expression on the anode probably caused by the highest abundance of eab fig 10a indicating the anode biofilm owned the highest electron generating capacity at the same stage weak efficiency of electron transfer between the cathodic biofilm and the cathode could be drawn from the observation of low gene expression on the cathode this may owe to the blocked electron transfer from anode to cathode caused by open circuit condition in stage 1 thus reducing the electron donator for cathodic bacteria fig 10a however after the closed circuit operation the genes encoding quinone oxidoreductase and cytochrome c oxidase obviously decreased in anode while increased in cathode fig 10a this phenomenon illustrated that the efficiency of electron transfer was reduced on the anode but enhanced on the cathode given the same electron flux at anode and cathode this difference in gene expression could demonstrate the lower electron consumption rate at the cathode than the electron production rate at the anode which could further confirm that cathode was the limiting factor in the improvement of current generation in cc fecb in view of the decreased abundance of eab from stage 2 to stage 3 in cathode fe3o4 modification may be responsible for the promotion of the increase in relevant gene expression song et al 2019 overall fe3o4 modification contributed to increasing the gene expression of cathode microorganisms thus enhancing the efficiency of electron utilization at the cathode and ensuring stable and efficient ectopic electron transfer in practical water remediation for long term operation in natural surface water nitrogen removal is accomplished via biological metabolic pathways including denitrification dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnra and assimilatory nitrate reduction anra liang et al 2021 scott et al 2008 tao et al 2022a denitrification is driven by key enzymes including nitrate reductase nitrite reductase nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase liang et al 2023 from the result depicted in fig 10b that the genes coding for the above enzymes in denitrification showed sensible increasing copies from stage 1 to stage 3 in the cathode and plant root it could be implied that the denitrification capacity of cc fecb was constantly improved during the long term operation beside napab and narghi coding for nitrate reductase in cathode presented a greater abundance than root samples and this result suggested that nitrate was more favorable to convert to nitrite in cathode than in plant root during denitrification wang et al 2020 moreover the increased copies of nirs nirk norb norc and nosz further evidenced the increasing capability of the conversion of nitrite to nitrogen in cathode and plant root after the 1 year operation wu et al 2017 thereby strengthening denitrification for higher tn removal in practical application in the dnra process the nitrite reductase nirb nird catalyzed the conversion of nitrite to ammonia manifested as the increasing abundance in plant roots and cathode in the demonstration operation fig 10b corresponding to the change of nitrate reductase this result confirmed that the nitrate metabolism was enhanced in the plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode through dnra pathway favoring the improvement of nitrogen removal from the practical water however in anra process fig 10b ferredoxin nitrate reductase narb and ferredoxin nitrite reductase nara of plant root presented greater copies in stage 1 and stage 2 than those in stage 3 beneficial to generate more organic ammonia for plant growth the copies of narb and nara sharply decreased in stage 3 when the plants got mature as fig 2c showed this result reflected that the dominant pathway of nitrate reduction in the plant root shifted from andr to denitrification and dnar from stage 2 to stage 3 which can be regarded as the succession of the biological nitrogen metabolic pathway in the plant roots notably with stable copies of functional genes in anra and dnra processes the functional genes for denitrification obtained a continuous boost in copies possibly due to the facilitation of fe3o4 modification on cathode xie et al 2021 in general the high efficiency of eec for nitrogen removal was consistent with the overall high copies of key functional genes for electron transfer and nitrogen metabolism and the high efficiency of eec for nitrogen removal in long term operation was due to the promotion of the key functional gene expression for electron transfer and nitrogen metabolism by fe3o4 modification on cathode 3 4 mechanism of eec for nitrogen removal in cc fecb according to operational evaluation at the laboratory scale and demonstration scale the cathode enhanced ecofb mes cc fecb performed a sensible improvement in terms of decontamination and bioelectricity production efficiency its enhancing mechanism was proposed and illustrated in fig 11 in ecofb mes electrons are generated by electroactive bacteria through the oxidation of organic matter in sediment and then transferred to the cathode across the external circuit the cathodic bacteria can take up the electrons from the cathode to reduce nitrate at the cathode interface thereby achieving electron ectopic compensation for decontamination fe3o4 can reduce the electron transfer resistance to facilitate interfacial electron transfer thus both anode and cathode modification with fe3o4 are able to enhance the efficiency of ectopic electron transfer in ecofb mes yet it should be stressed that the cathode modified ecofb mes performed a more visible improvement of ectopic electron transfer efficiency than the anode modified ecofb mes did considering the different impacts of fe3o4 modification on anode and cathode for interfacial electron transfer the improvement of cathodic electron utilization is more decisive than that of anodic electron generation on the efficiency enhancement of ectopic electron transfer which strongly emphasizes the significance of cathode modification moreover the cathode modified with nano fe3o4 enables to create a favorable living habitat for enriching eab e g pseudomonas pseudarthrobacter and defluviimonas and ncb e g pseudomonas pseudarthrobacter and unclassified f comamonadaceae to facilitate the pollutant removal notably benefiting from fe3o4 some denitrifying bacteria can obtain electrons more efficiently from cathodic eab or directly from cathode to promote denitrification in the condition of electron donor lacking by ectopic electron compensation furthermore fe3o4 for cathode modification can also facilitate the expression of key functional genes concerning electron transfer and nitrogen metabolism in plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode to further ensure the high efficiency and stability in long term engineering application for in situ remediation in summary the fe3o4 modified cathode can greatly boost the eec efficiency in eocfb mes by enriching eab and ncb at cathode as well as promoting the key gene expression for electron transfer and denitrification in plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode this mechanism was the key to guaranteeing great pollutant removal performance of eocfb mes which laid the crucial foundation for realizing stable and durable engineering application of eocfb mes for urban water remediation 4 conclusion in this study an innovative fe3o4 modified cathode enhanced ecofb mes cc fecb was constructed and evaluated both at laboratory and demonstration scales in the laboratory test the removal efficiency of toc tn and tp in cc fecb achieved 81 43 2 05 85 12 1 46 and 59 80 2 27 increased by 4 31 12 38 and 19 83 respectively than those in original ecofb mes cc cb which were also superior to the anode enhanced eocfb mes fecc cb beside the output voltages current density and power density of cc fecb were obviously improved by the fe3o4 modified cathode considering the outstanding performance of cc fecb among all eocfb mess cc fecb was selected for engineering application in a 2300 m2 pond for 1 year operation with the treatment of cc fecb effluent water met the grade iii gb 3838 2002 in stable operation and the removal load of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus of cc fecb reached 37 14 g cod d m2 2 62 g tn d m2 and 0 55 g tp d m2 importantly cc fecb maintained the high abundance of eab and ncb in microbial succession during long term operation thus exhibiting high stability and great resistance against the influences of temperature fluctuation and precipitation overall the cathode enhanced ecofb mes was confirmed with great value and prospect in further practical engineering applications through mechanism analysis the crucial role of cathode modification with fe3o4 was demonstrated that modified cathode remarkably enhanced the enrichment of eab and ncb as well as the expression genes of electron transfer and denitrification in the plant root assisted fe3o4 modified cathode thus improving the ectopic electron compensation for decontamination in the in situ water remediation this study successfully realized the full scale engineering applications of cathode enhanced ecofb mes at the same time promoted the development of microbial

14811,janus membranes with asymmetric wettability have attracted wide attentions for their robust anti oil wetting fouling abilities in membrane distillation md compared to traditional surface modification approaches in this study we provided a new approach which manipulated surfactant induced wetting to fabricate janus membrane with a controllable thickness of the hydrophilic layer the membranes with 10 20 and 40 μm of wetted layers were obtained by stopping the wetting induced by 40 mg l 1 triton x 100 j 25 l m 2 h 1 at about 15 40 and 120 s respectively then the wetted layers were coated using polydopamine pda to fabricate the janus membranes the resulting janus membranes showed no significant change in porosities or pore size distributions compared with the virgin pvdf membrane these janus membranes exhibited low in air water contact angles 50 high underwater oil contact angles 145 and low adhesion with oil droplets therefore they all showed excellent oil water separation performance with 100 rejection and stable flux the janus membranes showed no significant decline in flux but a trade off existed between the hydrophilic layer thicknesses and the vapor flux utilizing membranes with tunable hydrophilic layer thickness we elucidated the underlying mechanism of such trade off in mass transfer furthermore the successful modification of membranes with different coatings and in situ immobilization of silver nanoparticles indicated that this facile modification method is universal and can be further expanded for multifunctional membrane fabrication graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation janus membrane surfactant induced wetting hydrophilic layer thickness oct data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane distillation md a membrane based technology driven by vapor pressure differences is promising in high salinity wastewater treatment zero liquid discharge resource recovery etc chen et al 2014 liao et al 2020 in a typical md a porous hydrophobic membrane separates the hot feed and the cold distillate and retains non volatile substances alkhudhiri et al 2012 qasim et al 2021 wang and chung 2015 however the hydrophobic membrane is of good affinity to oil due to hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction lokare et al 2017 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 the oil droplets can easily adhere to the surface of the hydrophobic membrane and wick into the membrane pores causing pore blocking i e fouling and direct passages of feed liquid i e wetting resulting in decreases in vapor flux and rejection chew et al 2019 wang et al 2016a wang and lin 2017 therefore md is limited in the application of oil containing wastewater e g shale gas wastewater du et al 2018 horseman et al 2020 shaffer et al 2013 one way to eliminate wetting and fouling induced by oil is to prevent oil droplets from directly contacting with hydrophobic membranes a hydrophilic layer which contains a high proportion of water could act as a barrier against the attachment of oil droplets due to the immiscibility of oil and water chen et al 2021 chew et al 2017 gong et al 2022 shao et al 2020 sun et al 2019 thus the fabrication of a janus membrane whose one side is in air hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic and the other side is in air hydrophobic is an effective solution to resist oil induced fouling and wetting li et al 2020 2021 qing et al 2020 with the hydrophilic layer oil droplets cannot directly contact with the hydrophobic part of the membrane thereby avoiding the oil induced wetting and fouling therefore janus membrane is promising in md to treat oil containing wastewater the preparation of janus membrane generally involves dip coating plasma treatment electrospinning spraying grafting casting and other approaches of imparting specific wettability to membranes afsari et al 2021 chew et al 2019 the hydrophilicity of membrane is often tuned by controlling the hydrophilic layer thickness su et al 2021 wang et al 2020 however there is still a lack of an ideal method for preparing a janus membrane with a thickness controllable hydrophilic layer afsari et al 2021 chew et al 2019 for example surface coating or incorporation could hardly control the thickness of the hydrophilic layer on a hydrophobic substrate and may have the risk of

dose and time the delamination problem needs to be resolved su et al 2021 yan et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 and the uncontrollable operations may cause pore clogging and defects and subsequent pore wetting during operations chew et al 2019 hou et al 2018 wang et al 2019b casting can also control the layer thickness but it requires specialized equipment and the resulting membrane may show defects in long term operation liu et al 2018 in addition these methods can hardly modify commercial membranes in situ which may also cause delamination and loss in use chen et al 2016 jiang et al 2020 therefore it is imperative to develop an in situ and facile method to fabricate the janus membrane with thickness controllable hydrophilic layer previous studies gryta 2007 rezaei et al 2018 shao et al 2021 have reported that surfactant induced wetting is a process of gradually introducing feed solution into and filling the membrane pores which is determined by the transport of surfactant molecules this progressive process often takes several or tens of minutes chen et al 2017 luo et al 2023 shao et al 2021 depending on membrane thickness and surfactant types and concentration this inspired us to manipulate surfactant induced wetting to create a wetted layer with a controllable thickness inside the membrane pores and then hydrophilization modified the wetted layer to obtain a thickness controllable janus membrane in addition since both the surfactant induced wetting and the hydrophilization occurred inside the membranes this approach may enable an in situ preparation of

fabricate janus membrane with a thickness controllable hydrophilic layer 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials and chemicals a hydrophobic pvdf membrane millipore ipvh00010 with a nominal pore size of 0 45 μm and a thickness of 116 2 μm was used triton x 100 and dopamine hydrochloride da hcl were obtained from sigma aldrich tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris hcl and mineral oil were acquired from aladdin shanghai china hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium chloride nacl were purchased from sinopharm shanghai china 2 2 dcmd system a laboratory scale set of direct contact membrane distillate dcmd system was employed for the test of membrane performances fig s1 a customized flat sheet membrane module was made of acrylic with an effective membrane area of 1 5 6 cm2 the cross flow rates of feed and distillate streams were controlled by two gear pumps wt3000 1jb longer china the temperature set for the feed was maintained by a digital thermostatic magnetic hotplate stirrer rct digital ika germany at 60 or 70 c and that for the distillate was maintained by a chiller dc0510 cnshp china at 20 c the flux of the system was determined by the mass increase of the distillate measured by a digital balance ah a3002g anheng china and the conductivity of the distillate was monitored by a conductivity meter sin tds310 sinomeasure china for rejection determination 2 3 in situ preparation of janus membrane when preparing the janus membrane the initial feed was 0 6 mol l 1 nacl solution and the feed and distillate temperature were 60 and 20 c respectively fig 1 a the vapor flux of the system was approximately at 25 l m 2 h 1 a certain concentration of surfactant 40 ppm triton x 100 in this study was added to induce surface wetting of the membrane fig 1b in fact some other surfactants are also acceptable in appropriate concentration ranges the optical coherence tomography oct was employed to observe the thickness of the wetted layer during the wetting process shao et al 2021 shi et al 2022 when the membrane pores were gradually filled with liquid the gas liquid interface advanced into the membrane pores and the corresponding oct image showed two bright bands of membrane surface and gas liquid interface fig s2 the distance between the two bright bands was considered as the wetted layer thickness membranes with different wetted layer thicknesses were obtained by controlling the wetting duration the local wetting rates were relatively consistent leading to an even wetted layer the change in wettability of the hydrophobic membrane by the surfactant cannot be maintained it would recover with the desorption of the surfactant or the drying of the membrane chang et al 2022 so the wetted layer needs to be hydrophilization modified due to the strong adhesion and good hydrophilicity polydopamine pda is usually used for hydrophilization modification chew et al 2017 2018 liu et al 2019 the feed was replaced with a da containing modification solution without heating fig 1c and the modification was carried out by circulating cross flow for 6 h the da modification solution was obtained by dissolving 0 4 g da hcl in 200 ml of 10 mm tris hcl buffer solution ph 8 5 adjusted with hydrochloric acid during the modification process da polymerizes as pda and deposited on the surface and the pore wall of the hydrophilic layer after the modification the feed was changed to deionized water to remove the residual pda particles fig 1d and the janus membrane with a controllable hydrophilic layer thickness 10 20 40 μm was obtained as janus 10 janus 20 and janus 40 membrane 2 4 preparation of janus p and janus ag membrane to verify the generalizability of this approach a self made hydrophobic ptfe membrane qing et al 2017 was modified following up the steps described in section 2 3 as reported in a previous study chen et al 2021 to achieve a better hydrophilization effect the modification solution was changed to a pda pei mixture solution dissolving 2 g l 1 dopamine and 2 g l 1 pei in 10 mm tris hcl buffer at ph 8 5 and heated at 85 c and the resulting membrane was denoted as janus p membrane we also prepared a janus ag membrane by in situ immobilization to enhance the biofouling resistance the freshly coated janus 20 membrane was rinsed with deionized water before it was placed in 4 g l 1 agno3 solution for the immobilization of silver yang et al 2016 the container was wrapped with tin foil to avoid the sunlight and placed in a shaking bath at room temperature 25 c for 6 h after being rinsed with deionized water the silver incorporated janus membrane was obtained as the janus ag membrane 2 5 md performance test the fluxes were tested with deionized water under the two temperature differences 60 20 c 70 20 c and with 0 6 m nacl 60 20 c the membranes were also tested with oil in saline emulsion as the feed for the anti oil wetting fouling tests the feed solution was prepared by mixing 4 g l 1 mineral oil and 0 6 m nacl solution using a magnetic stirrer for 12 h and an ultrasonic homogenizer scientz ǁd for 6 h the prepared emulsion was turbid and should be stable for at least 24 h during operation without observable phase separation 2 6 characterization of membranes the hydrophilic layer thickness of the janus membrane was measured via oct gan220c1 thorlab usa which has been reported in our previous studies shao et al 2021 shi et al 2022 based on the principle of oct the imaging brightness in the oct scan represents the light intensity reflected by the corresponding medium in the sample due to the wettability of the janus membrane the water can freely diffuse across the hydrophilic layer in the form of liquid but cannot break through the boundary between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers therefore a gas liquid interface is formed at this boundary inside the membrane pores because the gas liquid interface can strongly reflect lights it can be imaged in oct scans as a bright band point and so as the membrane surface the distance between the membrane surface and the gas liquid interface is the thickness of the hydrophilic layer the membrane morphology and elementary analysis were carried out via scanning electron microscope sem sigma 500 zeiss germany equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy eds detector and the chemical composition of the membrane was analyzed by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir nicolet is10 thermo scientific usa the static in air water contact angle wca and underwater oil contact angle oca of the membranes were measured by an electron microscope sn 30c sangnond the porosity and pore size distribution of the membranes were characterized by mercury intrusion porosimetry microactive autopore v 9600 micromeritics usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 control the hydrophilic layer thickness by manipulating membrane wetting surfactant induced wetting was manipulated to obtain wetted layers with controlled thickness during the process of surfactant induced wetting the growth of the wetted layer was almost linear with time fig 2 a which has been reported in the previous studies shao et al 2021 wang et al 2018 the wetting rate at different locations of membrane was synchronized evidenced by the gas liquid interface nearly paralleling the membrane surface in oct images fig 2b as reported in the previous study shao et al 2021 the wetting rate was slower at lower surfactant concentration or lower vapor flux therefore the thickness of the wetted layer can be controlled by manipulating the surfactant induced wetting process in this study the membranes with 10 20 and 40 μm of wetted layers were obtained by stopping the wetting after approximately 15 40 and 120 s respectively the wetted layer may restore its hydrophobicity with the desorption of the surfactant or the drying of the membrane chang et al 2022 thus we further modified the wetted layer through pda coating the thicknesses of the modified hydrophilic layer had no significant changes compared with the wetted layer before pda coating p 0 5 fig 2c via oct scanning fig 2d this result showed that the thickness of the hydrophilic layer only depended on the wetted layer thickness therefore we can control the thickness of the hydrophilic layer of the janus membrane by controlling surface wetting and in this study janus membranes with 10 20 and 40 μm of wetted layer were obtained 3 2 properties and wettability of janus membrane to investigate the effect of the wetted layer on the pda hydrophilization modification we also surface coated a virgin pvdf membrane with pda and the resulting membrane was named as the janus 0 membrane the chemical composition of the membranes was investigated via atr ftir compared with the virgin pvdf membrane all the janus membranes except for the janus 0 showed a broad absorbance from 3000 to 3700 cm 1 fig 3 indicating the combined effects of oh and nh2 groups in pda chen et al 2021 liu et al 2019 besides stretching vibrations of c c resonance from aromatic rings σc c and n h bending were displayed at 1604 and 1512 cm 1 chen et al 2022 gu et al 2022 respectively fig 3 indicating the successful hydrophilization modification of the pda the characteristic adsorption peaks of pda observed in janus 10 janus 20 and janus 40 were all stronger than that observed in janus 0 fig 3 which demonstrated a higher amount of pda deposition in the pictures of the membranes fig s3 the janus membranes were all taupe and the colors of janus 10 20 and 40 were all deeper than janus 0 this could be attributed to the presence of the hydrophilic layer inside the membrane pores that allowed more pda to deposit inside the membrane pores membrane wettability was quantified by the static in air water contact angle wca measurements compared with the bare membrane the in air wcas of all the membranes modified with pda decreased below 50 fig 4 suggesting the expected success of pda hydrophilization modification in the presence of the wetted layer the in air hydrophilicity of the membranes was further enhanced significantly evidenced by the lower in air wcas fig 4 and the thicker the hydrophilic layer the lower the in air wca of the janus membrane this could be attributed to the thicker the hydrophilic layer the easier it was for water droplets to wick into the membrane pores due to the capillary force fan et al 2020 the propensity against attachment of hydrophobic foulants was measured by the underwater oil contact angle oca the bare pvdf membrane and janus 0 membrane were instantaneously wetted upon contact with the oil droplets fig 4 which was consistent with the previous studies li et al 2019 in comparison janus 10 janus 20 and janus 40 membranes all displayed high ocas greater than 145 fig 5 indicating their underwater olephobicity considering janus 10 membrane exhibited a higher wca its dynamic under water oil repelling was challenged and janus 10 membrane showed an extremely low adhesion to the oil droplets during the oil advancing and receding process fig 4 the strong underwater oil resistance of the janus membranes could be attributed to the strong interaction between the hydrophilic groups of pda and the surrounding water molecules which could form an interfacial hydration layer on the membrane surface and act as a physical barrier to resist the adhesion of oil droplets chen et al 2010 chew et al 2017 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the janus membranes all maintained the porous structures in the surface and cross section sem images fig 5a and no significant differences in porosities and the pore size distributions between the janus membranes and the virgin pvdf membrane were found fig 5b and c these results demonstrated that the pore coating with pda had little effect on the internal structure and surface morphology generally the thickness of thin film formed by pda coating on the membrane surface is about 10 50 nm geng et al 2020 lee et al 2007 wang et al 2019a while the pore size of the pvdf membrane is on the micron scale therefore the approach proposed in our study can maintain the porous structure of the membrane and would not increase the mass transfer resistance 3 3 membrane performance of the janus membranes in dmdc 3 3 1 mass transport since the hydrophilic layer thicknesses of the janus membranes were tunable and their pore structures had no significant change it provided conditions to further study the mass transfer of the janus membranes when fed with deionized water under low flux 60 20 c no significant change was shown in flux of janus membranes fig 6 a while under higher flux 70 20 c the flux of janus membranes with different hydrophilic layer thickness decreased by 2 10 fig 6a these results could be attributed to the exacerbated temperature polarizations tp in the presence of the hydrophilic layers fig 6b chen et al 2021 and the higher the flux the more severe the tp when treating 0 6 mol l 1 nacl solution the flux decline would be more significant as the hydrophilic layer thickness increased decreased by 18 for janus 40 in fig 6a this could be explained by the exacerbated concentration polarizations cp in the presence of hydrophilic layers fig 6b alklaibi and lior 2006 wang et al 2016a therefore there is a trade off between the hydrophilic layer thicknesses and the vapor flux in this study the flux decline for janus membranes was not obvious compared with those reported in previous studies afsari et al 2021 chew et al 2019 for one thing the modified hydrophilic layer could maintain its porous structures of the virgin membrane for the other thing the decreased thickness of hydrophobic layer would result in an enhancement in vapor transport eq s1 by increasing the membrane distillation coefficient b m fig 6c khayet et al 2004 phattaranawik et al 2003 qtaishat et al 2008 however with the increase of the hydrophilic layer thickness the flux would inevitably decrease fig 6a because the exacerbated internal concentration polarizations quantified by concentration polarization coefficient cpc caused decreased partial pressure of water at the feed side p f fig 6c and accordingly the decreased mass transfer eq s1 in si thus the thicker hydrophilic layer would lead to more serious flux decline these results indicated that the hydrophilic layer thickness should be controlled in an appropriate range 3 3 2 oil water separation when treating saline oil in water emulsion the virgin pvdf membrane and the surface coated membrane were wetted after 1 5 2 h of operation evidenced by the rapid increase in distillate conductivities fig 7 b and the decline of their vapor flux suggested the simultaneous occurrence of membrane fouling by oil fig 7a the strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between the oil droplets and the membrane materials enabled the adhesion of the oil to the membrane surface and pores which provided channels for the passage of saline feed in contrast the janus 10 membrane maintained the original vapor flux and 100 salt rejection after 24 h of operation fig 7 exhibiting outstanding anti oil wetting and anti oil fouling abilities the janus 20 and janus 40 membranes had similar performances to the janus 10 membrane data not shown the robust resistance to oil induced wetting of the janus membrane was due to the formation of a strong interfacial hydration layer which provided an energy barrier preventing hydrophobic foulants from adhering to the membrane surface chen et al 2021 chew et al 2017 sun et al 2019 these results suggest that the janus membranes developed in this study have a promising potential for treating oily wastewater in md 3 4 generality and extensibility of this in situ modification approach this in situ modification method has a certain generality and is suitable for different membrane materials and various coating solutions for example a membrane of another material ptfe was also in situ modified with the co deposition of pda pei reported by chen et al chen et al 2021 since the single deposition of pda only decreased the wca by 24 4 fig s7 the wca of resulting janus p membrane was reduced to 15 3 1 2 fig 8 displaying remarkable hydrophilicity the janus p membrane displayed an underwater oca of 134 8 0 2 fig 8 and its adhesion with oil droplet was low indicating well anti oil wetting fouling ability underwater considering ptfe membranes are very inert these results can support the generality of this in situ and thickness controllable modification method the janus membrane can be further modified according to the feed composition to realize a better antifouling effect for example in situ immobilization of silver nanoparticles agnps was carried out on the janus 20 membrane by in situ immobilization the sem image and eds analysis showed successful immobilization of silver this result could be attributed to the reducing catechol groups contained in pda that reduce silver ions in the solution and serve as anchors for the resulting agnps yang et al 2016 as was reported in previous studies chew et al 2019 yang et al 2016 the loading of agnps could endow the janus membrane with antibacterial properties therefore it can be inferred that this preparation method can be further optimized to prepare multifunctional membranes for different raw water treatments furthermore to enhance the flux we can fabricate a janus membrane in which a hydrophobic layer is sandwiched between two hydrophilic layers through this general route the hydrophilic layer on the feed facing side is expected to be thinner to minimize the effects of internal polarizations as much as possible and the hydrophilic layer on the distillate facing side is expected to shorten the length of vapor transfer channels to enhance the distillation rate the similar results have been proposed in previous studies basile et al 2015 while the janus membrane effectively resists the wetting induced by oil droplets it could not resist the wetting induced by surfactants because the surfactant molecules could readily pass through the porous hydrophilic layer to address this challenge the thickness controllable hydrophilic layer provides a nice platform to be modified for example the hydrogel can be embedded in the hydrophilic layer to hinder the diffusion of surfactant through the hydrophilic layer additionally a dense thin polyamide film could be formed on the surface of the hydrophilic layer to directly reject the surfactant molecules this general approach is promising in fabricating the janus membrane for the treatment of challenging wastewaters including shale gas well drilling food processing leather and fabric industries and domestic sewage however it should be mentioned that this method may not be applicable to the membranes with highly uneven pore size distribution or the membrane with too thin hydrophobic layer which could hardly obtain a wetted layer without partially breakthrough of some pores 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a strategy for preparing janus membranes with controllable hydrophilic layer thickness by manipulating membrane wetting instead of the traditional method of forming a hydrophilic layer upward on the membrane surface this strategy realized modification of partial membrane pores in the cross sectional direction this approach manipulated the surfactant induced wetting generally seen as a challenge in md as a means to control the thickness of the hydrophilic layer of the janus membranes the resulting janus membrane exhibited outstanding anti oil fouling and anti oil wetting abilities the porous structure and flux of the janus membranes showed no significant difference compared with the virgin pvdf membrane in addition this facile modification method has certain generality and extensibility for example this method was also applicable to the modification of membranes made of different materials pvdf ptfe and agnps were successfully immobilized in situ on the janus membrane which is promising to fabricate an antibacterial janus membrane declaration of competing interest the authors declare

14811,janus membranes with asymmetric wettability have attracted wide attentions for their robust anti oil wetting fouling abilities in membrane distillation md compared to traditional surface modification approaches in this study we provided a new approach which manipulated surfactant induced wetting to fabricate janus membrane with a controllable thickness of the hydrophilic layer the membranes with 10 20 and 40 μm of wetted layers were obtained by stopping the wetting induced by 40 mg l 1 triton x 100 j 25 l m 2 h 1 at about 15 40 and 120 s respectively then the wetted layers were coated using polydopamine pda to fabricate the janus membranes the resulting janus membranes showed no significant change in porosities or pore size distributions compared with the virgin pvdf membrane these janus membranes exhibited low in air water contact angles 50 high underwater oil contact angles 145 and low adhesion with oil droplets therefore they all showed excellent oil water separation performance with 100 rejection and stable flux the janus membranes showed no significant decline in flux but a trade off existed between the hydrophilic layer thicknesses and the vapor flux utilizing membranes with tunable hydrophilic layer thickness we elucidated the underlying mechanism of such trade off in mass transfer furthermore the successful modification of membranes with different coatings and in situ immobilization of silver nanoparticles indicated that this facile modification method is universal and can be further expanded for multifunctional membrane fabrication

request 1 introduction membrane distillation md a membrane based technology driven by vapor pressure differences is promising in high salinity wastewater treatment zero liquid discharge resource recovery etc chen et al 2014 liao et al 2020 in a typical md a porous hydrophobic membrane separates the hot feed and the cold distillate and retains non volatile substances alkhudhiri et al 2012 qasim et al 2021 wang and chung 2015 however the hydrophobic membrane is of good affinity to oil due to hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction lokare et al 2017 rezaei et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015 the oil droplets can easily adhere to the surface of the hydrophobic membrane and wick into the membrane pores causing pore blocking i e fouling and direct passages of feed liquid i e wetting resulting in decreases in vapor flux and rejection chew et al 2019 wang et al 2016a wang and lin 2017 therefore md is limited in the application of oil containing wastewater e g shale gas wastewater du et al 2018 horseman et al 2020 shaffer et al 2013 one way to eliminate wetting and fouling induced by oil is to prevent oil droplets from directly contacting with hydrophobic membranes a hydrophilic layer which contains a high proportion of water could act as a barrier against the attachment of oil droplets due to the immiscibility of oil and water chen et al 2021 chew et al 2017 gong et al 2022 shao et al 2020 sun et al 2019 thus the fabrication of a janus membrane whose one side is in air hydrophilic and underwater oleophobic and the other side is in air hydrophobic is an effective solution to resist oil induced fouling and wetting li et al 2020 2021 qing et al 2020 with the hydrophilic layer oil droplets cannot directly contact with the hydrophobic part of the membrane thereby avoiding the oil induced wetting and fouling therefore janus membrane is promising in md to treat oil containing wastewater the preparation of janus membrane generally involves dip coating plasma treatment electrospinning spraying grafting casting and other approaches of imparting specific wettability to membranes afsari et al 2021 chew et al 2019 the hydrophilicity of membrane is often tuned by controlling the hydrophilic layer thickness su et al 2021 wang et al 2020 however there is still a lack of an ideal method for preparing a janus membrane with a thickness controllable hydrophilic layer afsari et al 2021 chew et al 2019 for example surface coating or incorporation could hardly control the thickness of the hydrophilic layer on a hydrophobic substrate and may have the risk of peeling off and sacrificing flux lin et al 2015 wang et al 2016a 2016b although the electrospinning and atomic layer deposition method can tune the thickness of hydrophilic layer by controlling the dose and time the delamination problem needs to be resolved su et al 2021 yan et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 and the uncontrollable operations may cause pore clogging and defects and subsequent pore wetting during operations chew et al 2019 hou et al 2018 wang et al 2019b casting can also control the layer thickness but it requires specialized equipment and the resulting membrane may show defects

process in this study the membranes with 10 20 and 40 μm of wetted layers were obtained by stopping the wetting after approximately 15 40 and 120 s respectively the wetted layer may restore its hydrophobicity with the desorption of the surfactant or the drying of the membrane chang et al 2022 thus we further modified the wetted layer through pda coating the thicknesses of the modified hydrophilic layer had no significant changes compared with the wetted layer before pda coating p 0 5 fig 2c via oct scanning fig 2d this result showed that the thickness of the hydrophilic layer only depended on the wetted layer thickness therefore we can control the thickness of the hydrophilic layer of the janus membrane by controlling surface wetting and in this study janus membranes with 10 20 and 40 μm of wetted layer were obtained 3 2 properties and wettability of janus membrane to investigate the effect of the wetted layer on the pda hydrophilization modification we also surface coated a virgin pvdf membrane with pda and the resulting membrane was named as the janus 0 membrane the chemical composition of the membranes was investigated via atr ftir compared with the virgin pvdf membrane all the janus membranes except for the janus 0 showed a broad absorbance from 3000 to 3700 cm 1 fig 3 indicating the combined effects of oh and nh2 groups in pda chen et al 2021 liu et al 2019 besides stretching vibrations of c c resonance from aromatic rings σc c and n h bending were displayed at 1604 and 1512 cm 1 chen et al 2022 gu et al 2022 respectively fig 3 indicating the successful hydrophilization modification of the pda the characteristic adsorption peaks of pda observed in janus 10 janus 20 and janus 40 were all stronger than that observed in janus 0 fig 3 which demonstrated a higher amount of pda deposition in the pictures of the membranes fig s3 the janus membranes were all taupe and the colors of janus 10 20 and 40 were all deeper than janus 0 this could be attributed to the presence of the hydrophilic layer inside the membrane pores that allowed more pda to deposit inside the membrane pores membrane wettability was quantified by the static in air water contact angle wca measurements compared with the bare membrane the in air wcas of all the membranes modified with pda decreased below 50 fig 4 suggesting the expected success of pda hydrophilization modification in the presence of the wetted layer the in air hydrophilicity of the membranes was further enhanced significantly evidenced by the lower in air wcas fig 4 and the thicker the hydrophilic layer the lower the in air wca of the janus membrane this could be attributed to the thicker the hydrophilic layer the easier it was for water droplets to wick into the membrane pores due to the capillary force fan et al 2020 the propensity against attachment of hydrophobic foulants was measured by the underwater oil contact angle oca the bare pvdf membrane and janus 0 membrane were instantaneously wetted upon contact with the oil droplets fig 4 which was consistent with the previous studies li et al 2019 in comparison janus 10 janus 20 and janus 40 membranes all displayed high ocas greater than 145 fig 5 indicating their underwater olephobicity considering janus 10 membrane exhibited a higher wca its dynamic under water oil repelling was challenged and janus 10 membrane showed an extremely low adhesion to the oil droplets during the oil advancing and receding process fig 4 the strong underwater oil resistance of the janus membranes could be attributed to the strong interaction between the hydrophilic groups of pda and the surrounding water molecules which could form an interfacial hydration layer on the membrane surface and act as a physical barrier to resist the adhesion of oil droplets chen et al 2010 chew et al 2017 sun et al 2019 wang et al 2015 the janus membranes all maintained the porous structures in the surface and cross section sem images fig 5a and no significant differences in porosities and the pore size distributions between the janus membranes and the virgin pvdf membrane were found fig 5b and c these results demonstrated that the pore coating with pda had little effect on the internal structure and surface morphology generally the thickness of thin film formed by pda coating on the membrane surface is about 10 50 nm geng et al 2020 lee et al 2007 wang et al 2019a while the pore size of the pvdf membrane is on the micron scale therefore the approach proposed in our study can maintain the porous structure of the membrane and would not increase the mass transfer resistance 3 3 membrane performance of the janus membranes in dmdc 3 3 1 mass transport since the hydrophilic layer thicknesses of the janus membranes were tunable and their pore structures had no significant change it provided conditions to further study the mass transfer of the janus membranes when fed with deionized water under low flux 60 20 c no significant change was shown in flux of janus membranes fig 6 a while under higher flux 70 20 c the flux of janus membranes with different hydrophilic layer thickness decreased by 2 10 fig 6a these results could be attributed to the exacerbated temperature polarizations tp in the presence of the hydrophilic layers fig 6b chen et al 2021 and the higher the flux the more severe the tp when treating 0 6 mol l 1 nacl solution the flux decline would be more significant as the hydrophilic layer thickness increased decreased by 18 for janus 40 in fig 6a this could be explained by the exacerbated concentration polarizations cp in the presence of hydrophilic layers fig 6b alklaibi and lior 2006 wang et al 2016a therefore there is a trade off between the hydrophilic layer thicknesses and the vapor flux in this study the flux decline for janus membranes was not obvious compared with those reported in previous studies afsari et al 2021 chew et al 2019 for one thing the modified hydrophilic layer could maintain its porous structures of the virgin membrane for the other thing the decreased thickness of hydrophobic layer would result in an enhancement in vapor transport eq s1 by increasing the membrane distillation coefficient b m fig 6c khayet et al 2004 phattaranawik et al 2003 qtaishat et al 2008 however with the increase of the hydrophilic layer thickness the flux would inevitably decrease fig 6a because the exacerbated internal concentration polarizations quantified by concentration polarization coefficient cpc caused decreased partial pressure of water at the feed side p f fig 6c and accordingly the decreased mass transfer eq s1 in si thus the thicker hydrophilic layer would lead to more serious flux decline these results indicated that the hydrophilic layer thickness should be controlled in an appropriate range 3 3 2 oil water separation when treating saline oil in water emulsion the virgin pvdf membrane and the surface coated membrane were wetted after 1 5 2 h of operation evidenced by the rapid increase in distillate conductivities fig 7 b and the decline of their vapor flux suggested the simultaneous occurrence of membrane fouling by oil fig 7a the strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between the oil droplets and the membrane materials enabled the adhesion of the oil to the membrane surface and pores which provided channels for the passage of saline feed in contrast the janus 10 membrane maintained the original vapor flux and 100 salt rejection after 24 h of operation fig 7 exhibiting outstanding anti oil wetting and anti oil fouling abilities the janus 20 and janus 40 membranes had similar performances to the janus 10 membrane data not shown the robust resistance to oil induced wetting of the janus membrane was due to the formation of a strong interfacial hydration layer which provided an energy barrier preventing hydrophobic foulants from adhering to the membrane surface chen et al 2021 chew et al 2017 sun et al 2019 these results suggest that the janus membranes developed in this study have a promising potential for treating oily wastewater in md 3 4 generality and extensibility of this in situ modification approach this in situ modification method has a certain generality and is suitable for different membrane materials and various coating solutions for example a membrane of another material ptfe was also in situ modified with the co deposition of pda pei reported by chen et al chen et al 2021 since the single deposition of pda only decreased the wca by 24 4 fig s7 the wca of resulting janus p membrane was reduced to 15 3 1 2 fig 8 displaying remarkable hydrophilicity the janus p membrane displayed an underwater oca of 134 8 0 2 fig 8 and its adhesion with oil droplet was low indicating well anti oil wetting fouling ability underwater considering ptfe membranes are very inert these results can support the generality of this in situ and thickness controllable modification method the janus membrane can be further modified according to the feed composition to realize a better antifouling effect for example in situ immobilization of silver nanoparticles agnps was carried out on the janus 20 membrane by in situ immobilization the sem image and eds analysis showed successful immobilization of silver this result could be attributed to the reducing catechol groups contained in pda that reduce silver ions in the solution and serve as anchors for the resulting agnps yang et al 2016 as was reported in previous studies chew et al 2019 yang et al 2016 the loading of agnps could endow the janus membrane with antibacterial properties therefore it can be inferred that this preparation method can be further optimized to prepare multifunctional membranes for different raw water treatments furthermore to enhance the flux we can fabricate a janus membrane in which a hydrophobic layer is sandwiched between two hydrophilic layers through this general route the hydrophilic layer on the feed facing side is expected to be thinner to minimize the effects of internal polarizations as much as possible and the hydrophilic layer on the distillate facing side is expected to shorten the length of vapor transfer channels to enhance the distillation rate the similar results have been proposed in previous studies basile et al 2015 while the janus membrane effectively resists the wetting induced by oil droplets it could not resist the wetting induced by surfactants because the surfactant molecules could readily pass through the porous hydrophilic layer to address this challenge the thickness controllable hydrophilic layer provides a nice platform to be modified for example the hydrogel can be embedded in the hydrophilic layer to hinder the diffusion of surfactant through the hydrophilic layer additionally a dense thin polyamide film could be formed on the surface of the hydrophilic layer to directly reject the surfactant molecules this general approach is promising in fabricating the janus membrane for the treatment of challenging wastewaters including shale gas well drilling food processing leather and fabric industries and domestic sewage however it should be mentioned that this method may not be applicable to the membranes with highly uneven pore size distribution or the membrane with too thin hydrophobic layer which could hardly obtain a wetted layer without partially breakthrough of some pores 4 conclusions in this study we proposed a strategy for preparing janus membranes with controllable hydrophilic layer thickness by manipulating membrane wetting instead of the traditional method of forming a hydrophilic layer upward on the membrane surface this strategy realized modification of partial membrane pores in the cross sectional direction this approach manipulated the surfactant induced wetting generally seen as a challenge in md as a means to control the thickness of the hydrophilic layer of the janus membranes the resulting janus membrane exhibited outstanding anti oil fouling and anti oil wetting abilities the porous structure and flux of the janus membranes showed no significant difference compared with the virgin pvdf membrane in addition this facile modification method has certain generality and extensibility for example this method was also applicable to the modification of membranes made of different materials pvdf ptfe and agnps were successfully immobilized in situ on the janus membrane which is promising to fabricate an antibacterial janus membrane declaration of competing interest the authors declare

14812,micro bubble aeration is an efficient way to promote ozonation performance but the technology is challenged by extensive energy cost here a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane was used to achieve ozone micro bubble 0 80 µm aeration in a simple way at gaseous pressures of 0 14 0 19 mpa compared with milli bubble aeration micro bubble aeration increased the equilibrium aquatic o3 concentrations by 1 53 3 25 times and apparent o3 transfer rates by 3 12 3 35 times at ph 5 0 8 0 consequently the oh yield was 2 67 3 54 times via faster o3 transfer to the aquatic solution followed by decomposition rather than interfacial reaction ozone micro bubble aeration outperformed milli bubble aeration with the degradation kinetics of 2 4 d being 3 08 4 36 times higher both o3 oxidation and oh oxidation were important to the promotion with the contributions being 35 8 45 9 and 54 1 64 2 respectively the operational and water matric conditions influenced the oxidation performance via both o3 oxidation and oh oxidation which is reported for the first time in general the ceramic membrane offered a low energy approach of ozone micro bubble aeration for efficient pollutant degradation the o3 oxidation and oh oxidation were proportionally promoted by ozone micro bubble due to o3 transfer enhancement thus the promotive mechanism can be interpreted as the synchronous enchantment on ozone exposure and oh exposure for the first time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozone micro bubble aeration o3 transfer oh yield oxidation performance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ozone is widely used for the disinfection and elimination of organic pollutants during water and wastewater treatment kong et al 2021 yang et al 2021 ozonation includes direct oxidation via the ozone molecule reductive potential 2 07 v or indirect oxidation via oh oxidation reductive potential 2 80 v jabesa and ghosh 2021 von gunten 2003a zhou et al 2021 one of the engineering challenges of ozonation is the low solubility of ozone in water and the slow ozone transfer rate from gaseous phase to aquatic phase this leads to low ozone utility and high energy costs gągol et al 2018 wang et al 2019 enhancing ozone solubility in water is unfeasible through engineering practice thus numerous studies have focused on promoting the ozone transfer rate and ozonation performance yang et al 2021 micro bubble 1 100 µm aeration has been increasingly employed to promote the transfer rate of target species i e air oxygen and ozone from the gaseous phase to the aquatic phase john et al 2022a micro bubbles have a large specific surface area high internal pressure and long stagnation time ahmed et al 2018 john et al 2022b wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2015 micro bubble generation can be accomplished through various methods such as multiphase pumping spiral liquid flowing and fluidic oscillators john et al 2022a ulatowski and sobieszuk 2020 zhang et al 2022b but these processes are usually energy intensive recently ceramic ultrafiltration membranes have been an emerging aquatic micro bubble aeration method for biological treatment oil separation and air flotation arumugham et al 2021 liu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a compared with other methods ceramic membrane aeration has the advantages of simple equipment low energy consumption and simple operation and engineering application micro bubble aeration has been widely employed to enhance ozonation performance by promoting o3 transfer and oh formation jabesa and ghosh 2021 john et al 2022a khuntia et al 2012 2015a li et al 2020 the o3 transfer coefficient of micro bubble aeration was reported to be 2 2 times higher than that of milli bubble aeration zheng et al 2015 increasing the ozone utilization from 21 48 for milli bubble aeration to 65 79 for micro bubble aeration jabesa and ghosh 2021 wu et al 2019 observed that ozone micro bubble aeration generated more oh and more rapidly degraded nitrobenzene oh probe at half the ozone dose of milli bubble aeration this increase was caused by enhancing the ozone transfer rate and the direct o3 oxidation of pollutants in water by enhancing the ozone transfer rate and forming oh from aquatic o3 or by enhancing oh formation from gas liquid interfacial reactions on bubbles agarwal et al 2011 john et al 2022b wu et al 2019 however the enhancement mechanism has not been qualitatively or quantitatively clarified and ozone micro bubble aeration with a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane has not been thoroughly studied including optimization of the ozone bubble diameter o3 transfer rate and oxidation performance chemical 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d is a widely used herbicide and growth regulator that has been used since the 1940s girón navarro et al 2021 werner et al 2013 as a result 2 4 d has been ubiquitously detected in surface water and even drinking water sources gonzalez et al 2016 studies have reported that 2 4 d poses a risk to aquatic biota such as aquatic plants mammals and fish dehnert et al 2019 and has endocrine disrupting and carcinogenic activity toward humans girón navarro et al

oxidation performance of ozone micro bubble aeration was then investigated in terms of the ozone transfer rate oh yield and mechanism and 2 4 d oxidation under various solution ph values finally the oxidation performance of ozone micro bubble aeration was investigated in various water matrices 2 chemical materials and experiments 2 1 chemical materials formic acid 98 purity 2 4 d 97 purity para

ultrapure water upw generated by a millipore water purification system milli q integral 5 elix technology inside the flat ceramic membrane was purchased from tianlezhongqing technology shenzhen secondary effluent and river water were collected from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and a river in shenzhen guangdong province china respectively the collected water was filtered through 0 22 µm membrane filters before experiment to minimize the influence of particulate impurities the ozone micro bubble aeration was also conducted in the reclaimed water filtered by 0 45 µm membrane the ozonation performance was similar to that filtered by 0 22 µm membrane fig s14 to minimize the possible ceramic membrane clogging we conducted all experiments with the water filtered by 0 22 µm membrane the filtered secondary effluent was used to simulate reclaimed water the general water qualities of tap water river water and reclaimed water are shown in table s1 2 2 ozonation experiments both ozone micro bubble and milli bubble aeration were conducted in semi batch reactors including a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane for micro bubble aeration fig 1 and a titanium aerator with milli pores for milli bubble aeration the cuboidal aeration reactor was made of plexiglass with a volume of 0 9 l 75 40 300 mm the flat ceramic membrane 30 50 mm was fixed at the bottom of the reactor ozone was introduced into the water through a ceramic membrane aerator ozone was produced by an ozone generator ch ztw7g guangzhou chuanghuan technology with oxygen 99 999 purity as the inlet gas the gaseous ozone in the inlet and outlet gas was monitored online 3s j5000 beijing tonglin technology a mass flowmeter tsk621 beijing jierui was used to control and measure inlet gaseous flow rate the distribution of bubble diameter was measured with a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern for both micro and milli bubble aeration the analyzer can work well within the normal operating range 0 01 3500 μm however it should be noted that mastersizer presents data on a volume basis and hence is bias toward larger size bands the results can generally indicate the size level but need further measurement for more accurate information agarwal et al 2011 couto et al 2009 john et al 2022a a magnetic stirrer continuously stirred the solution at 450 rpm to increase the homogeneity of aeration for both the ozonation experiments and bubble size distribution measurements the measured bubble size under the magnetic stirring condition can reflect the actual bubble size during ozonation processes 2 3 analytical methods the solution ph was maintained with 10 mm phosphate and measured with a ph meter s400 mettler tole the ph of different water matrix was not buffered with phosphate and was adjusted to 7 0 before ozonation the aquatic ozone concentration was measured with the indigo colorimetric method bader and hoigné 1981 federation and association 2005 where the loss of potassium indigo trisulfonate by reaction with aquatic ozone decreased the absorbance at 600 nm dr6000 hach the concentrations of 2 4 d and pcba were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 2030 shimadzu japan using a c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 µm particle size cnw technologies for separation and a photodiode array detector spd 20 shimadzu japan for quantification the mobile phase was a mixture of upw containing 0 1 v v formic acid and acetonitrile in a 50 50 v v ratio the flow rate was 1 0 ml min 1 and the injection volume was 20 µl the quantification wavelengths for 2 4 d and pcba were 280 and 221 nm respectively all experiments were repeated at least two or three times the aquatic formaldehyde was quantified by hplc lc 2030 plus shimadzu corporation with a pretreatment derivative reaction 1 ml sample was spiked with 0 1 ml acetate buffer 4 mm ph 5 and 0 1 ml 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine solution 10 mm solvent acetonitrile and was kept in the dark for 4 h before hplc analysis the oh yield was evaluated after ozone milli and micro bubble aeration using excessive tert butanol tba to capture oh fischbacher et al 2013 yang et al 2016a the oh was almost completely captured by tba to form formaldehyde at a stoichiometric value of 2 during ozone aeration eq 1 2 the optimal dosage of tba was 100 mm fig s3 the total ozone dose tod was calculated from the

pathway r oh and r o3 were defined as the oh exposure ratio and o3 exposure ratio respectively to tod eq 6 7 the r oh can be calculated from the degradation of pcba eq 8 9 which is a widely reported oh probe with negligible reactivity to o3 and second order reaction rate constant of 5 0 109 m 1s 1 to oh khuntia et al 2015b pi et al 2005 the r o3 can be calculated from the degradation of 2 4 d eq

results and discussion 3 1 micro bubble aeration with ceramic membrane 3 1 1 diameter of bubbles by ceramic membrane aeration the diameter of bubbles followed a logarithmic normal distribution during ozone aeration with the ceramic membrane at gaseous pressures 0 14 0 19 mpa as shown in fig 2 a with the above distribution the average values of bubble diameter can be calculated under various conditions as shown in fig 2b the ceramic membrane achieved ozone micro bubble aeration with an average diameter of bubbles of 40 80 µm when the gaseous pressure was lower than 0 19 mpa interestingly the average bubble diameter reached a minimum value of 43 µm at a gaseous pressure 0 16 mpa yet the bubble diameter of milli bubble was measured to be 2 6 mm at the same gaseous pressure with a titanium aerator as shown in fig s1 when the gaseous pressure was higher than 0 20 mpa ceramic membrane aeration failed to generate micro bubbles and the average diameter rapidly increased to 666 µm this result could be explained by that the bubble size depended on both the growth rate and duration the bubble growth duration would be longer at lower pressure while the growth rate would be faster at higher pressure in addition the dependence of bubble size on gaseous pressure would vary with the properties of ceramic membrane such as the pore size and surface hydrophilicity for further practical application the operated gaseous pressure needs to be optimized to prevent the gas converging into milli bubbles on the membranes surface with various properties 3 1 2 improved o3 transfer by micro bubble aeration ozone micro bubble aeration with the ceramic membrane significantly increased the equilibrium aquatic o3 concentration and o3 transfer rate from gaseous phase to liquid phase as shown in fig 3 a for example the aquatic o3 reached an equilibrium of 37 5 24 0 14 6 and 9 6 µm at ph 5 6 7 8 respectively by ozone micro bubble aeration which was 1 53 3 25 times higher than the value achieved by ozone milli bubble aeration fig 3b to further quantify the o3 transfer rate from gaseous phase to liquid phase a modified diffusion model combining the o3 dissolved in an ideal liquid film eq 14 and decomposition in aquatic solution eq 15 was used lewis and whitman 1924 at equilibrium the dissolved rate of o3 was equal to the decomposition rate of o3 eq 16 by substituting eq 14 into eq 15 the apparent value of aquatic o3 can be expressed as eq 17 the corresponding integral equation can be further expressed as eq 18 14 d o 3 l d t k l a o 3 m l o 3 l 15 d o 3 1 d t k l a o 3 m 1 o 3 1 k o 3 1 16 k l a o 3 e 1 o 3 1 k o 3 1 17 d o 3 1 d t k l a k o 3 e 1 o 3 1 18 ln o 3 e l o 3 l k l a k t c where t is aeration time min k l is the mass transfer coefficient of o3 in the liquid film m h 1 a is the specific surface area of the bubble m2 m3 o3 l o3 m l and o3 e l are the aquatic o3 concentrations at aeration time t maximum value aquatic solubility and equilibrium state respectively m k is the pseudo first order kinetic constant of the o3 decomposition min 1 and c is a constant related to the equilibrium state by linear fitting of ln o3 e l o3 l as a function of aeration time the mass transfer of o3 can be quantified under various solution ph values for micro bubble and milli bubble aeration as shown in fig s2 the apparent o3 transfer rates k l a k of micro bubble aeration were 3 12 3 35 3 31 and 3 26 times higher than those of milli bubble aeration at ph 5 6 7 and 8 respectively fig 3c previous studies reported the o3 transfer coefficient in the range of 10 60 µm and were 1 2 5 2 times of that of milli bubble aeration at ph 7 karamah et al 2010 liu et al 2010 shangguan et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2015 the results varied with the size distribution of bubbles specific operating conditions and equipments john et al 2022 in this study the diameter of micro bubble was approximately 1 60 of milli bubble which resulted in 60 times higher specific surface area in addition the micro bubble has higher inner gaseous pressure and longer retention time in solution than milli bubble these factors would favor the micro bubble to show higher k la k than milli bubble john et al 2022a wu et al 2019 the variation of k l a k was minor with increasing ph from 5 to 8 regardless the aeration bubble size at elevated solution ph the ozone self decomposition k was expected to be more negative due to the rapid reaction between o3 and oh the ozone transfer coefficient k l a was also reported to be higher at elevated ph values john et al 2022a wu et al 2019 as a result the k l a k kept almost constant with increasing ph from 5 to 9 for both micro and milli bubble aeration eq 18 and fig s2 3 2 enhancement on the oh yield 3 2 1 oh yield under different solution ph values the intrinsic value of oh yield ζ oh represents the oh formation per tod the ζ oh can be quantified as the slope of the linear fit between accumulated oh and tod at various ph values as shown in fig 4 a b with increasing ph from 5 to 8 the ζ oh increased from 0 009 to 0 041 for ozone milli bubble aeration and from 0 028 to 0 147 for ozone micro bubble aeration fig 4c the favored ζ oh at elevated ph solution has also been observed in previous studies and was explained by the higher oh which can rapidly react with o3 and generate oh von gunten 2003a b notably micro bubble aeration had a much higher ζ oh than milli bubble aeration especially in alkaline solution the ζ oh of micro bubble aeration was 3 54 times that of milli bubble aeration ph 8 the promotion of ζ oh by micro bubble aeration may result from various pathways i e more reactive interfacial reaction higher dissolved o3 and subsequent decomposition into oh in the alkaline solution microbubble was attached with more oh which may favor the oh formation jabesa and ghosh 2021 ushikubo et al 2010 thus the promotion of ζ oh would be more obvious in alkaline solution than in acidic solution the importance of each pathway will be discussed in later section the higher ζ oh can further imply that ozone micro bubble aeration would be prominent for the elimination of o3 resistent micropollutants e g 2 4 d primidone diethyltoluamide han et al 2022 especially in the water of circumneutral ph 7 5 8 5 3 2 2 enhancement pathways oh may be generated from the decomposition of dissolved o3 and direct interfacial transformation of o3 during ozonation john et al 2022b wu et al 2019 as shown in fig 4d and eq 19 the interfacial transformation of o3 was negligible for oh formation by ozone milli bubble aeration john et al 2022b but not quantified for ozone micro bubble aeration the decomposition of dissolved o3 or direct interfacial transformation of o3 or both may contribute to the promotion of oh formation by ozone micro bubble aeration if the oh formation from o3 transfer is the dominant pathway the oh yield would be proportional to the apparent o3 transfer thus the ratio of ζ oh micro to ζ oh milli would be close to the ratio of k l a k micro to k l a k milli which can be conveniently verified thus oh formation from o3 transfer is presumed to be the dominant pathway for ozone micro bubble aeration while the contribution from interfacial transformation is considered to be negligible the ζ oh of micro bubble aeration ζ oh micro can be simplified as eq 20 and expressed as a function of milli bubble aeration ζ oh milli where the coefficient is the ratio of the o3 transfer rate between micro bubble aeration and milli bubble aeration η as shown in eq 21 22 and fig 4e similarly the steady state oh concentration from micro bubble aeration oh micro would be linear to that of milli bubble aeration oh milli as shown in eq 23 and fig 4f 19 ζ o h 1 t

i where toddissolve and todinter represent the tod of the decomposition of dissolved o3 and interfacial transformation respectively m and ζ oh dissolve and ζ oh inter are the oh yields via aquatic decomposition and interfacial transformation of o3 respectively the experimental results of ζ oh micro and oh micro under various solution ph values can be depicted by eq 21 and eq 23 respectively fig 4e and 4f a 1 1 linear fitting can well depict the relation between ζ oh micro and η ζ oh milli or between oh micro and η oh milli the well fitting result can verify the presumption that the interfacial transformation of o3 slightly contributed to oh formation for ozone micro bubble aeration ozone micro bubble aeration thus enhanced ζ oh over that of milli bubble aeration by promoting o3 transfer from the gaseous phase to the aquatic phase rather than through interfacial transformation notably the oh micro in acidic solution ph 5 0 6 0 fitted to the 1 1 line well while that in circumneutral solution ph 7 0 8 0 slightly deviated from the 1 1 line indicating that the interfacial transformation of o3 into oh becomes more prominent at elevated solution ph at elevated ph the surface of micro bubbles may become more negatively charged and preferentially adsorbed with more oh jabesa and ghosh 2021 ushikubo et al 2010 which favor the decomposition of dissolved o3 and formation of oh 3 3 enhancement of 2 4 d degradation the ozone micro bubble aeration significantly outperformed milli bubble aeration for the degradation of 2 4 d under various ph values as shown in fig s4 within 20 min aeration 2 4 d was almost completely eliminated by micro bubble aeration but was only 30 eliminated through milli bubble aeration limited to the reactor height the bubble contact time of milli bubble was expected to be lower than micro bubble which may underestimate the milli bubble ozonation john et al 2022a besides the promotion of ozone transfer the promotion of liquid ozone concentration by ozone micro bubble contributed to the prominent oxidation performance thus though the limited reactor height may amplify the performance of ozone micro bubble aeration the degradation based on tod would be better than that based on aeration time for the comparison of micro and milli bubble ozonation at specific ozone utilities and reactor operations so the degradation of 2 4 d was replotted as a function of tod with online monitoring gaseous ozone concentration for the inlet and outlet gas throughout the ozonation process as shown in fig 5 a at a specific tod micro bubble aeration resulted in much higher removal of 2 4 d than milli bubble aeration ozone micro bubble aeration achieved 95 removal of 2 4 d at 187 5 µm tod while ozone milli bubble aeration required approximately 420 µm tod this result could be explained by that the micro bubble aeration showed much higher ozone transfer which leaded to higher aquatic ozone concentration and oh yield and then more superior oxidation performance than milli bubble aeration thus similar oxidation performance may be expected for micro and milli bubble aeration with the same dissolved aquatic ozone doses rather than tod the degradation of 2 4 d can be well fitted with pseudo first order kinetics to tod eq 10 as shown in fig s6 the fitted kinetic constant k obs 2 4 d for micro bubble aeration was much higher than for milli bubble aeration and was 3 08 3 57 4 04 and 4 36 times higher than that of milli bubble aeration at ph 5 6 7 and 8 respectively fig 5b the promotion of ozone micro bubble aeration was further evaluated in terms of o3 oxidation r o3 and oh oxidation r oh pathways compared with milli bubble aeration micro bubble aeration significantly increased the r oh by 2 70 3 12 3 62 and 4 16 times and increased the r o3 by 3 81 4 48 4 91 and 4 80 times respectively at ph 5 6 7 and 8 fig s7 these results indicated that micro bubble aeration can promote the oxidation performance through both o3 oxidation and oh oxidation pathways with more obvious impact on r o3 the possible reason was that the ph affected the performance via the primary step of ozone dissolution and subsequent oh oxidation the promotion of oh oxidation was a dominant cause of the superior performance especially at elevated solution ph fig 5b at ph 8 the k obs 2 4 d for the oh oxidation pathway increased from 2 1 103 m 1s 1 to 8 8 103 m 1s 1 by changing milli bubble aeration to micro bubble aeration which accounted for 64 2 of the total increase of k obs 2 4 d 3 4 influencing factors on the oxidation of ozone micro bubbles 3 4 1 influences of operational conditions the inlet gaseous pressure did not significantly affect the degradation of 2 4 d by ozone micro bubble aeration at the pressure range of 0 14 0 18 mpa as shown in fig 6 and fig s8 however the degradation of 2 4 d decreased when the pressure was further increased to 0 20 mpa which can be attributed to the much larger bubble diameter correspondingly the k obs 2 4 d remained almost constant 8 71 8 93 103 m 1s 1 at inlet gaseous pressure 0 14 0 18 mpa and then significantly decreased to 5 03 103 m 1s 1 when the inlet gaseous pressure was increased to 0 20 mpa notably the contribution of oh oxidation 58 8 59 2 did not significantly change when the inlet gaseous pressure ranged from 0 14 to 0 18 mpa the above results indicated that ozone bubbles may not affect either the oxidation performance or the oh formation rate when the bubble diameter is lower than 100 µm but they may dramatically decrease the performance when the bubble diameter increases to higher than 500 µm as shown in fig s8c this information may be helpful for the practical operation and optimization that the ozone bubble size is necessitated to be lower than 100 µm for prominent performance the degradation of 2 4 d by micro bubble aeration under different inlet ozone gaseous concentrations and flow rates and the corresponding linear fits were also investigated as shown in fig 7 and fig s9 11 to achieve a specific 2 4 d removal rate ozone micro bubble aeration required a shorter time with at higher inlet gaseous o3 concentrations or flow rates fig s9 but required similar tod fig 7a the above results indicate that the inlet gaseous o3 concentration or flow rate cannot influence the apparent o3 transfer rate k l a k and subsequent oh formation efficiency this was supported by the constant k obs 2 4 d and oh oxidation contribution observed under various inlet gaseous o3 concentrations and flow rates fig 7b 3 4 2 influences of inorganic ions and natural organic material the degradation of 2 4 d by ozone micro bubble aeration in the presence of inorganic anions i e chloride and carbonate and humic acid and the corresponding linear fits were investigated as shown in fig 8 and fig s12 the chloride did not significantly affect the degradation of 2 4 d and the contribution of oh either at high 300 mg cl l 1 or low 30 mg cl l 1 chloride concentrations although chloride was previously reported to react with oh to form cloh it will rapidly proceed in the reverse reaction k 6 1 0 8 109 s 1 yu 2004 yu et al 2004 yu and barker 2003 the degradation of 2 4 d was not significantly influenced until the inorganic carbon increased to 100 mg c l 1 the k obs 2 4 d remained almost constant with increasing inorganic carbon to 20 mg c l 1 but decreased by 16 4 when the inorganic carbon further increased to 100 mg c l 1 k obs 2 4 d 9 4 103 m 1s 1 notably inorganic carbon preferentially decreased oh oxidation 21 3 decrease more than o3 oxidation 8 7 decrease at ph 7 inorganic carbon dominantly exists as hco3 81 and co3 2 19 and rapidly consumes oh jin et al 2016 mehrvar et al 2001 although the carbonate radical may also contribute to the elimination of pollutants yang et al 2016b it has much lower reactivity to most compounds such as 2 4 d the k obs 2 4 d remained almost constant with increasing humic acid concentration to 2 mg c l 1 but decreased by 47 5 with when the humic acid further increased to 10 mg c l 1 k obs 2 4 d 6 1 103 m 1s 1 notably the inhibition of k obs 2 4 d was mainly attributed to the inhibition of oh oxidation 67 5 decrease humic acid was reported to suppress ozonation performance by the promotion of competing consumptions of o3 and oh oulton et al 2015 or promotion of the ozonation performance by catalyzing o3 to form oh dong et al 2010 xiong and graham 1992 in this study humic acid suppressed ozone micro bubble aeration only when the concentration was higher 10 mg c l 1 the result indicates that ozone micro bubble aeration is suitable for the water with relatively low matric concentration but may be suppressed in the water with relatively high matric concentration e g industrial water and reclaimed water therefore ozone micro bubble aeration should be combinedly applied with pre treatments for the water with relatively low quality e g high humic acid concentration 3 4 3 influences of the water matrix ozone micro bubble aeration with the ceramic membrane was investigated for oxidation performance of 2 4 d in various water matrices i e tap water river water and reclaimed water as shown in fig 8 the corresponding linear fits are shown in fig s13 ozone micro bubble aeration had similar 2 4 d degradation in phosphate solution and tap water but had 4 8 and 34 3 lower k obs 2 4 d in river water and reclaimed water respectively more interestingly the suppression of oh oxidation accounted for 62 7 of the total suppression of k obs 2 4 d in reclaimed water reclaimed water is much more complex than other water matrix and contains more inorganic carbon and organic humics gulamussen et al 2021 jin et al 2016 as a result both o3 and oh are quenched more rapidly in the matrices of reclaimed water 4 conclusions this study investigated ozone micro bubble aeration with a flat ceramic ultrafiltration membrane where the average diameter of ozone bubbles was 40 80 µm at a gaseous pressure of 0 14 0 19 mpa ozone micro bubble aeration increased the equilibrium aquatic o3 concentration by 1 53 3 25 times and the apparent o3 transfer rate by 3 12 3 35 times when compared with ozone milli bubble aeration at ph 5 8 notably ozone micro bubble aeration had much higher ζ oh than milli bubble aeration especially in alkaline solution the promotion of ζ oh was mainly a result of faster o3 transfer followed by decomposition rather than interfacial reactions on the bubble interface ozone micro bubble aeration obviously outperformed milli bubble aeration for the degradation of 2 4 d the degradation kinetics of micro bubble aeration were 2 08 3 36 times higher than milli bubble aeration oh oxidation increased by 2 70 4 16 times and o3 oxidation increased by 3 81 4 91 times the oxidation performance of ozone micro bubble aeration was not significantly influenced by operational factors such as gaseous pressure 0 14 0 18 mpa inlet gaseous o3 concentration or gaseous flow rate but was inhibited by high concentrations of inorganic carbon and humic acid through the suppression on oh oxidation ozone micro bubble aeration resulted in a minor decrease 4 8 in 2 4 d degradation in river water and an obvious decrease 34 3 in reclaimed water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14812,micro bubble aeration is an efficient way to promote ozonation performance but the technology is challenged by extensive energy cost here a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane was used to achieve ozone micro bubble 0 80 µm aeration in a simple way at gaseous pressures of 0 14 0 19 mpa compared with milli bubble aeration micro bubble aeration increased the equilibrium aquatic o3 concentrations by 1 53 3 25 times and apparent o3 transfer rates by 3 12 3 35 times at ph 5 0 8 0 consequently the oh yield was 2 67 3 54 times via faster o3 transfer to the aquatic solution followed by decomposition rather than interfacial reaction ozone micro bubble aeration outperformed milli bubble aeration with the degradation kinetics of 2 4 d being 3 08 4 36 times higher both o3 oxidation and oh oxidation were important to the promotion with the contributions being 35 8 45 9 and 54 1 64 2 respectively the operational and water matric conditions influenced the oxidation performance via both o3 oxidation and oh oxidation which is reported for the first time in general the ceramic membrane offered a low energy approach of ozone micro bubble aeration for efficient pollutant degradation the o3 oxidation and oh oxidation were proportionally promoted by ozone micro bubble due to o3 transfer enhancement thus the promotive mechanism can be interpreted as the synchronous enchantment on ozone exposure and oh exposure for the first time graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozone micro bubble aeration o3 transfer oh yield oxidation performance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ozone is widely used for the disinfection and elimination of organic pollutants during water and wastewater treatment kong et al 2021 yang et al 2021 ozonation includes direct oxidation via the ozone molecule reductive potential 2 07 v or indirect oxidation via oh oxidation reductive potential 2 80 v jabesa and ghosh 2021 von gunten 2003a zhou et al 2021 one of the engineering challenges of ozonation is the low solubility of ozone in water and the slow ozone transfer rate from gaseous phase to aquatic phase this leads to low ozone utility and high energy costs gągol et al 2018 wang et al 2019 enhancing ozone solubility in water is unfeasible through engineering practice thus numerous studies have focused on promoting the ozone transfer rate and ozonation performance yang et al 2021 micro bubble 1 100 µm aeration has been increasingly employed to promote the transfer rate of target species i e air oxygen and ozone from the gaseous phase to the aquatic phase john et al 2022a micro bubbles have a large specific surface area high internal pressure and long stagnation time ahmed et al 2018 john et al 2022b wang et al 2019 zheng et al 2015 micro bubble generation can be accomplished through various methods such as multiphase pumping spiral liquid flowing and fluidic oscillators john et al 2022a ulatowski and sobieszuk 2020 zhang et al 2022b but these processes are usually energy intensive recently ceramic ultrafiltration membranes have been an emerging aquatic micro bubble aeration method for biological treatment oil separation and air flotation arumugham et al 2021 liu et al 2021 yu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a compared with other methods ceramic membrane aeration has the advantages of simple equipment low energy consumption and simple operation and engineering application micro bubble aeration has been widely employed to enhance ozonation performance by promoting o3 transfer and oh formation jabesa and ghosh 2021 john et al 2022a khuntia et al 2012 2015a li et al 2020 the o3 transfer coefficient of micro bubble aeration was reported to be 2 2 times higher than that of milli bubble aeration zheng et al 2015 increasing the ozone utilization from 21 48 for milli bubble aeration to 65 79 for micro bubble aeration jabesa and ghosh 2021 wu et al 2019 observed that ozone micro bubble aeration generated more oh and more rapidly degraded nitrobenzene oh probe at half the ozone dose of milli bubble aeration this increase was caused by enhancing the ozone transfer rate and the direct o3 oxidation of pollutants in water by enhancing the ozone transfer rate and forming oh from aquatic o3 or by enhancing oh formation from gas liquid interfacial reactions on bubbles agarwal et al 2011 john et al 2022b wu et al 2019 however the enhancement mechanism has not been qualitatively or quantitatively clarified and ozone micro bubble aeration with a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane has not been thoroughly studied including optimization of the ozone bubble diameter o3 transfer rate and oxidation performance chemical 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2 4 d is a widely used herbicide and growth regulator that has been used since the 1940s girón navarro et al 2021 werner et al 2013 as a result 2 4 d has been ubiquitously detected in surface water and even drinking water sources gonzalez et al 2016 studies have reported that 2 4 d poses a risk to aquatic biota such as aquatic plants mammals and fish dehnert et al 2019 and has endocrine disrupting and carcinogenic activity toward humans girón navarro et al 2021 ma et al 2018 sharma and singhvi 2017 the world health organization has classified 2 4 d as a moderately toxic pollutant shattar et al 2019 however 2 4 d is highly recalcitrant to physical adsorption or chemical oxidation dehghani et al 2014 this study aims to develop an ozone micro bubble aeration technology with a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane to achieve superior ozonation treatment and elimination of recalcitrant micropollutant 2 4 d the generation and characterization of ozone micro bubbles were investigated in terms of the micro bubble diameter distribution the oxidation performance of ozone micro bubble aeration was then investigated in terms of the ozone transfer rate oh yield and mechanism and 2 4 d oxidation under various solution ph values finally the oxidation performance of ozone micro bubble aeration was investigated in various water matrices 2 chemical materials and experiments 2 1 chemical materials formic acid 98 purity 2 4 d 97 purity para

ultrapure water upw generated by a millipore water purification system milli q integral 5 elix technology inside the flat ceramic membrane was purchased from tianlezhongqing technology shenzhen secondary effluent and river water were collected from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and a river in shenzhen guangdong province china respectively the collected water was filtered through 0 22 µm membrane filters before experiment to minimize the influence of particulate impurities the ozone micro bubble aeration was also conducted in the reclaimed water filtered by 0 45 µm membrane the ozonation performance was similar to that filtered by 0 22 µm membrane fig s14 to minimize the possible ceramic membrane clogging we conducted all experiments with the water filtered by 0 22 µm membrane the filtered secondary effluent was used to simulate reclaimed water the general water qualities of tap water river water and reclaimed water are shown in table s1 2 2 ozonation experiments both ozone micro bubble and milli bubble aeration were conducted in semi batch reactors including a ceramic ultrafiltration membrane for micro bubble aeration fig 1 and a titanium aerator with milli pores for milli bubble aeration the cuboidal aeration reactor was made of plexiglass with a volume of 0 9 l 75 40 300 mm the flat ceramic membrane 30 50 mm was fixed at the bottom of the reactor ozone

gaseous ozone in the inlet and outlet gas was monitored online 3s j5000 beijing tonglin technology a mass flowmeter tsk621 beijing jierui was used to control and measure inlet gaseous flow rate the distribution of bubble diameter was measured with a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern for both micro and milli bubble aeration the analyzer can work well within the normal operating range 0 01 3500 μm however it should be noted that mastersizer presents data on a volume basis and hence is bias toward larger size bands the results can generally indicate the size level but need further measurement for more accurate information agarwal et al 2011 couto et al 2009 john et al 2022a a magnetic stirrer continuously stirred the solution at 450 rpm to increase the homogeneity of aeration for both the ozonation experiments and bubble size distribution measurements the measured bubble size under the magnetic stirring condition can reflect the actual bubble size during ozonation processes 2 3 analytical methods the solution ph was maintained with 10 mm phosphate and measured with a ph meter s400 mettler tole the ph of different water matrix was not buffered with phosphate and was adjusted to 7 0 before ozonation the aquatic ozone concentration was measured with the indigo colorimetric method bader and hoigné 1981 federation and association 2005 where the loss of potassium indigo trisulfonate by reaction with aquatic ozone decreased the absorbance at 600 nm dr6000 hach the concentrations of 2 4 d and pcba were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc lc 2030 shimadzu japan using a c18 column 4 6 250 mm 5 µm particle size cnw technologies for separation and a photodiode array detector spd 20 shimadzu japan for quantification the mobile phase was a mixture of upw containing 0 1 v v formic acid and acetonitrile in a 50 50 v v ratio the flow rate was 1 0 ml min 1 and the injection volume was 20 µl the quantification wavelengths for 2 4 d and pcba were 280 and 221 nm respectively all experiments were repeated at least two or three times the aquatic formaldehyde was quantified by hplc lc 2030 plus shimadzu corporation with a

before hplc analysis the oh yield was evaluated after ozone milli and micro bubble aeration using excessive tert butanol tba to capture oh fischbacher et al 2013 yang et al 2016a the oh was almost completely captured by tba to form formaldehyde at a stoichiometric value of 2 during ozone aeration eq 1 2 the optimal dosage of tba was 100 mm fig s3 the total ozone dose tod was calculated from the

pathway r oh and r o3 were defined as the oh exposure ratio and o3 exposure ratio respectively to tod eq 6 7 the r oh can be calculated from the degradation of pcba eq 8 9 which is a widely reported oh probe with negligible reactivity to o3 and second order reaction rate constant of 5 0 109 m 1s 1 to oh khuntia et al 2015b pi et al 2005 the r o3 can be calculated from the degradation of 2 4 d eq

results and discussion 3 1 micro bubble aeration with ceramic membrane 3 1 1 diameter of bubbles by ceramic membrane aeration the diameter of bubbles followed a logarithmic normal distribution during ozone aeration with the ceramic membrane at gaseous pressures 0 14 0 19 mpa as shown in fig 2 a with the above distribution the average values of bubble diameter can be calculated under various conditions as shown in fig 2b the ceramic membrane achieved ozone micro bubble aeration with an average diameter of bubbles of 40 80 µm when the gaseous pressure was lower than 0 19 mpa interestingly the average bubble diameter reached a minimum value of 43 µm at a gaseous pressure 0 16 mpa yet the bubble diameter of milli bubble was measured to be 2 6 mm at the same gaseous pressure with a titanium aerator as shown in fig s1 when the gaseous pressure was higher than 0 20 mpa ceramic membrane aeration failed to generate micro bubbles and the average diameter rapidly increased to 666 µm this result could be explained by that the bubble size depended on both the growth rate and duration the bubble growth duration would be longer at lower pressure while the growth rate would be faster at higher pressure in addition the dependence of bubble size on gaseous pressure would vary with the properties of ceramic membrane such as the pore size and surface hydrophilicity for further practical application the operated gaseous pressure needs to be optimized to prevent the gas converging into milli bubbles on the membranes surface with various properties 3 1 2 improved o3 transfer by micro bubble aeration ozone micro bubble aeration with the ceramic membrane significantly increased the equilibrium aquatic o3 concentration and o3 transfer rate from gaseous phase to liquid phase as shown in fig 3 a for example the aquatic o3 reached an equilibrium of 37 5 24 0 14 6 and 9 6 µm at ph 5 6 7 8 respectively by ozone micro bubble aeration which was 1 53 3 25 times higher than the value achieved by ozone milli bubble aeration fig 3b to further quantify the o3 transfer rate from gaseous phase to liquid phase a modified diffusion model combining the o3 dissolved in an ideal liquid film eq 14 and decomposition in aquatic solution eq 15 was used lewis and whitman 1924 at equilibrium the dissolved rate of o3 was equal to the decomposition rate of o3 eq 16 by substituting eq 14 into eq 15 the apparent value of aquatic o3 can be expressed as eq 17 the corresponding integral equation can be further expressed as eq 18 14 d o 3 l d t k l a o 3 m l o 3 l 15 d o 3 1 d t k l a o 3 m 1 o 3 1 k o 3 1 16 k l a o 3 e 1 o 3 1 k o 3 1 17 d o 3 1 d t k l a k o 3 e 1 o 3 1 18 ln o 3 e l o 3 l k l a k t c where t is aeration time min k l is the mass transfer coefficient of o3 in the liquid film m h 1 a is the specific surface area of the bubble m2 m3 o3 l o3 m l and o3 e l are the aquatic o3 concentrations at aeration time t maximum value aquatic solubility and equilibrium state respectively m k is the pseudo first order kinetic constant of the o3 decomposition min 1 and c is a constant related to the equilibrium state by linear fitting of ln o3 e l o3 l as a function of aeration time the mass transfer of o3 can be quantified under various solution ph values for micro bubble and milli bubble aeration as shown in fig s2 the apparent o3 transfer rates k l a k of micro bubble aeration were 3 12 3 35 3 31 and 3 26 times higher than those of milli bubble aeration at ph 5 6 7 and 8 respectively fig 3c previous studies reported the o3 transfer coefficient in the range of 10 60 µm and were 1 2 5 2 times of that of milli bubble aeration at ph 7 karamah et al 2010 liu et al 2010 shangguan et al 2018 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2015 the results varied with the size distribution of bubbles specific operating conditions and equipments john et al 2022 in this study the diameter of micro bubble was approximately 1 60 of milli bubble which resulted in 60 times higher specific surface area in addition the micro bubble has higher inner gaseous pressure and longer retention time in solution than milli bubble these factors would favor the micro bubble to show higher k la k than milli bubble john et al 2022a wu et al 2019 the variation of k l a k was minor with increasing ph from 5 to 8 regardless the aeration bubble size at elevated solution ph the ozone self decomposition k was expected to be more negative due to the rapid reaction between o3 and oh the ozone transfer coefficient k l a was also reported to be higher at elevated ph values john et al 2022a wu et al 2019 as a result the k l a k kept almost constant with increasing ph from 5 to 9 for both micro and milli bubble aeration eq 18 and fig s2 3 2 enhancement on the oh yield 3 2 1 oh yield under different solution ph values the intrinsic value of oh yield ζ oh represents the oh formation per tod the ζ oh can be quantified as the slope of the linear fit between accumulated oh and tod at various ph values as shown in fig 4 a b with increasing ph from 5 to 8 the ζ oh increased from 0 009 to 0 041 for ozone milli bubble aeration and from 0 028 to 0 147 for ozone micro bubble aeration fig 4c the favored ζ oh at elevated ph solution has also been observed in previous studies and was explained by the higher oh which can rapidly react with o3 and generate oh von gunten 2003a b notably micro bubble aeration had a much higher ζ oh than milli bubble aeration especially in alkaline solution the ζ oh of micro bubble aeration was 3 54 times that of milli bubble aeration ph 8 the promotion of ζ oh by micro bubble aeration may result from various pathways i e more reactive interfacial reaction higher dissolved o3 and subsequent decomposition into oh in the alkaline solution microbubble was attached with more oh which may favor the oh formation jabesa and ghosh 2021 ushikubo et al 2010 thus the promotion of ζ oh would be more obvious in alkaline solution than in acidic solution the importance of each pathway will be discussed in later section the higher ζ oh can further imply that ozone micro bubble aeration would be prominent for the elimination of o3 resistent micropollutants e g 2 4 d primidone diethyltoluamide han et al 2022 especially in the water of circumneutral ph 7 5 8 5 3 2 2 enhancement pathways oh may be generated from the decomposition of dissolved o3 and direct interfacial transformation of o3 during ozonation john et al 2022b wu et al 2019 as shown in fig 4d and eq 19 the interfacial transformation of o3 was negligible for oh formation by ozone milli bubble aeration john et al 2022b but not quantified for ozone micro bubble aeration the decomposition of dissolved o3 or direct interfacial transformation of o3 or both may contribute to the promotion of oh formation by ozone micro bubble aeration if the oh formation from o3 transfer is the dominant pathway the oh yield would be proportional to the apparent o3 transfer thus the ratio of ζ oh micro to ζ oh milli would be close to the ratio of k l a k micro to k l a k milli which can be conveniently verified thus oh formation from o3 transfer is presumed to be the dominant pathway for ozone micro bubble aeration while the contribution from interfacial transformation is considered to be negligible the ζ oh of micro bubble aeration ζ oh micro can be simplified as eq 20 and expressed as a function of milli bubble aeration ζ oh milli where the coefficient is the ratio of the o3 transfer rate between micro bubble aeration and milli bubble aeration η as shown in eq 21 22 and fig 4e similarly the steady state oh concentration from micro bubble aeration oh micro would be linear to that of milli bubble aeration oh milli as shown in eq 23 and fig 4f 19 ζ o h 1 t o d ζ o h d issolve t o d dissolve ζ o h int e r t o d int e r 20 ζ o h ζ o h d issolve t o d dissolve t o d 21 ζ oh micro η ζ oh milli 22 η k l a k micro k l a k milli 23 o h m i c r o η o h m i l l i where toddissolve and todinter represent the tod of the decomposition of dissolved o3 and interfacial transformation respectively m and ζ oh dissolve and ζ oh inter are the oh yields via aquatic decomposition and interfacial transformation of o3 respectively the experimental results of ζ oh micro and oh micro under various solution ph values can be depicted by eq 21 and eq 23 respectively fig 4e and 4f a 1 1 linear fitting can well depict the relation between ζ oh micro and η ζ oh milli or between oh micro and η oh milli the well fitting result can verify the presumption that the interfacial transformation of o3 slightly contributed to oh formation for ozone micro bubble aeration ozone micro bubble aeration thus enhanced ζ oh over that of milli bubble aeration by promoting o3 transfer from the gaseous phase to the aquatic phase rather than through interfacial transformation notably the oh micro in acidic solution ph 5 0 6 0 fitted to the 1 1 line well while that in circumneutral solution ph 7 0 8 0 slightly deviated from the 1 1 line indicating that the interfacial transformation of o3 into oh becomes more prominent at elevated solution ph at elevated ph the surface of micro bubbles may become more negatively charged and preferentially adsorbed with more oh jabesa and ghosh 2021 ushikubo et al 2010 which favor the decomposition of dissolved o3 and formation of oh 3 3 enhancement of 2 4 d degradation the ozone micro bubble aeration significantly outperformed milli bubble aeration for the degradation of 2 4 d under various ph values as shown in fig s4 within 20 min aeration 2 4 d was almost completely eliminated by micro bubble aeration but was only 30 eliminated through milli bubble aeration limited to the reactor height the bubble contact time of milli bubble was expected to be lower than micro bubble which may underestimate the milli bubble ozonation john et al 2022a besides the promotion of ozone transfer the promotion of liquid ozone concentration by ozone micro bubble contributed to the prominent oxidation performance thus though the limited reactor height may amplify the performance of ozone micro bubble aeration the degradation based on tod would be better than that based on aeration time for the comparison of micro and milli bubble ozonation at specific ozone utilities and reactor operations so the degradation of 2 4 d was replotted as a function of tod with online monitoring gaseous ozone concentration for the inlet and outlet gas throughout the ozonation process as shown in fig 5 a at a specific tod micro bubble aeration resulted in much higher removal of 2 4 d than milli bubble aeration ozone micro bubble aeration achieved 95 removal of 2 4 d at 187 5 µm tod while ozone milli bubble aeration required approximately 420 µm tod this result could be explained by that the micro bubble aeration showed much higher ozone transfer which leaded to higher aquatic ozone concentration and oh yield and then more superior oxidation performance than milli bubble aeration thus similar oxidation performance may be expected for micro and milli bubble aeration with the same dissolved aquatic ozone doses rather than tod the degradation of 2 4 d can be well fitted with pseudo first order kinetics to tod eq 10 as shown in fig s6 the fitted kinetic constant k obs 2 4 d for micro bubble aeration was much higher than for milli bubble aeration and was 3 08 3 57 4 04 and 4 36 times higher than that of milli bubble aeration at ph 5 6 7 and 8 respectively fig 5b the promotion of ozone micro bubble aeration was further evaluated in terms of o3 oxidation r o3 and oh oxidation r oh pathways compared with milli bubble aeration micro bubble aeration significantly increased the r oh by 2 70 3 12 3 62 and 4 16 times and increased the r o3 by 3 81 4 48 4 91 and 4 80 times respectively at ph 5 6 7 and 8 fig s7 these results indicated that micro bubble aeration can promote the oxidation performance through both o3 oxidation and oh oxidation pathways with more obvious impact on r o3 the possible reason was that the ph affected the performance via the primary step of ozone dissolution and subsequent oh oxidation the promotion of oh oxidation was a dominant cause of the superior performance especially at elevated solution ph fig 5b at ph 8 the k obs 2 4 d for the oh oxidation pathway increased from 2 1 103 m 1s 1 to 8 8 103 m 1s 1 by changing milli bubble aeration to micro bubble aeration which accounted for 64 2 of the total increase of k obs 2 4 d 3 4 influencing factors on the oxidation of ozone micro bubbles 3 4 1 influences of operational conditions the inlet gaseous pressure did not significantly affect the degradation of 2 4 d by ozone micro bubble aeration at the pressure range of 0 14 0 18 mpa as shown in fig 6 and fig s8 however the degradation of 2 4 d decreased when the pressure was further increased to 0 20 mpa which can be attributed to the much larger bubble diameter correspondingly the k obs 2 4 d remained almost constant 8 71 8 93 103 m 1s 1 at inlet gaseous pressure 0 14 0 18 mpa and then significantly decreased to 5 03 103 m 1s 1 when the inlet gaseous pressure was increased to 0 20 mpa notably the contribution of oh oxidation 58 8 59 2 did not significantly change when the inlet gaseous pressure ranged from 0 14 to 0 18 mpa the above results indicated that ozone bubbles may not affect either the oxidation performance or the oh formation rate when the bubble diameter is lower than 100 µm but they may dramatically decrease the performance when the bubble diameter increases to higher than 500 µm as shown in fig s8c this information may be helpful for the practical operation and optimization that the ozone bubble size is necessitated to be lower than 100 µm for prominent performance the degradation of 2 4 d by micro bubble aeration under different inlet ozone gaseous concentrations and flow rates and the corresponding linear fits were also investigated as shown in fig 7 and fig s9 11 to achieve a specific 2 4 d removal rate ozone micro bubble aeration required a shorter time with at higher inlet gaseous o3 concentrations or flow rates fig s9 but required similar tod fig 7a the above results indicate that the inlet gaseous o3 concentration or flow rate cannot influence the apparent o3 transfer rate k l a k and subsequent oh formation efficiency this was supported by the constant k obs 2 4 d and oh oxidation contribution observed under various inlet gaseous o3 concentrations and flow rates fig 7b 3 4 2 influences of inorganic ions and natural organic material the degradation of 2 4 d by ozone micro bubble aeration in the presence of inorganic anions i e chloride and carbonate and humic acid and the corresponding linear fits were investigated as shown in fig 8 and fig s12 the chloride did not significantly affect the degradation of 2 4 d and the contribution of oh either at high 300 mg cl l 1 or low 30 mg cl l 1 chloride concentrations although chloride was previously reported to react with oh to form cloh it will rapidly proceed in the reverse reaction k 6 1 0 8 109 s 1 yu 2004 yu et al 2004 yu and barker 2003 the degradation of 2 4 d was not significantly influenced until the inorganic carbon increased to 100 mg c l 1 the k obs 2 4 d remained almost constant with increasing inorganic carbon to 20 mg c l 1 but decreased by 16 4 when the inorganic carbon further increased to 100 mg c l 1 k obs 2 4 d 9 4 103 m 1s 1 notably inorganic carbon preferentially decreased oh oxidation 21 3 decrease more than o3 oxidation 8 7 decrease at ph 7 inorganic carbon dominantly exists as hco3 81 and co3 2 19 and rapidly consumes oh jin et al 2016 mehrvar et al 2001 although the carbonate radical may also contribute to the elimination of pollutants yang et al 2016b it has much lower reactivity to most compounds such as 2 4 d the k obs 2 4 d remained almost constant with increasing humic acid concentration to 2 mg c l 1 but decreased by 47 5 with when the humic acid further increased to 10 mg c l 1 k obs 2 4 d 6 1 103 m 1s 1 notably the inhibition of k obs 2 4 d was mainly attributed to the inhibition of oh oxidation 67 5 decrease humic acid was reported to suppress ozonation performance by the promotion of competing consumptions of o3 and oh oulton et al 2015 or promotion of the ozonation performance by catalyzing o3 to form oh dong et al 2010 xiong and graham 1992 in this study humic acid suppressed ozone micro bubble aeration only when the concentration was higher 10 mg c l 1 the result indicates that ozone micro bubble aeration is suitable for the water with relatively low matric concentration but may be suppressed in the water with relatively high matric concentration e g industrial water and reclaimed water therefore ozone micro bubble aeration should be combinedly applied with pre treatments for the water with relatively low quality e g high humic acid concentration 3 4 3 influences of the water matrix ozone micro bubble aeration with the ceramic membrane was investigated for oxidation performance of 2 4 d in various water matrices i e tap water river water and reclaimed water as shown in fig 8 the corresponding linear fits are shown in fig s13 ozone micro bubble aeration had similar 2 4 d degradation in phosphate solution and tap water but had 4 8 and 34 3 lower k obs 2 4 d in river water and reclaimed water respectively more interestingly the suppression of oh oxidation accounted for 62 7 of the total suppression of k obs 2 4 d in reclaimed water reclaimed water is much more complex than other water matrix and contains more inorganic carbon and organic humics gulamussen et al 2021 jin et al 2016 as a result both o3 and oh are quenched more rapidly in the matrices of reclaimed water 4 conclusions this study investigated ozone micro bubble aeration with a flat ceramic ultrafiltration membrane where the average diameter of ozone bubbles was 40 80 µm at a gaseous pressure of 0 14 0 19 mpa ozone micro bubble aeration increased the equilibrium aquatic o3 concentration by 1 53 3 25 times and the apparent o3 transfer rate by 3 12 3 35 times when compared with ozone milli bubble aeration at ph 5 8 notably ozone micro bubble aeration had much higher ζ oh than milli bubble aeration especially in alkaline solution the promotion of ζ oh was mainly a result of faster o3 transfer followed by decomposition rather than interfacial reactions on the bubble interface ozone micro bubble aeration obviously outperformed milli bubble aeration for the degradation of 2 4 d the degradation kinetics of micro bubble aeration were 2 08 3 36 times higher than milli bubble aeration oh oxidation increased by 2 70 4 16 times and o3 oxidation increased by 3 81 4 91 times the oxidation performance of ozone micro bubble aeration was not significantly influenced by operational factors such as gaseous pressure 0 14 0 18 mpa inlet gaseous o3 concentration or gaseous flow rate but was inhibited by high concentrations of inorganic carbon and humic acid through the suppression on oh oxidation ozone micro bubble aeration resulted in a minor decrease 4 8 in 2 4 d degradation in river water and an obvious decrease 34 3 in reclaimed water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

14813,slow sand filtration is popular in drinking water treatment for the removal of a wide range of contaminants e g particles organic matter and microorganisms the schmutzdecke in slow sand filters ssfs is known to be essential for pathogen removal however this layer is also responsible for increased head loss since the role of deeper layers in bacteria and virus removal is poorly understood this research investigated the removal of e coli wr1 and phix 174 at different depths of a full scale ssf filter material from top 0 5 cm middle 5 20 cm and deep 20 35 cm layers of an established filter was used in an innovative experimental set up to differentiate physical chemical and biological removal processes in the analysis we distinguished between removal by biological activity biofilm and just sand in addition we modelled processes by a one side kinetic model the different layers contributed substantially to overall log removal of e coli wr1 1 4 1 7 log10 and phix 174 0 4 0 6 log10 for e coli wr1 biological activity caused major removal followed by removal within biofilm and sand whereas removal of phix 174 mainly occurred within sand followed by biofilm and biological activity narrow pore radii in the top layer obtained by micro computed tomography scanner suggested enhanced retention of bacteria due to constrained transport the retention rates of e coli wr1 and phix 174 in top layer were four and five times higher than deeper layers respectively kret 1 09 min 1 vs 0 26 min 1 for e coli wr1 and kret 0 32 min 1 vs of 0 06 min 1 for phix 174 while this higher rate was restricted to the schmutzdecke alone top 5 cm the deeper layers extend to around 1 m in full scale filters therefore the contribution of deeper layers of established ssfs to the overall log removal of bacteria and viruses is much more substantial than the schmutzdecke graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords slow sand filters pathogen removal schmutzdecke one site kinetic model mature biofilm abbreviations ssf slow sand filter e coli escherichia coli bsf biosand filter hna high nucleic acid lrv log reduction value data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction slow sand filtration one of the earliest water treatment processes has been a major contributor to drinking water safety chan et al 2018 chen et al 2021 haig et al 2011 maurya et al 2020 in the past decades slow sand filters ssfs have demonstrated the capacity to effectively remove turbidity dissolved organic matter and a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms bacteria viruses and protozoa however in recent times the focus has also been on the removal of biodegradable organic matter to increase biological stability of drinking water van der kooij et al 2017 in low resource settings intermittently operated ssf popularly known as the biosand filter bsf has been a promising household scale point of use pou technology for removal of microbes from drinking water the bsf has been highly successful when measured by user satisfaction durability and simplicity of design and operation elliott et al 2011 napotnik et al 2020 while ssfs differ from bsf in design and operation they offer a major benefit of chemicals free turbidity and pathogen removal compared to any direct competing technologies like membrane filtration coagulation ozonation and few more de oliveira and schneider 2019 drinking water treatment plants in the netherlands the united kingdom sweden brazil and many more use ssfs as a third or final treatment step in drinking water production due to their low energy consumption and high efficiency when drinking water is distributed without residual disinfectants such as chlorine sousi et al 2020 utilities opt for a multi stage treatment scheme where ssfs are the final treatment step to produce microbiologically safe and biologically stable drinking water van der kooij et al 2017 while ssfs are known to be safe and robust there is also consensus that there are a few drawbacks and limitations in operation the filters have a large land footprint as they are designed to operate at low filtration rates the schmutzdecke a dense biofilm in the top layer of ssfs is considered a key barrier for pathogens and other contaminants but overgrowth of biomass in this layer increases head loss in the filter andreoli and sabogal paz 2020 dizer et al 2004 hijnen et al 2007 schijven et al 2013 as a result cleaning techniques like scraping and wet harrowing are applied which in turn demand a long ripening period of 6 8 weeks to re establish the schmutzdecke and restore filter performance huisman and wood 1974 jenkins et al 2011 the importance of schmutzdecke in ssfs is promoted by high microbial abundance diversity and a broad range of functions compared to deeper layers of the sand bed chen et al 2021 stratification of biomass with depth is not surprising as substrate concentration and biomass acting on substrates are highest at the surface of the sand bed thus purification capacity and associated processes may be stratified over the filter height chen et al 2021 lee et al 2014 tatari et al 2016 recent investigation on mature full scale ssfs showed that removal of the schmutzdecke did not impact coliform counts and flow cytometry bacterial profiles in terms of intact cells and high nucleic acid content hna in effluent water chan et al 2018 they reported that deeper layers in mature filters operating for several years may have extensive biofilms with microbial community required for producing consistent microbial water quality generally during scraping the schmutzdecke and the top few centimetres 2 5 cm of sand are removed but deeper layers are retained unaltered pfannes et al 2015 observed 16s rrna gene copy numbers of around 106 copies ml in the deep sand bed although the count is less than 1011 copies ml commonly found in the schmutzdecke the total volume occupied by the sand bed is much greater than the volume in the schmutzdecke oh et al 2018 observed that microorganisms in the deeper layers grew faster by metabolizing more easily degradable organic matter compared to microbes in the schmutzdecke biofilms in both schmutzdecke and sand bed can entrap cells and support microbial interactions thus ssf performance may be a balance between processes in different layers of sand bed chan et al 2018 pfannes et al 2015 for example bacteria and protozoa removal occurred mainly in the schmutzdecke but virus removal improved with filter depth elliott et al 2008 while the influence of schmutzdecke on pathogen removal and associated mechanisms has been studied extensively hijnen et al 2004 schijven et al 2013 unger and collins 2008 the contribution of deeper depths in removal has not received much attention in the past previous studies evaluating filter performance have been largely performed on filters at lab or pilot scale where a sand bed microbial community has not had years to establish haig et al 2014 hijnen et al 2004 pfannes et al 2015 unger and collins 2008 in filters without an established microbial community in the deeper layers changes in treated water quality could be more coupled to the status of the schmutzdecke chan et al 2018 therefore understanding of removal processes in both schmutzdecke and deep sand bed in established full scale filters is crucial to enable improvements in design and operational procedures of ssfs in terms of new filter designs bed height and cleaning procedures for biomass preservation within the filter in this study we explored bacteria and virus removal capacity of schmutzdecke and deeper layers of an established ssf to distinct various co occurring removal processes including straining attachment and microbial inactivation the top and deeper depths of the filter may be evaluated as separate systems due to vast differences in the physical and biological characteristics of sand that influence microbial transport hence knowledge of stratification of biotic and abiotic induced processes that aid microbial removal is important for further optimization and promotion of the ssf technology in this study we hypothesized that deeper layers contribute substantially to e coli wr1 and phix 174 bacteriophage removal due to a mature biofilm in the sand bed therefore in an innovative experimental set up the removal capacity and transport of indicator enteric pathogens e coli wr1 and phix 174 were investigated at different depths of a full scale filter to investigate the contribution of physical chemical and biological processes in removal sand from different depths was investigated directly after inactivation of microbial activity by sodium azide and after incineration to remove the biofilm the retention and reentrainment behaviour of e coli wr1 and phix 174 at different depths were modelled using a one site kinetic model a micro computed tomography scanner micro ct and environmental scanning electron microscopy esem were employed to investigate the influence of porosity and sand characteristics on microbial transport at different depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling at full scale slow sand filter an established ssf producing drinking water for over 67 years built in 1955 at a drinking water treatment plant of dunea located at katwijk a drinking water utility in the netherlands was used in this study the plant receives raw water from the river meuse and is further treated by managed aquifer recharge in the dunes pellet softening aeration rapid sand filtration with powdered activated carbon dosing and lastly slow sand filtration the ssf in our study has been in operation for approx 28 years without sand replacement at the moment of sand sampling the filter had a sand bed height of 0 9 m with grain size of 0 4 0 6 mm followed by 0 3 m of gravel layer 4 6 mm and 0 12 m of underdrains for uniform passage of filtered water the hydraulic loading was 0 4 m h the in situ water temperature at the treatment plant was mostly stable between 10 and 12 c as seasonal fluctuation was regulated during dune filtration over a period of operation generally a few years the filters become clogged with biomass to restore water flow the top layers 2 5 cm of the ssf including schmutzdecke is removed by mechanical scraping the filter in this study was last scraped 653 days ago during one such scraping event intact sand samples from mature ssf was sampled up to a depth of 40 cm sand was core sampled from depths 0 5 cm top 5 20 cm middle and 20 35 cm deep by inserting and gently removing a sterile plexiglass cylinder the cylinder had an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and height of 5 cm for top layer and 15 cm for middle and deep layers and closed at the top with a rubber stopper sampling with the cylindrical cores provided the advantage to take undisturbed in situ sand samples without impacting the 3d structure and was further transformed into columns for the experiments two sand cores from each depth were sampled at two randomly selected locations to be used for duplicate column experiments 2 2 experimental set up the experimental set up consisted of small plexiglass columns with inner diameter of 2 5 cm and bed height of 5 cm for sand from top layer 0 5 cm and 15 cm for sand from middle 5 20 cm and deep layer 20 35 cm the core sampled sand from each depth was operated in columns under three conditions to simulate scenarios of physical chemical and biological processes in treatment active biofilm inactive biofilm and no biofilm the sand was prepared as per the following i active biofilm sand sand directly obtained from the full scale ssf as described in section 2 1 the three depths in consideration had different active biomass concentrations with the highest bioactivity in the top layer and the lowest in the deep layer as shown by atp analyses in figure s1 ii inactive biofilm sand microbial activity on sand from three depths and in the water phase was suppressed by continuously dosing sodium azide at a concentration of 6 mm 390 mg l elliott et al 2011 dosing was continued for three days until no biological activity was detected the activity was determined by measuring cellular atp on 1 g of sand using the deposit surface analysis kit dsa luminultra technologies ltd according to the manufacturer s protocol iii no biofilm sand biofilm on sand from three depths was destroyed by drying sand at 105 c and then ignited at 440 c in a muffle furnace as per british standard british standards institution 1990b rodgers et al 2004 the biofilm was burnt off at this temperature leaving behind a mixture of sand and ash the sand mixture from 3 depths was washed through a 53 μm sieve and filled into their respective columns the influent feeding the full scale ssfs at the water treatment plant was used as influent for the columns at a filtration rate of 0 4 m3 m2 h to replicate full scale ssf condition the pore volume and porosity in the columns were determined using deuterium 2h as a tracer according to bertelkamp et al 2016 further the columns were challenged with enteric bacteria and virus indicators e coli wr1 and phix 174 bacteriophages 2 3 e coli wr1 and phix 174 preparation and enumeration the experiments were carried out with e coli wr1 nctc 13 167 and bacteriophage phix 174 atcc 13 706 b1 e coli wr1 is widely used as an indicator of enteric bacteria in drinking water studies eisfeld et al 2022 schijven et al 2013 and is used here as a reference for bacterial removal a highly concentrated suspension of e coli wr1 was prepared by growing in buffered peptone water for 18 h at 37 c harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min and washing in sterile water as per iso 9308 1 e coli wr1 was enumerated by membrane filtration and incubation onto chromocult agar for 24 h at 37 c phix 174 is an icosahedral single stranded dna phage with a diameter of 26 nm and an isoelectric point of 4 4 chrysikopoulos and aravantinou 2012 soliman et al 2020a 2020b phix 174 is generally seen as a good viral surrogate due to its size and shape resemblance to several human enteroviruses such as poliovirus norovirus etc as well as its low hydrophobicity and stability bicudo et al 2021 oudega et al 2021 although phix174 may not be an ideal conservative colloidal tracer somatic coliphages have gained special importance in europe in recent years as a reliable viral faecal indicator due to their high prevalence in sewage and persistence in the environment oudega et al 2021 a highly concentrated suspension of phix 174 1011 pfu ml was prepared and concentrations were assayed as described in iso 10 705 2 4 spiking of e coli wr1 and phix 174 challenge water was prepared by dosing e coli wr1 or phix 174 stock solution to the influent at a concentration of 105 to 106 cfu ml and stirred 150 rpm to prevent settling the influent concentration was sampled in triplicate two times before spiked water was distributed and one time after the spiking was done challenge experiments with active biofilm inactive biofilm and no biofilm sand were performed on days 5 10 and 13 respectively spiking was done by lowering the supernatant slightly above the sand bed and dosing the challenge water using a peristaltic pump after spiking for 2 3 pore volumes pvs influent water free of e coli wr1 or phix 174 was dosed for the next 8 pvs effluent samples were collected in 250 ml sterile bottles every 5 min for the first 4 5 pvs and every 10 min for the next 5 pvs the collected samples were refrigerated and further analysed on the same day to yield breakthrough curves 2 5 micro computed tomography the top layer column in active inactive and no biofilm conditions were subjected to micro computed tomography micro ct phoenix nanotom boston ma usa 180 kv 0 5 ma with a maximum resolution 0 5 1 0 µm before imaging sand columns were disconnected from influent and effluent lines while maintaining the sand bed saturated imagej http rsb info nih gov was used to obtain porosity distribution and calculate pore radius 2 6 modelling transport of e coli wr1 and phix

retention and reentrainment rate coefficients respectively min 1 in this work retention processes such as unfavourable and favourable attachment hydrophobic interactions and straining are undertaken together under a single retention rate coefficient while reentrainment rate included detachment from previously un favourably attached microorganisms or detachment of previously hydrophobically retained microorganisms 2 7 estimating contribution of physical chemical and biological processes to removal the estimation of contribution of removal of e coli wr1 and phix 174 by intact biofilm assumed as predation grazing and enzyme induced inactivation biofilm assumed as straining hydrodynamic interaction and favourable attachment and sand only assumed as favourable and unfavourable attachment was performed using log reduction values lrvs in active inactive and no biofilm experiments as inputs intact biofilm induced removal was determined by subtracting lrvs in inactive biofilm from lrvs in active biofilm experiments the contribution of removal by sand alone was directly obtained from lrvs in no biofilm experiment further biofilm led removal was calculated from the difference of lrvs in inactive and no biofilm experiments in the no biofilm experiments the effects of biofilm removal and sand repacking see section 2 2 which clearly affected filter bed pore structure were neglected 2 8 data analysis data represents the mean and standard error se of duplicate microbial assays in duplicate columns n 4 statistical comparison of means of e coli wr1 and phix 174 removal at depths was performed by anova factor depth pairwise comparison of statistically different means in a series was performed with a pos hoc tukey test p 0 05 means for different filter media conditions for each depth were also compared using anova factor condition and further with pos hoc tukey test 3 results 3 1 e coli wr1 and phix 174 attenuation in active biofilm sand fig 1 shows breakthrough curves btcs of e coli wr1 and phix 174 both data and fitted curves in top middle and deep layer columns under active biofilm conditions all btcs are characterized by a climbing limb a plateau phase a declining limb and finally a gradual declining tail the btcs of e coli wr1 exhibit a very low relative breakthrough concentration in the range of 0 02 0 03 in top middle and deep layers resulting in lrvs of 1 69 1 52 and 1 41 log10 respectively fig 1 table 1 it is important to note that sand bed height was 5 cm in the top layer column and 15 cm in middle and deep layer columns as a result the estimation of log removal per cm showed removal of 0 33 log10 cm in the top layer substantially higher compared to 0 10 0 12 log10 cm in the middle and deep layer columns anova tests conducted for removal using depths as the independent variable produced p values below 0 05 f 11 09 p 0 0001 df 2 showing that lrvs at three depths were statistically different the r2 values between 0 83 0 95 indicated that breakthrough could be well described by one retention rate and one reentrainment rate parameter e coli wr1 displayed a kret of 1 09 min 1 in the top layer which was 5 times higher than kret of 0 26 min 1 in the middle and deep layers the btcs of phix 174 showed a high relative breakthrough concentration in the range of 0 27 0 39 which was 10 times higher than e coli wr1 relative breakthrough concentration the btcs resulted in poor but comparable lrvs of 0 56 0 41 and 0 42 log10 in top middle and deep layers respectively f 1 91 p 0 142 df 2 further the estimation of log removal per cm showed removal of 0 12 log10 cm in top layer 4 times higher than removal of 0 03 log10 cm in middle and deep layers anova tests performed using depth as an independent variable produced p values above 0 05 f 2 23 p 0 181 df 2 meaning that for phix 174 the influence of depths in removal is statistically insignificant the btcs were well described by one retention rate parameter and one re entrainment rate parameter shown by r2 values greater than 0 9 similar to the observations for e coli wr1 phix 174 showed higher kret of 0 32 min 1 compared to kret of 0 06 min 1 in middle and deep layers 3 2 e coli wr1 and phix 174 attenuation in inactive biofilm and no biofilm sand upon suppression of microbial activity by sodium azide lrvs of e coli wr1 in the top middle and deep layers drastically decreased by 0 80 0 80 and 0 70 log10 to lrvs of 0 92 0 71 and 0 69 log10 respectively it is evident from the btcs in fig 2 that the relative breakthrough concentrations and tails in inactive biofilm conditions were at least one order of magnitude higher than the btcs under active biofilm conditions statistical testing showed that e coli wr1 reductions were significantly lower by 0 7 0 8 log10 after microbial activity suppression f 15 36 p 0 0004 df 1 lower removal in inactive biofilm experiments is also reflected by the low retention rates in all three depths in the no biofilm experiments lrvs of e coli wr1 significantly reduced by 0 50 0 30 and 0 30 log10 to 0 42 0 42 and 0 44 log10 in top middle and deep layers respectively f 16 94 p 0 0003 df 2 this was also depicted by a further reduction in kret as shown in table 2 while phix 174 displayed a similar behaviour as e coli wr1 the removal was low the absence of microbial activity caused lrvs to reduce by 0 20 0 20 and 0 15 log10 to 0 46 0 35 and 0 34 log10 in top middle and deep layers respectively also displayed by lower kret table 2 although the variations seem minimal anova test revealed a statistically significant removal before and after bioactivity inhibition f 21 56 p 0 011 df 1 no biofilm experiments further reduced lrvs by 0 20 0 10 0 log10 to 0 31 0 26 and 0 28 log10 in top middle and deep layers respectively the influence of loss of biofilm was statistically significant in top and middle layers f 11 16 p 0 0004 df 1 but not in the deep layer f 1 13 p 0 05 df 1 table 2 3 3 micro computed tomography scanner the biofilm dense schmutzdecke may influence porosity in the top layer and alter flow path micro computed tomography scanner micro ct was used to directly characterize the pore structure and porosity distribution in the top layer column in active inactive and no biofilm conditions a comparison of porosity profiles fig 3 a shows that porosity in active and inactive biofilm columns is much lower than porosity in absence of biofilm in the active biofilm column porosity increased along the filter height the lowest porosity of 0 27 was recorded near the column inlet which increased to 0 32 almost at the bottom of the sand bed 5 cm the inactive biofilm column depicted the same trend in porosity distribution on the other hand the column without biofilm showed a consistent porosity in the range of 0 38 0 40 throughout the height of the sand bed further investigation on pore radius showed that pore radii in the column with no biofilm spanned between 15 and 75 μm with a median around 35 μm fig 3c in the active and inactive biofilm columns pore radii ranged between 1 and 35 μm with a median of 15 μm fig 3c in active and inactive biofilm columns pore radii of 1 μm which are in the range of average size of e coli wr1 made up 0 03 0 07 of the total pore volume 4 discussion 4 1 significance of mature biofilm this study showed that top middle and deep layers of mature ssf caused substantial removal of e coli wr1 1 4 1 7 log10 and phix 174 0 4 0 6 log10 indicating the significance of mature biofilm in the sand bed schmutzdecke is described as a visibly thick brownish slimy layer unlike the biofilms in deeper layers that can only be visualized under the microscope hence a general assumption is that pathogen removal by microbial activity associated processes like predation grazing or enzyme induced inactivation occurs mainly in the schmutzdecke where biological activity is the highest chen et al 2021 schjiven et al 2013 complementary to the previous observations we found that microbial activity in intact biofilm contributed to 0 70 0 80 log10 of e coli wr1 removal at all three depths table 3 meanwhile the intact biofilm slightly influenced phix 174 removal with 0 10 log10 at all three depths in biological filters stratification of biomass and bioactivity is observed due to environmental and chemical gradients e g doc nh4 chen et al 2021 despite these variations the substantial contribution of deeper depths to overall bacteria and virus log removal suggests the importance of a well functioning biofilm in the sand bed mature biofilms in filters functioning over a while have been reported to own different physical and biological properties such as thickness morphology and microbial community composition compared to young biofilms in newly established filters boe hansen et al 2002 bai et al 2022 haig et al 2015 in this study we observed that biofilm associated removal by straining hydrodynamic interaction and favourable attachment contributed to e coli wr1 removal of 0 5 log10 in the top layer and 0 3 log10 in middle and deep layers table 3 the contribution to phix 174 removal was rather low between 0 1 0 2 log10 earlier studies showed schmutzdecke thickness as one of the major factors increasing pathogen removal in ssfs schijven et al 2013 increased biofilm thickness by biomass accumulation is a consequence of filter ageing or maturation elliot et al 2011 hijnen et al 2007 schijven et al 2013 enhanced attachment and straining of bacteria and viruses have been observed for biofilms with higher thickness compared to relatively thin biofilms afrooz and boehm 2016 the favourable retention of bacteria and viruses in biofilm coated surface vs no biofilm surface is shown by higher retention rates in the former thus depicting different transport behaviour fig 1 and 2 biological properties of biofilm such as microbial community abundance diversity and evenness increase with filter maturation haig et al 2015 in newly built ssfs where biofilm has not had years to develop schmutzdecke microbial community may be distinctive from that of the sand bed in such young filters treatment performance may be more coupled to the status of the schmutzdecke chan et al 2018 in mature ssfs this will not be the case as consequent temporal changes are marginal haig et al 2015 e g the overall community composition in the first 50 cm of the sand bed is similar for bacteria archaea and eukaryotes li et al 2017 wakelin et al 2011 haig et al 2015 even at low abundance eukaryotic communities are strongly related to the removal of pathogenic bacteria by grazing and predation weber shirk and dick 1997a 1997b stott et al 2001 haig et al 2015 based on these observations biological removal processes may be prominent even in the deeper layers and not restricted to the schmutzdecke as previously assumed 4 2 retention processes at different depths active and inactive biofilm on sand increased retention of e coli wr1 as seen by higher kret values compared to no biofilm experiments at all three depths the top layer caused four times higher kret of e coli wr1 compared to middle and deep layers 1 09 min 1 vs 0 26 min 1 similarly for phix 174 the influence of active and inactive biofilm was prominent in top layer i e 5 times higher kret in top layer than deeper layers it is worthy to note that e coli wr1 retention was greater than phix 174 at all three depths however the change in kret between top and deeper layers was greater for the latter this highlights the value of top layer in terms of surface functionality and biological activity on sand in virus removal these observations indicate varying contribution of different retention processes at different depths for each type of microorganism from the modelling results we infer based on literature that retention processes like straining hydrophobic interactions and favourable and unfavourable attachment are occurring afrooz et al 2018 fu et al 2023 straining is caused when microbes are trapped in pore throats that are too small to allow passage foppen et al 2005 we observed that biofilms decreased the pore radii sizes in the top layer from 15 70 μm to 0 5 35 μm with narrow pores chances of e coli wr1 retention by straining is higher due to higher chance of collision with biofilm and large size of bacteria he et al 2020 foppen et al 2007 additionally strained bacteria would not be reentrained unless biofilm sloughing happens which is not the case in our experiments as shown by 100 times lower kreent of e coli wr1 than kret in the top layer however for viruses physical straining within the biofilm is unlikely due to their small size supported by relatively lower kret in the top layer the fact that schmutzdecke removal scraping reduced bacteria lrvs and not viruses in earlier studies hijnen et al al 2007 schijven et al 2013 may support the argument that straining may be an important retention mechanism for bacteria in the top layer although role of other biological retention mechanisms such as predation grazing enzyme induced inactivation and attachment to biofilm cannot be excluded enhanced retention of e coli wr1 and phix 174 in biofilm sand may also be supported by extracellular polymeric substances eps in biofilms eps components proteins and polysaccharides could bind and form hydrophobic interaction with bacterial surface functional groups such as teichoic acids and phospholipids fu et al 2023 xiao and wiesner 2013 in addition positively charged amine groups in eps promote electrostatic attraction with negatively charged bacteria and viruses allowing for favourable attachment guo et al 2015 in middle and deep layers the biomass levels were much lower than in the top layer suggesting the presence of relatively thin biofilms kret in both depths was slightly higher in the presence of biofilm indicating their influence on retention processes porosity distribution in middle and deep layers was not investigated in this study but the trend of increasing porosity with depth in top layer suggests that microbial retention by straining may not be critical in deeper depths however the contribution of hydrophobic interactions and favourable and unfavourable attachment cannot be overlooked this study did not quantify the exact contribution of different retention processes to e coli wr1 and phix removal as such an effort was beyond the scope of the present study interestingly kret of e coli wr1 and phix 174 in no biofilm experiments was not negligible under no biofilm condition removal is determined by clean bed collisions and the classic colloid filtration mechanisms interception brownian diffusion and gravitational deposition of which interception and brownian diffusion are likely most important for bacteria and virus removal respectively afrooz et al 2018 bradford et al 2003 at neutral ph as in our experiments colloids e coli wr1 phix 174 and sand grain surface are both negatively charged and therefore repulsive tripathi et al 2011 however when the distance between colloids and sand grain is small enough less than a few nm the attractive van der waals force may become dominant thus causing attachment foppen et al 2005 on the other hand favourable attachment of negatively charged bacteria viruses can occur on patches of positively charged surfaces on sand grains hence the higher intensity of kret for both e coli wr1 and phix 174 in top layer may be attributed to relatively high concentration of fe and mn oxides in top layer sand as shown in fig s3 b despite these differences similar removal of e coli wr1 and phix 174 at different bed heights in top middle and deep layers is likely caused by small sticking efficiency variations within the bacterium and virus population despite the variation in sticking efficiencies as reported in literature hijnen et al 2004 and schijven et al 2013 observed that removal data of e coli wr1 were concomitant with removal of thermotolerant coliforms and naturally present e coli bacteria in pilot and full scale filter studies in terms of viruses elliott et al 2008 observed higher reduction of human enteric virus echovirus 12 than bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 in bsf suggesting that virus removal depends upon the specific viral agent 4 3 balanced contribution of schmutzdecke and deeper layers to microbial removal in this study we hypothesised that deeper layers in established ssfs contribute to substantial removal of bacteria and viruses due to mature biofilm in the sand bed the estimated lrvs showed that e coli wr1 removal was 0 33 log10 cm in top layer and 0 10 log10 cm in middle and middle deep layers similarly phix 174 removal was 0 12 log10 cm and 0 03 log10 cm for top and middle deep layers respectively although log removal cm in deeper layers is 3 3 and 4 times lower than in top layer for e coli wr1 and phix 174 respectively the total volume of the deep sand is many times greater than that occupied by the schmutzdecke top layer the study of pfannes et al 2015 showed that effective removal of faecal indicators occurred due to the schmutzdecke in 14 week old ssfs however microbial communities in influent and effluent water were indistinguishable by t rflp analysis of bacterial 16s rrna in immature filters where a deep sand bed biofilm was unable to transform the influent water for any number of reasons time inoculation the influence of schmutzdecke on filter function might have been more obvious chan et al 2018 in mature ssfs functional microbial community was observed to be highly similar even when sampled from different depths haig et al 2015 thus biofilms in both schmutzdecke and deep sand bed is essential for shaping the produced water quality based on the finding that deeper layers of ssfs are important for bacteria and virus removal it is recommended that reducing the height of the filter bed by repetitive scraping is avoided where possible by doing so the treatment capacity of the deep sand bed in mature ssfs can be utilized particularly after schmutzdecke scraping preventing lengthy filter downtime also traditional practice to switch the deeper layers to the top when renewing the filter bed might need reconsideration as disturbing the deeper bed biofilm might have negative effects on filter perfomance the filters in our study were operated at relatively high filtration rates of 0 4 m h typical filtration rates 0 05 0 2 m h haig et al 2015 schijven et al 2013 and grain size of 0 4 0 6 mm typical grain sizes 0 15 0 3 mm schijven et al 2013 which might have influenced the stratification of microbial processes it is therefore encouraged to consider varying filtration rates and grain sizes both lower and higher than the values in this study as to further investigate the benefit on bacteria and virus removal this research also showed that bacteria and virus attenuation could be improved by microbial activity also in the deeper layers the microorganisms inhabiting the biofilm is driven by environmental and chemical gradients e g doc nh4 bai et al 2022 chen et al 2021 typically ssfs in many parts of the world operate without extensive pre treatment thus greater loads of particulate matter organics nutrients and microorganisms are introduced for continued development of biological activity in the filter as a result the contribution of microbial mechanisms to removal could be greater favouring pathogen removal however more efforts should be made to explore the influence of influent water quality and microbial community composition on pathogen removal in mature ssfs regardless filter operational procedures specifically cleaning practices that aim towards biomass preservation would benefit optimized performance for instance partial retention of schmutzdecke in the filter in situ hydraulic rinsing may be considered as alternatives to the conventional scraping to shorten the ripening process 5 conclusions this study examined the removal capacity of two important indicator enteric pathogens e coli wr1 and phix 174 at different depths of an established full scale ssf filter material collected from selected depths was studied in an innovative experimental setup to differentiate physical chemical and biological removal processes the main findings were schmutzdecke and deeper layers of established ssf showed substantial contribution to e coli wr1 and phix 174 log removal e coli wr1 removal was caused by active biofilm led processes like predation grazing enzyme induced inactivation at all three depths indicating the importance of mature biofilms in the sand bed furthermore removal by straining hydrodynamic interaction favourable and unfavourable attachment by inactive biofilm and sand contributed to overall removal in contrast active and inactive biofilm marginally influenced phix 174 removal mainly in the top layer however phix 174 removal was found to be mostly influenced by brownian diffusion as the engine of collisions with the sand surface one site kinetic retention model showed higher retention rates for e coli wr1 and phix 174 in the top layer physical chemical factors such as pore radii and mn and fe oxides and biological factors like dense biomass were identified as potential impactors for better retention of bacteria and viruses in the top layer the knowledge of underestimated removal capacity of deeper sand bed is a valuable contribution to optimizing the design and operation of ssfs

14813,slow sand filtration is popular in drinking water treatment for the removal of a wide range of contaminants e g particles organic matter and microorganisms the schmutzdecke in slow sand filters ssfs is known to be essential for pathogen removal however this layer is also responsible for increased head loss since the role of deeper layers in bacteria and virus removal is poorly understood this research investigated the removal of e coli wr1 and phix 174 at different depths of a full scale ssf filter material from top 0 5 cm middle 5 20 cm and deep 20 35 cm layers of an established filter was used in an innovative experimental set up to differentiate physical chemical and biological removal processes in the analysis we distinguished between removal by biological activity biofilm and just sand in addition we modelled processes by a one side kinetic model the different layers contributed substantially to overall log removal of e coli wr1 1 4 1 7 log10 and phix 174 0 4 0 6 log10 for e coli wr1 biological activity caused major removal followed by removal within biofilm and sand whereas removal of phix 174 mainly occurred within sand followed by biofilm and biological activity narrow pore radii in the top layer obtained by micro computed tomography scanner suggested enhanced retention of bacteria due to constrained transport the retention rates of e coli wr1 and phix 174 in top layer were four and five times higher than deeper layers respectively kret 1 09 min 1 vs 0 26 min 1 for e coli wr1 and kret 0 32 min 1 vs of 0 06 min 1 for phix 174 while this higher rate was restricted to the schmutzdecke alone top 5 cm the deeper layers extend to around 1 m in full scale filters therefore the contribution of deeper layers of established ssfs to the overall log removal of bacteria and viruses is much more substantial than the schmutzdecke graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords slow sand filters pathogen removal schmutzdecke one site kinetic model mature

introduction slow sand filtration one of the earliest water treatment processes has been a major contributor to drinking water safety chan et al 2018 chen et al 2021 haig et al 2011 maurya et al 2020 in the past decades slow sand filters ssfs have demonstrated the capacity to effectively remove turbidity dissolved organic matter and a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms bacteria viruses and protozoa however in recent times the focus has also been on the removal of biodegradable organic matter to increase biological stability of drinking water van der kooij et al 2017 in low resource settings intermittently operated ssf popularly known as the biosand filter bsf has been a promising household scale point of use pou technology for removal of microbes from drinking water the bsf has been highly successful when measured by user satisfaction durability and simplicity of design and operation elliott et al 2011 napotnik et al 2020 while ssfs differ from bsf in design and operation they offer a major benefit of chemicals free turbidity and pathogen removal compared to any direct competing technologies like membrane filtration coagulation ozonation and few more de oliveira and schneider 2019 drinking water treatment plants in the netherlands the united kingdom sweden brazil and many more use ssfs as a third or final treatment step in drinking water production due to their low energy consumption and high efficiency when drinking water is distributed without residual disinfectants such as chlorine sousi et al 2020 utilities opt for a multi stage treatment scheme where ssfs are the final treatment step to produce microbiologically safe and biologically stable drinking water van der kooij et al 2017 while ssfs are known to be safe and robust there is also consensus that there are a few drawbacks and limitations in operation the filters have a large land footprint as they are designed to operate at low filtration rates the schmutzdecke a dense biofilm in the top layer of ssfs is considered a key barrier for pathogens and other contaminants but overgrowth of biomass in this layer increases head loss in the filter andreoli and sabogal paz 2020 dizer et al 2004 hijnen et al 2007 schijven et al 2013 as a result cleaning techniques like scraping and wet harrowing are applied which in turn demand a long ripening period of 6 8 weeks to re establish the schmutzdecke and restore filter performance huisman and wood 1974 jenkins et al 2011 the importance of schmutzdecke in ssfs is promoted by high microbial abundance diversity and a broad range of functions compared to deeper layers of the sand bed chen et al 2021 stratification of biomass with depth is not surprising as substrate concentration and biomass acting on substrates are highest at the surface of the sand bed thus purification capacity and associated processes may be stratified over the filter height chen et al 2021 lee et al 2014 tatari et al 2016 recent investigation on mature full scale ssfs showed that removal of the schmutzdecke did not impact coliform counts and flow cytometry bacterial profiles in terms of intact cells and high nucleic acid content hna in effluent water chan et al 2018 they reported that deeper layers in mature filters operating for several years may have extensive biofilms with microbial community required for producing consistent microbial water quality generally during scraping the schmutzdecke and the top few centimetres 2 5 cm of sand are removed but deeper layers are retained unaltered pfannes et al 2015 observed 16s rrna gene copy numbers of around 106 copies ml in the deep sand bed although the count is less than 1011 copies ml commonly found in the schmutzdecke the total volume occupied by the sand bed is much greater than the volume in the schmutzdecke oh et al 2018 observed that microorganisms in the deeper layers grew faster by metabolizing more easily degradable organic matter compared to microbes in the schmutzdecke biofilms in both schmutzdecke and sand bed can entrap cells and support microbial interactions thus ssf performance may be a balance between processes in different layers of sand bed chan et al 2018 pfannes et al 2015 for example bacteria and protozoa removal occurred mainly in the schmutzdecke but virus removal improved with filter depth elliott et al 2008 while the influence of schmutzdecke on pathogen removal and associated mechanisms has been studied extensively hijnen et al 2004 schijven et al 2013 unger and collins 2008 the contribution of deeper depths in removal has not received much attention in the past previous studies evaluating filter performance have been largely performed on filters at lab or pilot scale where a sand bed microbial community has not had years to establish haig et al 2014 hijnen et al 2004 pfannes et al 2015 unger and collins 2008 in filters without an established microbial community in the deeper layers changes in treated water quality could be more coupled to the status of the schmutzdecke chan et al 2018 therefore understanding of removal processes in both schmutzdecke and deep sand bed in established full scale filters is crucial to enable improvements in design and operational procedures of ssfs in terms of new filter designs bed height and cleaning procedures for biomass preservation within the filter in this study we explored bacteria and virus removal capacity of schmutzdecke and deeper layers of an established ssf to distinct various co occurring removal processes including straining attachment and microbial inactivation the top and deeper depths of the filter may be evaluated as separate systems due to vast differences in the physical and biological characteristics of sand that influence microbial transport hence knowledge of stratification of biotic and abiotic induced processes that aid microbial removal is important for further optimization and promotion of the ssf technology in this study we hypothesized that deeper layers contribute substantially to e coli wr1 and phix 174 bacteriophage removal due to a mature biofilm in the sand bed therefore in an innovative experimental set up the removal capacity and transport of indicator enteric pathogens e coli wr1 and phix 174 were investigated at different depths of a full scale filter to investigate the contribution of physical chemical and biological processes in removal sand from different depths was investigated directly after inactivation of microbial activity by sodium azide and after incineration to remove the biofilm the retention and reentrainment behaviour of e coli wr1 and phix 174 at different depths were modelled using a one site kinetic model a micro computed tomography scanner micro ct and environmental scanning electron microscopy esem were employed to investigate the influence of porosity and sand characteristics on microbial transport at different depths 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling at full scale slow sand filter an established ssf producing drinking water for over 67 years built in 1955 at a drinking water treatment plant of dunea located at katwijk a drinking water utility in the netherlands was used in this study the plant receives raw water from the river meuse and is further treated by managed aquifer recharge in the dunes pellet softening aeration rapid sand filtration with powdered activated carbon dosing and lastly slow sand filtration the ssf in our study has been in operation for approx 28 years without sand replacement at the moment of sand sampling the filter had a sand bed height of 0 9 m with grain size of 0 4 0 6 mm followed by 0 3 m of gravel layer 4 6 mm and 0 12 m of underdrains for uniform passage of filtered water the hydraulic loading was 0 4 m h the in situ water temperature at the treatment plant was mostly stable between 10 and 12 c as seasonal fluctuation was regulated during dune filtration over a period of operation generally a few years the filters become clogged with biomass to restore water flow the top layers 2 5 cm of the ssf including schmutzdecke is removed by mechanical scraping the filter in this study was last scraped 653 days ago during one such scraping event intact sand samples from mature ssf was sampled up to a depth of 40 cm sand was core sampled from depths 0 5 cm top 5 20 cm middle and 20 35 cm deep by inserting and gently removing a sterile plexiglass cylinder the cylinder had an inner diameter of 2 5 cm and height of 5 cm for top layer and 15 cm for middle and deep layers and closed at the top with a rubber stopper sampling with the cylindrical cores provided the advantage to take undisturbed in situ sand samples without impacting the 3d structure and was further transformed into columns for the experiments two sand cores from each depth were sampled at two randomly selected locations to be used for duplicate column experiments 2 2 experimental set up the experimental set up consisted of small plexiglass columns with inner diameter of 2 5 cm and bed height of 5 cm for sand from top layer 0 5 cm and 15 cm for sand from middle 5 20 cm and deep layer 20 35 cm the core sampled sand from each depth was operated in columns under three conditions to simulate scenarios of physical chemical and biological processes in treatment active biofilm inactive biofilm and no biofilm the sand was prepared as per the following i active biofilm sand sand directly obtained from the full scale ssf as described in section 2 1 the three depths in consideration had different active biomass concentrations with the highest bioactivity in the top layer and the lowest in the deep layer as shown by atp analyses in figure s1 ii inactive biofilm sand microbial activity on sand from three depths and in the water phase was suppressed by continuously dosing sodium azide at a concentration of 6 mm 390 mg l elliott et al 2011 dosing was continued for three days until no biological activity was detected the activity was determined by measuring cellular atp on 1 g of sand using the deposit surface analysis kit dsa luminultra technologies ltd according to the manufacturer s protocol iii no biofilm sand biofilm on sand from three depths was destroyed by drying sand at 105 c and then ignited at 440 c in a muffle furnace as per british standard british standards institution 1990b rodgers et al 2004 the biofilm was burnt off at this temperature leaving behind a mixture of sand and ash the sand mixture from 3 depths was washed through a 53 μm sieve and filled into their respective columns the influent feeding the full scale ssfs at the water treatment plant was used as influent for the columns at a filtration rate of 0 4 m3 m2 h to replicate full scale ssf condition the pore volume and porosity in the columns were determined using deuterium 2h as a tracer according to bertelkamp et al 2016 further the columns were challenged with enteric bacteria and virus indicators e coli wr1 and phix 174 bacteriophages 2 3 e coli wr1 and phix 174 preparation and enumeration the experiments were carried out with e coli wr1 nctc 13 167 and bacteriophage phix 174 atcc 13 706 b1 e coli wr1 is widely used as an indicator of enteric bacteria in drinking water studies eisfeld et al 2022 schijven et al 2013 and is used here as a reference for bacterial removal a highly concentrated suspension of e coli wr1 was prepared by growing in buffered peptone water for 18 h at 37 c harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min and washing in sterile water as per iso 9308 1 e coli wr1 was enumerated by membrane filtration and incubation onto chromocult agar for 24 h at 37 c phix 174 is an icosahedral single stranded dna phage with a diameter of 26 nm and an isoelectric point of 4 4 chrysikopoulos and aravantinou 2012 soliman et al 2020a 2020b phix 174 is generally seen as a good viral surrogate due to its size and shape resemblance to several human enteroviruses such as poliovirus norovirus etc as well as its low hydrophobicity and stability bicudo et al 2021 oudega et al 2021 although phix174 may not be an ideal conservative colloidal tracer somatic coliphages have gained special importance in europe in recent years as a reliable viral faecal indicator due to their high prevalence in sewage and persistence in the environment oudega et al 2021 a highly concentrated suspension of phix 174 1011 pfu ml was prepared and concentrations were assayed as described in iso 10 705 2 4 spiking of e coli wr1 and phix 174 challenge water was prepared by dosing e coli wr1 or phix 174 stock solution to the influent at a concentration of 105 to 106 cfu ml and stirred 150 rpm to prevent settling the influent concentration was sampled in triplicate two times before spiked water was distributed and one time after the spiking was done challenge experiments with active biofilm inactive biofilm and no biofilm sand were performed on days 5 10 and 13 respectively spiking was done by lowering the supernatant slightly above the sand bed and dosing the challenge water using a peristaltic pump after spiking for 2 3 pore volumes pvs influent water free of e coli wr1 or phix 174 was dosed for the next 8 pvs effluent samples were collected in 250 ml sterile bottles every 5 min for the first 4 5 pvs and every 10 min for the next 5 pvs the collected samples were refrigerated and further analysed on the same day to yield breakthrough curves 2 5 micro computed tomography the top layer column in active inactive and no biofilm conditions were subjected to micro computed tomography micro ct phoenix nanotom boston ma usa 180 kv 0 5 ma with a maximum resolution 0 5 1 0 µm before imaging sand columns were disconnected from influent and effluent lines while maintaining the sand bed saturated imagej http rsb info nih gov was used to obtain porosity distribution and calculate pore radius 2 6 modelling transport of e coli wr1 and phix

together under a single retention rate coefficient while reentrainment rate included detachment from previously un favourably attached microorganisms or detachment of previously hydrophobically retained microorganisms 2 7 estimating contribution of physical chemical and biological processes to removal the estimation of contribution of removal of e coli wr1 and phix 174 by intact biofilm assumed as predation grazing and enzyme induced inactivation biofilm assumed as straining hydrodynamic interaction and favourable attachment and sand only assumed as favourable and unfavourable attachment was performed using log reduction values lrvs in active inactive and no biofilm experiments as inputs intact biofilm induced removal was determined by subtracting lrvs in inactive biofilm from lrvs in active biofilm experiments the contribution of removal by sand alone was directly obtained from lrvs in no biofilm experiment further biofilm led removal was calculated from the difference of lrvs in inactive and no biofilm experiments in the no biofilm experiments the effects of biofilm removal and sand repacking see section 2 2 which clearly affected filter bed pore structure were neglected 2 8 data analysis data represents the mean and standard error se of duplicate microbial assays in duplicate columns n 4 statistical comparison of means of e coli wr1 and phix 174 removal at depths was performed by anova factor depth pairwise comparison of statistically different means in a series was performed with a pos hoc tukey test p 0 05 means for different filter media conditions for each depth were also compared using anova factor condition and further with pos hoc tukey test 3 results 3 1 e coli wr1 and phix 174 attenuation in active biofilm sand fig 1 shows breakthrough curves btcs of e coli wr1 and phix 174 both data and fitted curves in top middle and deep layer columns under active biofilm conditions all btcs are characterized by a climbing limb a plateau phase a declining limb and finally a gradual declining tail the btcs of e coli wr1 exhibit a very low relative breakthrough concentration in the range of 0 02 0 03 in top middle and deep layers resulting in lrvs of 1 69 1 52 and 1 41 log10 respectively fig 1 table 1 it is important to note that sand bed height was 5 cm in the top layer column and 15 cm in middle and deep layer columns as a result the estimation of log removal per cm showed removal of 0 33 log10 cm in the top layer substantially higher compared to 0 10 0 12 log10 cm in the middle and deep layer columns anova tests conducted for removal using depths as the independent variable produced p values below 0 05 f 11 09 p 0 0001 df 2 showing that lrvs at three depths were statistically different the r2 values between 0 83 0 95 indicated that breakthrough could be well described by one retention rate and one reentrainment rate parameter e coli wr1 displayed a kret of 1 09 min 1 in the top layer which was 5 times higher than kret of 0 26 min 1 in the middle and deep layers the btcs of phix 174 showed a high relative breakthrough concentration in the range of 0 27 0 39 which was 10 times higher than e coli wr1 relative breakthrough concentration the btcs resulted in poor but comparable lrvs of 0 56 0 41 and 0 42 log10 in top middle and deep layers respectively f 1 91 p 0 142 df 2 further the estimation of log removal per cm showed removal of 0 12 log10 cm in top layer 4 times higher than removal of 0 03 log10 cm in middle and deep layers anova tests performed using depth as an independent variable produced p values above 0 05 f 2 23 p 0 181 df 2 meaning that for phix 174 the influence of depths in removal is statistically insignificant the btcs were well described by one retention rate parameter and one re entrainment rate parameter shown by r2 values greater than 0 9 similar to the observations for e coli wr1 phix 174 showed higher kret of 0 32 min 1 compared to kret of 0 06 min 1 in middle and deep layers 3 2 e coli wr1 and phix 174 attenuation in inactive biofilm and no biofilm sand upon suppression of microbial activity by sodium azide lrvs of e coli wr1 in the top middle and deep layers drastically decreased by 0 80 0 80 and 0 70 log10 to lrvs of 0 92 0 71 and 0 69 log10 respectively it is evident from the btcs in fig 2 that the relative breakthrough concentrations and tails in inactive biofilm conditions were at least one order of magnitude higher than the btcs under active biofilm conditions statistical testing showed that e coli wr1 reductions were significantly lower by 0 7 0 8 log10 after microbial activity suppression f 15 36 p 0 0004 df 1 lower removal in inactive biofilm experiments is also reflected by the low retention rates in all three depths in the no biofilm experiments lrvs of e coli wr1 significantly reduced by 0 50 0 30 and 0 30 log10 to 0 42 0 42 and 0 44 log10 in top middle and deep layers respectively f 16 94 p 0 0003 df 2 this was also depicted by a further reduction in kret as shown in table 2 while phix 174 displayed a similar behaviour as e coli wr1 the removal was low the absence of microbial activity caused lrvs to reduce by 0 20 0 20 and 0 15 log10 to 0 46 0 35 and 0 34 log10 in top middle and deep layers respectively also displayed by lower kret table 2 although the variations seem minimal anova test revealed a statistically significant removal before and after bioactivity inhibition f 21 56 p 0 011 df 1 no biofilm experiments further reduced lrvs by 0 20 0 10 0 log10 to 0 31 0 26 and 0 28 log10 in top middle and deep layers respectively the influence of loss of biofilm was statistically significant in top and middle layers f 11 16 p 0 0004 df 1 but not in the deep layer f 1 13 p 0 05 df 1 table 2 3 3 micro computed tomography scanner the biofilm dense schmutzdecke may influence porosity in the top layer and alter flow path micro computed tomography scanner micro ct was used to directly characterize the pore structure and porosity distribution in the top layer column in active inactive and no biofilm conditions a comparison of porosity profiles fig 3 a shows that porosity in active and inactive biofilm columns is much lower than porosity in absence of biofilm in the active biofilm column porosity increased along the filter height the lowest porosity of 0 27 was recorded near the column inlet which increased to 0 32 almost at the bottom of the sand bed 5 cm the inactive biofilm column depicted the same trend in porosity distribution on the other hand the column without biofilm showed a consistent porosity in the range of 0 38 0 40 throughout the height of the sand bed further investigation on pore radius showed that pore radii in the column with no biofilm spanned between 15 and 75 μm with a median around 35 μm fig 3c in the active and inactive biofilm columns pore radii ranged between 1 and 35 μm with a median of 15 μm fig 3c in active and inactive biofilm columns pore radii of 1 μm which are in the range of average size of e coli wr1 made up 0 03 0 07 of the total pore volume 4 discussion 4 1 significance of mature biofilm this study showed that top middle and deep layers of mature ssf caused substantial removal of e coli wr1 1 4 1 7 log10 and phix 174 0 4 0 6 log10 indicating the significance of mature biofilm in the sand bed schmutzdecke is described as a visibly thick brownish slimy layer unlike the biofilms in deeper layers that can only be visualized under the microscope hence a general assumption is that pathogen removal by microbial activity associated processes like predation grazing or enzyme induced inactivation occurs mainly in the schmutzdecke where biological activity is the highest chen et al 2021 schjiven et al 2013 complementary to the previous observations we found that microbial activity in intact biofilm contributed to 0 70 0 80 log10 of e coli wr1 removal at all three depths table 3 meanwhile the intact biofilm slightly influenced phix 174 removal with 0 10 log10 at all three depths in biological filters stratification of biomass and bioactivity is observed due to environmental and chemical gradients e g doc nh4 chen et al 2021 despite these variations the substantial contribution of deeper depths to overall bacteria and virus log removal suggests the importance of a well functioning biofilm in the sand bed mature biofilms in filters functioning over a while have been reported to own different physical and biological properties such as thickness morphology and microbial community composition compared to young biofilms in newly established filters boe hansen et al 2002 bai et al 2022 haig et al 2015 in this study we observed that biofilm associated removal by straining hydrodynamic interaction and favourable attachment contributed to e coli wr1 removal of 0 5 log10 in the top layer and 0 3 log10 in middle and deep layers table 3 the contribution to phix 174 removal was rather low between 0 1 0 2 log10 earlier studies showed schmutzdecke thickness as one of the major factors increasing pathogen removal in ssfs schijven et al 2013 increased biofilm thickness by biomass accumulation is a consequence of filter ageing or maturation elliot et al 2011 hijnen et al 2007 schijven et al 2013 enhanced attachment and straining of bacteria and viruses have been observed for biofilms with higher thickness compared to relatively thin biofilms afrooz and boehm 2016 the favourable retention of bacteria and viruses in biofilm coated surface vs no biofilm surface is shown by higher retention rates in the former thus depicting different transport behaviour fig 1 and 2 biological properties of biofilm such as microbial community abundance diversity and evenness increase with filter maturation haig et al 2015 in newly built ssfs where biofilm has not had years to develop schmutzdecke microbial community may be distinctive from that of the sand bed in such young filters treatment performance may be more coupled to the status of the schmutzdecke chan et al 2018 in mature ssfs this will not be the case as consequent temporal changes are marginal haig et al 2015 e g the overall community composition in the first 50 cm of the sand bed is similar for bacteria archaea and eukaryotes li et al 2017 wakelin et al 2011 haig et al 2015 even at low abundance eukaryotic communities are strongly related to the removal of pathogenic bacteria by grazing and predation weber shirk and dick 1997a 1997b stott et al 2001 haig et al 2015 based on these observations biological removal processes may be prominent even in the deeper layers and not restricted to the schmutzdecke as previously assumed 4 2 retention processes at different depths active and inactive biofilm on sand increased retention of e coli wr1 as seen by higher kret values compared to no biofilm experiments at all three depths the top layer caused four times higher kret of e coli wr1 compared to middle and deep layers 1 09 min 1 vs 0 26 min 1 similarly for phix 174 the influence of active and inactive biofilm was prominent in top layer i e 5 times higher kret in top layer than deeper layers it is worthy to note that e coli wr1 retention was greater than phix 174 at all three depths however the change in kret between top and deeper layers was greater for the latter this highlights the value of top layer in terms of surface functionality and biological activity on sand in virus removal these observations indicate varying contribution of different retention processes at different depths for each type of microorganism from the modelling results we infer based on literature that retention processes like straining hydrophobic interactions and favourable and unfavourable attachment are occurring afrooz et al 2018 fu et al 2023 straining is caused when microbes are trapped in pore throats that are too small to allow passage foppen et al 2005 we observed that biofilms decreased the pore radii sizes in the top layer from 15 70 μm to 0 5 35 μm with narrow pores chances of e coli wr1 retention by straining is higher due to higher chance of collision with biofilm and large size of bacteria he et al 2020 foppen et al 2007 additionally strained bacteria would not be reentrained unless biofilm sloughing happens which is not the case in our experiments as shown by 100 times lower kreent of e coli wr1 than kret in the top layer however for viruses physical straining within the biofilm is unlikely due to their small size supported by relatively lower kret in the top layer the fact that schmutzdecke removal scraping reduced bacteria lrvs and not viruses in earlier studies hijnen et al al 2007 schijven et al 2013 may support the argument that straining may be an important retention mechanism for bacteria in the top layer although role of other biological retention mechanisms such as predation grazing enzyme induced inactivation and attachment to biofilm cannot be excluded enhanced retention of e coli wr1 and phix 174 in biofilm sand may also be supported by extracellular polymeric substances eps in biofilms eps components proteins and polysaccharides could bind and form hydrophobic interaction with bacterial surface functional groups such as teichoic acids and phospholipids fu et al 2023 xiao and wiesner 2013 in addition positively charged amine groups in eps promote electrostatic attraction with negatively charged bacteria and viruses allowing for favourable attachment guo et al 2015 in middle and deep layers the biomass levels were much lower than in the top layer suggesting the presence of relatively thin biofilms kret in both depths was slightly higher in the presence of biofilm indicating their influence on retention processes porosity distribution in middle and deep layers was not investigated in this study but the trend of increasing porosity with depth in top layer suggests that microbial retention by straining may not be critical in deeper depths however the contribution of hydrophobic interactions and favourable and unfavourable attachment cannot be overlooked this study did not quantify the exact contribution of different retention processes to e coli wr1 and phix removal as such an effort was beyond the scope of the present study interestingly kret of e coli wr1 and phix 174 in no biofilm experiments was not negligible under no biofilm condition removal is determined by clean bed collisions and the classic colloid filtration mechanisms interception brownian diffusion and gravitational deposition of which interception and brownian diffusion are likely most important for bacteria and virus removal respectively afrooz et al 2018 bradford et al 2003 at neutral ph as in our experiments colloids e coli wr1 phix 174 and sand grain surface are both negatively charged and therefore repulsive tripathi et al 2011 however when the distance between colloids and sand grain is small enough less than a few nm the attractive van der waals force may become dominant thus causing attachment foppen et al 2005 on the other hand favourable attachment of negatively charged bacteria viruses can occur on patches of positively charged surfaces on sand grains hence the higher intensity of kret for both e coli wr1 and phix 174 in top layer may be attributed to relatively high concentration of fe and mn oxides in top layer sand as shown in fig s3 b despite these differences similar removal of e coli wr1 and phix 174 at different bed heights in top middle and deep layers is likely caused by small sticking efficiency variations within the bacterium and virus population despite the variation in sticking efficiencies as reported in literature hijnen et al 2004 and schijven et al 2013 observed that removal data of e coli wr1 were concomitant with removal of thermotolerant coliforms and naturally present e coli bacteria in pilot and full scale filter studies in terms of viruses elliott et al 2008 observed higher reduction of human enteric virus echovirus 12 than bacteriophages ms2 and prd1 in bsf suggesting that virus removal depends upon the specific viral agent 4 3 balanced contribution of schmutzdecke and deeper layers to microbial removal in this study we hypothesised that deeper layers in established ssfs contribute to substantial removal of bacteria and viruses due to mature biofilm in the sand bed the estimated lrvs showed that e coli wr1 removal was 0 33 log10 cm in top layer and 0 10 log10 cm in middle and middle deep layers similarly phix 174 removal was 0 12 log10 cm and 0 03 log10 cm for top and middle deep layers respectively although log removal cm in deeper layers is 3 3 and 4 times lower than in top layer for e coli wr1 and phix 174 respectively the total volume of the deep sand is many times greater than that occupied by the schmutzdecke top layer the study of pfannes et al 2015 showed that effective removal of faecal indicators occurred due to the schmutzdecke in 14 week old ssfs however microbial communities in influent and effluent water were indistinguishable by t rflp analysis of bacterial 16s rrna in immature filters where a deep sand bed biofilm was unable to transform the influent water for any number of reasons time inoculation the influence of schmutzdecke on filter function might have been more obvious chan et al 2018 in mature ssfs functional microbial community was observed to be highly similar even when sampled from different depths haig et al 2015 thus biofilms in both schmutzdecke and deep sand bed is essential for shaping the produced water quality based on the finding that deeper layers of ssfs are important for bacteria and virus removal it is recommended that reducing the height of the filter bed by repetitive scraping is avoided where possible by doing so the treatment capacity of the deep sand bed in mature ssfs can be utilized particularly after schmutzdecke scraping preventing lengthy filter downtime also traditional practice to switch the deeper layers to the top when renewing the filter bed might need reconsideration as disturbing the deeper bed biofilm might have negative effects on filter perfomance the filters in our study were operated at relatively high filtration rates of 0 4 m h typical filtration rates 0 05 0 2 m h haig et al 2015 schijven et al 2013 and grain size of 0 4 0 6 mm typical grain sizes 0 15 0 3 mm schijven et al 2013 which might have influenced the stratification of microbial processes it is therefore encouraged to consider varying filtration rates and grain sizes both lower and higher than the values in this study as to further investigate the benefit on bacteria and virus removal this research also showed that bacteria and virus attenuation could be improved by microbial activity also in the deeper layers the microorganisms inhabiting the biofilm is driven by environmental and chemical gradients e g doc nh4 bai et al 2022 chen et al 2021 typically ssfs in many parts of the world operate without extensive pre treatment thus greater loads of particulate matter organics nutrients and microorganisms are introduced for continued development of biological activity in the filter as a result the contribution of microbial mechanisms to removal could be greater favouring pathogen removal however more efforts should be made to explore the influence of influent water quality and microbial community composition on pathogen removal in mature ssfs regardless filter operational procedures specifically cleaning practices that aim towards biomass preservation would benefit optimized performance for instance partial retention of schmutzdecke in the filter in situ hydraulic rinsing may be considered as alternatives to the conventional scraping to shorten the ripening process 5 conclusions this study examined the removal capacity of two important indicator enteric pathogens e coli wr1 and phix 174 at different depths of an established full scale ssf filter material collected from selected depths was studied in an innovative experimental setup to differentiate physical chemical and biological removal processes the main findings were schmutzdecke and deeper layers of established ssf showed substantial contribution to e coli wr1 and phix 174 log removal e coli wr1 removal was caused by active biofilm led processes like predation grazing enzyme induced inactivation at all three depths indicating the importance of mature biofilms in the sand bed furthermore removal by straining hydrodynamic interaction favourable and unfavourable attachment by inactive biofilm and sand contributed to overall removal in contrast active and inactive biofilm marginally influenced phix 174 removal mainly in the top layer however phix 174 removal was found to be mostly influenced by brownian diffusion as the engine of collisions with the sand surface one site kinetic retention model showed higher retention rates for e coli wr1 and phix 174 in the top layer physical chemical factors such as pore radii and mn and fe oxides and biological factors like dense biomass were identified as potential impactors for better retention of bacteria and viruses in the top layer the knowledge of underestimated removal capacity of deeper sand bed is a valuable contribution to optimizing the design and operation of ssfs

14814,ozonation of natural waters is typically associated with the formation of carbonyl compounds aldehydes ketones and ketoacids a main class of organic disinfection byproducts dbps however the detection of carbonyl compounds in water and wastewater is challenged by multiple difficulties inherent to their physicochemical properties a non target screening method involving the derivatisation of carbonyl compounds with p toluenesulfonylhydrazine tsh followed by their analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation high resolution mass spectrometry lc esi hrms and an advanced non target screening and data processing workflow was developed the workflow was applied to investigate the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation of different water types including lake water aqueous solutions containing suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and wastewater a higher sensitivity for most target carbonyl compounds was achieved compared to previous derivatisation methods moreover the method allowed the identification of known and unknown carbonyl compounds 8 out of 17 target carbonyl compounds were consistently detected above limits of quantification loqs in most ozonated samples generally the concentrations of the 8 detected target compounds decreased in the order formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid glutaraldehyde 2 3 butanedione glyoxal 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene the doc concentration normalised formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation was higher in wastewater and srfa containing water than in lake water the specific ozone doses and the type of the dissolved organic matter dom played a predominant role for the extent of formation of carbonyl compounds five formation trends were distinguished for different carbonyl compounds some compounds were produced continuously upon ozonation even at high ozone doses while others reached a maximum concentration at a certain ozone dose above which they decreased concentrations of target and peak areas of non target carbonyl compounds during full scale ozonation at a wastewater treatment plant showed an increase as a function of the specific ozone dose sum of 8 target compounds

non target analysis high resolution mass spectrometry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the efficiency of ozone as an oxidant and disinfectant along with concerns about the formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps during chlorine based processes made ozonation a good alternative for oxidative water treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation was introduced as a disinfection step in drinking water at the beginning of the twentieth century von sonntag and von gunten 2012 more recently ozonation has been increasingly applied in wastewater treatment for the abatement of organic micropollutants known to induce a spectrum of adverse effects to aquatic ecosystems eggen et al 2014 hollender et al 2009 joss et al 2008 kienle et al 2022 ternes et al 2003 furthermore ozonation is increasingly considered as an oxidation step in water reuse treatment trains gerrity et al 2013 von gunten 2018 similar to other oxidants disinfectants the application of ozone to achieve different water and wastewater treatment goals is accompanied by the formation of dbps due to reactions with matrix components such as bromide and dissolved organic matter dom lim et al 2022 manasfi 2021 richardson and ternes 2022 von gunten 2003 von gunten 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 bromate is the most critical inorganic dbp formed during ozonation because of its possible carcinogenicity and it is regulated in drinking water world health organization 2017 amongst organic dbps formed during ozonation carbonyl compounds including aldehydes ketones oxo and keto acids are key classes the formation of carbonyl compounds is well documented during ozonation of natural organic matter nom isolates and drinking water hammes et al 2006 huang et al 2005 liu et al 2020 swietlik et al 2004 weinberg et al 1993 however there is only limited information on the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation of wastewater marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 overall about 50 carbonyl compounds have so far been proposed to be formed during ozonation hammes et al 2006 huang et al 2005 marron et al 2020 richardson et al 2000 richardson et al 1999 swietlik et al 2004 tentscher et al 2018 weinberg and glaze 1996 wert et al 2007 some carbonyl compounds e g benzoquinones and α ß unsaturated dialdehydes ketones were not detected in water treatment but rather in ozonation studies with model compounds tentscher et al 2018 zoumpouli et al 2021 considering the diversity of potential carbonyl precursors in dom the currently known carbonyl compounds represent only a small fraction of the universe of this compound class the main concern about the formation of carbonyl compounds is related to their toxicity which is induced by their electrophilic nature this allows them to form covalent bonds with nucleophilic moieties of biological macromolecules such as enzymes proteins and dna lopachin and gavin 2014 prasse 2021 prasse et al 2018 exposure to α ß unsaturated carbonyl compounds has been associated with development of cardiovascular and neurological diseases and diabetes lopachin and gavin 2014 in addition carbonyl compounds can possibly catalyse the formation of other potentially toxic byproducts such as nitrosamines lv et al 2009 and can act as precursors for halogenated byproducts during post chlorination barrott 2004 marron et al 2021 weinberg and glaze 1996 the formation of carbonyl compounds also contributes to the assimilable biodegradable organic carbon which may promote microbial re growth after ozonation hammes et al 2006 zimmermann et al 2011 finally often an increased toxicity is observed after ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent which is in many cases abated during biological post filtration magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010 volker et al 2019 the latter points towards easily biodegradable substances and carbonyl compounds may explain this observation to some extent von gunten 2018 in the us a maximum contaminant level of 50 µg l for total aldehydes and a notification level of 100 µg l for formaldehyde in drinking water have been introduced in the states of new york and california respectively california division of drinking water state water resources control board 2020 new york state department of health 2021 however no standards for carbonyl compounds have been established by the european union and the world health organization since typical concentrations in drinking water are considered well below concentrations of health concern european commission 2020 world health organization 2022 the analysis of carbonyl compounds faces multiple challenges related to their physicochemical properties carbonyl compounds are generally very polar with low molecular weights mw resulting in poor separation on reverse phase liquid chromatography lc columns they are typically poorly ionisable in electrospray ionisation esi and have a low detectability by mass spectrometry to address these challenges carbonyl compounds are typically derivatised before analysis derivatisation methods involve o 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine pfboa glaze et al 1989 pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine pfbha richardson et al 1999 and 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine dnph richardson et al 2000 these methods require laborious sample preparation as they typically involve liquid liquid or solid phase extraction and in the case of dnph suffer from its limited solubility in aqueous solutions and tendency to deposit in the ms ion source siegel et al 2014 alternatively a derivatisation method based on p toluenesulfonylhydrazine tsh has been applied for the screening of carbonyl compounds in biological samples siegel et al 2014 or for the targeted analysis of selected carbonyl compounds in water reuse systems marron et al 2020 however a systematic assessment of the tsh method performance in water and wastewater matrices has not been performed so far and the method has only been applied for targeted analysis of selected carbonyl compounds therefore the present study aimed at i developing optimizing and validating an analytical method based on tsh derivatisation and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms for the non targeted screening and targeted quantification of carbonyl compounds ii determining their concentrations and formation trends in dom containing synthetic water wastewater and lake water and iii monitoring their fate during full scale ozonation of a secondary wastewater effluent followed by biological post treatment in a companion study

followed by data dependant fragmentation ms2 experiments resolution 17 500 at m z 200 in the positive polarity mode the latter was selected since it provided better detection of the derivatised carbonyls than the negative polarity mode figure s5 si ms conditions were as follows spray voltage 4000 v capillary temperature 350 c sheath gas 40 arbitrary units auxiliary gas 10 arbitrary units and mass range from 100 to 1000 da properties of the data dependant top 5 ms2 scans included an automatic gain control agc of 2 105 isolation window of 1 0 m z and normalised collision energy nce of 30 the 17 derivatised target carbonyls in positive esi were added to an inclusion list to ensure their fragmentation 2 4 method performance characteristics matrix effects and stability of carbonyl compounds the concentrations of target carbonyl compounds were quantified based on external calibrations since matrix effects were negligible table s4 si calibration standards were prepared by spiking carbonyl compounds into ultrapure water followed by derivatisation the response ratio defined as the ratio of peak area of an analyte to the peak area of tsh derivatised benzaldehyde d6 in the same sample was used for calibration and quantification the limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq were defined based on a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively the calibration ranges were defined based on the linearity of calibration curves and the coverage of concentrations measured in the samples potential interferences on the response of carbonyl compounds in esi hrms due to matrix effects were assessed according to the protocol presented in section s4 si in addition the stability of carbonyl compounds during storage at 4 c in derivatised and non derivatised forms was assessed for details see section s5 si 2 5 non target screening and data processing workflow a non target screening workflow was implemented using the software compound discoverer cd3 2 thermo scientific germany the workflow consisted of an array of nodes used for the processing and post processing of lc ms data the detection of tsh derived fragments referred to as signature fragments in the ms2 spectra was used as a key criterion for the screening of carbonyl compounds fig 2 a detailed description of the non target workflow and data processing is presented in section s6 si a total of 178 carbonyl compounds were detected in all samples houska et al 2023 among the latter 40 non target carbonyl compounds were prioritized for monitoring because they occurred in more than two water types and contained 5 carbons with one exception for a c6 compound that was also included the tracefinder software tf5 1 thermo scientific germany was used for the determination of peak areas of the 40 non target carbonyl compounds and concentrations of target compounds 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimisation of the derivatisation procedure in the different water types the main parameters for the optimisation validation of the derivatisation procedure are discussed here with additional details in section s3 si 3 1 1 tsh concentration the variability of derivatisation efficiency as a function of the tsh concentration was similar for the target carbonyl compounds across all tested matrices a tsh concentration of 200 µm provided the highest derivatisation efficiency figures s2 and s3 si 3 1 2 hcl concentration the derivatisation efficiencies increased considerably in the presence of hcl 0 01 m except for formaldehyde no effect acetaldehyde decreasing efficiency and decanal slightly decreasing efficiency figure s4a si increasing hcl concentrations from 0 01 to 0 05 m did not enhance the derivatisation efficiency and therefore a hcl concentration of 0 02 m was selected to overcome potential buffering capacities in wastewater 3 1 3 reaction time changes in the derivatisation efficiencies were minor within 10 for most tested carbonyl compounds as the time interval between derivatisation and analysis increased from 10 min to 2 h figure s4b si therefore a short reaction time of 10 min after the addition of tsh and hcl was sufficient to achieve maximum derivatisation the application of the optimised derivatisation method significantly enhanced the detectability of most target carbonyl compounds while some compounds were also detectable before derivatisation most compounds became detectable only after derivatisation figure s5 si 3 2 method performance characteristics and stability of the target carbonyl compounds method performance characteristics including the lods loqs and measurement ranges are presented in table s3 si in addition the results of the assessment of analytical matrix effects during the analysis of carbonyl compounds in water and wastewater matrices are presented in section s4 and table s4 si based on the determined lods 0 004 1 35 µg l 0 06 13 5 nm the sensitivity of the tsh method was generally better or in a similar range to the sensitivity achieved by the pfboa and dnph derivatisation methods which involve extensive sample preparation such as longer derivatisation times 1 4 h and extraction steps and provide lods in the range of 0 7 5 2 µg l and 0 5 1 µg l respectively glaze et al 1989 richardson et al 2000 siegel et al 2014 also reported generally lower lods for carbonyl compounds with the tsh method compared to the dnph method for biological samples cell extracts formaldehyde was an exception with a markedly higher lod 4 50 µg l or 150 2 nm than for other carbonyl compounds and other derivatisation methods due to high background levels detected in tsh blanks the source of background formaldehyde concentration was attributed to tsh and it was accounted for in the determination of formaldehyde concentrations section s4 si however since the formation of formaldehyde is typically high during ozonation this limitation is not critical in the context of the present study matrix effects were negligible during the analysis of derivatised carbonyl compounds in both water and wastewater table s4 si which agrees with previous findings in cell extracts siegel et al 2014 the stability of the target carbonyl compounds before and after tsh derivatisation is presented in section s5 si in the tsh derivatised form a broad disparity in the stability of carbonyl compounds in wastewater was observed over a storage period of 6 5 days at 4 c figure s6 si derivatised carbonyl compounds were either highly unstable i e 40 loss within 24 h and declined to loq after 6 5 days e g glyoxal glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid and formaldehyde moderately unstable i e 65 loss within 6 5 days e g decanal crotonaldehyde and methacrolein figure s6a si or quite stable i e 10 loss within 6 5 days e g 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene acetaldehyde 2 3 butanedione glutaraldehyde and 3 5 heptanedione figure s6b si in the non derivatised form some carbonyl compounds tended to degrade e g glutaraldehyde pyruvic acid glyoxylic acid while others appeared during storage e g glyoxal figure s7 si this assessment emphasizes the importance of performing the derivatisation and analyses immediately after sampling for the detection and accurate determination of concentrations of carbonyl compounds 3 3 identification of carbonyl compounds by the non target screening workflow the application of the non target screening workflow allowed to effectively reduce the complexity of hrms data in complex matrices such as wastewater and to identify unknown carbonyl compounds the workflow applied in this study is presented in fig 3 for a plant ozonated secondary wastewater effluent as an example further details on the workflow are provided in section s6 si the workflow for identification of compounds was based on the acquired ms and ms2 spectra 1 in fig 3 where accurate masses error within 5 ppm were determined the chemical formulas were assigned using cd3 2 based on the accurate mass isotope patterns and fragmentation in ms2 2 in fig 3 see figure s8 and section s6 si for further information filtering of the identified compounds was achieved by excluding detected compounds which occurred in the derivatised blank at an intensity above 20 compared to the sample 3 in fig 3 for the plant ozonated wastewater provided as an example in fig 3 this background subtraction reduced the number of potential compounds by 40 number of hits decreasing from 1734 to 978 the secondary filtering criteria consisted of excluding compounds that did not have the minimal composition of c8h10n2o2s which results from derivatisation of carbonyl compounds and those with a rt lower than that of tsh 4 in fig 3 for the example in fig 3 this reduced the number of hits by 60 to 316 potential carbonyl compounds the exclusion of compounds with an rt rttsh was based on the assumption that the binding of an additional organic moiety carbonyl compound to tsh leads to a final product with an enhanced retention in reverse phase chromatography c18 column therefore tsh derivatized carbonyls will have a rt rttsh which was confirmed for all the tested target carbonyl compounds a further filtration criterion excluded compounds for which the ms2 spectra did not contain any of the three tsh signature fragments shown in fig 2 compound class score 33 and which were considered most likely as non carbonyl containing compounds 5 in fig 3 and section s6 si the exclusion of such compounds reduced the number of hits by 56 to 139 compounds furthermore from the 139 hits only the compounds which occurred at two fold intensity in the ozonated sample and had satisfying peak shapes were processed consequently the number of hits was reduced by 47 to a pool of 73 compounds 6 in fig 3 overall the combination of the four filtering criteria allowed the screening and identification of carbonyl compounds with low risk of false positives and reduced the pool of compounds under consideration by about 96 to determine the chemical formula of a carbonyl compound in the non derivatised form c7h8n2os or c14h16n4o2s2 in case of double derivatised dicarbonyl compounds were subtracted from the identified chemical formula of the derivatised compound using the scripting node section s6 si this allowed to assign chemical formulas for the non derivatised carbonyl compounds after these processing steps the identification of carbonyl compounds was at confidence level cl 3 given the presence of a carbonyl functional group according to the classification by schymanski et al 2014 structural elucidation was performed in step 7 7 in fig 3 where tentative probable and confirmed identifications were achieved by integrating analytical and mechanistic data including from the ozonation of model compounds as described in houska et al 2023 for the 73 compounds filtered in the plant ozonated wastewater sample 6 in fig 3 53 tentative cl 3 7 probable cl 2 and 4 confirmed cl 1 stuctures were elucidated along with 9 additional confirmed compounds which matched compounds present in the target list 7 in fig 3 overall the non target workflow allowed the identification of the molecular formulas of 178 carbonyl compounds number of carbons ranging from c 1 18 in the different water types the 178 detected carbonyl compounds included 166 unknowns and 12 targets with 4 compounds detected only loq the 166 unknown carbonyl compounds were identified as follows 151 tentative compounds cl 3 7 probable compounds cl 2 and 8 confirmed compounds cl 1 as described in detail in houska et al 2023 the detected target compounds are described in section 3 4 the validation of the workflow was achieved based on the identification of the target carbonyl compounds which were treated as unknowns for testing applying the workflow on the target carbonyls using standard solutions within the concentration range reported in table s3 si 14 out of 17 target carbonyl compounds could be identified when processed as unknowns the three target carbonyl compounds which escaped detection 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene indole 3 carboxaldehyde and glyoxylic acid were excluded due to the absence of the tsh signature fragments in their ms2 spectra or occurrence at intensities below the detection threshold the assignment of three target carbonyl compounds as false negatives is caused by the conservative nature of the applied non target approach which aimed at providing high specificity in detecting carbonyl compounds to avoid false positives while this approach has an advantage of providing high confidence in the assignment of carbonyl containing compounds its drawback is the potential exclusion of carbonyl compounds presenting ms2 spectra with no or low tsh fragments intensity however considering the high number of carbonyl compounds detected despite the restrictions in the non target workflow and the requirement of further prioritisation to achieve a manageable pool of compounds for structural elucidation houska et al 2023 the workflow can be considered fit for purpose 3 4 formation of target carbonyl compounds during ozonation in laboratory scale experiments 3 4 1 relative abundance of carbonyl compounds and the total carbonyl compound concentrations in the different water types 3 4 1 1 relative abundance of the quantified carbonyl compounds after laboratory scale ozonation 8 out of the 17 target carbonyl compounds were detected above the loqs in different water types in laboratory scale experiments figs 4 and 5 four carbonyl compounds benzaldehyde cyclopentanone decanal and 3 5 heptanedione were only detected loqs fig 4 shows the sum of the molar concentrations of carbonyl compounds pie chart size and the fractional molar distribution of the 8 target carbonyl compounds for ozonated samples for a specific ozone dose of 0 5 mgo3 mgc for mass concentrations see figure s9 si the relative molar abundance of the target carbonyl compounds in most samples decreased in the following order formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid glutaraldehyde 2 3 butanedione glyoxal 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene formaldehyde and acetaldehyde accounted for 80 of the total molar carbonyl concentration in most wastewater samples in line with the findings of marron et al 2020 formaldehyde was also detected in all water types before ozonation except werdhölzli october 2021 wastewater and lac de bret fig 5 other carbonyl compounds such as acetaldehyde and 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene were also detected loqs in some non ozonated samples fig 5 the occurrence of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in non ozonated lake water and secondary wastewater effluent has been reported previously glaze et al 1989 marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 in the two lake waters the fractional molar distribution differed significantly from one another with the most abundant carbonyl compounds being formaldehyde 92 and acetaldehyde 96 in lake greifensee and lac de bret respectively the lower number of carbonyl compounds quantified in ozonated lake waters doc 3 1 3 4 mg l compared to wastewaters doc 4 7 10 9 mg l is attributed to the lower doc concentrations and or different dom type 3 4 1 2 total carbonyl compound concentration for the different water types higher total carbonyl compounds concentrations were measured in ozonated wastewater and srfa containing water compared to lake water pie chart size fig 4 to assess the role of the dom type the concentrations of carbonyl compounds were normalised to the doc figure s12 si at a specific ozone dose of 0 5 mgo3 mgc the doc normalised total carbonyl compounds concentrations were 0 1 and 0 8 μm mgc in lac de bret and lake greifensee respectively ranged within 0 5 1 1 μm mgc in wastewater and reached 1 5 μm mgc for srfa in werdhölzli wastewater the doc concentration normalised total carbonyl compounds concentrations detected in september 2020 and march 2021 samples were almost identical around 1 μm mgc while in october 2021 samples it was significantly lower 0 5 μm mgc the lower concentration of formaldehyde in the october 2021 samples explains most of this difference figure s12 si at a specific ozone dose of ca 2 mgo3 mgc the doc concentration normalised total carbonyl compounds concentrations ranged from 0 03 0 5 μm mgc in lake waters 0 9 1 6 μm mgc in wastewaters and reached 1 9 μm mgc in srfa containing waters figure s12 si this is in agreement with the broad formation range reported previously during drinking water ozonation where aldehyde formation ranged within 0 1 and 0 5 μm mgc of toc weinberg et al 1993 furthermore significant differences in carbonyl compound formation in different lake waters have been reported at similar ph total organic carbon toc and ozone doses schechter 1993 weinberg and glaze 1996 weinberg et al 1993 these findings highlight the role of the dom type in the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation the high formation potential of carbonyl compounds in srfa containing waters and secondary wastewater effluent dom is in line with recent findings of houska et al 2021 who measured high phenol concentrations in srfa 2 84 µm phenol per gc and in effluent dom isolate and wastewaters 1 69 2 17 µm phenol per gc while the concentrations of phenolic moieties were not measured in lake waters additionally houska et al 2023 reported a relationship between carbonyl compound formation and the electron donating capacity edc which further supports this hypothesis 3 4 2 formation trends of the target carbonyl compounds in the different water types based on the variation of the concentrations of carbonyl compounds as a function of the specific ozone doses laboratory scale ozonation applied in the present study multiple formation trends could be distinguished for the quantified target carbonyl compounds fig 5 the same formation trends were observed for the non target carbonyl compounds and are discussed in detail with mechanistic considerations in houska et al 2023 in brief based on its formation trend a carbonyl compound can be classified into one of the following five categories i primary product with constant maximum formaldehyde fig 5 a ii primary product with further abatement 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene acetaldehyde glutaraldehyde figs 5 b c d iii product with direct but less efficient formation 2 3 butanedione fig 5 e iv secondary product with constant maximum glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid and potentially glyoxal figs 5 f g h v secondary product with further abatement only non target compounds houska et al 2023 the variability in the formation trends of carbonyl compounds can be explained by differences in their formation kinetics mechanisms from precursors precursor concentrations and abatement efficiencies which are governed by their reactivities with ozone and oh buxton et al 1988 hoigné and bader 1983a houska et al 2023 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the ph did not influence the formation of carbonyl compounds significantly which was demonstrated by similar concentrations of carbonyl compounds for samples with and without ph adjustment ph 7 werdhölzli september 2021 glarnerland and neugut versus ph 8 werdhölzli october and march 2021 this is consistent with the findings of a previous study in which only a minor decrease in aldehyde concentration was reported as the ph increased from 7 to 8 hoigné 1998 a formaldehyde fig 5a trend i loq 15 01 µg l concentrations before ozonation varied from loq to 74 72 µg l figure s10a si the formation trend of formaldehyde consisted of increasing concentrations during ozonation until a peak at either 0 5 mgo3 mgc ww werdhölzli september 2021 lake greifensee water and ww neugut 1 mgo3 mgc ww glarnerland and srfa or 2 3 mgo3 mgc ww werdhölzli march and october 2021 beyond this point formaldehyde concentrations levelled off or decreased slightly in agreement with the trends reported previously can and gurol 2003 huang et al 2005 such a trend can be explained by an expected continuous formation of formaldehyde from precursors which are not fully depleted during ozonation along with low reactivities of formaldehyde with ozone k 0 1 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a and oh k 1 0 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the highest doc concentration normalised formaldehyde formation was observed during ozonation of srfa 44 5 µg mgc whereas it varied considerably in ww in the range of 10 9 27 6 µg mgc and in the two lake water samples loq or 20 8 µg mgc in lac de bret or lake greifensee respectively in comparison to previous studies formaldehyde concentrations in wastewater were similar or up to two fold higher marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 while in lake waters they were similar to previous studies huang et al 2005 marron et al 2020 fig 6 b 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene fig 5b trend ii loq 0 37 µg l was detected in non ozonated secondary wastewater effluent loq 0 46 µg l and in lake greifensee water at 0 41 µg l figure s10b si its concentration increased during ozonation up to a specific ozone dose of 0 3 mgo3 mgc in lake water and 0 5 mgo3 mgc in wastewater above which it decreased fig 5b the abatement of 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene at high ozone doses can be attributed to its further ozone reaction at the olefin group with k o3 2 105 m 1s 1 at 20 c wang et al in preparation due to this reactivity the ozone reaction is expected to dominate the abatement of 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene even though it has an expected high second order rate constant for the reaction with oh similar to cylcohexene k oh 8 8 109 m 1s 1 michael and hart 1970 the formation of 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene in wastewater was slightly higher 0 3 0 5 µg mgc than in lake water 0 2 0 3 µg mgc while in srfa it was negligible loq fig 5b c acetaldehyde fig 5c trend ii loq 1 32 µg l was detected in secondary wastewater effluent at concentrations loq to 4 45 µg l figure s10c si acetaldehyde increased during ozonation up to a specific ozone dose of 1 mgo3 mgc followed by a decrease fig 5c this decrease occurring only at high specific ozone doses can be explained by a limited reactivity with ozone k 1 5 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a but a significant reactivity with oh k 2 4 109 m 1s 1 schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 the formation of acetaldehyde varied significantly between water types and even amongst the different samples of the same water type the doc concentration normalised maximum formation varied between 3 4 and 10 6 µg mgc in wastewater in srfa the doc concentration normalised maximum formation 10 1 µg mgc was similar to wastewater while in lake waters it was significantly lower 1 5 4 6 µg mgc the concentrations measured in wastewater are within the range of concentrations reported previously in similar water types fig 6 marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 whereas in lake water they are slightly lower than in previous studies huang et al 2005 marron et al 2020 however considering the three fold difference between the two lake water types in the present study the observed differences to previous studies can be expected d glutaraldehyde fig 5d trend ii loq 4 51 µg l was loq in all samples before ozonation during ozonation glutaraldehyde concentrations increased up to specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 mgo3 mgc followed by a decrease fig 5d low ozone reactivity is expected for this aliphatic compound whereas oh can lead to a slow abatement with an estimated k 2 3 109 m 1s 1 based on the alkane propane and butane reactivity getoff 1991 the doc concentration normalised glutaraldehyde formation was generally higher in wastewater 1 4 4 2 µg mgc than in lake water loq 1 9 µg mgc and srfa 1 5 µg mgc fig 5d glutaraldehyde has not been reported in ozonated lake water or wastewater previously e 2 3 butanedione fig 5e trend iii loq 0 86 µg l was loq in all water and wastewater samples before ozonation 2 3 butanedione is the only carbonyl compound without a carboxylic acid functional group that increased continuously with increasing ozone doses fig 5e the concentration increase is direct and steady but not steep and thus it is classified as a compound with trend iii the continuous increase of 2 3 butanedione can be explained by a presumed slow continuous formation from residual precursors during ozonation and an expected low reactivity with ozone expected k 1 m 1s 1 and oh k 1 7 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the maximum formation of 2 3 butanedione ranged between 1 2 and 2 0 µg mgc in the different water types with the highest formation in wastewater samples reaching 2 0 µg mgc at 3 mgo3 mgc fig 5e a molecular formula suspected as 2 3 butanedione has been detected in a previous study upon ozonation of drinking water richardson et al 1999 however it was not quantified f glyoxylic acid fig 5f trend iv loq 3 33 µg l was either not detected or loq in all samples before ozonation glyoxylic acid concentrations increased with mostly a lag phase but steadily upon ozonation reaching a plateau at a specific ozone dose of about 2 mgo3 mgc fig 5f the doc concentration normalised formation of glyoxylic acid ranged between 16 2 and 25 4 µg mgc in wastewater while it reached 21 2 µg mgc in srfa containing solutions in lake waters glyoxylic acid concentrations remained loq after ozonation previously a wide range of glyoxylic acid concentrations has been reported fig 6 huang et al 2005 reported high glyoxylic acid formation 130 µg l during ozonation of lake water at 3 mgo3 mgc which is comparable to the maximum concentration measured in srfa containing solutions 106 µg l at 1 76 mgo3 mgc in this study hammes et al 2006 reported negligible and low glyoxylic acid concentrations loq and 2 5 µg l in ozonated samples from lake greifensee and lake zurich respectively the trend of glyoxylic acid can be explained by its low reactivity with ozone with k 1 9 m 1s 1 for the deprotonated species glyoxylate hoigné and bader 1983b and an expected low reactivity with oh g pyruvic acid fig 5g trend iv loq 3 96 µg l was not detected or loq in wastewater samples before ozonation figure s10g si unlike glyoxylic acid for which the concentrations tended to level off or slightly decrease at very high ozone doses pyruvic acid concentrations continuously increased with increasing ozone doses fig 5g the doc concentration normalised concentrations of pyruvic acid varied amongst the wastewater samples in the range of 8 3 and 23 5 µg mgc reached 19 5 µg mgc in srfa containing water and remained loq in lake water samples fig 5g the concentrations of pyruvic acid measured in ozonated wastewater in the current study 45 6 140 9 µg l are higher than those reported by wert et al 2007 where the pyruvic acid concentration reached 41 µg l in tertiary wastewater effluent and decreased during ozonation fig 6 the trend reported by wert et al 2007 is inconsistent with the trend observed in the current study and other studies where the formation of pyruvic acid increased during ozonation huang et al 2005 h glyoxal fig 5h potentially trend iv loq 0 58 µg l was highly unstable after derivatisation disappeared completely after 1 day see stability assessment in section 3 2 while in non derivatised samples its concentration increased during storage which may result from the decay of organic peroxo compounds formed during criegee type reactions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al prep due to its instability a full quantitative assessment of glyoxal formation in the different water types and an unequivocal trend assignment were not possible before ozonation glyoxal was not detected in any of the samples glyoxal concentrations increased slightly at low ozone doses and peaked at specific ozone doses of 1 2 mgo3 mgc followed by a decrease the latter is likely due to the instability of derivatised glyoxal rather than due to glyoxal abatement given its expected low reactivity with ozone expected k 0 1 m 1s 1 and oh k 6 6 107 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 therefore the glyoxal formation trend is tentatively assigned as trend iv the doc concentration normalised formation of glyoxal ranged from 0 3 to 3 2 µg mgc in wastewater was 1 0 µg mgc in srfa containing water while it was negligible loq in lake waters fig 5h glyoxal concentrations measured in ozonated samples in the current study loq 19 0 µg l are lower than concentrations reported previously 7 71 µg l fig 6 this disparity might be caused by the higher instability of the tsh derivatised glyoxal compared to the other derivatisation methods or different storage times in previous studies before or after derivatisation 3 5 formation and fate of carbonyl compounds in full scale wwtps 3 5 1 comparison of the formation of carbonyl compounds during laboratory and full scale ozonation fig 7 shows a comparison of the formation of carbonyl compounds during laboratory and full scale ozonation based on ww werdhölzli march 2021 samples the concentrations of 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene 2 3 butanedione formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde were in a similar range for similar specific ozone doses whereas for acetaldehyde glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid the concentrations were considerably different fig 7 the acetaldehyde concentrations were more than two fold higher in laboratory than in the plant ozonated samples on the contrary glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid concentrations were higher in full scale ozonation except at the lowest ozone dose 0 3 mgo3 mgc where they were only detected in laboratory experiments fig 7 despite this discrepancy for some compounds the total target carbonyl concentrations were generally in a similar range 20 difference for the laboratory and the full scale ozonation at moderate and high specific ozone doses considering the slightly different specific ozone doses fig 7 however the difference was more pronounced up to 40 in total concentration at a low ozone dose which may be attributed to a more significant influence of ph and temperature variability on the ozone exposure and reactivity in comparison to at high ozone doses where such effects become less important due to the higher ozone exposures von sonntag and von gunten 2012 one main difference between laboratory and full scale ozonation was a pre filtration at 0 45 µm before laboratory ozonation however the formation of target and non target carbonyl compounds during laboratory ozonation experiments in both filtered and non filtered secondary wastewater effluent was quite similar figure s13 si therefore an influence of particulate organic matter as a cause of the observed disparity can be ruled out similar to the trends observed in laboratory ozonation the concentrations of carbonyl compounds generally increased at the applied specific ozone dose range of 0 3 1 mgo3 mgc in the full scale system figs 7 and 8 the maximum total concentrations of target carbonyl compounds were 237 and 282 µg l for laboratory and full scale ozonated wastewaters respectively 3 5 2 fate of carbonyl compounds during biological sand filtration during biological sand filtration the concentrations of all target carbonyl compounds were abated significantly with an overall abatement of the total carbonyl compound concentrations of 57 86 depending on the specific ozone dose and hence the carbonyl compound concentration fig 8a the abatement of individual target carbonyl compounds in ozonated wastewater at 0 9 mgo3 mgc was 64 94 figure s14 si for compounds abated to levels below loq the latter was used as the final concentration to calculate the abatement which is therefore a minimum the only target carbonyl compounds detected after biological sand filtration were in decreasing concentration order figure s14 si formaldehyde in all samples glyoxylic acid in 66 of samples glutaraldehyde in 33 samples and 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene in 66 of samples figure s14 si the bulk of the total carbonyl compound concentration after biological sand filtration was caused by formaldehyde which had concentrations in a similar range as in the secondary wastewater effluent before ozonation figure s14 si similarly non target carbonyl compounds were mostly abated significantly during biological sand filtration with an average abatement of 84 by comparing the peak area of non target carbonyl compounds in sand filtration effluent to the peak area in ozonated wastewater at 0 9 mgo3 mgc approaching the peak area measured in secondary wastewater effluent before ozonation fig 8b for the non target carbonyl compounds the abatement of individual compounds ranged between 47 and 100 excluding the peak area of a non target carbonyl compound initially occurring in secondary wastewater effluent the abatement of the fraction formed during ozonation at three ozone doses was 88 for all individual carbonyl compounds the overall abatement ranged between 109 and 120 for all ozonated wastewater samples however these abatement percentages for the non target carbonyl compounds only represent a tentative estimate due to the uncertainty arising from the use of peak areas instead of concentrations the abatement of carbonyl compounds reported here is in agreement with results from previous studies in which selected target carbonyl compounds were degradable during biological filtration processes sand and granular activated carbon filtration in both lake water and wastewater carlson and amy 1998 digiano et al 2001 kramer et al 1993 levine et al 2000 marron et al 2020 weinberg and glaze 1996 weinberg et al 1993 in previous studies the abatement of carbonyl compounds was shown for only a selection of carbonyl compounds while in this study the biodegradability is demonstrated for 48 carbonyl compounds targets and non targets and confirmed as a characteristic for this class of compounds moreover the trend of carbonyl compounds formation during ozonation followed by an abatement during biological filtration is comparable to previously reported trends for aoc in lake water and wastewater hammes et al 2006 zimmermann et al 2011 aoc has been shown to increase significantly during ozonation of lake water and secondary wastewater followed by a partial or complete abatement during sand filtration leading to aoc concentrations in a similar range to those before ozonation this trend similarity is consistent with the known role of carbonyl compounds as a main fraction of aoc in ozonated water and wastewater von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation and their subsequent abatement during sand filtration is in line with previously reported toxicity evolution trends consisting of an increase of toxicity mainly mutagenicity during ozonation followed by a

14814,ozonation of natural waters is typically associated with the formation of carbonyl compounds aldehydes ketones and ketoacids a main class of organic disinfection byproducts dbps however the detection of carbonyl compounds in water and wastewater is challenged by multiple difficulties inherent to their physicochemical properties a non target screening method involving the derivatisation of carbonyl compounds with p toluenesulfonylhydrazine tsh followed by their analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionisation high resolution mass spectrometry lc esi hrms and an advanced non target screening and data processing workflow was developed the workflow was applied to investigate the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation of different water types including lake water aqueous solutions containing suwannee river fulvic acid srfa and wastewater a higher sensitivity for most target carbonyl compounds was achieved compared to previous derivatisation methods moreover the method allowed the identification of known and unknown carbonyl compounds 8 out of 17 target carbonyl compounds were consistently detected above limits of quantification loqs in most ozonated samples generally the concentrations of the 8 detected target compounds decreased in the order formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid glutaraldehyde 2 3 butanedione glyoxal 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene the doc concentration normalised formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation was higher in wastewater and srfa containing water than in lake water the specific ozone doses and the type of the dissolved organic matter dom played a predominant role for the extent of formation of carbonyl compounds five formation trends were distinguished for different carbonyl compounds some compounds were produced continuously upon ozonation even at high ozone doses while others reached a maximum concentration at a certain ozone dose above which they decreased concentrations of target and peak areas of non target carbonyl compounds during full scale ozonation at a wastewater treatment plant showed an increase as a function of the specific ozone dose sum of 8 target compounds

about the formation of halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps during chlorine based processes made ozonation a good alternative for oxidative water treatment von sonntag and von gunten 2012 ozonation was introduced as a disinfection step in drinking water at the beginning of the twentieth century von sonntag and von gunten 2012 more recently ozonation has been increasingly applied in wastewater treatment for the abatement of organic micropollutants known to induce a spectrum of adverse effects to aquatic ecosystems eggen et al 2014 hollender et al 2009 joss et al 2008 kienle et al 2022 ternes et al 2003 furthermore ozonation is increasingly considered as an oxidation step in water reuse treatment trains gerrity et al 2013 von gunten 2018 similar to other oxidants disinfectants the application of ozone to achieve different water and wastewater treatment goals is accompanied by the formation of dbps due to reactions with matrix components such as bromide and dissolved organic matter dom lim et al 2022 manasfi 2021 richardson and ternes 2022 von gunten 2003 von gunten 2018 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 bromate is the most critical inorganic dbp formed during ozonation because of its possible carcinogenicity and it is regulated in drinking water world health organization 2017 amongst organic dbps formed during ozonation carbonyl compounds including aldehydes ketones oxo and keto acids are key classes the formation of carbonyl compounds is well documented during ozonation of natural organic matter nom isolates and drinking water hammes et al 2006 huang et al 2005 liu et al 2020 swietlik et al 2004 weinberg et al 1993 however there is only limited information on the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation of wastewater marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 overall about 50 carbonyl compounds have so far been proposed to be formed during ozonation hammes et al 2006 huang et al 2005 marron et al 2020 richardson et al 2000 richardson et al 1999 swietlik et al 2004 tentscher et al 2018 weinberg and glaze 1996 wert et al 2007 some carbonyl compounds e g benzoquinones and α ß unsaturated dialdehydes ketones were not detected in water treatment but rather in ozonation studies with model compounds tentscher et al 2018 zoumpouli et al 2021 considering the diversity of potential carbonyl precursors in dom the currently known carbonyl compounds represent only a small fraction of the universe of this compound class the main concern about the formation of carbonyl compounds is related to their toxicity which is induced by their electrophilic nature this allows them to form covalent bonds with nucleophilic moieties of biological macromolecules such as enzymes proteins and dna lopachin and gavin 2014 prasse 2021 prasse et al 2018 exposure to α ß unsaturated carbonyl compounds has been associated with development of cardiovascular and neurological diseases and diabetes lopachin and gavin 2014 in addition carbonyl compounds can possibly catalyse the formation of other potentially toxic byproducts such as nitrosamines lv et al 2009 and can act as precursors for halogenated byproducts during post chlorination barrott 2004 marron et al 2021 weinberg and glaze 1996 the formation of carbonyl compounds also contributes to the assimilable biodegradable organic carbon which may promote microbial re growth after ozonation hammes et al 2006 zimmermann et al 2011 finally often an increased toxicity is observed after ozonation of secondary wastewater effluent which is in many cases abated during biological post filtration magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010 volker et al 2019 the latter points towards easily biodegradable substances and carbonyl compounds may explain this observation to some extent von gunten 2018 in the us a maximum contaminant level of 50 µg l for total aldehydes and a notification level of 100 µg l for formaldehyde in drinking water have been introduced in the states of new york and california respectively california division of drinking water state water resources control board 2020 new york state department of health 2021 however no standards for carbonyl compounds have been established by the european union and the world health organization since typical concentrations in drinking water are considered well below concentrations of health concern european commission 2020 world health organization 2022 the analysis of carbonyl compounds faces multiple challenges related to their physicochemical properties carbonyl compounds are generally very polar with low molecular weights mw resulting in poor separation on reverse phase liquid chromatography lc columns they are typically poorly ionisable in electrospray ionisation esi and have a low detectability by mass spectrometry to address these challenges carbonyl compounds are typically derivatised before analysis derivatisation methods involve o 2 3 4 5 6 pentafluorobenzyl hydroxylamine pfboa glaze et al 1989 pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine pfbha richardson et al 1999 and 2 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine dnph richardson et al 2000 these methods require laborious sample preparation as they typically involve liquid liquid or solid phase extraction and in the case of dnph suffer from its limited solubility in aqueous solutions and tendency to deposit in the ms ion source siegel et al 2014 alternatively a derivatisation method based on p toluenesulfonylhydrazine tsh has been applied for the screening of carbonyl compounds in biological samples siegel et al 2014 or for the targeted analysis of selected carbonyl compounds in water reuse systems marron et al 2020 however a systematic assessment of the tsh method performance in water and wastewater matrices has not been performed so far and the method has only been applied for targeted analysis of selected carbonyl compounds therefore the present study aimed at i developing optimizing and validating an analytical method based on tsh derivatisation and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms for the non targeted screening and targeted quantification of carbonyl compounds ii determining their concentrations and formation trends in dom containing synthetic water wastewater and lake water and iii monitoring their fate during full scale ozonation of a secondary wastewater effluent followed by biological post treatment in a companion study

wastewater treatment plants wwtps neugut in dübendorf werdhölzli in zurich and glarnerland in bilten switzerland at the wwtp werdhölzli three sampling campaigns were carried out on different dates

samples with an ozone stock solution section s1 si to assess the potential influence of filtration of werdhölzli wwtp effluent on the formation of carbonyl compounds during laboratory scale experiments ozonation of a sample march 2021 sampling campaign was carried out with filtered and unfiltered water samples were then stored at 4 c until analysis water quality parameters including dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations are provided in table s2 si model dom samples doc concentration 5 mg l were prepared using a stock solution of suwannee river ii standard fulvic acid srfa isolate 50 mgc l in a phosphate buffer 5 mm ph 7 lake water secondary wastewater effluent samples referred to as wastewater and srfa samples were treated with multiple specific ozone doses using an ozone stock solution 1 5 1 9 mm section s1 si 2 3 derivatisation procedure and analysis by lc esi hrms the derivatisation reaction of carbonyl compounds was carried out using tsh in the presence of hcl as a catalyst fig 2 this is a nucleophilic addition of hydrazine tsh to the carbonyl group resulting in the formation of a hydrazone and h2o fig 2 details on the optimisation of the derivatisation conditions and the calculation of derivatisation efficiency are provided in section s3 si different derivatisation conditions including various tsh concentrations figures s2 and s3 si hcl concentrations figure s4a si and reaction times figure s4b si were tested for the derivatisation of carbonyl compounds in different water types samples were spiked with benzaldehyde d6 100 nm and tramadol d6 32 5 nm as derivatisation surrogate and internal standard respectively the samples were then derivatised by the addition of tsh 200 µm and hcl 0 02 m a flow scheme of the different steps during derivatisation is presented in figure s1 si derivatisation of samples was performed within 24 h after collection or generation the samples were analysed using high performance lc ultimate 3000 uhplc system dionex coupled to an orbitrap hrms q exactive plus thermo scientific with esi separation was performed using an atlantis column 3 µm particle size 3 150 mm at 30 c and a flow rate of 300 µl min an autosampler pal hts xt system mckinley scientific was used for sample injection 50 µl sample injected into a 100 µl loop and for sample storage at 4 c during measurement sequences eluents consisted of ultrapure water a and methanol b each containing 0 1 formic acid the lc method ran for 29 min and the lc gradient started with 95 a after 1 min b increased gradually from 5 to reach 95 at 17 min and stayed constant until 25 min afterwards a increased to reach 95 starting gradient at 27 min and then remained constant until the end of the run during the first 5 min of the run the lc flow was diverted to waste to avoid contamination of the ms with phosphate buffer which was present in most samples and the esi spray voltage was meanwhile set to 0 v moreover the intense peak of the derivatising agent rt 11 9 min was cut out by diverting the lc flow to waste between about 11 8 and 12 3 min to avoid any contamination of the ms an ultrapure water blank was injected after each derivatised sample to avoid potential carry over of derivatised carbonyls or tsh from one sample to another acquisition was achieved by performing an initial ms full scan resolution 140 000 at m z 200 followed by data dependant fragmentation ms2 experiments resolution 17 500 at m z 200 in the positive polarity mode the latter was selected since it provided better detection of the derivatised carbonyls than the negative polarity mode figure s5 si ms conditions were as follows spray voltage 4000 v capillary temperature 350 c sheath gas 40 arbitrary units auxiliary gas 10 arbitrary units and mass range from 100 to 1000 da properties of the data dependant top 5 ms2 scans included an automatic gain control agc of 2 105 isolation window of 1 0 m z and normalised collision energy nce of 30 the 17 derivatised target carbonyls in positive esi were added to an inclusion list to ensure their fragmentation 2 4 method performance characteristics matrix effects and stability of carbonyl compounds the concentrations of target carbonyl compounds were quantified based on external calibrations since matrix effects were negligible table s4 si calibration standards were prepared by spiking carbonyl compounds into ultrapure water followed by derivatisation the response ratio defined as the ratio of peak area of an analyte to the peak area of tsh derivatised benzaldehyde d6 in the same sample was used for calibration and quantification the limits of detection lod and limits of quantification loq were defined based on a signal to noise s n ratio of 3 1 and 10 1 respectively the calibration ranges were defined based on the linearity of calibration curves and the coverage of concentrations measured in the samples potential interferences on the response of carbonyl compounds in esi hrms due to matrix effects were assessed according to the protocol presented in section s4 si in addition the stability of carbonyl compounds during storage at 4 c in derivatised and non derivatised forms was assessed for details see section s5 si 2 5 non target screening and data processing workflow a non target screening workflow was implemented using the software compound discoverer cd3 2 thermo scientific germany the workflow consisted of an array of nodes used for the processing and post processing of lc ms data the detection of tsh derived fragments referred to as signature fragments in the ms2 spectra was used as a key criterion for the screening of carbonyl compounds fig 2 a detailed description of the non target workflow and data processing is presented in section s6 si a total of 178 carbonyl compounds were detected in all samples houska et al 2023 among the latter 40 non target carbonyl compounds were prioritized for monitoring because they occurred in more than two water types and contained 5 carbons with one exception for a c6 compound that was also included the tracefinder software tf5 1 thermo scientific germany was used for the determination of peak areas of the 40 non target carbonyl compounds and concentrations of target compounds 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimisation of the derivatisation procedure in the different water types the main parameters for the optimisation validation of the derivatisation procedure are discussed here with additional details in section s3 si 3 1 1 tsh concentration the variability of derivatisation efficiency as a function of the tsh concentration was similar for the target carbonyl compounds across all tested matrices a tsh concentration of 200 µm provided the highest derivatisation efficiency figures s2 and s3 si 3 1 2 hcl concentration the derivatisation efficiencies increased considerably in the presence of hcl 0 01 m except for formaldehyde no effect acetaldehyde decreasing efficiency and decanal slightly decreasing efficiency figure s4a si increasing hcl concentrations from 0 01 to 0 05 m did not enhance the derivatisation efficiency and therefore a hcl concentration of 0 02 m was selected to overcome potential buffering capacities in wastewater 3 1 3 reaction time changes in the derivatisation efficiencies were minor within 10 for most tested carbonyl compounds as the time interval between derivatisation and analysis increased from 10 min to 2 h figure s4b si therefore a short reaction time of 10 min after the addition of tsh and hcl was sufficient to achieve maximum derivatisation the application of the optimised derivatisation method significantly enhanced the detectability of most target carbonyl compounds while some compounds were also detectable before derivatisation most compounds became detectable only after derivatisation figure s5 si 3 2 method performance characteristics and stability of the target carbonyl compounds method performance characteristics including the lods loqs and measurement ranges are presented in table s3 si in addition the results of the assessment of analytical matrix effects during the analysis of carbonyl compounds in water and wastewater matrices are presented in section s4 and table s4 si based on the determined lods 0 004 1 35 µg l 0 06 13 5 nm the sensitivity of the tsh method was generally better or in a similar range to the sensitivity achieved by the pfboa and dnph derivatisation methods which involve extensive sample preparation such as longer derivatisation times 1 4 h and extraction steps and provide lods in the range of 0 7 5 2 µg l and 0 5 1 µg l respectively glaze et al 1989 richardson et al 2000 siegel et al 2014 also reported generally lower lods for carbonyl compounds with the tsh method compared to the dnph method for biological samples cell extracts formaldehyde was an exception with a markedly higher lod 4 50 µg l or 150 2 nm than for other carbonyl compounds and other derivatisation methods due to high background levels detected in tsh blanks the source of background formaldehyde concentration was attributed to tsh and it was accounted for in the determination of formaldehyde concentrations section s4 si however since the formation of formaldehyde is typically high during ozonation this limitation is not critical in the context of the present study matrix effects were negligible during the analysis of derivatised carbonyl compounds in both water and wastewater table s4 si which agrees with previous findings in cell extracts siegel et al 2014 the stability of the target carbonyl compounds before and after tsh derivatisation is presented in section s5 si in the tsh derivatised form a broad disparity in the stability of carbonyl compounds in wastewater was observed over a storage period of 6 5 days at 4 c figure s6 si derivatised carbonyl compounds were either highly unstable i e 40 loss within 24 h and declined to loq after 6 5 days e g glyoxal glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid and formaldehyde moderately unstable i e 65 loss within 6 5 days e g decanal crotonaldehyde and methacrolein figure s6a si or quite stable i e 10 loss within 6 5 days e g 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene acetaldehyde 2 3 butanedione glutaraldehyde and 3 5 heptanedione figure s6b si in the non derivatised form some carbonyl compounds tended to degrade e g glutaraldehyde pyruvic acid glyoxylic acid while others appeared during storage e g glyoxal figure s7 si this assessment emphasizes the importance of performing the derivatisation and analyses immediately after sampling for the detection and accurate determination of concentrations of carbonyl compounds 3 3 identification of carbonyl compounds by the non target screening workflow the application of the non target screening workflow allowed to effectively reduce the complexity of hrms data in complex matrices such as wastewater and to identify unknown carbonyl compounds the workflow applied in this study is presented in fig 3 for a plant ozonated secondary wastewater effluent as an example further details on the workflow are provided in section s6 si the workflow for identification of compounds was based on the acquired ms and ms2 spectra 1 in fig 3 where accurate masses error within 5 ppm were determined the chemical formulas were assigned using cd3 2 based on the accurate mass isotope patterns and fragmentation in ms2 2 in fig 3 see figure s8 and section s6 si for further information filtering of the identified compounds was achieved by excluding detected compounds which occurred in the derivatised blank at an intensity above 20 compared to the sample 3 in fig 3 for the plant ozonated wastewater provided as an example in fig 3 this background subtraction reduced the number of potential compounds by 40 number of hits decreasing from 1734 to 978 the secondary filtering criteria consisted of excluding compounds that did not have the minimal composition of c8h10n2o2s which results from derivatisation of carbonyl compounds and those with a rt lower than that of tsh 4 in fig 3 for the example in fig 3 this reduced the number of hits by 60 to 316 potential carbonyl compounds the exclusion of compounds with an rt rttsh was based on the assumption that the binding of an additional organic moiety carbonyl compound to tsh leads to a final product with an enhanced retention in reverse phase chromatography c18 column therefore tsh derivatized carbonyls will have a rt rttsh which was confirmed for all the tested target carbonyl compounds a further filtration criterion excluded compounds for which the ms2 spectra did not contain any of the three tsh signature fragments shown in fig 2 compound class score 33 and which were considered most likely as non carbonyl containing compounds 5 in fig 3 and section s6 si the exclusion of such compounds reduced the number of hits by 56 to 139 compounds furthermore from the 139 hits only the compounds which occurred at two fold intensity in the ozonated sample and had satisfying peak shapes were processed consequently the number of hits was reduced by 47 to a pool of 73 compounds 6 in fig 3 overall the combination of the four filtering criteria allowed the screening and identification of carbonyl compounds with low risk of false positives and reduced the pool of compounds under consideration by about 96 to determine the chemical formula of a carbonyl compound in the non derivatised form c7h8n2os or c14h16n4o2s2 in case of double derivatised dicarbonyl compounds were subtracted from the identified chemical formula of the derivatised compound using the scripting node section s6 si this allowed to assign chemical formulas for the non derivatised carbonyl compounds after these processing steps the identification of carbonyl compounds was at confidence level cl 3 given the presence of a carbonyl functional group according to the classification by schymanski et al 2014 structural elucidation was performed in step 7 7 in fig 3 where tentative probable and confirmed identifications were achieved by integrating analytical and mechanistic data including from the ozonation of model compounds as described in houska et al 2023 for the 73 compounds filtered in the plant ozonated wastewater sample 6 in fig 3 53 tentative cl 3 7 probable cl 2 and 4 confirmed cl 1 stuctures were elucidated along with 9 additional confirmed compounds which matched compounds present in the target list 7 in fig 3 overall the non target workflow allowed the identification of the molecular formulas of 178 carbonyl compounds number of carbons ranging from c 1 18 in the different water types the 178 detected carbonyl compounds included 166 unknowns and 12 targets with 4 compounds detected only loq the 166 unknown carbonyl compounds were identified as follows 151 tentative compounds cl 3 7 probable compounds cl 2 and 8 confirmed compounds cl 1 as described in detail in houska et al 2023 the detected target compounds are described in section 3 4 the validation of the workflow was achieved based on the identification of the target carbonyl compounds which were treated as unknowns for testing applying the workflow on the target carbonyls using standard solutions within the concentration range reported in table s3 si 14 out of 17 target carbonyl compounds could be identified when processed as unknowns the three target carbonyl compounds which escaped detection 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene indole 3 carboxaldehyde and glyoxylic acid were excluded due to the absence of the tsh signature fragments in their ms2 spectra or occurrence at intensities below the detection threshold the assignment of three target carbonyl compounds as false negatives is caused by the conservative nature of the applied non target approach which aimed at providing high specificity in detecting carbonyl compounds to avoid false positives while this approach has an advantage of providing high confidence in the assignment of carbonyl containing compounds its drawback is the potential exclusion of carbonyl compounds presenting ms2 spectra with no or low tsh fragments intensity however considering the high number of carbonyl compounds detected despite the restrictions in the non target workflow and the requirement of further prioritisation to achieve a manageable pool of compounds for structural elucidation houska et al 2023 the workflow can be considered fit for purpose 3 4 formation of target carbonyl compounds during ozonation in laboratory scale experiments 3 4 1 relative abundance of carbonyl compounds and the total carbonyl compound concentrations in the different water types 3 4 1 1 relative abundance of the quantified carbonyl compounds after laboratory scale ozonation 8 out of the 17 target carbonyl compounds were detected above the loqs in different water types in laboratory scale experiments figs 4 and 5 four carbonyl compounds benzaldehyde cyclopentanone decanal and 3 5 heptanedione were only detected loqs fig 4 shows the sum of the molar concentrations of carbonyl compounds pie chart size and the fractional molar distribution of the 8 target carbonyl compounds for ozonated samples for a specific ozone dose of 0 5 mgo3 mgc for mass concentrations see figure s9 si the relative molar abundance of the target carbonyl compounds in most samples decreased in the following order formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid glutaraldehyde 2 3 butanedione glyoxal 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene formaldehyde and acetaldehyde accounted for 80 of the total molar carbonyl concentration in most wastewater samples in line with the findings of marron et al 2020 formaldehyde was also detected in all water types before ozonation except werdhölzli october 2021 wastewater and lac de bret fig 5 other carbonyl compounds such as acetaldehyde and 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene were also detected loqs in some non ozonated samples fig 5 the occurrence of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in non ozonated lake water and secondary wastewater effluent has been reported previously glaze et al 1989 marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 in the two lake waters the fractional molar distribution differed significantly from one another with the most abundant carbonyl compounds being formaldehyde 92 and acetaldehyde 96 in lake greifensee and lac de bret respectively the lower number of carbonyl compounds quantified in ozonated lake waters doc 3 1 3 4 mg l compared to wastewaters doc 4 7 10 9 mg l is attributed to the lower doc concentrations and or different dom type 3 4 1 2 total carbonyl compound concentration for the different water types higher total carbonyl compounds concentrations were measured in ozonated wastewater and srfa containing water compared to lake water pie chart size fig 4 to assess the role of the dom type the concentrations of carbonyl compounds were normalised to the doc figure s12 si at a specific ozone dose of 0 5 mgo3 mgc the doc normalised total carbonyl compounds concentrations were 0 1 and 0 8 μm mgc in lac de bret and lake greifensee respectively ranged within 0 5 1 1 μm mgc in wastewater and reached 1 5 μm mgc for srfa in werdhölzli wastewater the doc concentration normalised total carbonyl compounds concentrations detected in september 2020 and march 2021 samples were almost identical around 1 μm mgc while in october 2021 samples it was significantly lower 0 5 μm mgc the lower concentration of formaldehyde in the october 2021 samples explains most of this difference figure s12 si at a specific ozone dose of ca 2 mgo3 mgc the doc concentration normalised total carbonyl compounds concentrations ranged from 0 03 0 5 μm mgc in lake waters 0 9 1 6 μm mgc in wastewaters and reached 1 9 μm mgc in srfa containing waters figure s12 si this is in agreement with the broad formation range reported previously during drinking water ozonation where aldehyde formation ranged within 0 1 and 0 5 μm mgc of toc weinberg et al 1993 furthermore significant differences in carbonyl compound formation in different lake waters have been reported at similar ph total organic carbon toc and ozone doses schechter 1993 weinberg and glaze 1996 weinberg et al 1993 these findings highlight the role of the dom type in the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation the high formation potential of carbonyl compounds in srfa containing waters and secondary wastewater effluent dom is in line with recent findings of houska et al 2021 who measured high phenol concentrations in srfa 2 84 µm phenol per gc and in effluent dom isolate and wastewaters 1 69 2 17 µm phenol per gc while the concentrations of phenolic moieties were not measured in lake waters additionally houska et al 2023 reported a relationship between carbonyl compound formation and the electron donating capacity edc which further supports this hypothesis 3 4 2 formation trends of the target carbonyl compounds in the different water types based on the variation of the concentrations of carbonyl compounds as a function of the specific ozone doses laboratory scale ozonation applied in the present study multiple formation trends could be distinguished for the quantified target carbonyl compounds fig 5 the same formation trends were observed for the non target carbonyl compounds and are discussed in detail with mechanistic considerations in houska et al 2023 in brief based on its formation trend a carbonyl compound can be classified into one of the following five categories i primary product with constant maximum formaldehyde fig 5 a ii primary product with further abatement 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene acetaldehyde glutaraldehyde figs 5 b c d iii product with direct but less efficient formation 2 3 butanedione fig 5 e iv secondary product with constant maximum glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid and potentially glyoxal figs 5 f g h v secondary product with further abatement only non target compounds houska et al 2023 the variability in the formation trends of carbonyl compounds can be explained by differences in their formation kinetics mechanisms from precursors precursor concentrations and abatement efficiencies which are governed by their reactivities with ozone and oh buxton et al 1988 hoigné and bader 1983a houska et al 2023 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the ph did not influence the formation of carbonyl compounds significantly which was demonstrated by similar concentrations of carbonyl compounds for samples with and without ph adjustment ph 7 werdhölzli september 2021 glarnerland and neugut versus ph 8 werdhölzli october and march 2021 this is consistent with the findings of a previous study in which only a minor decrease in aldehyde concentration was reported as the ph increased from 7 to 8 hoigné 1998 a formaldehyde fig 5a trend i loq 15 01 µg l concentrations before ozonation varied from loq to 74 72 µg l figure s10a si the formation trend of formaldehyde consisted of increasing concentrations during ozonation until a peak at either 0 5 mgo3 mgc ww werdhölzli september 2021 lake greifensee water and ww neugut 1 mgo3 mgc ww glarnerland and srfa or 2 3 mgo3 mgc ww werdhölzli march and october 2021 beyond this point formaldehyde concentrations levelled off or decreased slightly in agreement with the trends reported previously can and gurol 2003 huang et al 2005 such a trend can be explained by an expected continuous formation of formaldehyde from precursors which are not fully depleted during ozonation along with low reactivities of formaldehyde with ozone k 0 1 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a and oh k 1 0 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the highest doc concentration normalised formaldehyde formation was observed during ozonation of srfa 44 5 µg mgc whereas it varied considerably in ww in the range of 10 9 27 6 µg mgc and in the two lake water samples loq or 20 8 µg mgc in lac de bret or lake greifensee respectively in comparison to previous studies formaldehyde concentrations in wastewater were similar or up to two fold higher marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 while in lake waters they were similar to previous studies huang et al 2005 marron et al 2020 fig 6 b 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene fig 5b trend ii loq 0 37 µg l was detected in non ozonated secondary wastewater effluent loq 0 46 µg l and in lake greifensee water at 0 41 µg l figure s10b si its concentration increased during ozonation up to a specific ozone dose of 0 3 mgo3 mgc in lake water and 0 5 mgo3 mgc in wastewater above which it decreased fig 5b the abatement of 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene at high ozone doses can be attributed to its further ozone reaction at the olefin group with k o3 2 105 m 1s 1 at 20 c wang et al in preparation due to this reactivity the ozone reaction is expected to dominate the abatement of 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene even though it has an expected high second order rate constant for the reaction with oh similar to cylcohexene k oh 8 8 109 m 1s 1 michael and hart 1970 the formation of 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene in wastewater was slightly higher 0 3 0 5 µg mgc than in lake water 0 2 0 3 µg mgc while in srfa it was negligible loq fig 5b c acetaldehyde fig 5c trend ii loq 1 32 µg l was detected in secondary wastewater effluent at concentrations loq to 4 45 µg l figure s10c si acetaldehyde increased during ozonation up to a specific ozone dose of 1 mgo3 mgc followed by a decrease fig 5c this decrease occurring only at high specific ozone doses can be explained by a limited reactivity with ozone k 1 5 m 1s 1 hoigné and bader 1983a but a significant reactivity with oh k 2 4 109 m 1s 1 schuchmann and von sonntag 1988 the formation of acetaldehyde varied significantly between water types and even amongst the different samples of the same water type the doc concentration normalised maximum formation varied between 3 4 and 10 6 µg mgc in wastewater in srfa the doc concentration normalised maximum formation 10 1 µg mgc was similar to wastewater while in lake waters it was significantly lower 1 5 4 6 µg mgc the concentrations measured in wastewater are within the range of concentrations reported previously in similar water types fig 6 marron et al 2020 wert et al 2007 whereas in lake water they are slightly lower than in previous studies huang et al 2005 marron et al 2020 however considering the three fold difference between the two lake water types in the present study the observed differences to previous studies can be expected d glutaraldehyde fig 5d trend ii loq 4 51 µg l was loq in all samples before ozonation during ozonation glutaraldehyde concentrations increased up to specific ozone doses of 0 5 1 mgo3 mgc followed by a decrease fig 5d low ozone reactivity is expected for this aliphatic compound whereas oh can lead to a slow abatement with an estimated k 2 3 109 m 1s 1 based on the alkane propane and butane reactivity getoff 1991 the doc concentration normalised glutaraldehyde formation was generally higher in wastewater 1 4 4 2 µg mgc than in lake water loq 1 9 µg mgc and srfa 1 5 µg mgc fig 5d glutaraldehyde has not been reported in ozonated lake water or wastewater previously e 2 3 butanedione fig 5e trend iii loq 0 86 µg l was loq in all water and wastewater samples before ozonation 2 3 butanedione is the only carbonyl compound without a carboxylic acid functional group that increased continuously with increasing ozone doses fig 5e the concentration increase is direct and steady but not steep and thus it is classified as a compound with trend iii the continuous increase of 2 3 butanedione can be explained by a presumed slow continuous formation from residual precursors during ozonation and an expected low reactivity with ozone expected k 1 m 1s 1 and oh k 1 7 108 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the maximum formation of 2 3 butanedione ranged between 1 2 and 2 0 µg mgc in the different water types with the highest formation in wastewater samples reaching 2 0 µg mgc at 3 mgo3 mgc fig 5e a molecular formula suspected as 2 3 butanedione has been detected in a previous study upon ozonation of drinking water richardson et al 1999 however it was not quantified f glyoxylic acid fig 5f trend iv loq 3 33 µg l was either not detected or loq in all samples before ozonation glyoxylic acid concentrations increased with mostly a lag phase but steadily upon ozonation reaching a plateau at a specific ozone dose of about 2 mgo3 mgc fig 5f the doc concentration normalised formation of glyoxylic acid ranged between 16 2 and 25 4 µg mgc in wastewater while it reached 21 2 µg mgc in srfa containing solutions in lake waters glyoxylic acid concentrations remained loq after ozonation previously a wide range of glyoxylic acid concentrations has been reported fig 6 huang et al 2005 reported high glyoxylic acid formation 130 µg l during ozonation of lake water at 3 mgo3 mgc which is comparable to the maximum concentration measured in srfa containing solutions 106 µg l at 1 76 mgo3 mgc in this study hammes et al 2006 reported negligible and low glyoxylic acid concentrations loq and 2 5 µg l in ozonated samples from lake greifensee and lake zurich respectively the trend of glyoxylic acid can be explained by its low reactivity with ozone with k 1 9 m 1s 1 for the deprotonated species glyoxylate hoigné and bader 1983b and an expected low reactivity with oh g pyruvic acid fig 5g trend iv loq 3 96 µg l was not detected or loq in wastewater samples before ozonation figure s10g si unlike glyoxylic acid for which the concentrations tended to level off or slightly decrease at very high ozone doses pyruvic acid concentrations continuously increased with increasing ozone doses fig 5g the doc concentration normalised concentrations of pyruvic acid varied amongst the wastewater samples in the range of 8 3 and 23 5 µg mgc reached 19 5 µg mgc in srfa containing water and remained loq in lake water samples fig 5g the concentrations of pyruvic acid measured in ozonated wastewater in the current study 45 6 140 9 µg l are higher than those reported by wert et al 2007 where the pyruvic acid concentration reached 41 µg l in tertiary wastewater effluent and decreased during ozonation fig 6 the trend reported by wert et al 2007 is inconsistent with the trend observed in the current study and other studies where the formation of pyruvic acid increased during ozonation huang et al 2005 h glyoxal fig 5h potentially trend iv loq 0 58 µg l was highly unstable after derivatisation disappeared completely after 1 day see stability assessment in section 3 2 while in non derivatised samples its concentration increased during storage which may result from the decay of organic peroxo compounds formed during criegee type reactions von sonntag and von gunten 2012 wang et al prep due to its instability a full quantitative assessment of glyoxal formation in the different water types and an unequivocal trend assignment were not possible before ozonation glyoxal was not detected in any of the samples glyoxal concentrations increased slightly at low ozone doses and peaked at specific ozone doses of 1 2 mgo3 mgc followed by a decrease the latter is likely due to the instability of derivatised glyoxal rather than due to glyoxal abatement given its expected low reactivity with ozone expected k 0 1 m 1s 1 and oh k 6 6 107 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 therefore the glyoxal formation trend is tentatively assigned as trend iv the doc concentration normalised formation of glyoxal ranged from 0 3 to 3 2 µg mgc in wastewater was 1 0 µg mgc in srfa containing water while it was negligible loq in lake waters fig 5h glyoxal concentrations measured in ozonated samples in the current study loq 19 0 µg l are lower than concentrations reported previously 7 71 µg l fig 6 this disparity might be caused by the higher instability of the tsh derivatised glyoxal compared to the other derivatisation methods or different storage times in previous studies before or after derivatisation 3 5 formation and fate of carbonyl compounds in full scale wwtps 3 5 1 comparison of the formation of carbonyl compounds during laboratory and full scale ozonation fig 7 shows a comparison of the formation of carbonyl compounds during laboratory and full scale ozonation based on ww werdhölzli march 2021 samples the concentrations of 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene 2 3 butanedione formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde were in a similar range for similar specific ozone doses whereas for acetaldehyde glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid the concentrations were considerably different fig 7 the acetaldehyde concentrations were more than two fold higher in laboratory than in the plant ozonated samples on the contrary glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid concentrations were higher in full scale ozonation except at the lowest ozone dose 0 3 mgo3 mgc where they were only detected in laboratory experiments fig 7 despite this discrepancy for some compounds the total target carbonyl concentrations were generally in a similar range 20 difference for the laboratory and the full scale ozonation at moderate and high specific ozone doses considering the slightly different specific ozone doses fig 7 however the difference was more pronounced up to 40 in total concentration at a low ozone dose which may be attributed to a more significant influence of ph and temperature variability on the ozone exposure and reactivity in comparison to at high ozone doses where such effects become less important due to the higher ozone exposures von sonntag and von gunten 2012 one main difference between laboratory and full scale ozonation was a pre filtration at 0 45 µm before laboratory ozonation however the formation of target and non target carbonyl compounds during laboratory ozonation experiments in both filtered and non filtered secondary wastewater effluent was quite similar figure s13 si therefore an influence of particulate organic matter as a cause of the observed disparity can be ruled out similar to the trends observed in laboratory ozonation the concentrations of carbonyl compounds generally increased at the applied specific ozone dose range of 0 3 1 mgo3 mgc in the full scale system figs 7 and 8 the maximum total concentrations of target carbonyl compounds were 237 and 282 µg l for laboratory and full scale ozonated wastewaters respectively 3 5 2 fate of carbonyl compounds during biological sand filtration during biological sand filtration the concentrations of all target carbonyl compounds were abated significantly with an overall abatement of the total carbonyl compound concentrations of 57 86 depending on the specific ozone dose and hence the carbonyl compound concentration fig 8a the abatement of individual target carbonyl compounds in ozonated wastewater at 0 9 mgo3 mgc was 64 94 figure s14 si for compounds abated to levels below loq the latter was used as the final concentration to calculate the abatement which is therefore a minimum the only target carbonyl compounds detected after biological sand filtration were in decreasing concentration order figure s14 si formaldehyde in all samples glyoxylic acid in 66 of samples glutaraldehyde in 33 samples and 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene in 66 of samples figure s14 si the bulk of the total carbonyl compound concentration after biological sand filtration was caused by formaldehyde which had concentrations in a similar range as in the secondary wastewater effluent before ozonation figure s14 si similarly non target carbonyl compounds were mostly abated significantly during biological sand filtration with an average abatement of 84 by comparing the peak area of non target carbonyl compounds in sand filtration effluent to the peak area in ozonated wastewater at 0 9 mgo3 mgc approaching the peak area measured in secondary wastewater effluent before ozonation fig 8b for the non target carbonyl compounds the abatement of individual compounds ranged between 47 and 100 excluding the peak area of a non target carbonyl compound initially occurring in secondary wastewater effluent the abatement of the fraction formed during ozonation at three ozone doses was 88 for all individual carbonyl compounds the overall abatement ranged between 109 and 120 for all ozonated wastewater samples however these abatement percentages for the non target carbonyl compounds only represent a tentative estimate due to the uncertainty arising from the use of peak areas instead of concentrations the abatement of carbonyl compounds reported here is in agreement with results from previous studies in which selected target carbonyl compounds were degradable during biological filtration processes sand and granular activated carbon filtration in both lake water and wastewater carlson and amy 1998 digiano et al 2001 kramer et al 1993 levine et al 2000 marron et al 2020 weinberg and glaze 1996 weinberg et al 1993 in previous studies the abatement of carbonyl compounds was shown for only a selection of carbonyl compounds while in this study the biodegradability is demonstrated for 48 carbonyl compounds targets and non targets and confirmed as a characteristic for this class of compounds moreover the trend of carbonyl compounds formation during ozonation followed by an abatement during biological filtration is comparable to previously reported trends for aoc in lake water and wastewater hammes et al 2006 zimmermann et al 2011 aoc has been shown to increase significantly during ozonation of lake water and secondary wastewater followed by a partial or complete abatement during sand filtration leading to aoc concentrations in a similar range to those before ozonation this trend similarity is consistent with the known role of carbonyl compounds as a main fraction of aoc in ozonated water and wastewater von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation and their subsequent abatement during sand filtration is in line with previously reported toxicity evolution trends consisting of an increase of toxicity mainly mutagenicity during ozonation followed by a decrease during biological treatment kienle et al 2022 magdeburg et al 2014 stalter et al 2010 volker et al 2019 this hints towards a role of carbonyl compounds as a contributor to the detected toxic effects in ozonated wastewater in line with previous hypotheses regarding the susceptibility of oxygen rich dbps to induce toxicity in treated water von gunten 2018 the ability of many aldehydes including some of the compounds formed during ozonation e g formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxal glutaraldehyde and others to induce dna mutations or other forms of genotoxicity has been previously demonstrated antonowicz et al 2021 demkowicz dobrzanski and castonguay 1991 grafstrom et al 1983 mukai and goldstein 1976 niosh current intelligence bulletin 55 1991 weng et al 2018 4 conclusions tsh derivatisation coupled to an advanced hrms based non target workflow provides a simple and robust approach for the targeted and non targeted analysis of carbonyl compounds in non ozonated surface water and wastewater evaluation of different derivatisation conditions the stability of derivatised carbonyl compounds and the effects of sample filtration on the formation of carbonyl compounds during ozonation revealed best practices for sample preparation ozonation of lake water srfa containing water and secondary wastewater effluent resulted in the formation of carbonyl compounds 8 out of 17 target carbonyl compounds were detected loqs in most ozonated samples the dom type played a predominant role in the formation of carbonyl compounds since the doc concentration normalised carbonyl compound concentrations were higher in srfa 1 9 µm mgc and wastewater 0 9 1 6 µm mgc compared to lake water 0 03 0 5 µm mgc at a specific ozone dose of 2 mgo3 mgc the abundance of carbonyl compounds differed significantly between the two ozonated lake waters while in ozonated wastewater and srfa containing water it was comparable the molar concentrations decreased in the order formaldehyde acetaldehyde glyoxylic acid pyruvic acid glutaraldehyde 2 3 butanedione glyoxal 1 acetyl 1 cyclohexene formation trends were assigned to the different quantified target carbonyl compounds they depend on the reactivities and concentrations of precursors the reactivity of target compounds with ozone and hydroxyl radical and the stability of these two oxidants the formation of carbonyl compounds in laboratory and full scale ozonation of wastewater was similar for all target compounds except acetaldehyde glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid the total carbonyl concentrations diverged by around 20 at moderate and high specific ozone doses the concentrations and peak intensities of target and non target carbonyl compounds respectively decreased significantly during biological sand filtration at a
