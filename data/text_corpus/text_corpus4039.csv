20195,autonomous sailboats are promising platforms for long term marine science missions and have become a research area of increased interest over the last two decades to date dozens of distinctive autonomous sailboats have been designed and notably employed in numerous tasks some literature lists and reviews the various designs of the existing autonomous sailboats however no comprehensive work connects the design to the performance requirements of various application scenarios this paper first reviews and summarizes the existing designs from the perspective of critical performance in marine science missions further pointing out the present state and the logic behind the designs we then identify factors that hinder further performance improvement of autonomous sailboats through statistics and analysis of existing designs we finally describe how the autonomous sailboat community should best address these challenges with technology from other disciplines this article can provide references for designers of autonomous sailboats and inspire the community to eliminate the limitations they are facing additionally making autonomous sailboats more powerful platforms can facilitate marine science research such as research on ecosystems biogeochemistry and meteorology keywords autonomous sailboat design robotics 1 introduction in recent years the related research on marine ecosystems biogeochemistry and meteorology has been extended to the open sea which has increased the urgent demand of the scientific community for long term surface data acquisition platforms hotaling and kocak 2014 stammer et al 2016 visbeck 2018 directly driven by abundant wind energy autonomous sailboats are endowed with good endurance cokelet et al 2015 de robertis et al 2019 stelzer and jafarmadar 2011 in addition to their low cost miller et al 2015a 2015b low noise silva et al 2013 and moderate transition capacity cruz and alves 2008a b autonomous sailboats are promising platforms chai et al 2020 cruz and alves 2008a b rynne and von ellenrieder 2009 and significant relevant progress has been attained over the past 20 years abril et al 1997 elkaim 2001 designing an autonomous sailboat with good performance requires sufficient insights first different tasks have different performance requirement weights long distance transfer tasks require better endurance while tracking tasks may pay more attention to sailing speed for platforms that work in harsh seas survivability is the primary performance second the sea is harsh and changeable operation platforms must withstand most environmental conditions therefore performance conflicts arise the choice of trade off requires sufficient experience and wisdom moreover as autonomous sailboats are strongly affected by the environment the process of comparing and evaluating different designs is complicated at present designers from academic organizations to commercial companies have developed dozens of distinctive autonomous sailboats which play essential roles in multitudinous tasks such as ocean floor mapping saildrone surveyor marine biological surveys klinck et al 2009 mordy et al 2017 long term ocean observations cokelet et al 2015 cross et al 2015 ghani et al 2014 meinig et al 2015 sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 and water mass tracking kilpin 2014 rathour 2016 the literature describes works on performance improvement of autonomous sailboats including structural durability domínguez brito et al 2016 sauze et al 2006 sauzé and neal 2011a energy self sufficiency alvira and barton 2013 baker et al 2016 bruget et al 2014 dahl et al 2015 lavigne et al 2016 overturning resistance alves and cruz 2008 giger et al 2009 neal 2006 sailing speed dhomé 2018 tretow 2017 etc currently autonomous sailboats can sail for dozens or even hundreds of days cokelet et al 2015 cross et al 2015 de robertis et al 2019 meinig et al 2015 vazquez cuervo et al 2019 or complete feats such as crossing the atlantic sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 and circumnavigating antarctica stein 2019 although some of the literature silva et al 2019 stelzer and jafarmadar 2011 listed and reviewed existing autonomous sailboat designs no related work has been performed from the perspective of performance therefore this paper first reviews and summarizes the existing designs from the perspective of critical performance in marine science missions aiming to connect the design to performance requirements and clarify the logic behind these designs then through the analysis of the methods adopted by the designer to meet performance requirements design and statistical analysis we reveal the cause of the bottleneck in the performance improvement of the current autonomous sailboat designs in response to these factors we finally introduce technologies in related fields that can be used as potential solutions this paper provides comprehensive references in terms of design considerations and parameters it is important to note that the field of autonomous sailboat design is still far from mature and potential technologies are introduced in this paper thus we aim to inspire designers and thus enable autonomous sailboats to become more powerful tools for marine science research in this paper existing designs are reviewed in section 2 considering the following four essential characteristics structural durability energy self sufficiency overturning resistance and sailing speed the factors limiting further performance improvements of autonomous sailboats are summarized in section 3 section 4 describes the future development direction prospects of autonomous sailboat design in section 5 conclusions are presented 2 present state review of the designs from the perspective of performance performance is usually both the starting point and goal of design reviewing existing designs from the perspective of performance can be helpful when comparing different designs analysing the design ideas behind them and revealing core design issues the unique feature of autonomous sailboats compared with other platforms is that they are driven by sails therefore autonomous sailboats are structural fragile energy saving easy to capsize and their speed is easily affected therefore we review and analyse existing designs from four performance aspects structural durability energy self sufficiency overturning resistance and sailing speed 2 1 structural durability structural durability is the capability of a component to withstand the loads encountered in service over a specified period of use without failure or unacceptable degradation considering that autonomous sailboats often work in extremely harsh environments for example wind speeds of 46 knots cokelet et al 2015 and wave heights of 14 3 m sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 structural durability is assigned the highest design priority alves and cruz 2014 cruz and alves 2008a b m aasala and others 2018 naveau et al 2013 sauze et al 2006 table 1 presents the failure cases attributed to insufficient structural durability reported in the application related literature klinck et al 2016 meinig et al 2015 and on the microtransat challenge website microtransat history 2020 a transatlantic race for autonomous boats the most vulnerable component of an autonomous sailboat is its sail the hull keel and rudder are also at risk of failure the cause of damage to the sail and its actuator is usually impact caused by high energy wind and waves fatigue and artificial damage caused by passing ships the following two scenarios are very threatening for the hull keel and rudder driven into nearshore areas by superimposed winds and currents and encountering passing ships or fishing operations both may cause severe entanglement and collision to enhance the structural durability of the vessels traditional soft sails sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 voosen 2018 have increasingly been replaced with vertical airfoils i e wing sails the traditional soft sail with thousands of years of history is suitable for long distance sailing with crews neal et al 2009 stelzer and jafarmadar 2011 however prone to wear soft sails miller et al 2015b neal et al 2009 rynne 2008 and prone to entanglement riggings sauze et al 2006 are not suitable for automatic systems without maintenance in contrast wing sails are more reliable due to their solid profiles elkaim 2001 and embedded actuators enqvist et al 2016 hansen 1996 p 1 neal et al 2009 moreover in contrast to soft sails which have an air performance that severely degenerates after damage wing sails usually do not fail tretow 2017 as depicted in fig 1 a detailed information on platforms equipped with wing sails has been provided by silva et al 2019 another way to improve sail durability is to increase redundancy via the adoption of dual wing sails as depicted in fig 1 b platforms equipped with dual sails include the arc sauze et al 2006 moop3 sauzé and neal 2011a a tirma g2 domínguez brito et al 2016 and the shanghai jiao tong university sjtu prototypes du et al 2018 in addition to the realization of durability redundancy dual sails can greatly reduce the overturning moment and act as air rudders domínguez brito et al 2016 neal et al 2009 to enhance the manoeuvrability of autonomous sailboats sail actuators have been designed so that the actuator can be locked without the need to continuously maintain the position miller et al 2013 as another technical route the sailbuoy adopts a free rotating wing sail with a caging device sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 as shown in fig 1 c although the sail cannot be precisely controlled it provides sufficient durability with this configuration sailbuoy became the first autonomous sailboat ever to complete a transatlantic voyage similarly autonomous sailboats such as atlantis elkaim 2001 2006 saildrone cokelet et al 2015 meinig et al 2015 aspire friebe 2019 friebe et al 2017 m aasala and others 2018 and maribot vane tretow 2017 adopt free rotating self trimming wings to effectively reduce the load acting on the actuators however the reduction in energy consumption is more pronounced and therefore self trimming wings are described in section 2 2 regarding hull manufacture glass fibre and carbon fibre materials which exhibit good resistance to corrosion and collisions are commonly applied certain designs incorporate additional hull reinforcement and protection measures to minimize the damage caused by collisions and scratching the bow and stern which are prone to collision can be wrapped in polyurethane foam neal 2006 watertight bulkheads leloup et al 2011 waterproof boxes or tubes elkaim 2001 leloup et al 2011 sliwka et al 2009 and styrene foam plastic fillers are used in snoopy and breizh tigresse endeavour ec crossing brave puffin and opentransat to improve the sink resistance and provide electronic equipment protection boat details team joker 2014 stenersen 2016 fig 2 a shows the hull of breizh spirit 3 as a typical case of hull enhancement regarding the rudders atlantis elkaim 2001 arc sauze et al 2006 fast alves and cruz 2008 iboat briere 2008a avalon giger et al 2009 and a tirma g2 domínguez brito et al 2016 include twin rudders as depicted in fig 2 b which can increase the durability redundancy and ensure manoeuvrability under severe heeling giger et al 2009 sauze et al 2006 sliwka et al 2009 2 2 energy self sufficiency almost all platforms are powered by electricity for convenience navigation via the assimilation of abundant wind by sails rather than the transformation of stored energy by the main engine makes autonomous sailboats advantageous in terms of endurance smith 1989 however power is required for frequent adjustments of the sails and rudders sampling of scientific payloads adornato et al 2009 drifters 2003 and transmission of data and commands hotaling and kocak 2014 most platform acquisition energy supplements mainly rely on solar panels which are vulnerable to cloudy weather conditions high latitudes and salt spray fouling augenstein et al 2017 briere 2008a sauzé and neal 2011b although designers have adopted measures friebe et al 2017 guo et al 2011 jaulin and le bars 2014 miller et al 2014 naveau et al 2013 to improve energy harvesting ensuring energy self sufficiency for continuous scientific work remains challenging the gap between energy harvesting and energy consumption may require high capacity batteries sauzé and neal 2008a 2011b and backup fuel cells giger et al 2009 klinck et al 2009 and may lead to a decrease in task performance or endurance júnior et al 2013 ulysse et al 2019 according to statistics 1 m2 marine solar panels can produce approximately 10 35 w on average when considering the alternation of day and night and the probability of inadequate sun coverage rynne and von ellenrieder 2009 which is approximately 1 6 1 3 of the ideal state augenstein et al 2017 briere 2008a sauzé and neal 2011b to improve energy harvesting the maximum number of solar panels is deployed on sails and decks fig 3 moreover the aspire friebe et al 2017 adopted innovative solar panels to track the direction of the sun by adjusting the azimuth angle fig 4 it has been reported that the annual energy output can be increased by 50 compared to horizontally installed panels specific platforms adopt vertical axis wind turbines to obtain additional energy especially at night guo et al 2011 miller et al 2014 naveau et al 2013 jaulin and le bars 2014 proposed a unique energy harvesting method the main idea involved the application of a station keeping mode platform as a windmill pulling with swinging sails as reported this approach generates 93 w of electrical energy on average at a wind speed of 4 m s excluding the scientific payloads which are usually different the energy consumption of autonomous sailboats mainly includes three parts the functional module comprises the main computer sensors and communication system the driving module is the sail actuator and the steering module is the rudder actuator the energy consumption of the functional module is related to the hardware selection and the operational frequency instead of the general size of the platform as shown in fig 5 functional modules account for 5 86 of the total consumption of certain platforms to reduce energy consumption designers have adopted various management strategies linking operation decisions to the remaining power dahl et al 2015 sauzé and neal 2008b 2011b or frequency reduction alves et al 2008 baker et al 2016 eriksson and friebe 2015 sauzé and neal 2011b of the main computer in a low battery or idle state the driving module accounts for 13 86 of the total consumption certain autonomous sailboats use balanced rigs as depicted in fig 6 to reduce the high energy consumption of traditional soft sails under high loads ménage et al 2014 the headsail and mainsail of the balanced rig are positioned on the same beam instead of on separate beams this configuration brings the centre of effect closer to the mast with a shorter arm which produces a more balanced wind load distribution effectively reducing the energy consumption of the sail actuator and improving the sail durability it has been reported that the load on the sail actuator can be reduced by more than 50 giger et al 2009 the energy consumption can be reduced by two thirds stelzer and dalmau 2013 and the impact on aerodynamic performance can be ignored stelzer and dalmau 2013 wing sails are generally heavy and sensitive to the attack angle enqvist et al 2016 2017 kilpin 2014 the frequent and precise control of wing sails is a highly energy consuming task as an improvement self trimming wings have been developed the self trimming wing was first proposed in 1983 newman and fekete 1983 and was first applied to the autonomous sailboat atlantis in 2001 elkaim 2001 compared to a wing sail directly driven by the actuator a self trimming wing can rotate freely and is controlled by another smaller surface that is usually mounted behind it namely the tail fig 7 similar to a wind vane the controlled tail applies the wind power to adjust the main wing to the desired angle elkaim 2008 elkaim and boyce jr 2007 on the one hand elkaim 2008 enqvist et al 2016 and tretow 2017 noted that the self adjusting system simplifies the complexity of the control system and dramatically reduces the energy consumption associated with the adjustment and position keeping of the main wing on the other hand the tail provides passive stability when the wind direction changes slightly the self trimming sail can absorb gusts and automatically maintain a fixed angle of attack also a fixed lift coefficient this feature decouples the propulsion system from the navigation control system to a certain extent effectively downgrading the control frequency and further reducing energy consumption augenstein et al 2017 dhomé 2018 in regard to the steering module self steering systems as depicted in fig 8 have been implemented to save energy the history of the self steering system is much longer than that of autonomous sailboats since at least the 1920s crewed sailboats have adopted self steering systems alves and cruz 2008 letcher and others 1976 stelzer et al 2007 currently it remains in use for long distance sailing voyages to reduce the operational burden on sailors similar to the self trimming sail the main concept of the self steering system is to link the rudder to the wind vane mechanically when the wind direction changes slightly the rudder is automatically adjusted without energy consumption application to autonomous sailboats was first reported in 2011 on the l improbable of the ensta bretagne robot team sliwka et al 2011 the system was mounted on the bow to avoid any gears between the rudder and vane in another case the maribot vane tretow 2017 adopted both a self steering system and a self trimming wing since the main wing turns with the wind an additional wind vane was not included and the main wing was directly connected to the rudder through a clutch tests revealed that this configuration can automatically maintain the heading dhomé 2018 ulysse et al 2019 in the automatic mode while switching to the active servo controlled mode when needed 2 3 overturning resistance in the naval architecture field the term stability usually describes the ability of a ship the hull itself to float in the upright position and if inclined under the action of an external force to return to this position after the external force has ceased however the severity of the environment withstood by an autonomous sailboat is related to not only the hull but also the overturning moment producing sail therefore we consider the overturning resistance to describe the ability of autonomous sailboats to resist external disturbances before addressing the overturning resistance it should first be noted that designers tend to limit the general size length and displacement to a specific range as depicted in fig 9 the reasons include consideration of the manufacturing cost deployment facilities transportation convenience and regulatory restrictions anthierens et al 2014 fernandes et al 2016 neal 2006 tretow 2017 where the last reason is the most important whether autonomous sailboats belong to the vessel category or a particular buoy is a controversial issue alves and cruz 2015 briere 2008a eriksson and friebe 2015 however autonomous sailboats undoubtedly pose a collision risk to passing ships anthierens et al 2014 eliasson et al 2014 and holzgrafe 2014 revealed that when scaling a design both the recovery moment and the overturning moment decrease as the scale decreases however the rate of decrease in the recovery moment is higher in other words autonomous sailboats which are usually small require a relatively higher overturning resistance however no universally recognized standard applies for overturning resistance in practice designers have specified wind speed thresholds to ensure that the platform achieves sufficient resistance to overturning e g avalon giger et al 2009 was designed to withstand a wind speed of 50 knots and 9 m high waves near the irish coast other suitable configurations have been proposed by adjusting the design based on sea trial results or engineering experience sauzé and neal 2008a designers have improved the overturning resistance by enhancing the restoring ability produced by the hull and keel most designs adopt monohulls friebe et al 2017 rynne and von ellenrieder 2009 instead of multihulls although the stability of monohulls is not as high as that of multihulls eliasson et al 2014 miller et al 2013 their low inverted stability provides the opportunity for righting with an external disturbance after capsizing rynne and von ellenrieder 2009 as special cases a doghouse is placed on the deck to help the sailboat to turn back in case of it rolled over naveau et al 2013 active self righting system has been designed for the datamaran fig 10 which uprights the platform and relies on a swingable sail platform autonomous marine systems 2019 furthermore designers often choose crewed sailboats with a good stability as the starting point of design fig 11 a for example klinck et al 2009 considered the laerling boat type which is a dinghy designed for young beginners while ulysse et al 2019 considered a paralympic design in addition because there is no limitation on roll acceleration based on crew comfort in autonomous sailboat design cruz and alves 2008a b domínguez brito et al 2016 sliwka et al 2011 designers have adopted longer and heavier keels to effectively lower the centre of gravity alves and cruz 2008 giger et al 2009 neal 2006 in some instances extremely long or heavy or both keels as depicted in fig 11 b provide a self righting capability the hull can generate a restoring moment at any heel angle baker et al 2016 domínguez brito et al 2016 rynne and ellenrieder 2010 another commonly employed method is reducing the overturning moment sail area reduction is a direct and effective method briere 2008a adopted a 1 5 m2 sail area instead of the customary 4 m2 sail area in the design of beagle b the sail area was reduced by 40 neal et al 2009 sliwka et al 2009 also reduced the sail area based on international monohull open class association imoca design standards in addition lower sails stein 2019 or dual sails domínguez brito et al 2016 du et al 2018 sauze et al 2006 sauzé and neal 2011a have been adopted to lower the aerodynamic centre of the sail due to the wind gradient ittc 2011 a lower aerodynamic centre can notably reduce the overturning moment sailvane cusail fleet uses a stubby wingsail as a special case submaran s10 fig 11 c has a retractable wing sail submaran 2017 under extreme conditions the sails are brought down and the platform is submerged and driven by propellers 2 4 sailing speed we use the term sailing speed to describe the speed performance of autonomous sailboats under various wind directions and speeds although autonomous sailboats are known for their long endurance the sailing speed remains a vital feature compared to the notable efficiency improving effect in area coverage the sailing speed greatly facilitates the task of disaster monitoring and water mass tracking rathour 2016 pointed out that in the application of oil spill detection the platform should be faster than 3 of the wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface which is the drift speed of spilled oil furthermore the sailing speed is the decisive factor in autonomous sailboat passability platforms with a poor sailing speed are more likely to be captured by strong currents with the vessel eventually being stranded and damaged as indicated in table 1 microtransat history 2020 in addition platforms with slow sailing speeds may have to abandon closer routes to avoid being affected by strong ocean circulation currents which may severely limit the efficiency of a mission evaluating the sailing speed of a specific design remains a challenging task first the sailing speed cannot be characterized by a single value such as the average speed which has been widely considered in the literature the speed of an autonomous sailboat is closely related to the wind direction and speed so the average speed without specified conditions is meaningless second the sailing speed is impossible to evaluate based on the subsystem hull keel and sails without the other parts designed guelfi and canepa 2013 for example a platform with a narrower hull exhibits a lower resistance but a weaker overturning resistance designers should adopt a smaller sail to ensure a sufficient overturning resistance thus limiting the driving force generation therefore we introduce certain dimensionless numbers that reflect a specific performance aspect to review the existing designs comprehensively and qualitatively table 2 the first two dimensionless numbers introduced are the length displacement ratio ldr and length breadth ratio l b eliasson et al 2014 generally longer slenderer and lighter hulls exhibit higher speed potential the sail area displacement ratio sa d sponberg 2011 describes the power load ratio of the platform similar to the power to weight ratio of a vehicle considering only power conditions we apply sa d to both soft and wing sails since rynne and von ellenrieder 2008 noted that the typical lift coefficients of wing and soft sails are very similar finally we introduce the ballast to displacement ratio b d which is the percentage of ballast in the total weight to describe autonomous sailboats usually by the keel weight displacement ratio a high ballast ratio lowers the speed potential but enhances the overturning resistance since the mass stability is usually the primary source of the overturning resistance the statistics shown in fig 12 indicate that designers tend to adopt stubby hulls catamaran numbers are excluded with low ldr values most sa d values are lower than 15 corresponding to crewed slow auxiliary sailboats sponberg 2011 the distribution of b d is considerably dispersed reflecting that designers do not agree on this parameter research on the sailing speed is limited and mainly focused on evaluating and systematically optimizing the sailing speed velocity prediction programs vpps are reliable tools to predict the speed of a particular design under given external conditions wind speed and direction de jong et al 2008 graf and bohm 2005 kerwin 1978 orc vpp designer s version 2020 as depicted in fig 13 the output is usually provided in the form of a polar graph which can be used as a reference for control strategy formulation and design optimization briere 2008b proposed a four degree of freedom dof model to guide control law formulation rynne and von ellenrieder 2010 implemented an xfoil based vpp to optimize the design of the self trimming wing sails of the maribot vane miller et al 2018 compared the performance of viking style wing sails and traditional soft sails through pcsail a vpp developed by martin and beck 2001 however an et al unpublished results noted that existing vpps typically rely on empirical equation based modelling and gradient based solvers that are unsuitable for the design of autonomous sailboats thus they developed an optimization based generalized vpp by using vpp to optimize the sailing speed miller et al 2013 adopted a full scale tank test to optimize the shape and weight of the keel and bulb resulting in a speed increase of 15 dhomé 2018 and tretow 2017 adopted the vortex lattice method to model the self trimming wing and employed a customized matlab based vpp as an evaluator to select reasonable design parameters for the self trimming wing 3 discussion and analysis factors hindering further performance improvement over the past two decades autonomous sailboats have become effective platforms in multiple marine science missions due to continuous progress with an appropriate design proper control and no unexpected events disturbance by a passing ship damage from a serious collision extreme bad weather etc autonomous sailboats can sail for dozens or even hundreds of days cokelet et al 2015 cross et al 2015 de robertis et al 2019 meinig et al 2015 vazquez cuervo et al 2019 also complete feats such as crossing the atlantic sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 and circumnavigating antarctica stein 2019 however there are still issues that hinder and restrict the further improvement of the critical performance mainly due to the insufficient consideration of the coupling among these capacities in the current designs we now propose a list of emerging challenges that designers should overcome the list is not intended to be exhaustive but is intended to provide a basis for debate 3 1 design customization in general most existing designs have been modified based on reference designs typically remote control rc models 3 m cabrera gámez et al 2014 neal 2006 tranzatto et al 2015 dinghies 3 5 m anthierens et al 2014 ménage et al 2014 and yachts 5 m rynne and ellenrieder 2010 sauze et al 2006 as detailed in table 3 reference based designs are a good starting point but they introduce inappropriate design considerations the rc model is usually considered under racing conditions in calmer water so it provides a poor overturning resistance in addition slender hulls may handicap the arrangement of scientific loads in dinghy design the weight of the crew is accounted for in the overturning resistance so a lighter keel or even a dagger board is often adopted which is unsuitable for sea going autonomous sailboats ocean going yachts exhibit a good overturning resistance but the simple imitation of reference designs introduces unnecessary constraints for example the consideration of crew comfort cruz and alves 2008a b domínguez brito et al 2016 sliwka et al 2011 the flooding angle izaguirre alza et al 2008 the port depth and the class rule ensure the fairness of competitions although the continuous progress has let to improvements in the critical performance these improvements are not targeted enough designers tend to develop a comprehensive platform rather than a task based platform however different tasks are associated with their own capacity requirements as noted by hotaling and kocak 2014 ecosystem researchers are more concerned with the continuity of monitoring density and frequency of sampling which requires the platform to achieve better energy self sufficiency in contrast hazard observing missions require a fast response and a greater overturning resistance when capacities cannot be improved simultaneously nontargeted designs are not optimal for the task 3 2 trade off between the sailing speed and the overturning resistance crewed sailboats can maintain high performance in various external environments the overturning and recovering moments can be adjusted by modifying the sail configuration manually and through crew weight hiking however there is no available and reliable alternative mechanism for autonomous sailboats eriksson and friebe 2015 sauzé and neal 2008a tretow 2017 hence various external environments must be withstood with a fixed design in certain tasks a lack of environmental adaptability can notably degrade the performance of the platform for example when the wind direction and force conditions are adverse in a position keeping mission the fixed sail configuration may result in additional energy consumption more importantly as mentioned above the small general size severely lowers the overturning resistance of autonomous sailboats thus designers have to reduce the sail area as depicted in fig 14 briere 2008a neal et al 2009 sliwka et al 2009 adopt heavier keels alves and cruz 2008 giger et al 2009 neal 2006 and even design heavy self righting hulls baker et al 2016 domínguez brito et al 2016 to ensure that the platform achieves sufficient overturning resistance in the harshest environments however small sails and excess weight reduce the sailing speed in most situations especially under downwind moderate conditions çakici et al 2012 a reduction in the sailing speed may seriously affect the mission efficiency rapid response capability and regional passability 3 3 design optimization to date only a few works related to design optimization have been reported and most studies are design iterations based on engineering experience or sea trial results lacking corresponding theoretical guidance sauzé and neal 2008a although engineering studies have been carried out to assess durability no systematic studies have been conducted on the failure mechanism force characteristics and structural optimization of the unique and most vulnerable component of autonomous sailboats i e the sail in terms of energy self sufficiency most energy budgets have been determined based on simple estimates which sometimes differ from reality schröder and hertel 2014 additionally the proportion of the functional module energy consumption is notable no comparative conclusion has been proposed regarding the type of main computer and sensors for balancing energy consumption and performance the sailing speed under downwind and moderate conditions conflicts with the overturning resistance under upwind and harsh conditions most existing designs are focused on the latter although few studies have optimized the speed performance based on vpps dhomé 2018 tretow 2017 the best trade off between the sailing speed and overturning resistance has not been determined 4 potential solutions towards more powerful autonomous sailboats with the ever increasing practical applications and related research on autonomous sailboats we expect that over the next decade autonomous sailboats will become a powerful indispensable platform for marine science research and may be the answer to existing problems such as underwater cluster communication and virtual mooring to further enhance the critical performance the three aspects below should be developed 4 1 customized design considering scenarios the general size application scenarios and design purpose of autonomous sailboats are different from those of crewed sailboats certain designs are now free from the simple imitation of crewed sailboats targeted to strengthen the task performance platform autonomous marine systems 2019 sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 submaran 2017 vazquez cuervo et al 2019 in the future autonomous sailboats may be designed as dedicated platforms in consideration of mission scenarios it is challenging to design a most suitable autonomous sailboat for specific mission scenarios because the capability requirements for each specific scenario are complex thus the priorities and trade offs need to be considered appropriately however in table 4 we illustrate the optimal configuration of some meta scenarios a specific task may be a complex combination of several meta scenarios based on the literature and existing designs this proposed configuration is expected to help future designers obtain an appropriate scenario customized design regarding platforms that operate in harsh open seas the platform should be a wide heavy monohull equipped with short masts dual wings and a deep heavy keel this configuration provides a notable overturning resistance and high sail and actuator durability in terms of platforms operating in shallow water the overturning resistance is not the primary design consideration but rather the potential risks of collision and scraping are the prominent considerations therefore these platforms should adopt shallow draft catamaran hulls with short keels strengthened hulls and dual rudders regarding short term highly energy consuming tasks energy harvesting is generally insufficient to maintain energy self sufficiency therefore the design should be based on the capacity of the adopted batteries these platforms should be wide monohulls with high energy density batteries and backup energy regarding long term tasks energy harvesting is the top priority a catamaran type with large solar panel covered decks is preferable also dedicated configurations include medium sized self trimming wings and a self steering system when tasks require downwind performance specialization the platform should be slender and possess a light catamaran hull equipped with larger soft sails in contrast the version with specialized upwind performance should adopt a broader and heavier monohull with higher stability and wing sails and should exhibit a higher lift drag ratio and a smaller dead zone 4 2 adaptive mechanisms for different conditions at present certain autonomous sailboats include mechanisms to offset extreme conditions such as the submaran s retractable wing sails and the datamaran s active self righting system however retracted sails sacrifice all the driving force the active self righting system represents an emergency measure rather than an adaptation to different environments in the future mechanisms from related fields may be applied to autonomous sailboats to enable the platform to adapt to both breezes and gales with minimal loss in the driving force and thereby fundamentally alleviate or even solve the contradiction between the overturning resistance and the sailing speed the mechanism is described below and the pros and cons for autonomous sailboats are listed in table 5 the first promising type of technology involves reefable sails these sails can be dynamically adjusted according to the environment and maximize the driving force while ensuring a suitable overturning resistance junk rigs hasler et al 2004 as depicted in fig 15 a are sails with a long history and their mast independence makes them very suitable for automatic adjustment the transition rig dryden 2004 is a bionic foldable sail fig 15 b a hinged mast allows the sail to modify its geometry according to the wind similar to a bird adjusting its wing shape in green shipping telescoping retractable sails as depicted in fig 15 c are used to assist commercial ship propulsion oceanbird ouchi 2009 retractable sails satisfy energy saving and emission reduction needs while ensuring safety in bad weather and providing trafficability when passing bridges inflatable wing sails fig 16 were designed by the iws company inflated wing sails 2018 the sail area and aerodynamic shape are adjusted by continuously operating interior fans adjustable variant sails represent another mechanism that provides adaptability to changing environments when the magnus sail fig 17 a is driven to rotate pressure differences are formed and a driving force is generated the magnus effect magnus effect wikipedia 2021 by designating the rotation speed ships with magnus sails maintain smaller roll angles in a storm nuttall and kaitu u 2016 sky sails fig 17 b are controlled paragliders and their curvature and shape can be adjusted via bridle lines connected to a controller due to the wind gradient ittc 2011 skysails operating at high altitudes can produce a higher driving force skysails yacht 2021 more importantly the vertical height of the towing point is low so the overturning moment generated can be almost ignored bigi et al 2015 naaijen and koster 2007 sky sails can also be applied to generate power directly but that goes beyond our definition of being directly driven by wind energy for details please refer to costello et al 2015 fritz 2013 the last type of promising technology is stabilizers including the canting keel and passive hydrofoil fig 18 which can provide extra stability according to the external environment canting keels hobbs and manganelli 2007 provide additional stability by swinging windward claughton and oliver 2004 with canting keels sufficient overturning resistance is provided under a lighter ballast which can improve the sailing speed of autonomous sailboats passive hydrofoil is a well performing wing adopted by ocean going yachts official website of the vendée globe 2021 usually in the form of a dali moustache shaped foil chistera foil or dynamic stability system dss foil labi and others 2019 when a sailboat heels the passive hydrofoil becomes submerged and generates lift which provides a recovery moment and slightly lifts the hull the hydrofoil can notably improve the sailing speed and overturning resistance performance under gale conditions aygor and others 2017 official website of the vendée globe 2021 because the generated lift is proportional to the square of the speed however the passive hydrofoil yields an indirect effect by improving the stability supporting a giant sail and therefore improving the sailing speed the design of a hydrofoil with more positive effects than the resultant additional resistance is the core topic 4 3 design optimization under the simulation based framework although the mission requirements and design considerations of autonomous sailboats are different from those of crewed sailboats keuning and sonnenberg 1998 the advanced design method for crewed sailboats is of reference value in the future these design methods will be more widely applied in the design of autonomous sailboats parametric modelling technology bole 1997 hochkirch et al 2002 establishes a one to one mapping between design parameters and 3d models by changing the design parameters the parametric model is easily adjusted with smoothness constraints satisfied parametric modelling technology enables convenient design space exploration of different task requirements working environments and layout constraints moreover it facilitates further research on the influence of design parameters on performance designing a yacht in particular its hull geometry and appendages is a process of creativity skill experience and art harries et al 2001 regarding the task oriented ad hoc design of autonomous sailboats the difficulty of reliably estimating the performance in advance results in the difficulty of establishing the initial design simulation driven design sbd sellgren 1999 can transform the general design of autonomous sailboats into an optimization problem based on a computational fluid dynamics cfd design evaluation in crewed sailboat design the wide light project prince and claughton 2016 has demonstrated that commercial cfd software can capture the typical effect of design parameters on the performance without requiring an excessive grid density although the sbd technique may not completely replace an experienced designer the approach provides a sufficiently good design and design evaluation methods without expensive model tests considering ad hoc design tasks optimization studies focused on autonomous sailboats dhomé 2018 tretow 2017 often regard speed as the only optimization objective in the future the multidisciplinary design optimization mdo method may be introduced to consider multiple critical performances simultaneously thus the coupling between design parameters and capabilities can be fully considered to obtain an optimal design given specified requirements and scenarios however in the above framework prioritizing as few design parameters as possible to simplify the parametric model balancing the accuracy and computational complexity and selecting multidisciplinary criteria to reasonably capture the coupling relationship among capacities constitute high priority research topics 5 conclusions after 20 years of development autonomous sailboats have become a powerful tool for marine science from the concept platform in the laboratory this paper provides a comprehensive summary of existing designs from the perspective of performance discusses fruitful advances in enhancing the structural durability energy self sufficiency overturning resistance and sailing speed and provides insights regarding the design logic according to the statistics and analysis of the existing designs this paper reveals three aspects that constrain further performance improvements inadequate consideration is given to task scenarios trade offs between the sailing speed and the overturning resistance are insufficiently addressed and the design and optimization framework is still far from complete regarding the future of these platforms the authors introduced technologies in related fields that can be used as potential solutions by adopting a scenario specific design adaptive mechanisms for different conditions and simulation based optimization breakthrough improvements in the performance of autonomous sailboats will be made and these platforms will play a more critical role in marine science activities credit authorship contribution statement yang an conceptualization writing original draft investigation and visualization jiancheng yu

20195,autonomous sailboats are promising platforms for long term marine science missions and have become a research area of increased interest over the last two decades to date dozens of distinctive autonomous sailboats have been designed and notably employed in numerous tasks some literature lists and reviews the various designs of the existing autonomous sailboats however no comprehensive work connects the design to the performance requirements of various application scenarios this paper first reviews and summarizes the existing designs from the perspective of critical performance in marine science missions further pointing out the present state and the logic behind the designs we then identify factors that hinder further performance improvement of autonomous sailboats through statistics and analysis of existing designs we finally describe how the autonomous sailboat community should best address these challenges with technology from other disciplines this article can provide references for designers of autonomous sailboats and inspire the community to eliminate the limitations they are facing additionally making autonomous sailboats more powerful platforms can facilitate marine science research such as research on ecosystems biogeochemistry and meteorology keywords autonomous sailboat design robotics 1 introduction in recent years the related research on marine ecosystems biogeochemistry and meteorology has been extended to the open sea which has increased the urgent demand of the scientific community for long term surface data acquisition platforms hotaling and kocak 2014 stammer et al 2016 visbeck 2018 directly driven by abundant wind energy autonomous sailboats are endowed with good endurance cokelet et al 2015 de robertis et al 2019 stelzer and jafarmadar 2011 in addition to their low cost miller et al 2015a 2015b low noise silva et al 2013 and moderate transition capacity cruz and alves 2008a b autonomous sailboats are promising platforms chai et al 2020 cruz and alves 2008a b rynne and von ellenrieder 2009 and significant relevant progress has been attained over the past 20 years abril et al 1997 elkaim 2001 designing an autonomous sailboat with good performance requires sufficient insights first different tasks have different performance requirement weights long distance transfer tasks require better endurance while tracking tasks may pay more attention to sailing speed for platforms that work in harsh seas survivability is the primary performance second the sea is harsh and changeable operation platforms must withstand most environmental conditions therefore performance conflicts arise the choice of trade off requires sufficient experience and wisdom moreover as autonomous sailboats are strongly affected by the environment the process of comparing and evaluating different designs is complicated at present designers from academic organizations to commercial companies have developed dozens of distinctive autonomous sailboats which play essential roles in multitudinous tasks such as ocean floor mapping saildrone surveyor marine biological surveys klinck et al 2009 mordy et al 2017 long term ocean observations cokelet et al 2015 cross et al 2015 ghani et al 2014 meinig et al 2015 sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 and water mass tracking kilpin 2014 rathour 2016 the literature describes works on performance improvement of autonomous sailboats including structural durability domínguez brito et al 2016 sauze et al 2006 sauzé and neal 2011a energy self sufficiency alvira and barton 2013 baker et al 2016 bruget et al 2014 dahl et al 2015 lavigne et al 2016 overturning resistance alves and cruz 2008 giger et al 2009 neal 2006 sailing speed dhomé 2018 tretow 2017 etc currently autonomous sailboats can sail for dozens or even hundreds of days cokelet et al 2015 cross et al 2015 de robertis et al 2019 meinig et al 2015 vazquez cuervo et al 2019 or complete feats such as crossing the atlantic sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 and circumnavigating antarctica stein 2019 although some of the literature silva et al 2019 stelzer and jafarmadar 2011 listed and reviewed existing autonomous sailboat designs no related work has been performed from the perspective of performance therefore this paper first reviews and summarizes the existing designs from the perspective of critical performance in marine science missions aiming to connect the design to performance requirements and clarify the logic behind these designs then through the analysis of the methods adopted by the designer to meet performance requirements design and statistical analysis we reveal the cause of the bottleneck in the performance improvement of the current autonomous sailboat designs in response to these factors we finally introduce technologies in related fields that can be used as potential solutions this paper provides comprehensive references in terms of design considerations and parameters it is important to note that the field of autonomous sailboat design is still far from mature and potential technologies are introduced in this paper thus we aim to inspire designers and thus enable autonomous sailboats to become more powerful tools for marine science research in this paper existing designs are reviewed in section 2 considering the following four essential characteristics structural durability energy self sufficiency overturning resistance and sailing speed the factors limiting further performance improvements of autonomous sailboats are summarized in section 3 section 4 describes the future development direction prospects of autonomous sailboat design in section 5 conclusions are presented 2 present state review of the designs from the perspective of performance performance is usually both the starting point and goal of design reviewing existing designs from the perspective of performance can be helpful when comparing different designs analysing the design ideas behind them and revealing core design issues the unique feature of autonomous sailboats compared with other platforms is that they are driven by sails therefore autonomous sailboats are structural fragile energy saving easy to capsize and their speed is easily affected therefore we review and analyse existing designs from four performance aspects structural durability energy self sufficiency overturning resistance and sailing speed 2 1 structural durability structural durability is the capability of a component to withstand the loads encountered in service over a specified period of use without failure or unacceptable degradation considering that autonomous sailboats often work in extremely harsh environments for example wind speeds of 46 knots cokelet et al 2015 and wave heights of 14 3 m sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 structural durability is assigned the highest design priority alves and cruz 2014 cruz and alves 2008a b m aasala and others 2018 naveau et al 2013 sauze et al 2006 table 1 presents the failure cases attributed to insufficient structural durability reported in the application related literature klinck et al 2016 meinig et al 2015 and on the microtransat challenge website microtransat history 2020 a transatlantic race for autonomous boats the most vulnerable component of an autonomous sailboat is its sail the hull keel and rudder are also at risk of failure the cause of damage to the sail and its actuator is usually impact caused by high energy wind and waves fatigue and artificial damage caused by passing ships the following two scenarios are very threatening for the hull keel and rudder driven into nearshore areas by superimposed winds and currents and encountering passing ships or fishing operations both may cause severe entanglement and collision to enhance the structural durability of the vessels traditional soft sails sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 voosen 2018 have increasingly been replaced with vertical airfoils i e wing sails the traditional soft sail with thousands of years of history is suitable for long distance sailing with crews neal et al 2009 stelzer and jafarmadar 2011 however prone to wear soft sails miller et al 2015b neal et al 2009 rynne 2008 and prone to entanglement riggings sauze et al 2006 are not suitable for automatic systems without maintenance in contrast wing sails are more reliable due to their solid profiles elkaim 2001 and embedded actuators enqvist et al 2016 hansen 1996 p 1 neal et al 2009 moreover in contrast to soft sails which have an air performance that severely degenerates after damage wing sails usually do not fail tretow 2017 as depicted in fig 1 a detailed information on platforms equipped with wing sails has been provided by silva et al 2019 another way to improve sail durability is to increase redundancy via the adoption of dual wing sails as depicted in fig 1 b platforms equipped with dual sails include the arc sauze et al 2006 moop3 sauzé and neal 2011a a tirma g2 domínguez brito et al 2016 and the shanghai jiao tong university sjtu prototypes du et al 2018 in addition to the realization of durability redundancy dual sails can greatly reduce the overturning moment and act as air rudders domínguez brito et al 2016 neal et al 2009 to enhance the manoeuvrability of autonomous sailboats sail actuators have been designed so that the actuator can be locked without the need to continuously maintain the position miller et al 2013 as another technical route the sailbuoy adopts a free rotating wing sail with a caging device sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 as shown in fig 1 c although the sail cannot be precisely controlled it provides sufficient durability with this configuration sailbuoy became the first autonomous sailboat ever to complete a transatlantic voyage similarly autonomous sailboats such as atlantis elkaim 2001 2006 saildrone cokelet et al 2015 meinig et al 2015 aspire friebe 2019 friebe et al 2017 m aasala and others 2018 and maribot vane tretow 2017 adopt free rotating self trimming wings to effectively reduce the load acting on the actuators however the reduction in energy consumption is more pronounced and therefore self trimming wings are described in section 2 2 regarding hull manufacture glass fibre and carbon fibre materials which exhibit good resistance to corrosion and collisions are commonly applied certain designs incorporate additional hull reinforcement and protection measures to minimize the damage caused by collisions and scratching the bow and stern which are prone to collision can be wrapped in polyurethane foam neal 2006 watertight bulkheads leloup et al 2011 waterproof boxes or tubes elkaim 2001 leloup et al 2011 sliwka et al 2009 and styrene foam plastic fillers are used in snoopy and breizh tigresse endeavour ec crossing brave puffin and opentransat to improve the sink resistance and provide electronic equipment protection boat details team joker 2014 stenersen 2016 fig 2 a shows the hull of breizh spirit 3 as a typical case of hull enhancement regarding the rudders atlantis elkaim 2001 arc sauze et al 2006 fast alves and cruz 2008 iboat briere 2008a avalon giger et al 2009 and a tirma g2 domínguez brito et al 2016 include twin rudders as depicted in fig 2 b which can increase the durability redundancy and ensure manoeuvrability under severe heeling giger et al 2009 sauze et al 2006 sliwka et al 2009 2 2 energy self sufficiency almost all platforms are powered by electricity for convenience navigation via the assimilation of abundant wind by sails rather than the transformation of stored energy by the main engine makes autonomous sailboats advantageous in terms of endurance smith 1989 however power is required for frequent adjustments of the sails and rudders sampling of scientific payloads adornato et al 2009 drifters 2003 and transmission of data and commands hotaling and kocak 2014 most platform acquisition energy supplements mainly rely on solar panels which are vulnerable to cloudy weather conditions high latitudes and salt spray fouling augenstein et al 2017 briere 2008a sauzé and neal 2011b although designers have adopted measures friebe et al 2017 guo et al 2011 jaulin and le bars 2014 miller et al 2014 naveau et al 2013 to improve energy harvesting ensuring energy self sufficiency for continuous scientific work remains challenging the gap between energy harvesting and energy consumption may require high capacity batteries sauzé and neal 2008a 2011b and backup fuel cells giger et al 2009 klinck et al 2009 and may lead to a decrease in task performance or endurance júnior et al 2013 ulysse et al 2019 according to statistics 1 m2 marine solar panels can produce approximately 10 35 w on average when considering the alternation of day and night and the probability of inadequate sun coverage rynne and von ellenrieder 2009 which is approximately 1 6 1 3 of the ideal state augenstein et al 2017 briere 2008a sauzé and neal 2011b to improve energy harvesting the maximum number of solar panels is deployed on sails and decks fig 3 moreover the aspire friebe et al 2017 adopted innovative solar panels to track the direction of the sun by adjusting the azimuth angle fig 4 it has been reported that the annual energy output can be increased by 50 compared to horizontally installed panels specific platforms adopt vertical axis wind turbines to obtain additional energy especially at night guo et al 2011 miller et al 2014 naveau et al 2013 jaulin and le bars 2014 proposed a unique energy harvesting method the main idea involved the application of a station keeping mode platform as a windmill pulling with swinging sails as reported this approach generates 93 w of electrical energy on average at a wind speed of 4 m s excluding the scientific payloads which are usually different the energy consumption of autonomous sailboats mainly includes three parts the functional module comprises the main computer sensors and communication system the driving module is the sail actuator and the steering module is the rudder actuator the energy consumption of the functional module is related to the hardware selection and the operational frequency instead of the general size of the platform as shown in fig 5 functional modules account for 5 86 of the total consumption of certain platforms to reduce energy consumption designers have adopted various management strategies linking operation decisions to the remaining power dahl et al 2015 sauzé and neal 2008b 2011b or frequency reduction alves et al 2008 baker et al 2016 eriksson and friebe 2015 sauzé and neal 2011b of the main computer in a low battery or idle state the driving module accounts for 13 86 of the total consumption certain autonomous sailboats use balanced rigs as depicted in fig 6 to reduce the high energy consumption of traditional soft sails under high loads ménage et al 2014 the headsail and mainsail of the balanced rig are positioned on the same beam instead of on separate beams this configuration brings the centre of effect closer to the mast with a shorter arm which produces a more balanced wind load distribution effectively reducing the energy consumption of the sail actuator and improving the sail durability it has been reported that the load on the sail actuator can be reduced by more than 50 giger et al 2009 the energy consumption can be reduced by two thirds stelzer and dalmau 2013 and the impact on aerodynamic performance can be ignored stelzer and dalmau 2013 wing sails are generally heavy and sensitive to the attack angle enqvist et al 2016 2017 kilpin 2014 the frequent and precise control of wing sails is a highly energy consuming task as an improvement self trimming wings have been developed the self trimming wing was first proposed in 1983 newman and fekete 1983 and was first applied to the autonomous sailboat atlantis in 2001 elkaim 2001 compared to a wing sail directly driven by the actuator a self trimming wing can rotate freely and is controlled by another smaller surface that is usually mounted behind it namely the tail fig 7 similar to a wind vane the controlled tail applies the wind power to adjust the main wing to the desired angle elkaim 2008 elkaim and boyce jr 2007 on the one hand elkaim 2008 enqvist et al 2016 and tretow 2017 noted that the self adjusting system simplifies the complexity of the control system and dramatically reduces the energy consumption associated with the adjustment and position keeping of the main wing on the other hand the tail provides passive stability when the wind direction changes slightly the self trimming sail can absorb gusts and automatically maintain a fixed angle of attack also a fixed lift coefficient this feature decouples the propulsion system from the navigation control system to a certain extent effectively downgrading the control frequency and further reducing energy consumption augenstein et al 2017 dhomé 2018 in regard to the steering module self steering systems as depicted in fig 8 have been implemented to save energy the history of the self steering system is much longer than that of autonomous sailboats since at least the 1920s crewed sailboats have adopted self steering systems alves and cruz 2008 letcher and others 1976 stelzer et al 2007 currently it remains in use for long distance sailing voyages to reduce the operational burden on sailors similar to the self trimming sail the main concept of the self steering system is to link the rudder to the wind vane mechanically when the wind direction changes slightly the rudder is automatically adjusted without energy consumption application to autonomous sailboats was first reported in 2011 on the l improbable of the ensta bretagne robot team sliwka et al 2011 the system was mounted on the bow to avoid any gears between the rudder and vane in another case the maribot vane tretow 2017 adopted both a self steering system and a self trimming wing since the main wing turns with the wind an additional wind vane was not included and the main wing was directly connected to the rudder through a clutch tests revealed that this configuration can automatically maintain the heading dhomé 2018 ulysse et al 2019 in the automatic mode while switching to the active servo controlled mode when needed 2 3 overturning resistance in the naval architecture field the term stability usually describes the ability of a ship the hull itself to float in the upright position and if inclined under the action of an external force to return to this position after the external force has ceased however the severity of the environment withstood by an autonomous sailboat is related to not only the hull but also the overturning moment producing sail therefore we consider the overturning resistance to describe the ability of autonomous sailboats to resist external disturbances before addressing the overturning resistance it should first be noted that designers tend to limit the general size length and displacement to a specific range as depicted in fig 9 the reasons include consideration of the manufacturing cost deployment facilities transportation convenience and regulatory restrictions anthierens et al 2014 fernandes et al 2016 neal 2006 tretow 2017 where the last reason is the most important whether autonomous sailboats belong to the vessel category or a particular buoy is a controversial issue alves and cruz 2015 briere 2008a eriksson and friebe 2015 however autonomous sailboats undoubtedly pose a collision risk to passing ships anthierens et al 2014 eliasson et al 2014 and holzgrafe 2014 revealed that when scaling a design both the recovery moment and the overturning moment decrease as the scale decreases however the rate of decrease in the recovery moment is higher in other words autonomous sailboats which are usually small require a relatively higher overturning resistance however no universally recognized standard applies for overturning resistance in practice designers have specified wind speed thresholds to ensure that the platform achieves sufficient resistance to overturning e g avalon giger et al 2009 was designed to withstand a wind speed of 50 knots and 9 m high waves near the irish coast other suitable configurations have been proposed by adjusting the design based on sea trial results or engineering experience sauzé and neal 2008a designers have improved the overturning resistance by enhancing the restoring ability produced by the hull and keel most designs adopt monohulls friebe et al 2017 rynne and von ellenrieder 2009 instead of multihulls although the stability of monohulls is not as high as that of multihulls eliasson et al 2014 miller et al 2013 their low inverted stability provides the opportunity for righting with an external disturbance after capsizing rynne and von ellenrieder 2009 as special cases a doghouse is placed on the deck to help the sailboat to turn back in case of it rolled over naveau et al 2013 active self righting system has been designed for the datamaran fig 10 which uprights the platform and relies on a swingable sail platform autonomous marine systems 2019 furthermore designers often choose crewed sailboats with a good stability as the starting point of design fig 11 a for example klinck et al 2009 considered the laerling boat type which is a dinghy designed for young beginners while ulysse et al 2019 considered a paralympic design in addition because there is no limitation on roll acceleration based on crew comfort in autonomous sailboat design cruz and alves 2008a b domínguez brito et al 2016 sliwka et al 2011 designers have adopted longer and heavier keels to effectively lower the centre of gravity alves and cruz 2008 giger et al 2009 neal 2006 in some instances extremely long or heavy or both keels as depicted in fig 11 b provide a self righting capability the hull can generate a restoring moment at any heel angle baker et al 2016 domínguez brito et al 2016 rynne and ellenrieder 2010 another commonly employed method is reducing the overturning moment sail area reduction is a direct and effective method briere 2008a adopted a 1 5 m2 sail area instead of the customary 4 m2 sail area in the design of beagle b the sail area was reduced by 40 neal et al 2009 sliwka et al 2009 also reduced the sail area based on international monohull open class association imoca design standards in addition lower sails stein 2019 or dual sails domínguez brito et al 2016 du et al 2018 sauze et al 2006 sauzé and neal 2011a have been adopted to lower the aerodynamic centre of the sail due to the wind gradient ittc 2011 a lower aerodynamic centre can notably reduce the overturning moment sailvane cusail fleet uses a stubby wingsail as a special case submaran s10 fig 11 c has a retractable wing sail submaran 2017 under extreme conditions the sails are brought down and the platform is submerged and driven by propellers 2 4 sailing speed we use the term sailing speed to describe the speed performance of autonomous sailboats under various wind directions and speeds although autonomous sailboats are known for their long endurance the sailing speed remains a vital feature compared to the notable efficiency improving effect in area coverage the sailing speed greatly facilitates the task of disaster monitoring and water mass tracking rathour 2016 pointed out that in the application of oil spill detection the platform should be faster than 3 of the wind speed at 10 m above the sea surface which is the drift speed of spilled oil furthermore the sailing speed is the decisive factor in autonomous sailboat passability platforms with a poor sailing speed are more likely to be captured by strong currents with the vessel eventually being stranded and damaged as indicated in table 1 microtransat history 2020 in addition platforms with slow sailing speeds may have to abandon closer routes to avoid being affected by strong ocean circulation currents which may severely limit the efficiency of a mission evaluating the sailing speed of a specific design remains a challenging task first the sailing speed cannot be characterized by a single value such as the average speed which has been widely considered in the literature the speed of an autonomous sailboat is closely related to the wind direction and speed so the average speed without specified conditions is meaningless second the sailing speed is impossible to evaluate based on the subsystem hull keel and sails without the other parts designed guelfi and canepa 2013 for example a platform with a narrower hull exhibits a lower resistance but a weaker overturning resistance designers should adopt a smaller sail to ensure a sufficient overturning resistance thus limiting the driving force generation therefore we introduce certain dimensionless numbers that reflect a specific performance aspect to review the existing designs comprehensively and qualitatively table 2 the first two dimensionless numbers introduced are the length displacement ratio ldr and length breadth ratio l b eliasson et al 2014 generally longer slenderer and lighter hulls exhibit higher speed potential the sail area displacement ratio sa d sponberg 2011 describes the power load ratio of the platform similar to the power to weight ratio of a vehicle considering only power conditions we apply sa d to both soft and wing sails since rynne and von ellenrieder 2008 noted that the typical lift coefficients of wing and soft sails are very similar finally we introduce the ballast to displacement ratio b d which is the percentage of ballast in the total weight to describe autonomous sailboats usually by the keel weight displacement ratio a high ballast ratio lowers the speed potential but enhances the overturning resistance since the mass stability is usually the primary source of the overturning resistance the statistics shown in fig 12 indicate that designers tend to adopt stubby hulls catamaran numbers are excluded with low ldr values most sa d values are lower than 15 corresponding to crewed slow auxiliary sailboats sponberg 2011 the distribution of b d is considerably dispersed reflecting that designers do not agree on this parameter research on the sailing speed is limited and mainly focused on evaluating and systematically optimizing the sailing speed velocity prediction programs vpps are reliable tools to predict the speed of a particular design under given external conditions wind speed and direction de jong et al 2008 graf and bohm 2005 kerwin 1978 orc vpp designer s version 2020 as depicted in fig 13 the output is usually provided in the form of a polar graph which can be used as a reference for control strategy formulation and design optimization briere 2008b proposed a four degree of freedom dof model to guide control law formulation rynne and von ellenrieder 2010 implemented an xfoil based vpp to optimize the design of the self trimming wing sails of the maribot vane miller et al 2018 compared the performance of viking style wing sails and traditional soft sails through pcsail a vpp developed by martin and beck 2001 however an et al unpublished results noted that existing vpps typically rely on empirical equation based modelling and gradient based solvers that are unsuitable for the design of autonomous sailboats thus they developed an optimization based generalized vpp by using vpp to optimize the sailing speed miller et al 2013 adopted a full scale tank test to optimize the shape and weight of the keel and bulb resulting in a speed increase of 15 dhomé 2018 and tretow 2017 adopted the vortex lattice method to model the self trimming wing and employed a customized matlab based vpp as an evaluator to select reasonable design parameters for the self trimming wing 3 discussion and analysis factors hindering further performance improvement over the past two decades autonomous sailboats have become effective platforms in multiple marine science missions due to continuous progress with an appropriate design proper control and no unexpected events disturbance by a passing ship damage from a serious collision extreme bad weather etc autonomous sailboats can sail for dozens or even hundreds of days cokelet et al 2015 cross et al 2015 de robertis et al 2019 meinig et al 2015 vazquez cuervo et al 2019 also complete feats such as crossing the atlantic sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 and circumnavigating antarctica stein 2019 however there are still issues that hinder and restrict the further improvement of the critical performance mainly due to the insufficient consideration of the coupling among these capacities in the current designs we now propose a list of emerging challenges that designers should overcome the list is not intended to be exhaustive but is intended to provide a basis for debate 3 1 design customization in general most existing designs have been modified based on reference designs typically remote control rc models 3 m cabrera gámez et al 2014 neal 2006 tranzatto et al 2015 dinghies 3 5 m anthierens et al 2014 ménage et al 2014 and yachts 5 m rynne and ellenrieder 2010 sauze et al 2006 as detailed in table 3 reference based designs are a good starting point but they introduce inappropriate design considerations the rc model is usually considered under racing conditions in calmer water so it provides a poor overturning resistance in addition slender hulls may handicap the arrangement of scientific loads in dinghy design the weight of the crew is accounted for in the overturning resistance so a lighter keel or even a dagger board is often adopted which is unsuitable for sea going autonomous sailboats ocean going yachts exhibit a good overturning resistance but the simple imitation of reference designs introduces unnecessary constraints for example the consideration of crew comfort cruz and alves 2008a b domínguez brito et al 2016 sliwka et al 2011 the flooding angle izaguirre alza et al 2008 the port depth and the class rule ensure the fairness of competitions although the continuous progress has let to improvements in the critical performance these improvements are not targeted enough designers tend to develop a comprehensive platform rather than a task based platform however different tasks are associated with their own capacity requirements as noted by hotaling and kocak 2014 ecosystem researchers are more concerned with the continuity of monitoring density and frequency of sampling which requires the platform to achieve better energy self sufficiency in contrast hazard observing missions require a fast response and a greater overturning resistance when capacities cannot be improved simultaneously nontargeted designs are not optimal for the task 3 2 trade off between the sailing speed and the overturning resistance crewed sailboats can maintain high performance in various external environments the overturning and recovering moments can be adjusted by modifying the sail configuration manually and through crew weight hiking however there is no available and reliable alternative mechanism for autonomous sailboats eriksson and friebe 2015 sauzé and neal 2008a tretow 2017 hence various external environments must be withstood with a fixed design in certain tasks a lack of environmental adaptability can notably degrade the performance of the platform for example when the wind direction and force conditions are adverse in a position keeping mission the fixed sail configuration may result in additional energy consumption more importantly as mentioned above the small general size severely lowers the overturning resistance of autonomous sailboats thus designers have to reduce the sail area as depicted in fig 14 briere 2008a neal et al 2009 sliwka et al 2009 adopt heavier keels alves and cruz 2008 giger et al 2009 neal 2006 and even design heavy self righting hulls baker et al 2016 domínguez brito et al 2016 to ensure that the platform achieves sufficient overturning resistance in the harshest environments however small sails and excess weight reduce the sailing speed in most situations especially under downwind moderate conditions çakici et al 2012 a reduction in the sailing speed may seriously affect the mission efficiency rapid response capability and regional passability 3 3 design optimization to date only a few works related to design optimization have been reported and most studies are design iterations based on engineering experience or sea trial results lacking corresponding theoretical guidance sauzé and neal 2008a although engineering studies have been carried out to assess durability no systematic studies have been conducted on the failure mechanism force characteristics and structural optimization of the unique and most vulnerable component of autonomous sailboats i e the sail in terms of energy self sufficiency most energy budgets have been determined based on simple estimates which sometimes differ from reality schröder and hertel 2014 additionally the proportion of the functional module energy consumption is notable no comparative conclusion has been proposed regarding the type of main computer and sensors for balancing energy consumption and performance the sailing speed under downwind and moderate conditions conflicts with the overturning resistance under upwind and harsh conditions most existing designs are focused on the latter although few studies have optimized the speed performance based on vpps dhomé 2018 tretow 2017 the best trade off between the sailing speed and overturning resistance has not been determined 4 potential solutions towards more powerful autonomous sailboats with the ever increasing practical applications and related research on autonomous sailboats we expect that over the next decade autonomous sailboats will become a powerful indispensable platform for marine science research and may be the answer to existing problems such as underwater cluster communication and virtual mooring to further enhance the critical performance the three aspects below should be developed 4 1 customized design considering scenarios the general size application scenarios and design purpose of autonomous sailboats are different from those of crewed sailboats certain designs are now free from the simple imitation of crewed sailboats targeted to strengthen the task performance platform autonomous marine systems 2019 sailbuoy unmanned surface vessel 2020 submaran 2017 vazquez cuervo et al 2019 in the future autonomous sailboats may be designed as dedicated platforms in consideration of mission scenarios it is challenging to design a most suitable autonomous sailboat for specific mission scenarios because the capability requirements for each specific scenario are complex thus the priorities and trade offs need to be considered appropriately however in table 4 we illustrate the optimal configuration of some meta scenarios a specific task may be a complex combination of several meta scenarios based on the literature and existing designs this proposed configuration is expected to help future designers obtain an appropriate scenario customized design regarding platforms that operate in harsh open seas the platform should be a wide heavy monohull equipped with short masts dual wings and a deep heavy keel this configuration provides a notable overturning resistance and high sail and actuator durability in terms of platforms operating in shallow water the overturning resistance is not the primary design consideration but rather the potential risks of collision and scraping are the prominent considerations therefore these platforms should adopt shallow draft catamaran hulls with short keels strengthened hulls and dual rudders regarding short term highly energy consuming tasks energy harvesting is generally insufficient to maintain energy self sufficiency therefore the design should be based on the capacity of the adopted batteries these platforms should be wide monohulls with high energy density batteries and backup energy regarding long term tasks energy harvesting is the top priority a catamaran type with large solar panel covered decks is preferable also dedicated configurations include medium sized self trimming wings and a self steering system when tasks require downwind performance specialization the platform should be slender and possess a light catamaran hull equipped with larger soft sails in contrast the version with specialized upwind performance should adopt a broader and heavier monohull with higher stability and wing sails and should exhibit a higher lift drag ratio and a smaller dead zone 4 2 adaptive mechanisms for different conditions at present certain autonomous sailboats include mechanisms to offset extreme conditions such as the submaran s retractable wing sails and the datamaran s active self righting system however retracted sails sacrifice all the driving force the active self righting system represents an emergency measure rather than an adaptation to different environments in the future mechanisms from related fields may be applied to autonomous sailboats to enable the platform to adapt to both breezes and gales with minimal loss in the driving force and thereby fundamentally alleviate or even solve the contradiction between the overturning resistance and the sailing speed the mechanism is described below and the pros and cons for autonomous sailboats are listed in table 5 the first promising type of technology involves reefable sails these sails can be dynamically adjusted according to the environment and maximize the driving force while ensuring a suitable overturning resistance junk rigs hasler et al 2004 as depicted in fig 15 a are sails with a long history and their mast independence makes them very suitable for automatic adjustment the transition rig dryden 2004 is a bionic foldable sail fig 15 b a hinged mast allows the sail to modify its geometry according to the wind similar to a bird adjusting its wing shape in green shipping telescoping retractable sails as depicted in fig 15 c are used to assist commercial ship propulsion oceanbird ouchi 2009 retractable sails satisfy energy saving and emission reduction needs while ensuring safety in bad weather and providing trafficability when passing bridges inflatable wing sails fig 16 were designed by the iws company inflated wing sails 2018 the sail area and aerodynamic shape are adjusted by continuously operating interior fans adjustable variant sails represent another mechanism that provides adaptability to changing environments when the magnus sail fig 17 a is driven to rotate pressure differences are formed and a driving force is generated the magnus effect magnus effect wikipedia 2021 by designating the rotation speed ships with magnus sails maintain smaller roll angles in a storm nuttall and kaitu u 2016 sky sails fig 17 b are controlled paragliders and their curvature and shape can be adjusted via bridle lines connected to a controller due to the wind gradient ittc 2011 skysails operating at high altitudes can produce a higher driving force skysails yacht 2021 more importantly the vertical height of the towing point is low so the overturning moment generated can be almost ignored bigi et al 2015 naaijen and koster 2007 sky sails can also be applied to generate power directly but that goes beyond our definition of being directly driven by wind energy for details please refer to costello et al 2015 fritz 2013 the last type of promising technology is stabilizers including the canting keel and passive hydrofoil fig 18 which can provide extra stability according to the external environment canting keels hobbs and manganelli 2007 provide additional stability by swinging windward claughton and oliver 2004 with canting keels sufficient overturning resistance is provided under a lighter ballast which can improve the sailing speed of autonomous sailboats passive hydrofoil is a well performing wing adopted by ocean going yachts official website of the vendée globe 2021 usually in the form of a dali moustache shaped foil chistera foil or dynamic stability system dss foil labi and others 2019 when a sailboat heels the passive hydrofoil becomes submerged and generates lift which provides a recovery moment and slightly lifts the hull the hydrofoil can notably improve the sailing speed and overturning resistance performance under gale conditions aygor and others 2017 official website of the vendée globe 2021 because the generated lift is proportional to the square of the speed however the passive hydrofoil yields an indirect effect by improving the stability supporting a giant sail and therefore improving the sailing speed the design of a hydrofoil with more positive effects than the resultant additional resistance is the core topic 4 3 design optimization under the simulation based framework although the mission requirements and design considerations of autonomous sailboats are different from those of crewed sailboats keuning and sonnenberg 1998 the advanced design method for crewed sailboats is of reference value in the future these design methods will be more widely applied in the design of autonomous sailboats parametric modelling technology bole 1997 hochkirch et al 2002 establishes a one to one mapping between design parameters and 3d models by changing the design parameters the parametric model is easily adjusted with smoothness constraints satisfied parametric modelling technology enables convenient design space exploration of different task requirements working environments and layout constraints moreover it facilitates further research on the influence of design parameters on performance designing a yacht in particular its hull geometry and appendages is a process of creativity skill experience and art harries et al 2001 regarding the task oriented ad hoc design of autonomous sailboats the difficulty of reliably estimating the performance in advance results in the difficulty of establishing the initial design simulation driven design sbd sellgren 1999 can transform the general design of autonomous sailboats into an optimization problem based on a computational fluid dynamics cfd design evaluation in crewed sailboat design the wide light project prince and claughton 2016 has demonstrated that commercial cfd software can capture the typical effect of design parameters on the performance without requiring an excessive grid density although the sbd technique may not completely replace an experienced designer the approach provides a sufficiently good design and design evaluation methods without expensive model tests considering ad hoc design tasks optimization studies focused on autonomous sailboats dhomé 2018 tretow 2017 often regard speed as the only optimization objective in the future the multidisciplinary design optimization mdo method may be introduced to consider multiple critical performances simultaneously thus the coupling between design parameters and capabilities can be fully considered to obtain an optimal design given specified requirements and scenarios however in the above framework prioritizing as few design parameters as possible to simplify the parametric model balancing the accuracy and computational complexity and selecting multidisciplinary criteria to reasonably capture the coupling relationship among capacities constitute high priority research topics 5 conclusions after 20 years of development autonomous sailboats have become a powerful tool for marine science from the concept platform in the laboratory this paper provides a comprehensive summary of existing designs from the perspective of performance discusses fruitful advances in enhancing the structural durability energy self sufficiency overturning resistance and sailing speed and provides insights regarding the design logic according to the statistics and analysis of the existing designs this paper reveals three aspects that constrain further performance improvements inadequate consideration is given to task scenarios trade offs between the sailing speed and the overturning resistance are insufficiently addressed and the design and optimization framework is still far from complete regarding the future of these platforms the authors introduced technologies in related fields that can be used as potential solutions by adopting a scenario specific design adaptive mechanisms for different conditions and simulation based optimization breakthrough improvements in the performance of autonomous sailboats will be made and these platforms will play a more critical role in marine science activities credit authorship contribution statement yang an conceptualization writing original draft investigation and visualization jiancheng yu

aria abedi maryam kamran school of mechanical engineering iran university of science and technology tehran iran school of mechanical engineering iran university of science and technology tehran iran department of mechanical engineering iran university of science and technology tehran iran corresponding author surface piercing propeller spp is a type of super cavitating propellers which with ventilation on the blades have suitable performance at water air interface these propellers provide perfect ventilation behind the blade which effectively controls cavitation aeriation and improves trust performance at operational condition even if at high speeds the spps have higher efficiency compared to the conventional propellers and water jets the main challenge is their lower efficiency than other propulsion systems at a lower speed which can affects the starting phase of high speed crafts in fact there is a lack of research in studies on these propellers which concern the improvement of their performance at low speed in the present studies an aeration mechanism is investigated so that air is injected upstream in order to improve performance of the propeller the design of the experiment doe is carried out on a spp model to perform performance tests in open water conditions using the spp flow loop mechanism at hydrotech institute of applied hydrodynamics and marine technologies iran university of science and technology the effects of the horizontal distances α and vertical distances β between the ventilation point and the location of the propeller are presented in the form of non dimensional ventilation immersion ratios β α for different propeller immersion ratios ventilation immersion ratios and advance coefficients the thrust coefficient for different cases was measured and compared to unventilated conditions the achievements of the present research are different performance curves about thrust coefficient which illustrate a good correlation between propeller performance and aeration at different propeller immersion ratios the maximum thrust coefficient improvement is around 100 which can achieve at i 0 25 β α 0 05 and j 0 4 as propeller immersion ratio i increases region with improved performance shifts towards higher values of advance coefficient j keywords surface piercing propellers spp low advance coefficient ventilation mechanism 1 introduction the surface piercing propeller spp is a special type of super cavitating propeller which nowadays these propulsion systems show wide applications in different lightweight vessels these propellers operate simultaneously in water and in air during a revolution in general for about a third of the operating time the blades are completely in the air for a third of the time they work completely submerged and for the remaining time they are partially in the air and partially submerged there is less restriction for the size of the propeller and the mechanism of the appendages and also good performance with regard to cavitation which on the one hand leads to an increase in efficiency and a decrease in fuel consumption and on the other hand makes this propulsion system suitable for high speed applications in the most significant experimental research carried out to study the performance of spp one could cite the experiments of shiba 1953 hadler hadler and hecker 1968 hecker 1973 rainz rains 1981 rose and kruppa 1991 kruppa 1992 and rose et al 1993 these researches focused on the study of thrust torque bending moment and lateral forces due to the propeller operation in these studies the effects of the depth of immersion the number of blades the pitch ratio the rake the geometry of the blade section as well as the yaw angles and the trim of the shaft propeller have been investigated in addition to the studies mentioned above important experimental research includes that of olofsson 1996 miller and szantyr 1998 dyson et al dyson 2000 and peterson 2005 these studies provide more information to determine the dynamic characteristic and performance of spps these recent experiments aimed to study the unsteady hydrodynamic loadings and the stresses in the blades and the propeller shaft as well as the structure under laboratory conditions olofsson 1996 studied the characterizations of flow and force in surface piercing propellers their experimental modellings were performed to determine the dynamics and steady performance of an spp at high speed conditions the objectives of these tests were to evaluate the effects of the yaw and trim angles of the propeller shaft on its hydrodynamic characteristics at different froude and cavitation numbers and also to investigate the flow around the blades of the propeller under various conditions in this study the loads on the blades are measured by a five component balancing system and the important characteristics of the flow are recorded using several cameras the results on the one hand showed that the spp with an appropriate yaw angle can reach a high efficiency compared to submerged propellers but on the other hand they demonstrated the possibility of severe vibrations and problems related to the resistance of the blade due to the vibrational resonance of the blade kotb 2005 surveyed the data obtained from the surface piercing propeller tests and introduced an algorithm to estimate the diameter pitch and efficiency of the spps under different operational conditions ferrando et al 2006 investigated the effects of weber number on the behavior of spps based on a series of tests on three propeller models which their geometries varied systematically they found out that weber number has an important role not only on the critical advance coefficient but also on the thrust and torque coefficient of the fully ventilated regime of the propeller ferrando et al 2006 reported the results of tests carried out on a series of 4 and 5 blades spps with pitch ratio between 0 8 and 1 4 in their studies effects of immersion ratio and shaft inclination were investigated and at advance coefficients higher than critical value and regression equations were presented to relate thrust and torque coefficient also the effects of weber number were also assessed briefly which confirmed the results of previous studies pustoshny pustoshny et al 2007 published the results of the 5 blade spp tests carried out at the russian maritime research institute on vessels at maximum speeds of 45 60 knots this study was carried out in a towing tank equipped with depressurization devices in order to obtain the effects of different geometries and operational parameters on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the spps in this report some data from the propeller tests behind the body are presented to determine the effects of interactions between the body and the propeller ding 2007 reported the results of studies on spps to the china ship scientific research center cssrc in this center the effects of the free surface cavitation number immersion ratio shaft inclination angle and froude number on propeller performance can be assessed they published the results of a series of methodical tests on 6 blade spps with different pitch ratios the author concluded that if the froude number is greater than 3 5 open water test can be carried out at atmospheric pressure and the results would not be sensitive to the froude and cavitation number the results of this research presented a series of performance curves that can be used in the design procedure califano et al califano and steen 2011 studied the numerical simulation of a fully submerged propeller subject to ventilation they identified the inability of their numerical simulation to properly resolve the tip vortex shedding behavior from the propeller blades whereas the dynamic loads computed are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental and thrust is over estimated at all the other angular positions misra et al 2012 tested a series of 4 blade spps with wedge and diamond section shaped in towing tank at naval science and technological laboratory nstl india the best performance has been reported for propellers with a wedge shape and a trailing edge at a 60 degree angle seyyedi et al 2019 studied the effects of immersion ratio and shaft inclination angle on the propeller s efficiency and hydrodynamic coefficients were investigated experimentally the highest efficiency of the propeller was achieved in the range of 40 50 immersion ratios at all angles of shaft inclination for all immersion ratios the maximum and minimum efficiencies were obtained at 0 and 15 shaft inclination angles respectively the best efficiency of the propeller was at 50 immersion ratio and zero shaft inclination angle yang et al 2018 investigated the effects of artificial ventilation on the hydrodynamic characteristics of spp at fully submerged condition using urans in this study volume of fluid method for modeling free surface and overlapped mesh technique for simulation of propeller s rotation are used they demonstrated that artificial ventilation can lead to increase in efficiency at high advance coefficient whereas at low advance coefficients torque and thrust coefficient and also efficiency of propeller decrease gao et al 2019 also studied the influence of diverse vent pipe diameters on hydrodynamic performance of the surface piercing propeller under full immersion conditions the numerical results show that with ventilation by increasing of vent pipe diameters the thrust and torque of the surface piercing propeller decrease and the efficiency of the propeller increases rapidly the low pressure area near the back root of the blade becomes smaller and smaller gradually and the peak of periodic vibration of thrust and torque can be effectively reduced as mentioned above there are suitable studies for the evaluation of spp performance as well as some parametric study on the characteristics of spp despite the role and importance of ventilation in the spp there is a lack of research in this area the objective of the present research is to investigate experimentally the effects of aeration on the performance of the spp this can lead to performance improvements especially on the propeller thrust coefficient at a lower advance coefficient in current research using an aeration mechanism and an air injection upstream of the propeller the improvement of the trust coefficient has been studied in a series of model tests in open water condition using the spp flow loop mechanism at hydrotech institute of applied hydrodynamics and marine technologies iran university of science and technology to assess the hydrodynamic behavior of the propeller model the trust applied by the propeller is measured by a calibrated 5 component balance and gives the trust coefficient of the propeller as a non dimensional number then with the aeration mechanism the air injected at special horizontal and vertical distances from the propeller and the thrust coefficients are compared to non ventilated cases 2 open water test conditions in general performance characteristics of propeller can be classified into two categories 1 open water and 2 behind hull open water characteristics are related to the forces and moments applied to the propeller during its operation in a uniform upstream fluid flow in the self propulsion behind hull performance characteristics are assessed through operation of propellers in the wake field behind a body propulsion force or thrust and axial moment or torque of the propeller depend on different parameters in general form they are functions of 1 t f v n d μ ρ p p a e a o e g σ h z ψ γ α β 2 q g v n d μ ρ p p a e a o e g σ h z ψ γ α β

performance of the propeller model and the hydrodynamics phenomena geometrical kinematics and kinetics similarity should be satisfied to achieve dynamics and kinematics similarity between the model and the actual propeller the most important non dimensional numbers for spps are froude number weber number cavitation number reynolds number advance coefficient and propeller immersion ratio it is not possible to obtain identical values of all parameters for the actual and model propellers in one hand there are some quantitative limitations according to our available facilities and in the other hand performance of the propellers can be independent of some non dimensional parameters in present studies the ranges of r e w n and f r are as follows 14 r e 5 10 5 15 w n 180 16 f r 4 which the performance of the propellers can be considered independent of these three parameters nouri et al 2018 cavitation number has no significant effect on the performance therefore open water tests can be performed at atmospheric pressure as a result the thrust coefficient of spp in ψ 5 o γ 10 o for aerated and non aerated conditions could be considered as following general equations 17 k f f r re w n

tunnel has an open test section with dimensions of 20 20 cm which make ready the equivalent advance speed in the range of 2 6 5 m s flow loop consists of test section pumps flowmeter open test section and a relaxation tank which is used for deaeration of water returning from the tunnel this flow loop includes 4 submerged pumps which are located in the relaxation tank and the outlet of the pumps are connected together by a 5 way junction after the 5 way junction there is the by pass which can be used to regulate the velocity at the test section then a flowmeter is fastened on the pipeline to records the instantaneous flow rate for estimating the average speed using a converter the circular cross section of the pipeline is connected to the manufactured rectangular cross section this section conveys the flow to another rectangular section in which the upper deck is flexibly constructed to take the shape of the stern of high speed vessel to prepare the flow to the open test section that the propeller will be placed here the test section is an open chamber in which the propeller is located because of the transparent walls flow visualization is possible for making flow patterns visible in order to get some qualitative information propeller derived by an electrical motor gearbox with a controllable speed up to 3000 rpm then the position and orientation of the shaft and propeller could be trimmed by the moving parts to the desired condition including the distance from the propeller to the hull the yaw and the pitch angle of the propeller shaft and also the immersion depth of the propeller this system can be adjusted to a specific position along the length of the channel using a rail mechanism and can be leveled by the adjustable table legs for each specific test force and torque measurements performed by an accurate multi axil balance which allows us to measure all reaction of the propeller including axial and side force and also axial moment due to the propeller reactions in order to perform torque force balance calibration a field calibration system has been used that can apply the load in five degrees of freedom simultaneously and independently nouri et al 2018 during manual calibration and dead weight loadings for calibration of sensors loading mechanism is connected to the end of the propeller s shaft this mechanism acts as the propeller model inside the water for considering mechanism and equipment effects such as dead weight and friction between moving parts the loading is applied when the propeller s shaft is rotating see fig 1 4 data collection instruments the data collection system consists of a 16 channel data acquisition system up to 1 mega sample per second signal conditioner amplifiers and analog to digital convertor for strain gauges which is used to record and digitize signals from strain gauge outputs sampling rate used in present studies is 10000 sample per second a typical data for thrust signal during 10 s for propeller immersion ratio of 0 6 and advance coefficient of 0 25 is shown in fig 2 5 propeller s model specification specification of the propeller model as shows in table 1 and have been used in present studies are as follows 6 aeration mechanism aeration is considered as an effective mechanism for improving the performance of spp at low advance coefficients a mechanism is developed to inject the air at the upstream of the propeller at different flow rates by using a 4 mm diameter tube as presented in figures figs 3 7 the released air tries to ventilate the upstream surface of the propeller at different α and β value as depicted in fig 4 figs 5 7 shows some images captured from present experiments 7 test plan organization according to the criteria and defined ranges for similarity in present works for the model diameter of 130 mm and the rotational speed between 1500 rpm and 3000 rpm the advance coefficient should be calculated at each water velocity in channel since the water velocity in the open water tunnel is limited all advance coefficients cannot only be regulated by advance velocity hence to achieve various advance coefficients in the range of 0 2 j 0 6

performance improvement can be observed at all of lower advance coefficients j 0 2 to 0 40 and β α for higher advance coefficients j 0 40 toward 0 60 thrust performance improvement reduced in comparison to lower advance coefficients j 0 2 to 0 40 under these ventilation conditions the improvements are only considerable around mid value of j 0 4 but for the higher or lower value of j 0 4 the improvement is turn down so that at the highest j reduction in performance observed as propeller immersion ratio i increases region with improved performance shifts towards higher values of j for propeller immersions ratios beyond i 0 75 and at advance coefficient of 0 25 performance is declined but at j 0 6 thrust coefficient is enhanced in propeller immersion ratio of 0 4 fig 9 the highest thrust performance improvement is 70 and is obtained at β α 0 15 and advance coefficient of 0 35 in this propeller immersion ratio for all low advance coefficients 0 2 0 35 and for all β α enhancement in thrust performance of the propeller can be observed as the propeller immersion ratio increases region of performance improvement shifts towards higher β α so that in propeller immersion ratio of 0

0 15 for β α in immersion ratio of 0 6 fig 10 the highest performance improvement is 70 and occurs at β α 0 2 and advance coefficient of 0 35 in this propeller immersion ratio for all low advance coefficients 0 2 0 35 and for all β α improvement in thrust performance of the propeller can be observed as the propeller immersion ratio increases region of performance improvement shifts towards higher values of β α so that in immersion ratio of 0 4 the maximum of performance improvement was obtained in the β α values between 0 1 and 0 15 while at propeller immersion ratio of 0 6 the highest performance improvement occurs for values of β α in the range of 0 15 0 2 in propeller immersion ratio of 0 75 fig 11 the highest performance improvement is 40 and occurs at β α 0 3 and advance coefficient of 0 25 as the propeller immersion ratio increases region of performance improvement shifts towards higher β α values so that in immersion ratio of 0 6 the maximum of performance improvement was obtained in the β α ranged between 0 15 and 0 2 while at propeller immersion ratio of 0 75 the highest performance improvement occurs for the values of β α between 0 2 and 0 3 in propeller immersion ratios of 0 85 and 1 fig 12 and fig 13 because the propeller is fully merged no improvement in the thrust performance is achieved and air injection leads to higher wetting of the back surface of the propeller and consequently decreasing of thrust coefficient 10 conclusion performance of surface piercing propellers at speeds lower than 40 knots has been reduced compared to the other propulsion systems which is the main challenge for using spps at lower speeds especially at starting mode of the vessels when the vessel s speed reaches 40 knots and above better performance of propellers can be achieved the present paper contributes to the improvement of the spp thrust at low advance coefficients by using ventilation and air injection upstream of the propeller ventilation evaluation tests were conducted under different physical conditions and the effects of the dimensionless ventilation immersion ratio β α at different propeller immersion ratios and advance coefficients evaluated by assessing the results for all ventilation conditions one can conclude that increasing in propeller immersion ratio will decrease the thrust coefficient improvement percentage the best performance improvement is approximately 100 and is obtained at propeller immersion ratio of 0 25 ventilation immersion ratio β α 0 05 and advance coefficient of 0 4 in addition by increasing the propeller immersion ratio region of performance improvements shifts towards the higher values of j credit author contribution statement ali amini validation formal analysis investigation writing

department of mechanical engineering iran university of science and technology tehran iran corresponding author surface piercing propeller spp is a type of super cavitating propellers which with ventilation on the blades have suitable performance at water air interface these propellers provide perfect ventilation behind the blade which effectively controls cavitation aeriation and improves trust performance at operational condition even if at high speeds the spps have higher efficiency compared to the conventional propellers and water jets the main challenge is their lower efficiency than other propulsion systems at a lower speed which can affects the starting phase of high speed crafts in fact there is a lack of research in studies on these propellers which concern the improvement of their performance at low speed in the present studies an aeration mechanism is investigated so that air is injected upstream in order to improve performance of the propeller the design of the experiment doe is carried out on a spp model to perform performance tests in open water conditions using the spp flow loop mechanism at hydrotech institute of applied hydrodynamics and marine technologies iran university of science and technology the effects of the horizontal distances α and vertical distances β between the ventilation point and the location of the propeller are presented in the form of non dimensional ventilation immersion ratios β α for different propeller immersion ratios ventilation immersion ratios and advance coefficients the thrust coefficient for different cases was measured and compared to unventilated conditions the achievements of the present research are different performance curves about thrust coefficient which illustrate a good correlation between propeller performance and aeration at different propeller immersion ratios the maximum thrust coefficient improvement is around 100 which can achieve at i 0 25 β α 0 05 and j 0 4 as propeller immersion ratio i increases region with improved performance shifts towards higher values of advance coefficient j keywords surface piercing propellers spp low advance coefficient ventilation mechanism 1 introduction the surface piercing propeller spp is a special type of super cavitating propeller which nowadays these propulsion systems show wide applications in different lightweight vessels these propellers operate simultaneously in water and in air during a revolution in general for about a third of the operating time the blades are completely in the air for a third of the time they work completely submerged and for the remaining time they are partially in the air and partially submerged there is less restriction for the size of the propeller and the mechanism of the appendages and also good performance with regard to cavitation which on the one hand leads to an increase in efficiency and a decrease in fuel consumption and on the other hand makes this propulsion system suitable for high speed applications in the most significant experimental research carried out to study the performance of spp one could cite the experiments of shiba 1953 hadler hadler and hecker 1968 hecker 1973 rainz rains 1981 rose and kruppa 1991 kruppa 1992 and rose et al 1993 these researches focused on the study of thrust torque bending moment and lateral forces due to the propeller operation in these studies the effects of the depth of immersion the number of blades the pitch ratio the rake the geometry of the blade section as well as the yaw angles and the trim of the shaft propeller have been investigated in addition to the studies mentioned above important experimental research includes that of olofsson 1996 miller and szantyr 1998 dyson et al dyson 2000 and peterson 2005 these studies provide more information to determine the dynamic characteristic and performance of spps these recent experiments aimed to study the unsteady hydrodynamic loadings and the stresses in the blades and the propeller shaft as well as the structure under laboratory conditions olofsson 1996 studied the characterizations of flow and force in surface piercing propellers their experimental modellings were performed to determine the dynamics and steady performance of an spp at high speed conditions the objectives of these tests were to evaluate the effects of the yaw and trim angles of the propeller shaft on its hydrodynamic characteristics at different froude and cavitation numbers and also to investigate the flow around the blades of the propeller under various conditions in this study the loads on the blades are measured by a five component balancing system and the important characteristics of the flow are recorded using several cameras the results on the one hand showed that the spp with an appropriate yaw angle can reach a high efficiency compared to submerged propellers but on the other hand they demonstrated the possibility of severe vibrations and problems related to the resistance of the blade due to the vibrational resonance of the blade kotb 2005 surveyed the data obtained from the surface piercing propeller tests and introduced an algorithm to estimate the diameter pitch and efficiency of the spps under different operational conditions ferrando et al 2006 investigated the effects of weber number on the behavior of spps based on a series of tests on three propeller models which their geometries varied systematically they found out that weber number has an important role not only on the critical advance coefficient but also on the thrust and torque coefficient of the fully ventilated regime of the propeller ferrando et al 2006 reported the results of tests carried out on a series of 4 and 5 blades spps with pitch ratio between 0 8 and 1 4 in their studies effects of immersion ratio and shaft inclination were investigated and at advance coefficients higher than critical value and regression equations were presented to relate thrust and torque coefficient also the effects of weber number were also assessed briefly which confirmed the results of previous studies pustoshny pustoshny et al 2007 published the results of the 5 blade spp tests carried out at the russian maritime research institute on vessels at maximum speeds of 45 60 knots this study was carried out in a towing tank equipped with depressurization devices in order to obtain the effects of different geometries and operational parameters on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the spps in this report some data from the propeller tests behind the body are presented to determine the effects of interactions between the body and the propeller ding 2007 reported the results of studies on spps to the china ship scientific research center cssrc in this center the effects of the free surface cavitation number immersion ratio shaft inclination angle and froude number on propeller performance can be assessed they published the results of a series of methodical tests on 6 blade spps with different pitch ratios the author concluded that if the froude number is greater than 3 5 open water test can be carried out at atmospheric pressure and the results would not be sensitive to the froude and cavitation number the results of this research presented a series of performance curves that can be used in the design procedure califano et al califano and steen 2011 studied the numerical simulation of a fully submerged propeller subject to ventilation they identified the inability of their numerical simulation to properly resolve the tip vortex shedding behavior from the propeller blades whereas the dynamic loads computed are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental and thrust is over estimated at all the other angular positions misra et al 2012 tested a series of 4 blade spps with wedge and diamond section shaped in towing tank at naval science and technological laboratory nstl india the best performance has been reported for propellers with a wedge shape and a trailing edge at a 60 degree angle seyyedi et al 2019 studied the effects of immersion ratio and shaft inclination angle on the propeller s efficiency and hydrodynamic coefficients were investigated experimentally the highest efficiency of the propeller was achieved in the range of 40 50 immersion ratios at all angles of shaft inclination for all immersion ratios the maximum and minimum efficiencies were obtained at 0 and 15 shaft inclination angles respectively the best efficiency of the propeller was at 50 immersion ratio and zero shaft inclination angle yang et al 2018 investigated the effects of artificial ventilation on the hydrodynamic characteristics of spp at fully submerged condition using urans in this study volume of fluid method for modeling free surface and overlapped mesh technique for simulation of propeller s rotation are used they demonstrated that artificial ventilation can lead to increase in efficiency at high advance coefficient whereas at low advance coefficients torque and thrust coefficient and also efficiency of propeller decrease gao et al 2019 also studied the influence of diverse vent pipe diameters on hydrodynamic performance of the surface piercing propeller under full immersion conditions the numerical results show that with ventilation by increasing of vent pipe diameters the thrust and torque of the surface piercing propeller decrease and the efficiency of the propeller increases rapidly the low pressure area near the back root of the blade becomes smaller and smaller gradually and the peak of periodic vibration of thrust and torque can be effectively reduced as mentioned above there are suitable studies for the evaluation of spp performance as well as some parametric study on the characteristics of spp despite the role and importance of ventilation in the spp there is a lack of research in this area the objective of the present research is to investigate experimentally the effects of aeration on the performance of the spp this can lead to performance improvements especially on the propeller thrust coefficient at a lower advance coefficient in current research using an aeration mechanism and an air injection upstream of the propeller the improvement of the trust coefficient has been studied in a series of model tests in open water condition using the spp flow loop mechanism at hydrotech institute of applied hydrodynamics and marine technologies iran university of science and technology to assess the hydrodynamic behavior of the propeller model the trust applied by the propeller is measured by a calibrated 5 component balance and gives the trust coefficient of the propeller as a non dimensional number then with the aeration mechanism the air injected at special horizontal and vertical distances from the propeller and the thrust coefficients are compared to non ventilated cases 2 open water test conditions in general performance characteristics of propeller can be classified into two categories 1 open water and 2 behind hull open water characteristics are related to the forces and moments applied to the propeller during its operation in a uniform upstream fluid flow in the self propulsion behind hull performance characteristics are assessed through operation of propellers in the wake field behind a body propulsion force or thrust and axial moment or torque of the propeller depend on different parameters in general form they are functions of 1 t f v n d μ ρ p p a e a o e g σ h z ψ γ α β 2 q g v n d μ ρ p p a e a o e g σ h z ψ γ α β

performance of the propeller model and the hydrodynamics phenomena geometrical kinematics and kinetics similarity should be satisfied to achieve dynamics and kinematics similarity between the model and the actual propeller the most important non dimensional numbers for spps are froude number weber number cavitation number reynolds number advance coefficient and propeller immersion ratio it is not possible to obtain identical values of all parameters for the actual and model propellers in one hand there are some quantitative limitations according to our available facilities and in the other hand performance of the propellers can be independent of some non dimensional parameters in present studies the ranges of r e w n and f r are as follows 14 r e 5 10 5 15 w n 180 16 f r 4 which the performance of the propellers can be considered independent of these three parameters nouri et al 2018 cavitation number has no significant effect on the performance therefore open water tests can be performed at atmospheric pressure as a result the thrust coefficient of spp in ψ 5 o γ 10 o for aerated and non aerated conditions could be considered as following general equations 17 k f f r re w n

tunnel has an open test section with dimensions of 20 20 cm which make ready the equivalent advance speed in the range of 2 6 5 m s flow loop consists of test section pumps flowmeter open test section and a relaxation tank which is used for deaeration of water returning from the tunnel this flow loop includes 4 submerged pumps which are located in the relaxation tank and the outlet of the pumps are connected together by a 5 way junction after the 5 way junction there is the by pass which can be used to regulate the velocity at the test section then a flowmeter is fastened on the pipeline to records the instantaneous flow rate for estimating the average speed using a converter the circular cross section of the pipeline is connected to the manufactured rectangular cross section this section conveys the flow to another rectangular section in which the upper deck is flexibly constructed to take the shape of the stern of high speed vessel to prepare the flow to the open test section that the propeller will be placed here the test section is an open chamber in which the propeller is located because of the transparent walls flow visualization is possible for making flow patterns visible in order to get some qualitative information propeller derived by an electrical motor gearbox with a controllable speed up to 3000 rpm then the position and orientation of the shaft and propeller could be trimmed by the moving parts to the desired condition including the distance from the propeller to the hull the yaw and the pitch angle of the propeller shaft and also the immersion depth of the propeller this system can be adjusted to a specific position along the length of the channel using a rail mechanism and can be leveled by the adjustable table legs for each specific test force and torque measurements performed by an accurate multi axil balance which allows us to measure all reaction of the propeller including axial and side force and also axial moment due to the propeller reactions in order to perform torque force balance calibration a field calibration system has been used that can apply the load in five degrees of freedom simultaneously and independently nouri et al 2018 during manual calibration and dead weight loadings for calibration of sensors loading mechanism is connected to the end of the propeller s shaft this mechanism acts as the propeller model inside the water for considering mechanism and equipment effects such as dead weight and friction between moving parts the loading is applied when the propeller s shaft is rotating see fig 1 4 data collection instruments the data collection system consists of a 16 channel data acquisition system up to 1 mega sample per second signal conditioner amplifiers and analog to digital convertor for strain gauges which is used to record and digitize signals from strain gauge outputs sampling rate used in present studies is 10000 sample per second a typical data for thrust signal during 10 s for propeller immersion ratio of 0 6 and advance coefficient of 0 25 is shown in fig 2 5 propeller s model specification specification of the propeller model as shows in table 1 and have been used in present studies are as follows 6 aeration mechanism aeration is considered as an effective mechanism for improving the performance of spp at low advance coefficients a mechanism is developed to inject the air at the upstream of the propeller at different flow rates by using a 4 mm diameter tube as presented in figures figs 3 7 the released air tries to ventilate the upstream surface of the propeller at different α and β value as depicted in fig 4 figs 5 7 shows some images captured from present experiments 7 test plan organization according to the criteria and defined ranges for similarity in present works for the model diameter of 130 mm and the rotational speed between 1500 rpm and 3000 rpm the advance coefficient should be calculated at each water velocity in channel since the water velocity in the open water tunnel is limited all advance coefficients cannot only be regulated by advance velocity hence to achieve various advance coefficients in the range of 0 2 j 0 6 water velocity and revolution speed should be regulated at special values different values of u m s and n rpm which have been taken into account in the current studies presented intable 2 aeration

advance coefficient so that a total number of 540 6 5 3 6 tests were conducted as mentioned intable 3 8 uncertainty analysis the experimental uncertainties in the process are calculated in accordance with the general rules reported in iso guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement young 2002 and the combined uncertainty uc for each variable is calculated by considering type a and type b

is calculated by considering the probability distribution of observed values as presented in table 4 the type b uncertainty is associated with the instrument properties and error propagation and the most frequently normal distribution is assumed the type an uncertainty of the measured variables including the improvement percentage of the thrust coefficient is determined by using eq 20 below 21 u

correlated to increasing of ventilation immersion ratio the maximum improvement is around 100 which can achieved at i 0 25 β α 0 05 and j 0 4 fig 8 a for propeller immersion ratio i 0 25 thrust performance improvement can be observed at all of lower advance coefficients j 0 2 to 0 40 and β α for higher advance coefficients j 0 40 toward 0 60 thrust performance improvement reduced in comparison to lower advance coefficients j 0 2 to 0 40 under these ventilation conditions the improvements are only considerable around mid value of j 0 4 but for the higher or lower value of j 0 4 the improvement is turn down so that at the highest j reduction in performance observed as propeller immersion ratio i increases region with improved performance shifts towards higher values of j for propeller immersions ratios beyond i 0 75 and at advance coefficient of 0 25 performance is declined but at j 0 6 thrust coefficient is enhanced in propeller immersion ratio of 0 4 fig 9 the highest thrust performance improvement is 70 and is obtained at β α 0 15 and advance coefficient of 0 35 in this propeller immersion ratio for all low advance coefficients 0 2 0 35 and for all β α enhancement in thrust performance of the propeller can be observed as the propeller immersion ratio increases region of performance improvement shifts towards higher β α so that in propeller immersion ratio of 0 25 the maximum of performance improvement is obtained in the values of β α between 0 03 and 0 1 while at propeller immersion ratio of 0 4 the highest performance improvement occurs in the range of 0 1 0 15 for β α in immersion ratio of 0 6 fig 10 the highest performance improvement is 70 and occurs at β α 0 2 and advance coefficient of 0 35 in this propeller immersion ratio for all low advance coefficients 0 2 0 35 and for all β α improvement in thrust performance of the propeller can be observed as the propeller immersion ratio increases region of performance improvement shifts towards higher values of β α so that in immersion ratio of 0 4 the maximum of performance improvement was obtained in the β α values between 0 1 and 0 15 while at propeller immersion ratio of 0 6 the highest performance improvement occurs for values of β α in the range of 0 15 0 2 in propeller immersion ratio of 0 75 fig 11 the highest performance improvement is 40 and occurs at β α 0 3 and advance coefficient of 0 25 as the propeller immersion ratio increases region of performance improvement shifts towards higher β α values so that in immersion ratio of 0 6 the maximum of performance improvement was obtained in the β α ranged between 0 15 and 0 2 while at propeller immersion ratio of 0 75 the highest performance improvement occurs for the values of β α between 0 2 and 0 3 in propeller immersion ratios of 0 85 and 1 fig 12 and fig 13 because the propeller is fully merged no improvement in the thrust performance is achieved and air injection leads to higher wetting of the back surface of the propeller and consequently decreasing of thrust coefficient 10 conclusion performance of surface piercing propellers at speeds lower than 40 knots has been reduced compared to the other propulsion systems which is the main challenge for using spps at lower speeds especially at starting mode of the vessels when the vessel s speed reaches 40 knots and above better performance of propellers can be achieved the present paper contributes to the improvement of the spp thrust at low advance coefficients by using ventilation and air injection upstream of the propeller ventilation evaluation tests were conducted under different physical conditions and the effects of the dimensionless ventilation immersion ratio β α at different propeller immersion ratios and advance coefficients evaluated by assessing the results for all ventilation conditions one can conclude that increasing in propeller immersion ratio will decrease the thrust coefficient improvement percentage the best performance improvement is approximately 100 and is obtained at propeller immersion ratio of 0 25 ventilation immersion ratio β α 0 05 and advance coefficient of 0 4 in addition by increasing

20197,horizontal well drilling in the unconsolidated marine hydrate sediments is a challenging issue due to high risk of wellbore instability this paper analyzed this issue under different conditions through numerical simulations based on the field available data in shenhu area of the south china sea besides the potential secondary hydrate formation in the annulus and the influence of mud cake on the wellbore stability were discussed the results show that the assumed horizontal wellbore may not collapse at the site shsc 4 even though some local areas may enter the yielded state however the drilling pipe sticking may occur after drilling because of slight displacement of well wall caused by stress release the sensitivity analyses exhibit that increasing the drilling fluid density and salinity may slightly accelerate hydrate dissociation but these effects on wellbore stability is negligible a significant increase in the drilling fluid temperature may be a disaster for maintaining the wellbore stability and even cause secondary hydrate formation and well blowout the model also shows that the wellbore instability can exacerbate with the decrease in the initial hydrate saturation and irreducible water saturation while the low permeability mud cake is conductive to reducing filtrate loss and facilitate the wellbore stability keywords gas hydrate horizontal well wellbore stability secondary hydrate formation mud cake 1 introduction natural gas hydrate is anticipated to be a potential alternative energy with global distribution in marine and permafrost sediments according to the previous estimation the natural gas trapped in gas hydrate reservoirs is over 1 5 1016 m3 kvenvolden 1988 consequently the exploration and exploitation of gas hydrates has become a topic of high interest for energy industry collett et al 2009b thereinto well drilling is a very important process to identify and optimize the production candidates by core sampling well logging permeability measurement etc yun et al 2011 guo et al 2020 cai et al 2020 however wellbore stability is a serious concern that need to be addressed during drilling through gas hydrate bearing sediments ghbs because of the poorly consolidated sediments which are usually characterized by limited shear strength birchwood and noeth 2012 moridis et al 2011 in addition gas hydrate may dissociate if the drilling operations are not carefully controlled which can exacerbate the wellbore instability because of the structural strength degradation of the ghbs and blocking risk due to secondary hydrates formation birchwood et al 2005 cheng et al 2013 freij ayoub et al 2007 guo et al 2020 sun et al 2018 yan et al 2020 the field drilling practices in most places such as gulf of mexico collett et al 2009a nankai trough yan et al 2020 shenhu area sun et al 2018 and krishna godavari basin motghare and musale 2017 have also demonstrated wellbore state issues therefore addressing this challenging work is of great importance to safe and efficient gas production from ghbs to figure out this issue some theoretical models numerical simulations and laboratory experiments were performed birchwood et al 2005 firstly developed a semi analytical model that incorporated the mechanical properties of thf hydrate bearing sediments to assess wellbore stability during drilling through ghbs however the model was not directly coupled with the thermal simulator which can predict hydrate stability after that a wellbore stability model that preliminarily coupled thermo hydro mechanical process was proposed by freij ayoub et al 2007 the model considered the fluid transport as pseudo multiphase flow because only liquid properties were assigned to the fluid in addition the chemical composition of the drilling fluid and its interaction with hydrates were not taken into account khurshid et al 2010 developed a wellbore temperature simulator to predict the thermal field near wellbore and to confirm the temperature disturbance during the drilling fluid circulation they found the drilling fluid temperature and bottom hole pressure could significantly affect hydrate dissociation around the borehole subsequently a fluid solid coupling model for studying wellbore stability in drilling of ghbs was proposed by li et al 2011 and then it was developed by their group to performed some numerical simulations on wellbore stability analysis during drilling i e li et al 2012 cheng et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 they found hydrate dissociation is very sensitive to drilling fluid temperature rather than drilling fluid density which can result in wellbore instability additionally prolonging the drilling fluid invasion time can also increase the risk of wellbore collapse however the effect of drilling fluid salinity on hydrate dissociation was not fully considered in this model sun et al 2018 analyzed the vertical wellbore stability during drilling through ghbs by coupling tough hydrate and flac3d the high pore pressure is likely to be generated near the wellbore triggered by the large amount of free gas to be released during drilling in addition the hydrate saturation decrease and the permeability increase in the surrounding sediment can also exacerbate wellbore stability cheng et al 2019 developed a porothermoelastic model to capture the temperature and pore pressure fields in the entire formation which are used to predict the hydrate stability and wellbore stability they indicated that there is low risk of hydrate dissociation for riserless drilling because the seawater cools the mud and a safe mud density window was determined for the vertical well in shenhu area however the effect of hydrate saturation variation caused by drilling disturbance on formation strength was not included afterwards wang et al 2019 suggested an elastic analytical solution for ghbs wellbore stability by diving the infinite region around wellbore into several annular areas with different physical properties considering the multi field coupled effects on the methane hydrate dissociation and geomechanical response but the formation was regarded as elastic so the responses after wellbore failure cannot be trapped similarly the impact of salt in the drilling fluid on hydrate dissociation was not considered in this study due to these deficiencies a new elastoplastic analytical solution for wellbore stability during drilling through marine ghbs was amended by guo et al 2020 meanwhile merey 2020 also analyzed wellbore stability conditions for deviated and horizontal wells in the shallow sediments of the mediterranean sea by lower hemisphere projections the results showed that extensive washouts were detected because the sediments within hydrate stability zone are weak and unconsolidated however the degree of washouts could be reduced by increasing the drilling fluid density in addition to these investigations some scholars mainly focused on the influences of bottom hole pressure and thermal field near the well on hydrate dissociation and then qualitatively analyzed the wellbore stability e g golmohammadi and nakhaee 2015 khabibullin et al 2011 lee et al 2015 recently several laboratory experiments were also performed to study the drilling fluid invasion on hydrate dissociation which aimed to optimize the drilling fluid design and inhibit hydrate dissociation in formation gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 but they disregarded the effect of geomechanical processes on the wellbore stability from the discussion above wellbore stability in ghbs is a complex multi field coupling process with phase transition it is evident that the geomechanical and geochemical processes are necessary to predict wellbore stability especially in marine ghbs where inorganic salts widely exist although the foregoing investigations have achieved promising results in wellbore stability prediction and control they mainly concentrate on vertical well drilling in addition the effect of mud cake formation on wellbore stability in ghbs and the potential secondary hydrate formation area in annulus space during the drilling fluid circulation are rarely assessed before according to the previous field trails performed in the mackenzie delta hancock et al 2005 yamamoto and dallimore 2008 the north slope of alaska david schoderbek et al 2013 the eastern nankai trough boswell 2013 yamamoto et al 2019 the qilian mountain permafrost sun et al 2014 and the south china sea li et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 it can be found that gas recovery from ghbs using the traditional vertical production well may be hard to reach commercial level as an alternative horizontal well is a promising option because of the more efficient hydrate dissociation in ghbs feng et al 2014 moridis et al 2009b ye et al 2020 which was also successfully drilled in the eastern nankai trough takahashi and tsuji 2005 and demonstrated in the second offshore hydrate production trial in shenhu area ye et al 2020 therefore conducting research on horizontal well stability during drilling in ghbs is extremely significant for future gas recovery enhancement in this work a numerical study on wellbore stability of an assumed horizontal well deployed at the first offshore hydrate production test site i e shsc 4 in china is performed using a thermo hydro mechanical and geochemical model with the consideration of drilling fluid invasion and pore water salinity effects in particular the effects of drilling fluid density temperature and salinity as well as initial hydrate saturation and irreducible water saturation on wellbore stability are fully investigated furthermore the potential secondary hydrate formation area in the annulus and the effect of mud cake on wellbore stability are also discussed this study can give insight into horizontal wellbore stability during drilling through ghbs and optimize the drilling operations to maintain horizontal wellbore stability and drilling fluid safe circulation 2 simulation model 2 1 geological background the study area mainly focuses on the first offshore field trial site in the pearl river mouth basin because a lot of available field data are reported in this region by the test team fig 1 which is the middle of the continental slope of southeast shenhu area northern south china sea li et al 2018 the water depth at this site is 1266 m and the overburden is 201 meters beneath the sea floor mbsf in 2017 the offshore production trial lasted for 60 days yielding approximately 3 0 105 m3 of gas li et al 2018 according to drilling and well logging at this site natural gas hydrate system can be divided into three intervals from top to bottom which are ghbs with a thickness of 35 m i e 201 236 mbsf three phase coexistence layer with a thickness of 15 m i e 236 251 mbsf and free gas layer with a thickness of 27 m i e 251 278 mbsf the lithology of all layers is clayey silt with high content of clay minerals which results in high bound water concentration more than 65 li et al 2018 thus the irreducible water saturation is assigned to be 0 7 in the simulations the porosity of three layers from top to bottom is 0 35 0 33 and 0 32 respectively and their corresponding mean permeability is 2 9 1 5 and 7 4 md based on the field logging curve li et al 2018 sun et al 2019a in this work the horizontal well assumed in the center of ghbs is mainly investigated according to the field survey the mean hydrate saturation in the ghbs is 34 li et al 2018 in addition the submarine temperature is approximately 4 c with a geothermal gradient of 45 339 k km based on the adjacent in situ measurements sun et al 2015a 2017 2019b 2 2 numerical approach the investigation on the horizontal wellbore stability during drilling in the ghbs involves flow thermal and geomechanical coupling processes because of the special characteristics of gas hydrates according to previous suggestions rutqvist et al 2009 2012 rutqvist and moridis 2009 linking the multiphysics code tough hydrate moridis 2014 to the geomechanical code flac3d itasca 2012 may be a feasible method to handle this issue the coupling numerical tool i e tough hydrate and flac3d has been widely used to predict gas production potential and reservoir stability during hydrate extraction before e g lin et al 2019 moridis et al 2013 moridis and kowalsky 2007 sun et al 2017 in 2018 we successfully demonstrated the possibility of vertical wellbore stability analysis considering drilling fluid invasion and the prediction results are qualitative in agreement with the field site observations sun et al 2018 therefore the numerical approach adopted is robust and employed again to quantitatively investigate the wellbore state of a hypothetical horizontal well at the first offshore production test site in shenhu area the kinetic model in tough hydrate was adopted as suggested by kowalsky and moridis 2007 because well drilling often expends a short period in this shallow area in this study the open hole time of horizontal section is assumed to be within 3 days meanwhile the mohr coulomb yielding criterion already incorporated in the geotechnical simulator i e flac3d was considered although this model shows some limitations to describe soil deformation sanchez et al 2017 it is appropriate to predict the formation failure which is the major target of this investigation specifically the following three methods are used to determine the wellbore instability together chen and jin 2012 1 the convergence criterion 2 displacement mutation criterion and 3 plastic zone criterion which can exactly trap the instability behavior during drilling 2 3 model construction as shown in fig 2 a horizontal well drilling in the ghbs is predicted it is designed to be deployed in the center of hydrate reservoir with a borehole radius of 0 108 m based on the previous filed horizontal well drilling campaign in the nankai trough matsuzawa et al 2006 the geometry of the study region represents 0 1 m of the horizontal well and can extend laterally because of symmetry only half of the simulation domain is studied which can accelerate computing speed specifically the length along the x axis is 5 m and the height along the z axis is 10 m which are sufficient to analyze the wellbore stability according to the previous studies ning et al 2013a b sun et al 2015b and a lot of trial computations on drilling fluid invasion in ghbs the wellbore pressure was estimated from hydrostatic pressure of downhole fluid column it should be noted that the dynamic well pressure during the drilling fluid circulation is not considered because the turbulence of drilling fluid is hard to represent in current simulation and we only emphasize change of the wellbore state during drilling and open hole i e the simulation includes the drilling process and the subsequent drilling fluid invasion process therefore the isotropic pressure as the drilling pressure is employed on the well wall because for gas recovery from ghbs riser system will be used meaning a closed system is adopted motghare and musale 2017 then the following formula can be used 1 p f p a t m p f g h z 10 6 where p f is wellbore pressure in mpa ρ f is drilling fluid density in kg m3 p atm is the standard atmospheric pressure i e 0 101325 mpa h is seawater depth in m z is the depth of sediment from the seafloor in m g is gravity acceleration in m s2 according to the prediction performed by li et al 2019 the fracture pressure of ghbs in shenhu area is 1 14 1 15 therefore the drilling fluid density is assigned to be 1060 kg m3 to predict wellbore stability which is a little higher than the initial pore pressure and the downhole pressure is around 15 54 mpa the corresponding downhole fluid temperature i e t f at z 218 5 mbsf is assumed to 15 2 c based on the adjacent site measurement at the same depth nakai et al 2007 according to calculation predicted by tough hydrate the phase equilibrium pressure at this temperature i e t f 15 2 c is about 16 03 mpa it is anticipated that hydrates around the wellbore will dissociate by the heating coming from the drilling fluid in addition natural gas hydrates in nature are usually buried in shallow deposits with unconsolidated characteristic so it can also be assumed that the initial pore pressure in ghbs is hydrostatic in the fluid thermal coupling analysis performed in tough hydrate hyndman et al 1992 similarly substituting the seawater density i e 1019 kg m3 for the drilling fluid density i e ρ f 1060 kg m3 in formula 1 can determine the pore pressure of the whole simulation system meanwhile the bottom water temperature at this site is approximately 4 c which combined with the geothermal gradient allows obtaining the initial temperature distribution in this domain after initialization it can be found that the hydrates are stable based on the hydrate phase equilibrium curve fig 3 besides these the downhole drilling fluid is assumed to be a fixed inner boundary which indicates the temperature pressure and salinity in the borehole is constant this inner boundary can be treated as a pseudo medium with a porosity φ 1 0 a high horizontal and vertical permeability k x k y k z 5 0 10 9 m2 and a capillary pressure p c 0 sun et al 2018 additionally the external boundaries including the top and bottom as well as the lateral boundary are also treated as the dirichlet boundaries table 1 presents the main modeling and drilling fluid parameters used in tough hydrate the geomechanical analysis is performed in flac3d and the same geometry is adopted for fluid thermal analysis in tough hydrate the horizontal wellbore stability prediction in this study can be considered as a plane strain model the downhole pressure is applied to the inner borehole wall and the geostatic stress is applied on the top and lateral boundaries based on a bulk density of deposits calculated from table 1 i e 2112 kg m3 the initial vertical total stress at the top of model is about 17 18 mpa the compressive stress is negative in flac3d then the vertical total stress of whole system can be obtained by increasing at a rate of 20 78 kpa m meanwhile the horizontal total stress at the corresponding depth is 16 13 mpa considering the lateral confinement condition similarly the initial horizontal stress can also be calculated with an increased rate of 15 77 kpa m because of symmetry a restriction of zero displacement normal to the x 0 plane is imposed in addition we also assume that there is no vertical displacement at the bottom of the model the main geomechanical properties employed in the analysis are shown table 2 the cohesion friction angle and poisson ratio of sediments at s h 0 are obtained from our laboratory tests using the field samples recovered from shenhu area because there are no tests on the available field samples with hydrate the relationships between geomechanical properties and hydrate saturation adopted in this simulation are mainly based on the tests using the in situ samples from the eastern nankai trough miyazaki et al 2010 yoneda et al 2015 in addition previous studies show that the friction angle is independent of hydrate saturation masui et al 2005 waite et al 2009 so it will remain constant during the simulation the dilation angle is also not considered in this investigation because our laboratory test and some similar research show that obvious strain hardening and shear shrinkage behaviors were observed for silty sediments with and without hydrate luo et al 2020 it is noted that these geomechanical properties e g stiffness and strength are not updated with porosity change the initial formation stress distributions of the whole simulation domain are shown in fig 4 2 4 domain discretization fig 5 shows the same meshes used for the simulation in both tough hydrate and flac3d as suggested by moridis et al 2007 2009 hydrate phase transitions as well as heat and mass transfer near the wellbore is drastic demanding a very fine discretization in the vicinity of the borehole therefore the meshes are refined in this region and the studied domain is discretized into 1020 grids in a cartesian system x y z as shown in fig 5 there are 40 inactive elements which are adopted to define the inner and outside boundaries due to this reason 4900 980 5 coupled equations will be solved at the same time when the kinetic model is executed in tough hydrate furthermore the mesh employed to perform the wellbore stability analysis in flac3d is fully the same which can contribute to link parameters in two codes 3 results and analysis wellbore stability of ghbs is closely related to the change of pore pressure caused by drilling fluid invasion and the degradation of reservoir strength resulted from hydrate dissociation mcconnell et al 2012 merey 2016 ning et al 2013b sun et al 2018 therefore it is critical to show the spatial evolutions of main physical properties during the horizontal well drilling process in this section the reference case i e ρ f 1060 kg m3 and t f 15 2 c was firstly analyzed in detail and then the effects of main drilling fluid and reservoir physical properties on horizontal wellbore stability were investigated in overbalanced drilling as shown in table 3 it is note that the mud cake is not considered in this part because the irreducible water saturation i e s ira 0 7 in most cases is higher than the initial water saturation i e s w 0 66 in formation except the sensitivity analysis on irreducible water saturation however the effect of mud cake on horizontal wellbore stability is specifically discussed in some typical cases shown in section 4 3 1 reference case fig 6 shows the spatial distribution evolutions of main physical properties around the wellbore it can be observed that the well pressure is significantly higher than that in the ghbs after the wellbore open however the pore pressure in the vicinity of the borehole does not display obvious variation within 3 days fig 6 a which is mainly due to the reason that the high irreducible water saturation is over the initial formation water saturation therefore the drilling fluid in the wellbore may not effectively invade into the ghbs and cause the pore pressure change this indicates that the high density drilling fluid in the wellbore is conducive to counteracting the stress relief after drilling and maintaining the wellbore stability despite the mass transfer fails to occur the heat transfer continuously takes place and causes the temperature rise near the wellbore because of the temperature difference between the wellbore and the reservoir fig 6 b due to this reason the hydrates will dissociate in this area and may significantly result in the decrease in formation strength exacerbating the horizontal wellbore stability according to fig 6 c it is clear that hydrates on the sidewall will rapidly dissociate at the beginning and then its saturation slowly decreases this phenomenon occurs mainly because the initial drilling fluid temperature is relatively high in the wellbore hydrate will sharply dissociate when they contact each other in addition the difference in the concentration of dissolved methane between the wellbore and reservoir can also accelerate hydrate dissolution bureau et al 2002 chapoy et al 2004 ou et al 2019 however the hydrate dissociation is an endothermic process which is mainly dependent on heat transfer if the drilling fluid is unlikely to effectively penetrate into the reservoir thus a sharp decrease in hydrate saturation around the wellbore can be observed at the beginning and the evolution trend declines gradually after that rapid reduction furthermore it can be found that hydrate saturation on the sidewall decreases only about 2 within 3 days so the drilling fluid still cannot effectively invade into the ghbs which can also demonstrate the distribution of pore pressure shown in fig 6 a as the continuous drilling fluid circulation free gas released from hydrate dissociation and salinity reduction caused by the dilution effect can also be discovered near the wellbore fig 6 d and e the free gas appears in the vicinity of the wellbore may alter the pore pressure distribution and decrease the effective stress in these areas which can increase the risk of wellbore instability the possible reason why no free gas appears in the early period is that only hydrate on the sidewall can dissociate at the early stage because the drilling fluid cannot invade into ghbs however there is no methane occurring in the drilling fluid during its circulation so the dissociated gas in the early period will be dissolved into water as the duration of reservoir exposure prolongs hydrates far from the sidewall can also dissociate slowly at the same time with the help of heat transfer from the drilling fluid therefore some free gas can trapped in the later period of simulation this can also be verified by the distribution of significant low salinity caused by the dilution effect at the later stage around the wellbore additionally the free gas released from hydrate dissociation is just a little so the pore pressure distribution is not obviously affected fig 7 exhibits the spatial evolutions of the yielding zone state and the displacements around the wellbore during the entire simulated process it can be observed that the formation adjacent to the wellbore will reach the yield condition because of stress release just after drilling especially in the right horizontal area it is interesting that the yielding range remains unchanged even though slight hydrates dissociate in the vicinity of the wellbore however the yielding zone state transition may occur during the whole prediction the possible reason is that drilling fluid is unlikely to invade into ghbs within 3 days which is unable to obviously affect pore pressure and effective stress distribution fig 6 a but hydrates still slightly dissociate near the wellbore due to heat transfer fig 6 c resulting in the mild decrease in formation strength therefore the yielding zone state can change during the simulation overall the sediments above and below the wellbore present tensile failure but the shear failure mainly occurs in the right part in order to quantitatively describe the well wall stability the displacements of some specific monitoring sites in the vicinity of the wellbore are depicted it is obvious that the displacements at different points mainly generate after the formation is just opened after that the displacements have little changes for the entire process the maximum displacement appears at the top of the horizontal well and the lowest deformation is at the z 0 plane specifically the displacements around the borehole just after drilling mainly range from 0 13 cm to 0 43 cm and then remain basically stable which indicates that there may be a lower risk of horizontal wellbore collapse in this case due to a limited deformation even though a small area near the borehole enters into yield phase however the drilling pipe sticking may occur during the operation it can be speculated that the possibility of wellbore instability will increase as the continuous hydrate dissociation in this case because the released free gas can disturb the pore pressure distribution and reduce sediment strength for the long term operation therefore increasing drilling rate and shortening drilling fluid circulation time as far as possible contribute to the horizontal wellbore stability at the first offshore test site in shenhu area 3 2 effect of drilling fluid density a high drilling fluid density in the wellbore is usually conducive to maintaining the wellbore stability and preventing the blowout when it is below formation fracture pressure gao et al 2018 therefore it is significant to develop a sound understanding of reservoir response caused by drilling in the ghbs using different mud density in this sensitivity analysis the same drilling fluid temperature and salinity i e 15 2 c and 3 5 respectively are kept when the drilling fluid density increases from 1060 to 1100 kg m3 these density values are inside the security density window in shenhu area as suggested by li et al 2019 fig 8 depicts the spatial distributions of pore pressure hydrate saturation and free gas saturation near the wellbore at t 3 days because the drilling fluid is unlikely to penetrate into ghbs in these cases due to the high initial irreducible water saturation it can be observed that the drilling fluid is limited to the wellbore even though its density is increasing because of the low initial water saturation in reservoir fig 8 a however this noninvasive behavior can assist to the wellbore stability because there is no obvious mud loss which is able to increase pore pressure and decrease hydrate saturation around the borehole in addition it also helps to reduce the damages to the reservoir similarly hydrate dissociation in the vicinity of the wellbore is limited due to the slow heat conduction but the dissociation extent will slightly increase with an increase in the drilling fluid density resulting in the slight decrease in formation strength fig 8 b a possible reason for this behavior is that methane solubility in water will obviously increase as the system pressure increases this phenomenon has been demonstrated by previous investigations during the drilling operations e g bureau et al 2002 li and huang 2016 thus hydrate saturation decrease caused by dissolution will increase in spite of the same temperature difference between the wellbore and reservoir in addition free gas around the wellbore does not exhibit significant diversity among three cases and only an inconspicuous distribution variation above the wellbore can be discerned when the drilling fluid density increases fig 8 c this can also be attributed to the methane solubility difference in diverse wellbore pressure conditions fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of yielding range and the displacement variations near the wellbore for various drilling fluid densities the yield range sharply decreases with an increase in the drilling fluid density because there is no obvious mud loss under these conditions fig 8 a which favors the wellbore stability by maximally using the fluid column pressure in the well to compensate geostress after drilling this means increasing the drilling fluid density as far as possible but below the fracture pressure at this site undoubtedly decrease the risk of wellbore collapse this conclusion can also be drawn from the evolutions of displacements near the borehole fig 9 it is obvious that the deformation around the wellbore will dramatically reduce as the drilling fluid density increases to be more specific the positive displacement at position x y z 0 108 0 0 can be observed when the drilling fluid density reaches to 1100 kg m3 thus increasing the drilling fluid density favors the wellbore stability if no significant mud loss occurs during drilling in the ghbs 3 3 effect of drilling fluid temperature the drilling fluid temperature in the annulus during the circulation is likely to rise because of the friction of the drilling tool sun et al 2018 this temperature increase may enhance the hydrate dissociation around the wellbore and give rise to the wellbore instability gao et al 2019 thus it is necessary to give major concern in horizontal wellbore stability caused by the drilling fluid temperature fig 10 shows the distribution evolutions of main physical properties affecting the wellbore stability near the borehole at different drilling fluid temperatures when the other parameters remain the same the pore pressure in the vicinity of the wellbore will increase as the drilling fluid temperature rises and can even exceed the well pressure fig 10 a resulting in the decrease in effective stress of the surrounding formation the higher the drilling fluid temperature the more obvious the phenomenon is this means the risk of wellbore collapse and even reservoir fracturing sharply increase with an increase in the drilling fluid temperature this behavior is mainly because hydrate dissociation is accelerated due to the more heat transfer from the higher temperature drilling fluid fig 10 b which releases a large amount of free gas around the wellbore and causes the pore pressure to increase in the surrounding sediments fig 10 c in addition some hydrates near the wellbore have fully dissociated because of high temperature favoring the drilling fluid invasion which can also increase the pore pressure and affect the free gas distribution in the neighbor sediments to some extent as shown in fig 10 b the dramatic hydrate dissociation around the wellbore will give rise to the degradation of formation strength within the dissociation front further exacerbating the instability of the borehole as discussed below fig 11 exhibits the spatial distributions of the yielding region and the evolutions of formation displacements in the surrounding sediments with different annular temperatures it is obvious that the yielding range dramatically expands with the increase of the drilling fluid temperature and for the cases of high annular temperatures the zone failure state changes significantly i e the single shear or tension failure will transform to the combination of both failure modes which can demonstrate the above qualitative analysis of wellbore stability to be specific some areas around the wellbore will collapse with an increase in the drilling fluid temperature based on the corresponding displacements at the monitoring points it is clear that the large deformation of the wellbore wall sharply generates within a very short period of time e g the displacements at positions x y z 0 0 0 108 x y z 0 076 0 0 076 and x y z 0 108 0 0 meaning the occurrence of wellbore collapse and the higher the drilling fluid temperature the earlier the wellbore collapse appears according to the monitoring histories the radial range with a thickness about 1 0 cm will fully collapse because the adjacent displacements sharply increase and do not tend to be stable if the drilling fluid temperature increases from 15 2 c to 19 2 c additionally the instability region may further expand in the yielding range if the drilling fluid invasion time prolongs therefore it is critical to warily adjust the drilling fluid circulation temperature to avoid wellbore instability or drilling pipe sticking during horizontal drilling operations in the ghbs 3 4 effect of drilling fluid salinity inorganic salt as a thermodynamic inhibitor is generally used to inhibit secondary gas hydrate formation in the annulus and to improve the drilling efficiency when drilling in the ghbs according to the investigation performed by zhao et al 2017 adding the high concentration of nacl can effectively avoid the hydrate formation and enhance the cleaning performance in the borehole but at the same time the high salinity is unfavorable for hydrate stability around the wellbore srungavarapu et al 2018 which may trigger wellbore collapse fig 12 a shows that the pore pressure near the wellbore is almost the same even though the salinity of the drilling fluid increases while the temperature and density are fixed this means the effective stress in the surrounding sediments also remains constant and this change may not increase the risk of horizontal wellbore instability this phenomenon occurs mainly because the drilling fluid cannot effectively invade into the ghbs with high irreducible water saturation which can also be demonstrated by the hydrate saturation distribution around the borehole fig 12 b despite the phase equilibrium temperature depression with the increase in the drilling fluid salinity the hydrate dissociation is not significantly accelerated because of no effective convection in the surrounding sediments it can be found that the hydrate saturation at the monitoring point just slightly decreases when using the high drilling fluid salinity in other words the geomechancial properties i e associated with the hydrate saturation decrease do not undergo much reduction helping to maintain the wellbore stability depending on hydrate dissociation only a little free gas can be observed around the wellbore and the difference among three conditions is negligible which is also unlikely to affect the pore pressure distribution fig 12 c in fig 13 the yielding ranges and displacements around the wellbore for different drilling fluid salinity are presented the ultimate yielding range does not expand with an increase in the drilling fluid salinity because the pore pressure and hydrate saturation mainly affecting wellbore stability are basically unchanged fig 12 due to the same reason the displacements at the corresponding monitoring points show almost the same evolution trend and only slight fluctuations can be observed possibly because the minor differences in hydrate saturation according to the simulation the high addition of inorganic salt to the drilling fluid at this site is conducive to inhibiting hydrate formation in the annulus without significantly affecting the horizontal wellbore stability 3 5 effect of hydrate saturation initial hydrate saturation in the sediments is usually not uniform which has been verified by the field surveys li et al 2018 yamamoto et al 2019 lin et al 2019 therefore the horizontal wellbore stability analysis incorporating different hydrate saturations is necessary fig 14 depicts the spatial evolutions of pore pressure hydrate saturation and gas saturation around the wellbore the effect of hydrate saturation on the horizontal wellbore stability at this site is extremely remarkable when decreasing the hydrate saturation because of the significant mass and heat transfer near the wellbore i e the initial water saturation is higher than irreducible water saturation it is clear that drilling fluid invasion and hydrate dissociation near the wellbore will accelerate with the decrease in hydrate saturation fig 14 a and b resulting in the reduction in effective stress and formation strength around the wellbore simultaneously these imply the risk of horizontal wellbore collapse will increase under the same drilling operation condition however there is no free gas generated and any gas released will be dissolved into water if decreasing the initial hydrate saturation fig 14 c thus the pore pressure increase is mainly attributed to drilling fluid invasion rather than free gas released from hydrate dissociation the lower the initial hydrate saturation is the more significant reduction in effective stress will be this is probably because the effective permeability in a formation with low hydrate saturation can sharply increase accelerating the drilling fluid invasion and hydrate dissociation in addition decreasing the initial hydrate saturation can also reduce the formation strength at the beginning to resist deformation after drilling therefore as the initial hydrate saturation decreases the formation strength will decline and the hydrate dissociation area and wellbore instability will exacerbate from the above analyses fig 15 shows the distributions of yield range and displacements around the wellbore with the change of initial hydrate saturation it is easy to understand that the yielding range will decrease as the initial hydrate saturation increases because of little increase in pore pressure and significant enhancement of formation strength it can be found that the maximum yielding range can decrease from 0 241 m to 0 14 m when initial hydrate saturation increases from 0 26 to 0 34 at this site in terms of wellbore wall displacements during the simulations it can be observed that the corresponding displacements in the surrounding sediments will dramatically increase when decreasing the initial hydrate saturation meaning the risk increase of wellbore instability the maximum horizontal displacement will reach to approximately 1 05 cm if the initial hydrate saturation decreases to 0 26 which indicates that wellbore collapse or drilling pipe sticking is more likely to occur during drilling 3 6 effect of irreducible water saturation irreducible water saturation of ghbs is a very important reservoir parameter which may significantly influence the drilling fluid invasion in order to clarify its effect the sensitivity analysis on irreducible water saturation is also performed fig 16 exhibits the spatial distributions of main physical properties around the wellbore after drilling at different times there is a significant difference in drilling fluid invasion behavior when the initial formation water saturation is above or below the irreducible water saturation this means the wellbore stability may also be sharply affected when the initial water saturation is over the irreducible water saturation the drilling fluid losses will occur and increase the pore pressure in the surrounding sediments fig 16 a in addition the convective heat transfer is intensified near the wellbore thereby accelerating hydrate dissociation fig 16 b both of them can result in the wellbore instability because of the reductions in the effective stress and formation strength it is interesting that the further decrease in irreducible water saturation has almost no influence however the invasion cannot be observed when the initial formation water saturation is below the irreducible water saturation and only slight hydrate dissociation occurs due to heat conduction which can be demonstrated by the spatial distributions of pore pressure and free gas saturation fig 16 a and c in addition there is no free gas if the irreducible water saturation is below the initial water saturation which may be conducive to wellbore stability because the pore pressure cannot further change the possible reason is that the released gas dissolves into the water under the high pore pressure and displacement fig 17 shows the corresponding distributions of yielding range and displacements around the wellbore under the conditions of different irreducible water saturations it is obvious that the yielding range will significantly expand near the wellbore if the irreducible water saturation decreases to below initial formation water saturation i e 0 66 and the final yield range is the same even though the irreducible water saturation further decreases these phenomena can also be demonstrated by the evolution of displacements in the vicinity of wellbore the deformation will exacerbate once the irreducible water saturation reduces to below 0 66 and the same evolution path of displacements will be observed in the two cases i e 0 60 and 0 65 the maximum displacement around the wellbore may reach to 0 736 cm which illustrates that drilling pipe sticking and even wellbore collapse may generate during horizontal well drilling in general the wellbore stability is mainly dependent on the relative magnitudes of initial formation water saturation and irreducible water saturation 4 discussion 4 1 secondary hydrate formation risk assessment as mentioned above hydrate dissociation is easy to appear during drilling in the ghbs and the released free gas is likely to enter the annulus and form secondary hydrate lou and liang 2020 therefore in this section the possible secondary hydrate formation area is mainly discussed based on the sensitivity analysis on the drilling fluid temperature because a large amount of free gas is produced in these cases as shown in fig 18 a the free gas released will flow into the wellbore due to differential pressure when increasing the drilling fluid temperature it can be observed that there is no free gas entering the annulus if the initial bottom hole temperature is 15 2 c meaning the low risk of secondary hydrate formation note that methane solubility difference is not considered along the annulus because of the different pressure and temperature fig 18 b however the free gas will gradually flow into the annulus with an increase in the drilling fluid temperature and the higher temperature will give rise to the earlier free gas entrance which is likely to form secondary hydrate and block circulation channel in addition the gas cut can cause the drilling fluid gasification and affect the drilling efficiency and safety in order to quantitatively characterize the potential secondary hydrate formation range we introduce the corresponding drilling fluid temperature measured in adjacent site i e site sh2 performed in 2007 nakai et al 2007 and the phase equilibrium temperature for a fixed drilling fluid density 1060 kg m3 and salinity 3 5 it should be noted that the drilling fluid density is assumed to be constant in this analysis in fact it may be slightly changed by the released gas invasion under the high drilling fluid temperature in general the possibility of secondary hydrate formation is relatively low when maintaining the bottom hole temperature at 15 2 c in contrast the risk of secondary hydrate formation can sharply increase with the increase of drilling fluid temperature specifically it is speculated that the potential secondary hydrate formation depth is above 146 67 mbsf for a bottom hole temperature of 17 2 c while the potential area will reduce to above 84 44 mbsf if the drilling fluid temperature at the bottom is 19 2 c it should be noted that hydrate may dissociate again above the seafloor because of heat transfer from the surrounding seawater which is beyond the scope of this study and not discussed here 4 2 effect of mud cake it is well known that mud cake will form under dynamic filtration during drilling fluid circulation which is usually beneficial to alleviate filtrate loss and stabilize the wellbore because high irreducible water saturation is confirmed in the silt clay reservoir at the first offshore production test site in shenhu area causing no obvious drilling fluid loss in most cases so the mud cake effect is not considered in above research however the high drilling fluid temperature or the low hydrate and irreducible water saturation can also give rise to the significant drilling fluid invasion therefore it is necessary to clarify the difference among these situations in this part the sediment response around the wellbore under the typical cases i e the drilling fluid temperature is 19 2 c and the initial hydrate saturation is 26 are discussed in detailed according to the laboratory permeability measurements of low permeability sandstone a few millidarcy to dozens of millidarcy during drilling fluid invasion performed by wang 2015 the maximum ratio of mean permeability damage can reach 74 7 in addition some similar permeability tests on mud cake are also carried out using different drilling fluid compositions which shows that the permeability ranges from 0 00253 md to 3 413 md fu et al 2013 therefore in this work it is assumed that a thin mud cake forms on the well wall and its permeability is 0 0725 md 1 40 absolute permeability of ghbs 4 2 1 high temperature drilling fluid case i e 19 2 c fig 19 shows the spatial distribution evolutions of pore pressure hydrate saturation and gas saturation near the wellbore with without mud cake it can be found that the pore pressure distribution at the beginning between two cases is almost the same but the significant difference can be observed in the later period fig 19 a the low permeability mud cake on the well wall may slightly expand the relatively high pore pressure area around the wellbore in the drilling process which may be unfavorable for horizontal wellbore stability the possible reason is that the high drilling fluid temperature accelerates hydrate dissociation and thus a large amount of free gas is released but the dissociated gas flowing into the well will be hindered due to this low permeability mud cake in contrast the released gas can enter the annulus continuelly under pressure differential if the mud cake effect is not taken into account this can also be demonstrated by the spatial distribution of free gas with high saturation near the wellbore fig 19 c and the rate evolution of total methane gas flowing into the wellbore fig 20 meanwhile the low permeability mud cake is able to relieve the drilling fluid invasion and decrease the hydrate dissociation extent in the surrounding sediments which is conducive to maintaining the horizontal wellbore stability fig 19 b due to the same reason an obvious difference in the free gas distribution in the later period can be observed additionally the methane enters into the annulus can be delayed and the inflow volume can be reduced especially at the early drilling fluid circulation stage thus it may be beneficial to control secondary hydrate formation in the annulus and relieve blowout risk during the horizontal well drilling the corresponding distributions of yielding range and displacements around the wellbore in both cases are depicted in fig 21 the final yielding range in the surrounding sediments will slightly increase using the high temperature drilling fluid if the mud cake forms on the well wall this is mainly caused by the high pore pressure distribution near the wellbore fig 19 a although the mud cake forms on the well wall it may still not avoid wellbore collapse near the borehole e g the positions at x y z 0 0 0 108 x y z 0 076 0 0 076 and x y z 0 108 0 0 the formation displacements at a little distance from the wellbore at the top and right parts could be significantly decreased however the corresponding displacements in the direction of 45 may slightly increase it is expected that the mud cake formation contributes to maintaining the wellbore stability because it may avoid continuous large displacement around the wellbore in spite of the fact that the yielding range may slightly increase 4 2 2 low hydrate saturation case i e 26 fig 22 exhibits the spatial evolutions of pore pressure and hydrate saturation around the borehole during the simulations in two conditions additionally the predictions show that under these situations there is no free gas and the released gas is mainly dissolved in water the reservoir response near the wellbore is clearly different from that using the high temperature drilling fluid shown in section 4 2 1 the mud cake formation on the well wall can dramatically avoid mud losses and mitigate the drilling fluid invasion depth for the reservoir with relatively low hydrate saturation fig 22 a thus the pore pressure increase in the surrounding sediments will be suppressed which is favorable for horizontal wellbore stability meanwhile the hydrate dissociation extent near the wellbore will decrease facilitating the horizontal wellbore stability due to the fact that heat and mass transfer from the well to the sediments is weakened fig 22 b from this viewpoint the corresponding final yielding range and displacements near the wellbore are likely to decrease if the low permeability mud cake forms which can be demonstrated by the predictions shown in fig 23 it is anticipated that the yielding range will obviously shrink because of the favorable slurry retaining wall effect moreover the sediment deformations around the wellbore can be significantly decreased at different monitoring points and the maximum displacement on the well wall can reduce by 0 4 cm these results confirm that forming the low permeability mud cake helps to maintain the wellbore stability and reduce the risk of drilling pipe sticking when performing horizontal well drilling in the low hydrate saturation reservoir at this site 5 conclusions and suggestions in this study horizontal wellbore state of a hypothetical well during drilling at the first offshore hydrate production test site i e shsc 4 in shenhu area was evaluated by numerical simulations and the sensitivity analyses including drilling fluid properties hydrate saturation and irreducible water saturation on the wellbore stability were also performed based on these simulations the potential secondary hydrate formation range and the effect of mud cake on the wellbore stability were also discussed in detail the following conclusions can be drawn from this investigation 1 the drilling fluid is unlikely to invade into the ghbs with high irreducible water saturation at this site and hydrate dissociation is mainly derived from heat conduction caused by temperature difference between the wellbore and reservoir when the bottom hole temperature is 15 2 c the wellbore is unlikely to collapse because of the limited displacement after drilling at this site even though some areas may enter the yielded state however the drilling pipe sticking is possible to occur because the deformation caused by stress release can be trapped around the wellbore therefore improving the drilling fluid lubricity and keeping solid control are beneficial to avoid operation accidents when performing the horizontal well drilling at this site 2 increasing the drilling fluid density and salinity at this site may slightly accelerate hydrate dissociation around the wellbore but these effects on wellbore stability are negligible compared to the slurry retaining wall effect if there is no obvious drilling fluid loss and temperature increase therefore increasing the drilling fluid density facilitates the horizontal wellbore stability and adding a small amount of inorganic salts into the drilling fluid may not affect wellbore stability in this area which can also inhibit secondary hydrate formation simultaneously in addition a significant increase in the drilling fluid temperature may be a disaster that rapid hydrate dissociation and pore pressure increase appear causing the sharp risk increase of horizontal wellbore instability which illustrates the drilling fluid temperature should be carefully controlled 3 the risk of wellbore collapse increases with a decrease in initial hydrate saturation due to the severe drilling fluid invasion and relatively low sediment strength therefore the horizontal well deployed in the ghbs with high saturation is more preferred in addition the irreducible water saturation of ghbs may also significantly affect drilling fluid losses and wellbore stability which is mainly dependent on the relative magnitudes of initial formation water saturation and irreducible water saturation in short the horizontal well drilled in the ghbs with relatively high irreducible water saturation i e above the initial formation water saturation may maintain the wellbore stability more efficiently 4 the high temperature drilling fluid can not only exacerbate hydrate dissociation and wellbore instability during horizontal well drilling in the ghbs but also trigger the risks of secondary hydrate formation and blowout although the formation of low permeability mud cake is conducive to reducing filtrate loss the wellbore instability can still not be avoided if the high temperature drilling fluid is adopted for the reservoir with low hydrate saturation the mud cake on the well wall is able to significantly alleviate the drilling fluid invasion and decrease hydrate dissociation in the surrounding sediments which favors the wellbore stability thus it is necessary to form the low permeability mud cake on the well wall to stabilize the horizontal wellbore such as the degradable and environmentally friendly nanometer calcium carbonate drilling fluid system credit authorship contribution statement jiaxin sun conceptualization data curation writing original draft

20197,horizontal well drilling in the unconsolidated marine hydrate sediments is a challenging issue due to high risk of wellbore instability this paper analyzed this issue under different conditions through numerical simulations based on the field available data in shenhu area of the south china sea besides the potential secondary hydrate formation in the annulus and the influence of mud cake on the wellbore stability were discussed the results show that the assumed horizontal wellbore may not collapse at the site shsc 4 even though some local areas may enter the yielded state however the drilling pipe sticking may occur after drilling because of slight displacement of well wall caused by stress release the sensitivity analyses exhibit that increasing the drilling fluid density and salinity may slightly accelerate hydrate dissociation but these effects on wellbore stability is negligible a significant increase in the drilling fluid temperature may be a disaster for maintaining the wellbore stability and even cause secondary hydrate formation and well blowout the model also shows that the wellbore instability can exacerbate with the decrease in the initial hydrate saturation and irreducible water saturation while the low permeability mud cake is conductive to reducing filtrate loss and facilitate the wellbore stability keywords gas hydrate horizontal well wellbore stability secondary hydrate formation mud cake 1 introduction natural gas hydrate is anticipated to be a potential alternative energy with global distribution in marine and permafrost sediments according to the previous estimation the natural gas trapped in gas hydrate reservoirs is over 1 5 1016 m3 kvenvolden 1988 consequently the exploration and exploitation of gas hydrates has become a topic of high interest for energy industry collett et al 2009b thereinto well drilling is a very important process to identify and optimize the production candidates by core sampling well logging permeability measurement etc yun et al 2011 guo et al 2020 cai et al 2020 however wellbore stability is a serious concern that need to be addressed during drilling through gas hydrate bearing sediments ghbs because of the poorly consolidated sediments which are usually characterized by limited shear strength birchwood and noeth 2012 moridis et al 2011 in addition gas hydrate may dissociate if the drilling operations are not carefully controlled which can exacerbate the wellbore instability because of the structural strength degradation of the ghbs and blocking risk due to secondary hydrates formation birchwood et al 2005 cheng et al 2013 freij ayoub et al 2007 guo et al 2020 sun et al 2018 yan et al 2020 the field drilling practices in most places such as gulf of mexico collett et al 2009a nankai trough yan et al 2020 shenhu area sun et al 2018 and krishna godavari basin motghare and musale 2017 have also demonstrated wellbore state issues therefore addressing this challenging work is of great importance to safe and efficient gas production from ghbs to figure out this issue some theoretical models numerical simulations and laboratory experiments were performed birchwood et al 2005 firstly developed a semi analytical model that incorporated the mechanical properties of thf hydrate bearing sediments to assess wellbore stability during drilling through ghbs however the model was not directly coupled with the thermal simulator which can predict hydrate stability after that a wellbore stability model that preliminarily coupled thermo hydro mechanical process was proposed by freij ayoub et al 2007 the model considered the fluid transport as pseudo multiphase flow because only liquid properties were assigned to the fluid in addition the chemical composition of the drilling fluid and its interaction with hydrates were not taken into account khurshid et al 2010 developed a wellbore temperature simulator to predict the thermal field near wellbore and to confirm the temperature disturbance during the drilling fluid circulation they found the drilling fluid temperature and bottom hole pressure could significantly affect hydrate dissociation around the borehole subsequently a fluid solid coupling model for studying wellbore stability in drilling of ghbs was proposed by li et al 2011 and then it was developed by their group to performed some numerical simulations on wellbore stability analysis during drilling i e li et al 2012 cheng et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 they found hydrate dissociation is very sensitive to drilling fluid temperature rather than drilling fluid density which can result in wellbore instability additionally prolonging the drilling fluid invasion time can also increase the risk of wellbore collapse however the effect of drilling fluid salinity on hydrate dissociation was not fully considered in this model sun et al 2018 analyzed the vertical wellbore stability during drilling through ghbs by coupling tough hydrate and flac3d the high pore pressure is likely to be generated near the wellbore triggered by the large amount of free gas to be released during drilling in addition the hydrate saturation decrease and the permeability increase in the surrounding sediment can also exacerbate wellbore stability cheng et al 2019 developed a porothermoelastic model to capture the temperature and pore pressure fields in the entire formation which are used to predict the hydrate stability and wellbore stability they indicated that there is low risk of hydrate dissociation for riserless drilling because the seawater cools the mud and a safe mud density window was determined for the vertical well in shenhu area however the effect of hydrate saturation variation caused by drilling disturbance on formation strength was not included afterwards wang et al 2019 suggested an elastic analytical solution for ghbs wellbore stability by diving the infinite region around wellbore into several annular areas with different physical properties considering the multi field coupled effects on the methane hydrate dissociation and geomechanical response but the formation was regarded as elastic so the responses after wellbore failure cannot be trapped similarly the impact of salt in the drilling fluid on hydrate dissociation was not considered in this study due to these deficiencies a new elastoplastic analytical solution for wellbore stability during drilling through marine ghbs was amended by guo et al 2020 meanwhile merey 2020 also analyzed wellbore stability conditions for deviated and horizontal wells in the shallow sediments of the mediterranean sea by lower hemisphere projections the results showed that extensive washouts were detected because the sediments within hydrate stability zone are weak and unconsolidated however the degree of washouts could be reduced by increasing the drilling fluid density in addition to these investigations some scholars mainly focused on the influences of bottom hole pressure and thermal field near the well on hydrate dissociation and then qualitatively analyzed the wellbore stability e g golmohammadi and nakhaee 2015 khabibullin et al 2011 lee et al 2015 recently several laboratory experiments were also performed to study the drilling fluid invasion on hydrate dissociation which aimed to optimize the drilling fluid design and inhibit hydrate dissociation in formation gao et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 but they disregarded the effect of geomechanical processes on the wellbore stability from the discussion above wellbore stability in ghbs is a complex multi field coupling process with phase transition it is evident that the geomechanical and geochemical processes are necessary to predict wellbore stability especially in marine ghbs where inorganic salts widely exist although the foregoing investigations have achieved promising results in wellbore stability prediction and control they mainly concentrate on vertical well drilling in addition the effect of mud cake formation on wellbore stability in ghbs and the potential secondary hydrate formation area in annulus space during the drilling fluid circulation are rarely assessed before according to the previous field trails performed in the mackenzie delta hancock et al 2005 yamamoto and dallimore 2008 the north slope of alaska david schoderbek et al 2013 the eastern nankai trough boswell 2013 yamamoto et al 2019 the qilian mountain permafrost sun et al 2014 and the south china sea li et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 it can be found that gas recovery from ghbs using the traditional vertical production well may be hard to reach commercial level as an alternative horizontal well is a promising option because of the more efficient hydrate dissociation in ghbs feng et al 2014 moridis et al 2009b ye et al 2020 which was also successfully drilled in the eastern nankai trough takahashi and tsuji 2005 and demonstrated in the second offshore hydrate production trial in shenhu area ye et al 2020 therefore conducting research on horizontal well stability during drilling in ghbs is extremely significant for future gas recovery enhancement in this work a numerical study on wellbore stability of an assumed horizontal well deployed at the first offshore hydrate production test site i e shsc 4 in china is performed using a thermo hydro mechanical and geochemical model with the consideration of drilling fluid invasion and pore water salinity effects in particular the effects of drilling fluid density temperature and salinity as well as initial hydrate saturation and irreducible water saturation on wellbore stability are fully investigated furthermore the potential secondary hydrate formation area in the annulus and the effect of mud cake on wellbore stability are also discussed this study can give insight into horizontal wellbore stability during drilling through ghbs and optimize the drilling operations to maintain horizontal wellbore stability and drilling fluid safe circulation 2 simulation model 2 1 geological background the study area mainly focuses on the first offshore field trial site in the pearl river mouth basin because a lot of available field data are reported in this region by the test team fig 1 which is the middle of the continental slope of southeast shenhu area northern south china sea li et al 2018 the water depth at this site is 1266 m and the overburden is 201 meters beneath the sea floor mbsf in 2017 the offshore production trial lasted for 60 days yielding approximately 3 0 105 m3 of gas li et al 2018 according to drilling and well logging at this site natural gas hydrate system can be divided into three intervals from top to bottom which are ghbs with a thickness of 35 m i e 201 236 mbsf three phase coexistence layer with a thickness of 15 m i e 236 251 mbsf and free gas layer with a thickness of 27 m i e 251 278 mbsf the lithology of all layers is clayey silt with high content of clay minerals which results in high bound water concentration more than 65 li et al 2018 thus the irreducible water saturation is assigned to be 0 7 in the simulations the porosity of three layers from top to bottom is 0 35 0 33 and 0 32 respectively and their corresponding mean permeability is 2 9 1 5 and 7 4 md based on the field logging curve li et al 2018 sun et al 2019a in this work the horizontal well assumed in the center of ghbs is mainly investigated according to the field survey the mean hydrate saturation in the ghbs is 34 li et al 2018 in addition the submarine temperature is approximately 4 c with a geothermal gradient of 45 339 k km based on the adjacent in situ measurements sun et al 2015a 2017 2019b 2 2 numerical approach the investigation on the horizontal wellbore stability during drilling in the ghbs involves flow thermal and geomechanical coupling processes because of the special characteristics of gas hydrates according to previous suggestions rutqvist et al 2009 2012 rutqvist and moridis 2009 linking the multiphysics code tough hydrate moridis 2014 to the geomechanical code flac3d itasca 2012 may be a feasible method to handle this issue the coupling numerical tool i e tough hydrate and flac3d has been widely used to predict gas production potential and reservoir stability during hydrate extraction before e g lin et al 2019 moridis et al 2013 moridis and kowalsky 2007 sun et al 2017 in 2018 we successfully demonstrated the possibility of vertical wellbore stability analysis considering drilling fluid invasion and the prediction results are qualitative in agreement with the field site observations sun et al 2018 therefore the numerical approach adopted is robust and employed again to quantitatively investigate the wellbore state of a hypothetical horizontal well at the first offshore production test site in shenhu area the kinetic model in tough hydrate was adopted as suggested by kowalsky and moridis 2007 because well drilling often expends a short period in this shallow area in this study the open hole time of horizontal section is assumed to be within 3 days meanwhile the mohr coulomb yielding criterion already incorporated in the geotechnical simulator i e flac3d was considered although this model shows some limitations to describe soil deformation sanchez et al 2017 it is appropriate to predict the formation failure which is the major target of this investigation specifically the following three methods are used to determine the wellbore instability together chen and jin 2012 1 the convergence criterion 2 displacement mutation criterion and 3 plastic zone criterion which can exactly trap the instability behavior during drilling 2 3 model construction as shown in fig 2 a horizontal well drilling in the ghbs is predicted it is designed to be deployed in the center of hydrate reservoir with a borehole radius of 0 108 m based on the previous filed horizontal well drilling campaign in the nankai trough matsuzawa et al 2006 the geometry of the study region represents 0 1 m of the horizontal well and can extend laterally because of symmetry only half of the simulation domain is studied which can accelerate computing speed specifically the length along the x axis is 5 m and the height along the z axis is 10 m which are sufficient to analyze the wellbore stability according to the previous studies ning et al 2013a b sun et al 2015b and a lot of trial computations on drilling fluid invasion in ghbs the wellbore pressure was estimated from hydrostatic pressure of downhole fluid column it should be noted that the dynamic well pressure during the drilling fluid circulation is not considered because the turbulence of drilling fluid is hard to represent in current simulation and we only emphasize change of the wellbore state during drilling and open hole i e the simulation includes the drilling process and the subsequent drilling fluid invasion process therefore the isotropic pressure as the drilling pressure is employed on the well wall because for gas recovery from ghbs riser system will be used meaning a closed system is adopted motghare and musale 2017 then the following formula can be used 1 p f p a t m p f g h z 10 6 where p f is wellbore pressure in mpa ρ f is drilling fluid density in kg m3 p atm is the standard atmospheric pressure i e 0 101325 mpa h is seawater depth in m z is the depth of sediment from the seafloor in m g is gravity acceleration in m s2 according to the prediction performed by li et al 2019 the fracture pressure of ghbs in shenhu area is 1 14 1 15 therefore the drilling fluid density is assigned to be 1060 kg m3 to predict wellbore stability which is a little higher than the initial pore pressure and the downhole pressure is around 15 54 mpa the corresponding downhole fluid temperature i e t f at z 218 5 mbsf is assumed to 15 2 c based on the adjacent site measurement at the same depth nakai et al 2007 according to calculation predicted by tough hydrate the phase equilibrium pressure at this temperature i e t f 15 2 c is about 16 03 mpa it is anticipated that hydrates around the wellbore will dissociate by the heating coming from the drilling fluid in addition natural gas hydrates in nature are usually buried in shallow deposits with unconsolidated characteristic so it can also be assumed that the initial pore pressure in ghbs is hydrostatic in the fluid thermal coupling analysis performed in tough hydrate hyndman et al 1992 similarly substituting the seawater density i e 1019 kg m3 for the drilling fluid density i e ρ f 1060 kg m3 in formula 1 can determine the pore pressure of the whole simulation system meanwhile the bottom water temperature at this site is approximately 4 c which combined with the geothermal gradient allows obtaining the initial temperature distribution in this domain after initialization it can be found that the hydrates are stable based on the hydrate phase equilibrium curve fig 3 besides these the downhole drilling fluid is assumed to be a fixed inner boundary which indicates the temperature pressure and salinity in the borehole is constant this inner boundary can be treated as a pseudo medium with a porosity φ 1 0 a high horizontal and vertical permeability k x k y k z 5 0 10 9 m2 and a capillary pressure p c 0 sun et al 2018 additionally the external boundaries including the top and bottom as well as the lateral boundary are also treated as the dirichlet boundaries table 1 presents the main modeling and drilling fluid parameters used in tough hydrate the geomechanical analysis is performed in flac3d and the same geometry is adopted for fluid thermal analysis in tough hydrate the horizontal wellbore stability prediction in this study can be considered as a plane strain model the downhole pressure is applied to the inner borehole wall and the geostatic stress is applied on the top and lateral boundaries based on a bulk density of deposits calculated from table 1 i e 2112 kg m3 the initial vertical total stress at the top of model is about 17 18 mpa the compressive stress is negative in flac3d then the vertical total stress of whole system can be obtained by increasing at a rate of 20 78 kpa m meanwhile the horizontal total stress at the corresponding depth is 16 13 mpa considering the lateral confinement condition similarly the initial horizontal stress can also be calculated with an increased rate of 15 77 kpa m because of symmetry a restriction of zero displacement normal to the x 0 plane is imposed in addition we also assume that there is no vertical displacement at the bottom of the model the main geomechanical properties employed in the analysis are shown table 2 the cohesion friction angle and poisson ratio of sediments at s h 0 are obtained from our laboratory tests using the field samples recovered from shenhu area because there are no tests on the available field samples with hydrate the relationships between geomechanical properties and hydrate saturation adopted in this simulation are mainly based on the tests using the in situ samples from the eastern nankai trough miyazaki et al 2010 yoneda et al 2015 in addition previous studies show that the friction angle is independent of hydrate saturation masui et al 2005 waite et al 2009 so it will remain constant during the simulation the dilation angle is also not considered in this investigation because our laboratory test and some similar research show that obvious strain hardening and shear shrinkage behaviors were observed for silty sediments with and without hydrate luo et al 2020 it is noted that these geomechanical properties e g stiffness and strength are not updated with porosity change the initial formation stress distributions of the whole simulation domain are shown in fig 4 2 4 domain discretization fig 5 shows the same meshes used for the simulation in both tough hydrate and flac3d as suggested by moridis et al 2007 2009 hydrate phase transitions as well as heat and mass transfer near the wellbore is drastic demanding a very fine discretization in the vicinity of the borehole therefore the meshes are refined in this region and the studied domain is discretized into 1020 grids in a cartesian system x y z as shown in fig 5 there are 40 inactive elements which are adopted to define the inner and outside boundaries due to this reason 4900 980 5 coupled equations will be solved at the same time when the kinetic model is executed in tough hydrate furthermore the mesh employed to perform the wellbore stability analysis in flac3d is fully the same which can contribute to link parameters in two codes 3 results and analysis wellbore stability of ghbs is closely related to the change of pore pressure caused by drilling fluid invasion and the degradation of reservoir strength resulted from hydrate dissociation mcconnell et al 2012 merey 2016 ning et al 2013b sun et al 2018 therefore it is critical to show the spatial evolutions of main physical properties during the horizontal well drilling process in this section the reference case i e ρ f 1060 kg m3 and t f 15 2 c was firstly analyzed in detail and then the effects of main drilling fluid and reservoir physical properties on horizontal wellbore stability were investigated in overbalanced drilling as shown in table 3 it is note that the mud cake is not considered in this part because the irreducible water saturation i e s ira 0 7 in most cases is higher than the initial water saturation i e s w 0 66 in formation except the sensitivity analysis on irreducible water saturation however the effect of mud cake on horizontal wellbore stability is specifically discussed in some typical cases shown in section 4 3 1 reference case fig 6 shows the spatial distribution evolutions of main physical properties around the wellbore it can be observed that the well pressure is significantly higher than that in the ghbs after the wellbore open however the pore pressure in the vicinity of the borehole does not display obvious variation within 3 days fig 6 a which is mainly due to the reason that the high irreducible water saturation is over the initial formation water saturation therefore the drilling fluid in the wellbore may not effectively invade into the ghbs and cause the pore pressure change this indicates that the high density drilling fluid in the wellbore is conducive to counteracting the stress relief after drilling and maintaining the wellbore stability despite the mass transfer fails to occur the heat transfer continuously takes place and causes the temperature rise near the wellbore because of the temperature difference between the wellbore and the reservoir fig 6 b due to this reason the hydrates will dissociate in this area and may significantly result in the decrease in formation strength exacerbating the horizontal wellbore stability according to fig 6 c it is clear that hydrates on the sidewall will rapidly dissociate at the beginning and then its saturation slowly decreases this phenomenon occurs mainly because the initial drilling fluid temperature is relatively high in the wellbore hydrate will sharply dissociate when they contact each other in addition the difference in the concentration of dissolved methane between the wellbore and reservoir can also accelerate hydrate dissolution bureau et al 2002 chapoy et al 2004 ou et al 2019 however the hydrate dissociation is an endothermic process which is mainly dependent on heat transfer if the drilling fluid is unlikely to effectively penetrate into the reservoir thus a sharp decrease in hydrate saturation around the wellbore can be observed at the beginning and the evolution trend declines gradually after that rapid reduction furthermore it can be found that hydrate saturation on the sidewall decreases only about 2 within 3 days so the drilling fluid still cannot effectively invade into the ghbs which can also demonstrate the distribution of pore pressure shown in fig 6 a as the continuous drilling fluid circulation free gas released from hydrate dissociation and salinity reduction caused by the dilution effect can also be discovered near the wellbore fig 6 d and e the free gas appears in the vicinity of the wellbore may alter the pore pressure distribution and decrease the effective stress in these areas which can increase the risk of wellbore instability the possible reason why no free gas appears in the early period is that only hydrate on the sidewall can dissociate at the early stage because the drilling fluid cannot invade into ghbs however there is no methane occurring in the drilling fluid during its circulation so the dissociated gas in the early period will be dissolved into water as the duration of reservoir exposure prolongs hydrates far from the sidewall can also dissociate slowly at the same time with the help of heat transfer from the drilling fluid therefore some free gas can trapped in the later period of simulation this can also be verified by the distribution of significant low salinity caused by the dilution effect at the later stage around the wellbore additionally the free gas released from hydrate dissociation is just a little so the pore pressure distribution is not obviously affected fig 7 exhibits the spatial evolutions of the yielding zone state and the displacements around the wellbore during the entire simulated process it can be observed that the formation adjacent to the wellbore will reach the yield condition because of stress release just after drilling especially in the right horizontal area it is interesting that the yielding range remains unchanged even though slight hydrates dissociate in the vicinity of the wellbore however the yielding zone state transition may occur during the whole prediction the possible reason is that drilling fluid is unlikely to invade into ghbs within 3 days which is unable to obviously affect pore pressure and effective stress distribution fig 6 a but hydrates still slightly dissociate near the wellbore due to heat transfer fig 6 c resulting in the mild decrease in formation strength therefore the yielding zone state can change during the simulation overall the sediments above and below the wellbore present tensile failure but the shear failure mainly occurs in the right part in order to quantitatively describe the well wall stability the displacements of some specific monitoring sites in the vicinity of the wellbore are depicted it is obvious that the displacements at different points mainly generate after the formation is just opened after that the displacements have little changes for the entire process the maximum displacement appears at the top of the horizontal well and the lowest deformation is at the z 0 plane specifically the displacements around the borehole just after drilling mainly range from 0 13 cm to 0 43 cm and then remain basically stable which indicates that there may be a lower risk of horizontal wellbore collapse in this case due to a limited deformation even though a small area near the borehole enters into yield phase however the drilling pipe sticking may occur during the operation it can be speculated that the possibility of wellbore instability will increase as the continuous hydrate dissociation in this case because the released free gas can disturb the pore pressure distribution and reduce sediment strength for the long term operation therefore increasing drilling rate and shortening drilling fluid circulation time as far as possible contribute to the horizontal wellbore stability at the first offshore test site in shenhu area 3 2 effect of drilling fluid density a high drilling fluid density in the wellbore is usually conducive to maintaining the wellbore stability and preventing the blowout when it is below formation fracture pressure gao et al 2018 therefore it is significant to develop a sound understanding of reservoir response caused by drilling in the ghbs using different mud density in this sensitivity analysis the same drilling fluid temperature and salinity i e 15 2 c and 3 5 respectively are kept when the drilling fluid density increases from 1060 to 1100 kg m3 these density values are inside the security density window in shenhu area as suggested by li et al 2019 fig 8 depicts the spatial distributions of pore pressure hydrate saturation and free gas saturation near the wellbore at t 3 days because the drilling fluid is unlikely to penetrate into ghbs in these cases due to the high initial irreducible water saturation it can be observed that the drilling fluid is limited to the wellbore even though its density is increasing because of the low initial water saturation in reservoir fig 8 a however this noninvasive behavior can assist to the wellbore stability because there is no obvious mud loss which is able to increase pore pressure and decrease hydrate saturation around the borehole in addition it also helps to reduce the damages to the reservoir similarly hydrate dissociation in the vicinity of the wellbore is limited due to the slow heat conduction but the dissociation extent will slightly increase with an increase in the drilling fluid density resulting in the slight decrease in formation strength fig 8 b a possible reason for this behavior is that methane solubility in water will obviously increase as the system pressure increases this phenomenon has been demonstrated by previous investigations during the drilling operations e g bureau et al 2002 li and huang 2016 thus hydrate saturation decrease caused by dissolution will increase in spite of the same temperature difference between the wellbore and reservoir in addition free gas around the wellbore does not exhibit significant diversity among three cases and only an inconspicuous distribution variation above the wellbore can be discerned when the drilling fluid density increases fig 8 c this can also be attributed to the methane solubility difference in diverse wellbore pressure conditions fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of yielding range and the displacement variations near the wellbore for various drilling fluid densities the yield range sharply decreases with an increase in the drilling fluid density because there is no obvious mud loss under these conditions fig 8 a which favors the wellbore stability by maximally using the fluid column pressure in the well to compensate geostress after drilling this means increasing the drilling fluid density as far as possible but below the fracture pressure at this site undoubtedly decrease the risk of wellbore collapse this conclusion can also be drawn from the evolutions of displacements near the borehole fig 9 it is obvious that the deformation around the wellbore will dramatically reduce as the drilling fluid density increases to be more specific the positive displacement at position x y z 0 108 0 0 can be observed when the drilling fluid density reaches to 1100 kg m3 thus increasing the drilling fluid density favors the wellbore stability if no significant mud loss occurs during drilling in the ghbs 3 3 effect of drilling fluid temperature the drilling fluid temperature in the annulus during the circulation is likely to rise because of the friction of the drilling tool sun et al 2018 this temperature increase may enhance the hydrate dissociation around the wellbore and give rise to the wellbore instability gao et al 2019 thus it is necessary to give major concern in horizontal wellbore stability caused by the drilling fluid temperature fig 10 shows the distribution evolutions of main physical properties affecting the wellbore stability near the borehole at different drilling fluid temperatures when the other parameters remain the same the pore pressure in the vicinity of the wellbore will increase as the drilling fluid temperature rises and can even exceed the well pressure fig 10 a resulting in the decrease in effective stress of the surrounding formation the higher the drilling fluid temperature the more obvious the phenomenon is this means the risk of wellbore collapse and even reservoir fracturing sharply increase with an increase in the drilling fluid temperature this behavior is mainly because hydrate dissociation is accelerated due to the more heat transfer from the higher temperature drilling fluid fig 10 b which releases a large amount of free gas around the wellbore and causes the pore pressure to increase in the surrounding sediments fig 10 c in addition some hydrates near the wellbore have fully dissociated because of high temperature favoring the drilling fluid invasion which can also increase the pore pressure and affect the free gas distribution in the neighbor sediments to some extent as shown in fig 10 b the dramatic hydrate dissociation around the wellbore will give rise to the degradation of formation strength within the dissociation front further exacerbating the instability of the borehole as discussed below fig 11 exhibits the spatial distributions of the yielding region and the evolutions of formation displacements in the surrounding sediments with different annular temperatures it is obvious that the yielding range dramatically expands with the increase of the drilling fluid temperature and for the cases of high annular temperatures the zone failure state changes significantly i e the single shear or tension failure will transform to the combination of both failure modes which can demonstrate the above qualitative analysis of wellbore stability to be specific some areas around the wellbore will collapse with an increase in the drilling fluid temperature based on the corresponding displacements at the monitoring points it is clear that the large deformation of the wellbore wall sharply generates within a very short period of time e g the displacements at positions x y z 0 0 0 108 x y z 0 076 0 0 076 and x y z 0 108 0 0 meaning the occurrence of wellbore collapse and the higher the drilling fluid temperature the earlier the wellbore collapse appears according to the monitoring histories the radial range with a thickness about 1 0 cm will fully collapse because the adjacent displacements sharply increase and do not tend to be stable if the drilling fluid temperature increases from 15 2 c to 19 2 c additionally the instability region may further expand in the yielding range if the drilling fluid invasion time prolongs therefore it is critical to warily adjust the drilling fluid circulation temperature to avoid wellbore instability or drilling pipe sticking during horizontal drilling operations in the ghbs 3 4 effect of drilling fluid salinity inorganic salt as a thermodynamic inhibitor is generally used to inhibit secondary gas hydrate formation in the annulus and to improve the drilling efficiency when drilling in the ghbs according to the investigation performed by zhao et al 2017 adding the high concentration of nacl can effectively avoid the hydrate formation and enhance the cleaning performance in the borehole but at the same time the high salinity is unfavorable for hydrate stability around the wellbore srungavarapu et al 2018 which may trigger wellbore collapse fig 12 a shows that the pore pressure near the wellbore is almost the same even though the salinity of the drilling fluid increases while the temperature and density are fixed this means the effective stress in the surrounding sediments also remains constant and this change may not increase the risk of horizontal wellbore instability this phenomenon occurs mainly because the drilling fluid cannot effectively invade into the ghbs with high irreducible water saturation which can also be demonstrated by the hydrate saturation distribution around the borehole fig 12 b despite the phase equilibrium temperature depression with the increase in the drilling fluid salinity the hydrate dissociation is not significantly accelerated because of no effective convection in the surrounding sediments it can be found that the hydrate saturation at the monitoring point just slightly decreases when using the high drilling fluid salinity in other words the geomechancial properties i e associated with the hydrate saturation decrease do not undergo much reduction helping to maintain the wellbore stability depending on hydrate dissociation only a little free gas can be observed around the wellbore and the difference among three conditions is negligible which is also unlikely to affect the pore pressure distribution fig 12 c in fig 13 the yielding ranges and displacements around the wellbore for different drilling fluid salinity are presented the ultimate yielding range does not expand with an increase in the drilling fluid salinity because the pore pressure and hydrate saturation mainly affecting wellbore stability are basically unchanged fig 12 due to the same reason the displacements at the corresponding monitoring points show almost the same evolution trend and only slight fluctuations can be observed possibly because the minor differences in hydrate saturation according to the simulation the high addition of inorganic salt to the drilling fluid at this site is conducive to inhibiting hydrate formation in the annulus without significantly affecting the horizontal wellbore stability 3 5 effect of hydrate saturation initial hydrate saturation in the sediments is usually not uniform which has been verified by the field surveys li et al 2018 yamamoto et al 2019 lin et al 2019 therefore the horizontal wellbore stability analysis incorporating different hydrate saturations is necessary fig 14 depicts the spatial evolutions of pore pressure hydrate saturation and gas saturation around the wellbore the effect of hydrate saturation on the horizontal wellbore stability at this site is extremely remarkable when decreasing the hydrate saturation because of the significant mass and heat transfer near the wellbore i e the initial water saturation is higher than irreducible water saturation it is clear that drilling fluid invasion and hydrate dissociation near the wellbore will accelerate with the decrease in hydrate saturation fig 14 a and b resulting in the reduction in effective stress and formation strength around the wellbore simultaneously these imply the risk of horizontal wellbore collapse will increase under the same drilling operation condition however there is no free gas generated and any gas released will be dissolved into water if decreasing the initial hydrate saturation fig 14 c thus the pore pressure increase is mainly attributed to drilling fluid invasion rather than free gas released from hydrate dissociation the lower the initial hydrate saturation is the more significant reduction in effective stress will be this is probably because the effective permeability in a formation with low hydrate saturation can sharply increase accelerating the drilling fluid invasion and hydrate dissociation in addition decreasing the initial hydrate saturation can also reduce the formation strength at the beginning to resist deformation after drilling therefore as the initial hydrate saturation decreases the formation strength will decline and the hydrate dissociation area and wellbore instability will exacerbate from the above analyses fig 15 shows the distributions of yield range and displacements around the wellbore with the change of initial hydrate saturation it is easy to understand that the yielding range will decrease as the initial hydrate saturation increases because of little increase in pore pressure and significant enhancement of formation strength it can be found that the maximum yielding range can decrease from 0 241 m to 0 14 m when initial hydrate saturation increases from 0 26 to 0 34 at this site in terms of wellbore wall displacements during the simulations it can be observed that the corresponding displacements in the surrounding sediments will dramatically increase when decreasing the initial hydrate saturation meaning the risk increase of wellbore instability the maximum horizontal displacement will reach to approximately 1 05 cm if the initial hydrate saturation decreases to 0 26 which indicates that wellbore collapse or drilling pipe sticking is more likely to occur during drilling 3 6 effect of irreducible water saturation irreducible water saturation of ghbs is a very important reservoir parameter which may significantly influence the drilling fluid invasion in order to clarify its effect the sensitivity analysis on irreducible water saturation is also performed fig 16 exhibits the spatial distributions of main physical properties around the wellbore after drilling at different times there is a significant difference in drilling fluid invasion behavior when the initial formation water saturation is above or below the irreducible water saturation this means the wellbore stability may also be sharply affected when the initial water saturation is over the irreducible water saturation the drilling fluid losses will occur and increase the pore pressure in the surrounding sediments fig 16 a in addition the convective heat transfer is intensified near the wellbore thereby accelerating hydrate dissociation fig 16 b both of them can result in the wellbore instability because of the reductions in the effective stress and formation strength it is interesting that the further decrease in irreducible water saturation has almost no influence however the invasion cannot be observed when the initial formation water saturation is below the irreducible water saturation and only slight hydrate dissociation occurs due to heat conduction which can be demonstrated by the spatial distributions of pore pressure and free gas saturation fig 16 a and c in addition there is no free gas if the irreducible water saturation is below the initial water saturation which may be conducive to wellbore stability because the pore pressure cannot further change the possible reason is that the released gas dissolves into the water under the high pore pressure and displacement fig 17 shows the corresponding distributions of yielding range and displacements around the wellbore under the conditions of different irreducible water saturations it is obvious that the yielding range will significantly expand near the wellbore if the irreducible water saturation decreases to below initial formation water saturation i e 0 66 and the final yield range is the same even though the irreducible water saturation further decreases these phenomena can also be demonstrated by the evolution of displacements in the vicinity of wellbore the deformation will exacerbate once the irreducible water saturation reduces to below 0 66 and the same evolution path of displacements will be observed in the two cases i e 0 60 and 0 65 the maximum displacement around the wellbore may reach to 0 736 cm which illustrates that drilling pipe sticking and even wellbore collapse may generate during horizontal well drilling in general the wellbore stability is mainly dependent on the relative magnitudes of initial formation water saturation and irreducible water saturation 4 discussion 4 1 secondary hydrate formation risk assessment as mentioned above hydrate dissociation is easy to appear during drilling in the ghbs and the released free gas is likely to enter the annulus and form secondary hydrate lou and liang 2020 therefore in this section the possible secondary hydrate formation area is mainly discussed based on the sensitivity analysis on the drilling fluid temperature because a large amount of free gas is produced in these cases as shown in fig 18 a the free gas released will flow into the wellbore due to differential pressure when increasing the drilling fluid temperature it can be observed that there is no free gas entering the annulus if the initial bottom hole temperature is 15 2 c meaning the low risk of secondary hydrate formation note that methane solubility difference is not considered along the annulus because of the different pressure and temperature fig 18 b however the free gas will gradually flow into the annulus with an increase in the drilling fluid temperature and the higher temperature will give rise to the earlier free gas entrance which is likely to form secondary hydrate and block circulation channel in addition the gas cut can cause the drilling fluid gasification and affect the drilling efficiency and safety in order to quantitatively characterize the potential secondary hydrate formation range we introduce the corresponding drilling fluid temperature measured in adjacent site i e site sh2 performed in 2007 nakai et al 2007 and the phase equilibrium temperature for a fixed drilling fluid density 1060 kg m3 and salinity 3 5 it should be noted that the drilling fluid density is assumed to be constant in this analysis in fact it may be slightly changed by the released gas invasion under the high drilling fluid temperature in general the possibility of secondary hydrate formation is relatively low when maintaining the bottom hole temperature at 15 2 c in contrast the risk of secondary hydrate formation can sharply increase with the increase of drilling fluid temperature specifically it is speculated that the potential secondary hydrate formation depth is above 146 67 mbsf for a bottom hole temperature of 17 2 c while the potential area will reduce to above 84 44 mbsf if the drilling fluid temperature at the bottom is 19 2 c it should be noted that hydrate may dissociate again above the seafloor because of heat transfer from the surrounding seawater which is beyond the scope of this study and not discussed here 4 2 effect of mud cake it is well known that mud cake will form under dynamic filtration during drilling fluid circulation which is usually beneficial to alleviate filtrate loss and stabilize the wellbore because high irreducible water saturation is confirmed in the silt clay reservoir at the first offshore production test site in shenhu area causing no obvious drilling fluid loss in most cases so the mud cake effect is not considered in above research however the high drilling fluid temperature or the low hydrate and irreducible water saturation can also give rise to the significant drilling fluid invasion therefore it is necessary to clarify the difference among these situations in this part the sediment response around the wellbore under the typical cases i e the drilling fluid temperature is 19 2 c and the initial hydrate saturation is 26 are discussed in detailed according to the laboratory permeability measurements of low permeability sandstone a few millidarcy to dozens of millidarcy during drilling fluid invasion performed by wang 2015 the maximum ratio of mean permeability damage can reach 74 7 in addition some similar permeability tests on mud cake are also carried out using different drilling fluid compositions which shows that the permeability ranges from 0 00253 md to 3 413 md fu et al 2013 therefore in this work it is assumed that a thin mud cake forms on the well wall and its permeability is 0 0725 md 1 40 absolute permeability of ghbs 4 2 1 high temperature drilling fluid case i e 19 2 c fig 19 shows the spatial distribution evolutions of pore pressure hydrate saturation and gas saturation near the wellbore with without mud cake it can be found that the pore pressure distribution at the beginning between two cases is almost the same but the significant difference can be observed in the later period fig 19 a the low permeability mud cake on the well wall may slightly expand the relatively high pore pressure area around the wellbore in the drilling process which may be unfavorable for horizontal wellbore stability the possible reason is that the high drilling fluid temperature accelerates hydrate dissociation and thus a large amount of free gas is released but the dissociated gas flowing into the well will be hindered due to this low permeability mud cake in contrast the released gas can enter the annulus continuelly under pressure differential if the mud cake effect is not taken into account this can also be demonstrated by the spatial distribution of free gas with high saturation near the wellbore fig 19 c and the rate evolution of total methane gas flowing into the wellbore fig 20 meanwhile the low permeability mud cake is able to relieve the drilling fluid invasion and decrease the hydrate dissociation extent in the surrounding sediments which is conducive to maintaining the horizontal wellbore stability fig 19 b due to the same reason an obvious difference in the free gas distribution in the later period can be observed additionally the methane enters into the annulus can be delayed and the inflow volume can be reduced especially at the early drilling fluid circulation stage thus it may be beneficial to control secondary hydrate formation in the annulus and relieve blowout risk during the horizontal well drilling the corresponding distributions of yielding range and displacements around the wellbore in both cases are depicted in fig 21 the final yielding range in the surrounding sediments will slightly increase using the high temperature drilling fluid if the mud cake forms on the well wall this is mainly caused by the high pore pressure distribution near the wellbore fig 19 a although the mud cake forms on the well wall it may still not avoid wellbore collapse near the borehole e g the positions at x y z 0 0 0 108 x y z 0 076 0 0 076 and x y z 0 108 0 0 the formation displacements at a little distance from the wellbore at the top and right parts could be significantly decreased however the corresponding displacements in the direction of 45 may slightly increase it is expected that the mud cake formation contributes to maintaining the wellbore stability because it may avoid continuous large displacement around the wellbore in spite of the fact that the yielding range may slightly increase 4 2 2 low hydrate saturation case i e 26 fig 22 exhibits the spatial evolutions of pore pressure and hydrate saturation around the borehole during the simulations in two conditions additionally the predictions show that under these situations there is no free gas and the released gas is mainly dissolved in water the reservoir response near the wellbore is clearly different from that using the high temperature drilling fluid shown in section 4 2 1 the mud cake formation on the well wall can dramatically avoid mud losses and mitigate the drilling fluid invasion depth for the reservoir with relatively low hydrate saturation fig 22 a thus the pore pressure increase in the surrounding sediments will be suppressed which is favorable for horizontal wellbore stability meanwhile the hydrate dissociation extent near the wellbore will decrease facilitating the horizontal wellbore stability due to the fact that heat and mass transfer from the well to the sediments is weakened fig 22 b from this viewpoint the corresponding final yielding range and displacements near the wellbore are likely to decrease if the low permeability mud cake forms which can be demonstrated by the predictions shown in fig 23 it is anticipated that the yielding range will obviously shrink because of the favorable slurry retaining wall effect moreover the sediment deformations around the wellbore can be significantly decreased at different monitoring points and the maximum displacement on the well wall can reduce by 0 4 cm these results confirm that forming the low permeability mud cake helps to maintain the wellbore stability and reduce the risk of drilling pipe sticking when performing horizontal well drilling in the low hydrate saturation reservoir at this site 5 conclusions and suggestions in this study horizontal wellbore state of a hypothetical well during drilling at the first offshore hydrate production test site i e shsc 4 in shenhu area was evaluated by numerical simulations and the sensitivity analyses including drilling fluid properties hydrate saturation and irreducible water saturation on the wellbore stability were also performed based on these simulations the potential secondary hydrate formation range and the effect of mud cake on the wellbore stability were also discussed in detail the following conclusions can be drawn from this investigation 1 the drilling fluid is unlikely to invade into the ghbs with high irreducible water saturation at this site and hydrate dissociation is mainly derived from heat conduction caused by temperature difference between the wellbore and reservoir when the bottom hole temperature is 15 2 c the wellbore is unlikely to collapse because of the limited displacement after drilling at this site even though some areas may enter the yielded state however the drilling pipe sticking is possible to occur because the deformation caused by stress release can be trapped around the wellbore therefore improving the drilling fluid lubricity and keeping solid control are beneficial to avoid operation accidents when performing the horizontal well drilling at this site 2 increasing the drilling fluid density and salinity at this site may slightly accelerate hydrate dissociation around the wellbore but these effects on wellbore stability are negligible compared to the slurry retaining wall effect if there is no obvious drilling fluid loss and temperature increase therefore increasing the drilling fluid density facilitates the horizontal wellbore stability and adding a small amount of inorganic salts into the drilling fluid may not affect wellbore stability in this area which can also inhibit secondary hydrate formation simultaneously in addition a significant increase in the drilling fluid temperature may be a disaster that rapid hydrate dissociation and pore pressure increase appear causing the sharp risk increase of horizontal wellbore instability which illustrates the drilling fluid temperature should be carefully controlled 3 the risk of wellbore collapse increases with a decrease in initial hydrate saturation due to the severe drilling fluid invasion and relatively low sediment strength therefore the horizontal well deployed in the ghbs with high saturation is more preferred in addition the irreducible water saturation of ghbs may also significantly affect drilling fluid losses and wellbore stability which is mainly dependent on the relative magnitudes of initial formation water saturation and irreducible water saturation in short the horizontal well drilled in the ghbs with relatively high irreducible water saturation i e above the initial formation water saturation may maintain the wellbore stability more efficiently 4 the high temperature drilling fluid can not only exacerbate hydrate dissociation and wellbore instability during horizontal well drilling in the ghbs but also trigger the risks of secondary hydrate formation and blowout although the formation of low permeability mud cake is conducive to reducing filtrate loss the wellbore instability can still not be avoided if the high temperature drilling fluid is adopted for the reservoir with low hydrate saturation the mud cake on the well wall is able to significantly alleviate the drilling fluid invasion and decrease hydrate dissociation in the surrounding sediments which favors the wellbore stability thus it is necessary to form the low permeability mud cake on the well wall to stabilize the horizontal wellbore such as

machines additionally improved rul predictions can be achieved by combining data from distinct rope types subject to different test conditions keywords fibre rope offshore lifting remaining useful life machine learning 1 introduction fibre ropes are increasingly used for lifting operations however there are still issues related to the implementation the material advantages of fibre rope are well documented foster 2002 faria et al 2017 as well as issues inhibiting their immediate implementation connected to creep thermal response during cyclic bend over sheave and lack of available data regarding their implementation in offshore construction cranes to be able to exploit this potential fully more advanced maintenance routines must be established to challenge the status quo of manual inspection established by dnvgl 2017 there is significant potential and benefits with regards to avoiding premature retirement and reducing the chance of failure during operation through the development of intelligent maintenance methods for fibre ropes automation of manual processes and structured data driven approaches to quantify historical health data damage progression and physical measurements can lead to more informed decisions regarding rope condition and remaining useful life rul through more frequent documented state observation establishing and verifying these methods would also signal a shift from time based maintenance and reactive maintenance strategies to condition based and predictive maintenance approaches positive implications of this include preventing failure of rope during operation from an undetected fault decreasing operation downtime for routine inspections and avoiding retiring ropes with substantial remaining useful life other sectors have implemented approaches for rul estimation based on machine learning with several reviews available detailing specific implementations nguyen et al 2019 fink et al 2020 lei et al 2018 diez olivan et al 2019 sutharssan et al 2015 khan and yairi 2018 however this study will focus on the use of data driven approaches through machine learning applied to fibre rope condition monitoring data for rul prediction from cyclic bend over sheave cbos testing while the application of machine learning for prognostics and health management in fibre rope condition monitoring is not as established in the publicly accessible research domain these applications have seen successes in other fields much like other engineering components fibre ropes have damage mechanisms and physical changes that can be detected by sensors which can be used in machine learning approaches offshore fibre rope use in particular is concerned with rul related to time tension and temperature as advocated by industry standards by dnvgl 2015 and abs 2011 previous studies into rope behaviour detailing cbos testing also advocated acquiring this data törnqvist et al 2011 moving rope inspection from manual visual methods to computer vision opens up possibilities in machine learning and intelligent data driven assessment of fibre rope condition there are several examples of rul prediction methods for fibre ropes rul methods for fibre ropes have been mainly based on empirical evidence where a number of studies with cbos testing have been conducted for both steel and fibre ropes of several different diameters vennemann et al 2008 davies et al 2015 novak et al 2017 horigome and endo 2018 schmieder and golder 2020 nuttall 2010 detailed a modified version of the feyrer model for fibre ropes in lifting operations in conjunction with cbos testing there has also been other modelling approaches related to cbos motion in rope as detailed by frick et al 2019 and sloan 2019 other model based and experimental approaches to estimate service life have also been applied to hmpe ropes under tension tension regimes as seen in mooring as shown by humeau et al 2018 and asane et al 2020 addtionally lian et al 2015 detailed a model based on thermodynamic properties of fibres yarns and ropes and compared predictions to tensile tests some patents also incorporate discard parameters into a wider fibre rope monitoring system examples of this are provided by mupende and zerza who detail similar patents where a discard signal is created from monitoring rope and environmental parameters mupende and zerza 2014 2018 2019 in the context of lifting operations machine learning has been applied for prognostics and health management in steel ropes with a focus on mining hoists where data acquisition is more mature and readily available oland et al 2017 onur et al 2019 used neural networks to predict rul of steel wire rope in cbos testing and compared the performance to feyrer models at different loads and diameter ratios xue et al 2020 used a form of support vector machines to classify steel wire rope condition based on vibration data and zhou et al 2018 used convolutional neural networks cnn applied to images for classifying faults in balancing tail ropes for mine shaft hoisting operations finally huang et al 2020 also applied a cnn approach and computer vision techniques that detect surface damage in steel wire ropes the contribution of the present article can be summarised as follows machine learning based methods are presented for rul prediction of fibre rope during cbos testing the methods comprise neural networks nn support vector machines svm and random forest rf which are applied to data extracted from computer vision and thermal monitoring all approaches predict a target variable known as the rul factor rf which is based on the number of cycles left to failure occur during testing the various model performances are then assessed for their effectiveness based on both qualitative and quantitative means conditions that are assessed to find the best methods for rul assessment include variation of hyperparameters in the models and variations in the variables included in training the models the approach of combining data from two rope types under different test conditions for training and rul prediction is also explored to the authors knowledge there is no publicly available detailed study into the application of machine learning for rul prediction specifically for fibre ropes intended for offshore lifting until now this paper thus presents the application of existing methods for fibre rope condition monitoring and is not intended to develop the algorithms further the paper is organised as follows the machine learning frameworks and how their performance is assessed in this context are detailed in section 2 the experimental study and data sets are summarised in section 3 and the results of the various approaches are shown in section 4 the results are then discussed in section 5 before further work is considered and conclusions are offered 2 applied methods 2 1 target variable rul factor a target variable is required for regression analysis in ml and will act as the value to be predicted based on training data used in the modelling process the target variable used in this study is hereby referred to as the rul factor rf a fraction defined by eq 1 1 rf ctf t c t f t e s t where rf denotes the rul factor ctf t is the number of cycles to failure at the time of measurement and c t f t e s t is the amount of cycles at failure in each individual test where the measurements are made this produces a value that starts at 1 representing start of life and ends at 0 representing end of life respectively i e 100 and 0 fig 1 shows an example of damage progression in a section from a rope a5 at various rf with the different stages highlighted by decreasing rf from a through to d the images show that as rf decreases the subsection becomes longer and there is more visible wear as shown by ruptured strands and extruded loops the errors of the predictions made by the various approaches will be based on comparison to the rf as the cbos tests are performed at a constant tension rf is related to the accumulated damage d from palmgren miner s rule as shown in eq 2 2 rf 1 d as the cbos tests progress there is accumulated damage in the form of ruptured stands and compromised sub ropes the rope is extended further as the true rf values drop to lower values therefore the reduction in rope residual strength and thereby the retirement criteria in the experiments can be related to the non linear progression of the global elongation of the rope 2 2 neural networks the nn structures designated as nn1 and nn2 used in this study are detailed in tables 1 and 2 and are implemented using the keras library chollet 2015 with a tensorflow backend abadi et al 2016 the number of inputs in the input layer for both architectures correspond to the number of features n f e a t s used from the data extracted from the ropes during cbos testing the hidden layers are of a dense layer type with a specified number of neurons and a rectified linear unit relu activation function that introduces non linearity to the data both architectures use dropout layers that will randomly prevent 20 of the neuron outputs from proceeding through the network this is a regularisation technique used to prevent overfitting the final output layer consists of one neuron coupled with a sigmoid activation function that produces a value between 0 and 1 as a result this is done to reflect the previously described rf in section 2 1 the adam optimisation function was used for both network architectures specified in tables 1 and 2 to update the weight values associated with the input features the inputs are fed forward and backpropagated through the networks for 50 epochs with the model that produces the lower mean square error mse on the test data being saved as the best model used for predictions each configuration is simulated 20 times to account for randomness in the weights assigned in the neural network and give a more robust value for model output the average prediction calculated from these instances is used to compare to the ground truth rf measured from the cbos tests and provide a confidence interval 2 3 support vector machine svm was first used for classification by cortes and vapnik 1995 and was later adapted for regression problems by vapnik et al 1997 to predict the rf in this context the latter approach is adopted which has also been applied in other studies related to rul prediction such as garcía nieto et al 2015 essentially the data is separated by a hyperplane in a higher vector space this plane can be formed by use of a kernel in a classification implementation this line is used to separate the measured vectors into classes but for the regression analysis it will be used to predict a continuous variable for the other instances in the data set to compare to the performance of the nn it is chosen to use an svm framework adapted for regression analysis from scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 linear and gaussian kernels are used to form the fit to the data and to compare their relative accuracy to rf are compared to other methods 2 4 random forest rf is an example of an ensemble method which utilises a user specified number of decision trees created by bootstrapping data from features and data available from a training pool breiman 2001 and kundu et al 2020 the models created will assign rul values to the test samples in each individual tree and an average rul value will be calculated the rf algorithm for regression analysis from scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 is used for rf prediction the configurations for rf implementation in each data set are specified in table 3 for data sets a and b different tree depths are chosen due to the difference in number of measurements available between the different data sets and to prevent overfitting the differences between the data sets are highlighted in table 5 3 experimental study fig 2 details the flowchart of operations implemented in the ml process from beginning to final output and performance assessment specific details related to a test methods and b data acquisition are summarised in section 3 1 and the subsequent pre processing techniques applied to the data for ml application in section 3 2 then in sections 3 3 and 3 4 the c training and rul estimation stages and d model assessment are detailed 3 1 test methods and data acquisition the data sets were recorded from cbos experiments performed at the mechatronics innovation lab in grimstad norway the fibre ropes used in testing were 12 strand braided ropes with nominal diameter of 28 mm the two types used were five samples of dyneema dm20 xbo and four samples of samson amsteel blue which are designated as separate campaigns a and b respectively additionally a is tested at safety factor sf 11 and b is tested at sf 8 this equates to average tensions of 1 11 and 1 8 of each rope type s max tensile capacity features are engineered from data recorded during cbos testing and the ropes were separated into different zones that reflect the distinct bending regimes during cbos testing as highlighted in fig 3 the acronyms sz sbz and dbz refer to straight zone single bend zone and double bend zone respectively these are the positions in the rope where the rope is bending and unbending due to the cyclic movement of the sheaves no bending occurs in section sz a single bend occurs during each cycle in sbz and two bends occur in the dbz during one cycle the computer vision setup takes account of the whole rope surface with four edmund optics 13122c cameras placed around the rope as shown in fig 4 this takes into account that degradation will not be uniform around the rope and the different camera perspectives can view this computer vision data is recorded for 2000 images corresponding to 13 15 complete cycles every 1000 cycles a flir a6753sc thermal camera is placed next to the test sheave of the cbos machine as shown in fig 5 it was set to sample at 100 hz for 2000 images resulting in a 20 s video for each period this was sufficient to record at least one full cycle in the cbos test temperatures are only available for the lumped zones sz sbz and dbz the global length elongation was measured by a fluke 414d distance measuring laser that tracked the extension of the cbos machine hydraulic cylinder as the tests progressed the sensor has an accuracy of 2 0 mm computer vision data is extracted via algorithms developed in opencv bradski 2000 the geo data represents the local length and width measurements and values for each recording are thus aggregated to give median maximum minimum and standard deviations for these geometric features the therm data represents thermal measurements taken from the thermal camera and extracted using flir researchir 4 software flir 2015 these are the temperature values within the rope part of each relevant image are aggregated as average maximum minimum and standard deviation a list of features and their respective bending zones are summarised in table 4 specific details of the various operations the algorithms used to extract data are summarised in previous work detailing the various cbos testing campaigns by falconer et al 2020 3 2 data pre processing the data sets are separated into geo and geo therm feature sets based on data type to assess the effect of adding thermal features to the ml model the data set compositions are summarised in table 5 the records are the number of data samples recorded by the data acquisition set up mentioned in section 3 1 the ropes used in campaign b were tested at a higher tension and failed sooner than those in campaign a hence the lower number of records in b compared to a the number of features is found by multiplying the number of zones by the number of statistical parameters for each type of data e g 8 4 8 4 1 65 for geometric features and 3 5 1 16 for thermal features the raw measurements from the data acquisition phase are subject to pre processing where the data from the various features is standardised the data was scaled using the approach detailed in eq 3 3 z i y i y σ y where z i is the individual standardised value y i is the individual raw value y is the average of all readings for the specific feature in the rope sample and σ y is the standard deviation of all readings for the specific feature in the rope sample this is done for each rope in the data set to increase comparability between the different samples and is a standard pre processing step to prepare data for ml application 3 3 training and rul estimation the models are tested through leave one out cross validation loocv where rf predictions made on a single rope will be made using models trained with the remaining ropes in the data set this process is done separately for both ropes in campaign a and campaign b and as a combined data set with both a and b together in addition to investigating the effect of only geometric and combined geometric and thermal measurements as outlined in table 5 different combinations of features from the various bending zones detailed in fig 3 are also trained and tested this includes testing using all zones using only sbz and dbz measurements and finally using only dbz measurements 3 4 model assessment the metrics used for model assessment are root mean square error rmse and r 2 score r 2 4 rmse 1 n n 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 5 r 2 1 s s r e s s s t o t where n is the number of measurements made for each rope sample y i is the observed rf at instance i y ˆ i is the predicted rf at instance i s s r e s is the sum of squares of residuals and s s t o t is the total sum of squares rmse in this context will give an insight into how concentrated the rf predictions are around the rf ground truth using each algorithm configuration outlined in section 2 additionally the r 2 score gauges the correlation rf predictions have with the ground truth rf using the input variables outlined in table 4 the performance of the models is assessed through the use of rf graphs and residual analysis the rf graphs will include the ground truth from the observed experimental measurements and tolerance bounds at 20 based on this data the average rf prediction and a 95 confidence interval of the repeated simulations of each distinct configuration are compared to the ground truth and tolerance bounds the residual values e are calculated using eq 6 6 e y i y ˆ i where y i are the rul values from cbos testing and y ˆ i are the predictions made by each respective model the analysis includes plotting the residual values against the predicted rf values the actual rf value against the predicted rf value and finally a histogram analysis accounting for the numerical spread of the residual values this provides further information about the model ability to predict rf potential model bias and where overestimation and underestimation in rope health occurs 4 results 4 1 experimental results the amount of cycles at failure for all ropes in campaigns a and b are summarised in table 6 it is noted that there is a wider spread of values in a than b ropes a1 and a4 were shown to fail at lower amounts of cycles compared to the other ropes in campaign a this is owed to the rope failing at the driving sheave rather than the test sheave due the method used parts of the splice were in contact with the sheave during testing and lead to premature failure of the rope samples the features monitored at the test sheave in ropes a1 and a4 did not develop as much as those in a2 a3 and a5 but all ropes showed the same patterns in progression of global elongation through out every test this included a period of accelerated elongation of global length towards the failure of the rope moreover rope a5 completed a greater number of cycles than the rest of the ropes in campaign a this particular sample included an attempt to embed thermocouples within the strands of the rope and therefore could have contributed to slight discrepancy in the results some halts in logging occurred sporadically during cbos testing for campaign a meaning data acquisition equipment had to be restarted occasionally furthermore features for rope b1 were recorded every 1000 cycles and has less data compared to the other campaign b ropes which were recorded every 500 cycles this change was made as a reaction to the comparatively shorter test times for campaign b than campaign a 4 2 average metrics a quantitative assessment of rf prediction is performed by calculating the average r m s e and r 2 scores in each data set using different feature sets better performance is reflected by lower and higher values for r m s e and r 2 respectively the results for different feature combinations are compared for both a and b rope datasets and ranked by performance of the algorithm on only using geometric features i e a geo with a model and b geo with b model the results using the various feature combinations cross validated on a combined a and b rope data set are also presented fig 6 gives an overview of each algorithm performance based on different feature sets and training model composition it is seen that both configurations of rf performed best followed by nn and finally svm based on producing the lowest r m s e scores introducing thermal features generally either changes nothing or leads to detriment in performance when only a ropes are used as training data which is particularly noticeable in both nn and svm when the combined a and b model is used there is shown to be a slight improvement in performance when thermal features are introduced for nn when the sbz dbz and dbz feature sets are considered there is also shown to be a general reduction of r m s e as the number of zones used in the training are decreased this performance is also reflected in the r 2 values as shown in fig 7 as seen with the r m s e data types feature sets and model compositions influenced the algorithms differently the r 2 values for both rf configurations are shown to be the highest followed by nn and svm the high values recorded for r 2 indicate that the features used to create the rf models better explain the changes in rf it is seen that by using both a and b data to train the nn configurations that a higher r 2 is achieved than by only using a indicating that the same feature with enhanced data from different ropes better explain the changes in rf this is also seen for both svm configurations but had little impact on rf the r m s e values for data set b are shown in fig 8 both configurations of nn were shown to perform best when only b data is considered a noticeable difference in the b data is that for both nn and svm the thermal data led to significantly better predictive performance as indicated by lower r m s e using the combined a and b data set also improved performance of nn with the exception of the nn2 configuration in the sbz dbz feature set the combined a and b data set has a detrimental impact on the rf configuration with depth one the r 2 scores for the same algorithms using the b rope data set are shown in fig 9 the highest r 2 values are achieved with nn with improvements being shown when thermal data is introduced it is noted that higher r 2 is recorded using a and b data for training when only geometric features are considered but similar values are seen for b only and a and b combined when thermal features are introduced rf is shown to have similar r 2 values no matter what features are used there is also a noticeable increase in r 2 for svm gaussian when the combined a and b data set is considered 4 3 rul graphs a qualitative assessment of the algorithm performance during cross validation is given through plotting the predicted rf at various cycles throughout each test it is possible to gain a general idea of algorithm performance from the graphs but they can also reveal at which times in the test both the best and worst predictions are made the results of cross validation predictions made only using the single and combined data sets is also considered selected rul prediction results from both a and b data sets are shown in figs 10 11 12 and 13 fig 10 shows the results of rf prediction using nn2 for geometric features from all bending zones for rope a4 by using the combined a and b data set the predictions in the first half of the test are shown to be closer to the ground truth as well as showing a reduction in the overestimation peak seen in the middle of the a ropes model the method was still shown to overestimate from 50 000 cycles until failure but was slightly improved with the addition of all ropes to the model fig 11 presents the results for rf prediction for rope a3 using rf at tree depth 4 using geometric features from all bend zones as shown in the previous r m s e results for rf the combined a and b training data performed either the same or to slight decrease in performance which is reflected in the rf graphs there is a noticeable period of overestimation in the combined a and b model between 40 000 and 60 000 cycles but returns to being closer to rul just after additionally both models have very small confidence intervals compared to the nn configurations fig 12 considers the predictions by nn2 on rope b2 when both geometric and thermal features from the dbz are considered the confidence interval in the prediction is significantly reduced and almost totally confined to the tolerance bounds this is seen at the majority of test times with the exception of between 0 to 40 000 test cycles the overestimation in the b model from 4000 cycles until failure is also corrected to being closer to the true rul values by introducing the a rope data fig 13 shows the rf prediction results of using svm with a linear kernel when using geometric and thermal features from the dbz the model trained using the b ropes data is shown to significantly overestimate rope health after around 11 000 cycles but when the a and b data is included this period of rf predictions is corrected albeit with some underestimation after 12 000 cycles 4 4 residual analysis a residual analysis is performed to further investigate rf predictions and to compare the differences in results depending on algorithm features and training data used fig 14 shows the residual analysis comparison of using rf with tree depth 4 and nn2 predictions for rope a2 using only geometric features from all bend zones in this specific case both models were trained using only the a rope data the rf model produces low residual values indicating closer agreement with the ground truth while nn2 prediction are shown to both overestimate and underestimate as indicated by the spread of residual values fig 15 presents the residual analysis comparison of using geometric and the combined geometric and thermal features this is done for rope b3 predictions made using nn2 with features from the dbz by including thermal data the magnitude of all residuals is reduced to be within 0 1 of the rf ground truth when comparing predicted and actual rf values predictions are more effective generally but there is little effect on improving the predictions at the end of the test fig 16 provides analysis of improvements that are possible by combining the a and b rope data sets in model training this is presented for rope a1 with nn2 using combined geometric and thermal data from all bend zones an improvement with the combined training set is observed with magnitude of the outermost outliers being reduced rope a1 completed the least amount of cycles at failure when compared to the other ropes in the a data set and showed poor prediction results on models trained on this data set 5 discussion model performance varied depending on the algorithm and the data set used a major difference shown was that rf performs better than nn for campaign a but nn performs better than rf in campaign b differences in performance can be explained by the training data used the size of the data set and algorithm mechanisms 5 1 recorded data and availability two of the ropes in campaign a ropes a1 and a4 broke where the rope splice was bent over the driving sheave this led to earlier failure than for the other ropes of the campaign and to failure which was not located where the cameras were at the test sheave still the failure mechanism was very similar to what caused failure in the other ropes tested in this study rf frequently identified the global elongation as the most important split variable in line with this overall sameness of failure mechanism of all ropes tested this variable showed a similar development for all ropes including ropes a1 and a4 it was chosen to include the ropes in the analysis a choice that has two positive effects excluding them would have lead to even less data for training the machine learning algorithm and as discussed earlier cbos test data are time consuming and expensive to obtain secondly in real life ropes will not always break where expected including ropes a1 and a4 in the data set makes the models able to handle some such cases where the deviation from the expectation is not too large the model stability is addressed through the 95 confidence interval for the predictions it was found that combining campaigns a and b in all cases resulted in a narrower confidence interval than from each of the campaigns alone for unstable models adding new samples is expected to change the model qualitatively resulting in wider confidence intervals conversely the present study s narrowing of the confidence intervals indicates a stable model 5 2 random forest rf is formed of several individual decision trees where data is separated based on feature values that give the purest split the global elongation shows a steady increase during testing and it will therefore create one of the best splits in the decision trees of the rfs however this feature will not be available to all trees in the forest due to feature bagging still the averaging over 200 trees will ensure its contribution to the overall forests this is shown in the residual analysis performed in fig 14 where rf has outperformed nn2 rf was also shown to have a steady balance between slight overestimation and underestimation of predicted rf compared to the true value in general increased tree depth increases random forest accuracy and improvements by increasing forest size tend to plateau in campaign b each rope had fewer records than in campaign a to avoid overfitting the result was shallower trees for this campaign giving less accurate rf results the data is split by random feature sampling in each tree there would be slightly more variation in the quality of fits due to data splits made on less suitable features this leads to less accurate rul predictions as indicated by the higher rmse and lower r 2 values 5 3 neural networks the nn algorithms performed better in campaign b than campaign a all input variables are considered when using nn and depending on the neurons that randomly dropout the network through regularisation this can influence the model a feature that varies very little during the testing only contributes noise to a model and impacts performance negatively a clear example is comparing the use of geometric and the combined geometric and thermal feature sets for campaign a where thermal features lead to a higher r m s e at the lower test tensions the temperatures do not vary significantly throughout the cbos tests but reach a steady temperature until failure thus contributing noise to a potential model formulation however the temperatures recorded in campaign b are noticeably higher and have more variation between the sbz and dbz in line with the decreasing rf therefore contributing to a better model due to campaign b having both less data coupled with more variation in measurements leads to nn finding a better model than developed for campaign a both nn configurations show slight overestimation in the latter stages of the cbos tests but not to the same extent as svm generally it is noted that despite inconsistent numbers of test cycles in campaign a it is still possible to achieve acceptable results within the range of 20 of the rul ground truth additionally nn is shown to struggle with predicting rul in the earlier stages of the testing in particular for some ropes in the data set initially the various widths lengths and temperatures monitored will not change until later in the test and therefore the networks struggles to predict the distinct rf values at this testing stage 5 4 support vector machine the svm algorithms performed poorly compared to the other algorithms applied in this study if the hyperplane fit to the data is poor and non representative it will in turn have a detrimental impact on rf prediction using the algorithm as with nn the presence of noise via lack of variation in certain features will negatively influence this fit this is particularly prevalent in campaign a however it is noticed that svm performed slightly better in campaign b due to the greater variation in values measured it is also shown that the fit created by the linear kernel suits this rope test data set better than the gaussian kernel the svm is also shown to overestimate rope health towards the later stages of the cbos tests potential improvements for svm could be reducing the number of features used to create a simpler model there is also further potential in hyperparameter optimisation for both linear and gaussian kernels that can contribute to improve models 5 5 feature selection creating models from different feature sets consisting of the different bending zones features also influences algorithm performance during cbos testing the sbz and dbz are subject to substantially more bending whereas there is none present in the sz therefore in line with what was previously stated about nn measurements from the sz essentially contribute noise in the modelling process as only the features that give the best splits in the data are considered from the random subsets in rf the likelihood that features from sz will be consistently picked as splitting criteria in individual trees is extremely low hence minimal effect on both r m s e and r 2 values however limiting the features used to only those from the dbz is shown to improve algorithm performance for both nn and svm there was very little difference between the results from models that used all features and the combination of sbz and dbz features but the most accurate results for svm were achieved by reducing to only training with dbz features more frequent repeated bending will cause more accumulated damage and variation in these features will relate better to the associated rul value the residual analysis performed in fig 15 also shows the advantage of combining both geometric and thermal features as training data the higher temperatures in campaign b in this example contribute features with greater variation and therefore improve the prediction capabilities of the nn2 model used in this example 5 6 combining data sets combining the two data sets for predictions based on cross validation had both a positive and negative impact depending on the algorithm considered the main benefactors of this approach were the nn configurations as shown by improved results in average r m s e and r 2 for both the a and b ropes introducing thermal features for a rope predictions led to decreased performance when only considering the a data set but improved for the cases where sbz dbz and dbz features are used with models trained using the a and b ropes this can be attributed to the different thermal behaviour in each data set with the thermal information from the b ropes contributing to better predictions from a b ropes prediction perspective combining the a and b data sets creates a larger training data set and improves estimations from both nn and svm this suggests that simply increasing the amount of training data with slightly different feature behaviours will benefit model fitting in these cases the observations support the finding from this study that unique rope types subject to different relative test tensions can be combined to produce more accurate results the residual analysis performed in fig 16 also shows the advantage of combining the separate test campaigns in campaign a the thermal data varied very little due to the lower test tension applied therefore the little variation in the thermal data would contribute noise to the modelling process the introduction of campaign b improved the models due to both the presence of similar global elongation trends and thermal features that showed more variation due to the higher test tension 6 future work and adaptation for field deployment from the perspective of rul prediction in cbos testing the effectiveness of ml approaches is influenced by the quality and quantity of data recorded though good prediction results are demonstrated with a small pool of data at two safety factors further ml application to cbos test sets performed at a wider range of lower safety factors is needed these further tests would also benefit from more frequent data recording that would give a more rounded picture of the performance of a specific rope type this would be beneficial for methods such as rf which gave excellent results in campaign a but had its performance inhibited by the limited tree depths in campaign b furthermore it is shown that these further enhanced data sets can be combined into a common training data pool that can be used to make predictions on new test data from distinct rope types from various test conditions data availability is another limiting factor to further development of ml algorithms for application to fibre ropes other engineering components such as bearings and motors benefit from publicly available datasets and can therefore specifically focus on further development of prognostics methods rather than the condition monitoring framework for data acquisition the data acquisition methods can also be further developed to improve the presented models the current method does not account for the internal degradation for the rope which would provide another perspective to assess damage in fibre rope this could be done through embedded sensors that could account for changes in internal temperature or further exploration of localised strain additionally as the structure of the rope fuses with the test progression acoustic sensors could be placed on the sheave or internally to monitor changes in the micro structure of the rope this study provides an overview of the main ml techniques used for rul prediction but each algorithm mentioned has potential for further exploration this was done on tabular data that dealt with measurable physical quantities such as width length and temperatures but there are still further opportunities for enhancement by using cnn to quantify damage in the rope condition directly from visual and thermal images this could be extended to automatically detect visible abrasion fluffiness polishing and broken strands from the same images used in this study ml as a method combined with current inspection methods would further facilitate its application in real time inspection of fibre ropes in cranes and would provide a useful additional source to make decisions on rope retirement however there is further work required to fully adapt the ml approach usage in offshore construction cranes firstly cbos testing is an example of a run to failure test where a constant tension is applied at the same rope sections in real practice it will be different sections of the rope that will be subject to bending depending on lift depth and sea state during operations other factors such as payload size the temperature at lift location and the operation time will also influence rope longevity data from potential lifting campaigns would have to be recorded as part of a wider rope condition monitoring system where data is continually added to form a model with historical data this would create a model that specifically pertains to fibre rope use for offshore lifting rather than relying on more commonly used s n curves for these specific types of ropes the findings from this study of different ropes at different relative test tensions show there is potential in using data from a fleet of fibre rope cranes performing different lifting operations to validate the condition of an individual fibre rope crane intelligent prognosis techniques would then be applied to assess this data and establish what are the most relevant features to be monitored in practice and further develop a retirement criteria based on informed data driven methods for condition based maintenance rather than manual inspection geared towards reactive and time based maintenance practices in this study it is shown that there are benefits from monitoring the length both locally and globally and the temperature in different bend zones such measurements would be made from sensors collecting visual and ir data ideally from a location near the main sheave from a rope that has clearly defined sections the global rope length measurement would also have to be incorporated through some form of embedded sensor measurements within the rope structure to be monitored continually during use this could be done in the form of fibre optic threads allowing the changes in the light propagation to be continually measured and estimates to be made on the global length changes 7 conclusion several approaches for rul prediction in fibre ropes during cbos testing are discussed in this work the algorithms in this study are capable of predicting a continuous target variable known as rf for ropes using features derived from an experimental set up that uses computer vision and thermal monitoring in this investigation machine learning methods such as neural networks random forest and support vector machine were applied for prognostics for two sets of cbos test data at different safety factors for data set a random forest showed the most promise as a rul prediction method while nn was the best performing algorithm in data set b the benefit of combining data from different types of ropes for training data for rul prediction is also demonstrated for nn and svm rf has been shown to be the most effective in this study particularly in cases where larger amounts of data are available allowing a suitably complex model to be developed based on features selected by the algorithm nn is also shown to be useful but slightly less effective compared to rf if large amounts of data are not available then nn application with more focus in including only relevant features is a useful fall back solution credit authorship contribution statement shaun falconer conceptualisation methodology software

20198,fibre rope used in cranes for offshore deployment and recovery has significant potential to perform lifts with smaller cranes and vessels to reach depths limited by weight of steel wire rope current condition monitoring methods based on manual inspection and time based and reactive maintenance have significant potential for improvement coupled with more accurate remaining useful life rul prediction machine learning has found use as a condition monitoring approach coupled with vast improvements in data acquisition methods this paper details data driven rul prediction methods based on machine learning algorithms applied on cyclic bend over sheave cbos tests performed on two fibre rope types until failure data extracted through computer vision and thermal monitoring is used to predict rul through neural networks support vector machines and random forest random forest and neural networks methods are shown to be particularly adept at predicting rul compared to support vector machines additionally improved rul predictions can be achieved by combining data from distinct rope types subject to different test conditions keywords fibre rope offshore lifting remaining useful life machine learning 1 introduction fibre ropes are increasingly used for lifting operations however there are still issues related to the implementation the material advantages of fibre rope are well documented foster 2002 faria et al 2017 as well as issues inhibiting their immediate implementation connected to creep thermal response during cyclic bend over sheave and lack of available data regarding their implementation in offshore construction cranes to be able to exploit this potential fully more advanced maintenance routines must be established to challenge the status quo of manual inspection established by dnvgl 2017 there is significant potential and benefits with regards to avoiding premature retirement and reducing the chance of failure during operation through the development of intelligent maintenance methods for fibre ropes automation of manual processes and structured data driven approaches to quantify historical health data damage progression and physical measurements can lead to more informed decisions regarding rope condition and remaining useful life rul through more frequent documented state observation establishing and verifying these methods would also signal a shift from time based maintenance and reactive maintenance strategies to condition based and predictive maintenance approaches positive implications of this include preventing failure of rope during operation from an undetected fault decreasing operation downtime for routine inspections and avoiding retiring ropes with substantial remaining useful life other sectors have implemented approaches for rul estimation based on machine learning with several reviews available detailing specific implementations nguyen et al 2019 fink et al 2020 lei et al 2018 diez olivan et al 2019 sutharssan et al 2015 khan and yairi 2018 however this study will focus on the use of data driven approaches through machine learning applied to fibre rope condition monitoring data for rul prediction from cyclic bend over sheave cbos testing while the application of machine learning for prognostics and health management in fibre rope condition monitoring is not as established in the publicly accessible research domain these applications have seen successes in other fields much like other engineering components fibre ropes have damage mechanisms and physical changes that can be detected by sensors which can be used in machine learning approaches offshore fibre rope use in particular is concerned with rul related to time tension and temperature as advocated by industry standards by dnvgl 2015 and abs 2011 previous studies into rope behaviour detailing cbos testing also advocated acquiring this data törnqvist et al 2011 moving rope inspection from manual visual methods to computer vision opens up possibilities in machine learning and intelligent data driven assessment of fibre rope condition there are several examples of rul prediction methods for fibre ropes rul methods for fibre ropes have been mainly based on empirical evidence where a number of studies with cbos testing have been conducted for both steel and fibre ropes of several different diameters vennemann et al 2008 davies et al 2015 novak et al 2017 horigome and endo 2018 schmieder and golder 2020 nuttall 2010 detailed a modified version of the feyrer model for fibre ropes in lifting operations in conjunction with cbos testing there has also been other modelling approaches related to cbos motion in rope as detailed by frick et al 2019 and sloan 2019 other model based and experimental approaches to estimate service life have also been applied to hmpe ropes under tension tension regimes as seen in mooring as shown by humeau et al 2018 and asane et al 2020 addtionally lian et al 2015 detailed a model based on thermodynamic properties of fibres yarns and ropes and compared predictions to tensile tests some patents also incorporate discard parameters into a wider fibre rope monitoring system examples of this are provided by mupende and zerza who detail similar patents where a discard signal is created from monitoring rope and environmental parameters mupende and zerza 2014 2018 2019 in the context of lifting operations machine learning has been applied for prognostics and health management in steel ropes with a focus on mining hoists where data acquisition is more mature and readily available oland et al 2017 onur et al 2019 used neural networks to predict rul of steel wire rope in cbos testing and compared the performance to feyrer models at different loads and diameter ratios xue et al 2020 used a form of support vector machines to classify steel wire rope condition based on vibration data and zhou et al 2018 used convolutional neural networks cnn applied to images for classifying faults in balancing tail ropes for mine shaft hoisting operations finally huang et al 2020 also applied a cnn approach and computer vision techniques that detect surface damage in steel wire ropes the contribution of the present article can be summarised as follows machine learning based methods are presented for rul prediction of fibre rope during cbos testing the methods comprise neural networks nn support vector machines svm and random forest rf which are applied to data extracted from computer vision and thermal monitoring all approaches predict a target variable known as the rul factor rf which is based on the number of cycles left to failure occur during testing the various model performances are then assessed for their effectiveness based on both qualitative and quantitative means conditions that are assessed to find the best methods for rul assessment include variation of hyperparameters in the models and variations in the variables included in training the models the approach of combining data from two rope types under different test conditions for training and rul prediction is also explored to the authors knowledge there is no publicly available detailed study into the application of machine learning for rul prediction specifically for fibre ropes intended for offshore lifting until now this paper thus presents the application of existing methods for fibre rope condition monitoring and is not intended to develop the algorithms further the paper is organised as follows the machine learning frameworks and how their performance is assessed in this context are detailed in section 2 the experimental study and data sets are summarised in section 3 and the results of the various approaches are shown in section 4 the results are then discussed in section 5 before further work is considered and conclusions are offered 2 applied methods 2 1 target variable rul factor a target variable is required for regression analysis in ml and will act as the value to be predicted based on training data used in the modelling process the target variable used in this study is hereby referred to as the rul factor rf a fraction defined by eq 1 1 rf ctf t c t f t e s t where rf denotes the rul factor ctf t is the number of cycles to failure at the time of measurement and c t f t e s t is the amount of cycles at failure in each individual test where the measurements are made this produces a value that starts at 1 representing start of life and ends at 0 representing end of life respectively i e 100 and 0 fig 1 shows an example of damage progression in a section from a rope a5 at various rf with the different stages highlighted by decreasing rf from a through to d the images show that as rf decreases the subsection becomes longer and there is more visible wear as shown by ruptured strands and extruded loops the errors of the predictions made by the various approaches will be based on comparison to the rf as the cbos tests are performed at a constant tension rf is related to the accumulated damage d from palmgren miner s rule as shown in eq 2 2 rf 1 d as the cbos tests progress there is accumulated damage in the form of ruptured stands and compromised sub ropes the rope is extended further as the true rf values drop to lower values therefore the reduction in rope residual strength and thereby the retirement criteria in the experiments can be related to the non linear progression of the global elongation of the rope 2 2 neural networks the nn structures designated as nn1 and nn2 used in this study are detailed in tables 1 and 2 and are implemented using the keras library chollet 2015 with a tensorflow backend abadi et al 2016 the number of inputs in the input layer for both architectures correspond to the number of features n f e a t s used from the data extracted from the ropes during cbos testing the hidden layers are of a dense layer type with a specified number of neurons and a rectified linear unit relu activation function that introduces non linearity to the data both architectures use dropout layers that will randomly prevent 20 of the neuron outputs from proceeding through the network this is a regularisation technique used to prevent overfitting the final output layer consists of one neuron coupled with a sigmoid activation function that produces a value between 0 and 1 as a result this is done to reflect the previously described rf in section 2 1 the adam optimisation function was used for both network architectures specified in tables 1 and 2 to update the weight values associated with the input features the inputs are fed forward and backpropagated through the networks for 50 epochs with the model that produces the lower mean square error mse on the test data being saved as the best model used for predictions each configuration is simulated 20 times to account for randomness in the weights assigned in the neural network and give a more robust value for model output the average prediction calculated from these instances is used to compare to the ground truth rf measured from the cbos tests and provide a confidence interval 2 3 support vector machine svm was first used for classification by cortes and vapnik 1995 and was later adapted for regression problems by vapnik et al 1997 to predict the rf in this context the latter approach is adopted which has also been applied in other studies related to rul prediction such as garcía nieto et al 2015 essentially the data is separated by a hyperplane in a higher vector space this plane can be formed by use of a kernel in a classification implementation this line is used to separate the measured vectors into classes but for the regression analysis it will be used to predict a continuous variable for the other instances in the data set to compare to the performance of the nn it is chosen to use an svm framework adapted for regression analysis from scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 linear and gaussian kernels are used to form the fit to the data and to compare their relative accuracy to rf are compared to other methods 2 4 random forest rf is an example of an ensemble method which utilises a user specified number of decision trees created by bootstrapping data from features and data available from a training pool breiman 2001 and kundu et al 2020 the models created will assign rul values to the test samples in each individual tree and an average rul value will be calculated the rf algorithm for regression analysis from scikit learn pedregosa et al 2011 is used for rf prediction the configurations for rf implementation in each data set are specified in table 3 for data sets a and b different tree depths are chosen due to the difference in number of measurements available between the different data sets and to prevent overfitting the differences between the data sets are highlighted in table 5 3 experimental study fig 2 details the flowchart of operations implemented in the ml process from beginning to final output and performance assessment specific details related to a test methods and b data acquisition are summarised in section 3 1 and the subsequent pre processing techniques applied to the data for ml application in section 3 2 then in sections 3 3 and 3 4 the c training and rul estimation stages and d model assessment are detailed 3 1 test methods and data acquisition the data sets were recorded from cbos experiments performed at the mechatronics innovation lab in grimstad norway the fibre ropes used in testing were 12 strand braided ropes with nominal diameter of 28 mm the two types used were five samples of dyneema dm20 xbo and four samples of samson amsteel blue which are designated as separate campaigns a and b respectively additionally a is tested at safety factor sf 11 and b is tested at sf 8 this equates to average tensions of 1 11 and 1 8 of each rope type s max tensile capacity features are engineered from data recorded during cbos testing and the ropes were separated into different zones that reflect the distinct bending regimes during cbos testing as highlighted in fig 3 the acronyms sz sbz and dbz refer to straight zone single bend zone and double bend zone respectively these are the positions in the rope where the rope is bending and unbending due to the cyclic movement of the sheaves no bending occurs in section sz a single bend occurs during each cycle in sbz and two bends occur in the dbz during one cycle the computer vision setup takes account of the whole rope surface with four edmund optics 13122c cameras placed around the rope as shown in fig 4 this takes into account that degradation will not be uniform around the rope and the different camera perspectives can view this computer vision data is recorded for 2000 images corresponding to 13 15 complete cycles every 1000 cycles a flir a6753sc thermal camera is placed next to the test sheave of the cbos machine as shown in fig 5 it was set to sample at 100 hz for 2000 images resulting in a 20 s video for each period this was sufficient to record at least one full cycle in the cbos test temperatures are only available for the lumped zones sz sbz and dbz the global length elongation was measured by a fluke 414d distance measuring laser that tracked the extension of the cbos machine hydraulic cylinder as the tests progressed the sensor has an accuracy of 2 0 mm computer vision data is extracted via algorithms developed in opencv bradski 2000 the geo data represents the local length and width measurements and values for each recording are thus aggregated to give median maximum minimum and standard deviations for these geometric features the therm data represents thermal measurements taken from the thermal camera and extracted using flir researchir 4 software flir 2015 these are the temperature values within the rope part of each relevant image are aggregated as average maximum minimum and standard deviation a list of features and their respective bending zones are summarised in table 4 specific details of the various operations the algorithms used to extract data are summarised in previous work detailing the various cbos testing campaigns by falconer et al 2020 3 2 data pre processing the data sets are separated into geo and geo therm feature sets based on data type to assess the effect of adding thermal features to the ml model the data set compositions are summarised in table 5 the records are the number of data samples recorded by the data acquisition set up mentioned in section 3 1 the ropes used in campaign b were tested at a higher tension and failed sooner than those in campaign a hence the lower number of records in b compared to a the number of features is found by multiplying the number of zones by the number of statistical parameters for each type of data e g 8 4 8 4 1 65 for geometric features and 3 5 1 16 for thermal features the raw measurements from the data acquisition phase are subject to pre processing where the data from the various features is standardised the data was scaled using the approach detailed in eq 3 3 z i y i y σ y where z i is the individual standardised value y i is the individual raw value y is the average of all readings for the specific feature in the rope sample and σ y is the standard deviation of all readings for the specific feature in the rope sample this is done for each rope in the data set to increase comparability between the different samples and is a standard pre processing step to prepare data for ml application 3 3 training and rul estimation the models are tested through leave one out cross validation loocv where rf predictions made on a single rope will be made using models trained with the remaining ropes in the data set this process is done separately for both ropes in campaign a and campaign b and as a combined data set with both a and b together in addition to investigating the effect of only geometric and combined geometric and thermal measurements as outlined in table 5 different combinations of features from the various bending zones detailed in fig 3 are also trained and tested this includes testing using all zones using only sbz and dbz measurements and finally using only dbz measurements 3 4 model assessment the metrics used for model assessment are root mean square error rmse and r 2 score r 2 4 rmse 1 n n 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 5 r 2 1 s s r e s s s t o t where n is the number of measurements made for each rope sample y i is the observed rf at instance i y ˆ i is the predicted rf at instance i s s r e s is the sum of squares of residuals and s s t o t is the total sum of squares rmse in this context will give an insight into how concentrated the rf predictions are around the rf ground truth using each algorithm configuration outlined in section 2 additionally the r 2 score gauges the correlation rf predictions have with the ground truth rf using the input variables outlined in table 4 the performance of the models is assessed through the use of rf graphs and residual analysis the rf graphs will include the ground truth from the observed experimental measurements and tolerance bounds at 20 based on this data the average rf prediction and a 95 confidence interval of the repeated simulations of each distinct configuration are compared to the ground truth and tolerance bounds the residual values e are calculated using eq 6 6 e y i y ˆ i where y i are the rul values from cbos testing and y ˆ i are the predictions made by each respective model the analysis includes plotting the residual values against the predicted rf values the actual rf value against the predicted rf value and finally a histogram analysis accounting for the numerical spread of the residual values this provides further information about the model ability to predict rf potential model bias and where overestimation and underestimation in rope health occurs 4 results 4 1 experimental results the amount of cycles at failure for all ropes in campaigns a and b are summarised in table 6 it is noted that there is a wider spread of values in a than b ropes a1 and a4 were shown to fail at lower amounts of cycles compared to the other ropes in campaign a this is owed to the rope failing at the driving sheave rather than the test sheave due the method used parts of the splice were in contact with the sheave during testing and lead to premature failure of the rope samples the features monitored at the test sheave in ropes a1 and a4 did not develop as much as those in a2 a3 and a5 but all ropes showed the same patterns in progression of global elongation through out every test this included a period of accelerated elongation of global length towards the failure of the rope moreover rope a5 completed a greater number of cycles than the rest of the ropes in campaign a this particular sample included an attempt to embed thermocouples within the strands of the rope and therefore could have contributed to slight discrepancy in the results some halts in logging occurred sporadically during cbos testing for campaign a meaning data acquisition equipment had to be restarted occasionally furthermore features for rope b1 were recorded every 1000 cycles and has less data compared to the other campaign b ropes which were recorded every 500 cycles this change was made as a reaction to the comparatively shorter test times for campaign b than campaign a 4 2 average metrics a quantitative assessment of rf prediction is performed by calculating the average r m s e and r 2 scores in each data set using different feature sets better performance is reflected by lower and higher values for r m s e and r 2 respectively the results for different feature combinations are compared for both a and b rope datasets and ranked by performance of the algorithm on only using geometric features i e a geo with a model and b geo with b model the results using the various feature combinations cross validated on a combined a and b rope data set are also presented fig 6 gives an overview of each algorithm performance based on different feature sets and training model composition it is seen that both configurations of rf performed best followed by nn and finally svm based on producing the lowest r m s e scores introducing thermal features generally either changes nothing or leads to detriment in performance when only a ropes are used as training data which is particularly noticeable in both nn and svm when the combined a and b model is used there is shown to be a slight improvement in performance when thermal features are introduced for nn when the sbz dbz and dbz feature sets are considered there is also shown to be a general reduction of r m s e as the number of zones used in the training are decreased this performance is also reflected in the r 2 values as shown in fig 7 as seen with the r m s e data types feature sets and model compositions influenced the algorithms differently the r 2 values for both rf configurations are shown to be the highest followed by nn and svm the high values recorded for r 2 indicate that the features used to create the rf models better explain the changes in rf it is seen that by using both a and b data to train the nn configurations that a higher r 2 is achieved than by only using a indicating that the same feature with enhanced data from different ropes better explain the changes in rf this is also seen for both svm configurations but had little impact on rf the r m s e values for data set b are shown in fig 8 both configurations of nn were shown to perform best when only b data is considered a noticeable difference in the b data is that for both nn and svm the thermal data led to significantly better predictive performance as indicated by lower r m s e using the combined a and b data set also improved performance of nn with the exception of the nn2 configuration in the sbz dbz feature set the combined a and b data set has a detrimental impact on the rf configuration with depth one the r 2 scores for the same algorithms using the b rope data set are shown in fig 9 the highest r 2 values are achieved with nn with improvements being shown when thermal data is introduced it is noted that higher r 2 is recorded using a and b data for training when only geometric features are considered but similar values are seen for b only and a and b combined when thermal features are introduced rf is shown to have similar r 2 values no matter what features are used there is also a noticeable increase in r 2 for svm gaussian when the combined a and b data set is considered 4 3 rul graphs a qualitative assessment of the algorithm performance during cross validation is given through plotting the predicted rf at various cycles throughout each test it is possible to gain a general idea of algorithm performance from the graphs but they can also reveal at which times in the test both the best and worst predictions are made the results of cross validation predictions made only using the single and combined data sets is also considered selected rul prediction results from both a and b data sets are shown in figs 10 11 12 and 13 fig 10 shows the results of rf prediction using nn2 for geometric features from all bending zones for rope a4 by using the combined a and b data set the predictions in the first half of the test are shown to be closer to the ground truth as well as showing a reduction in the overestimation peak seen in the middle of the a ropes model the method was still shown to overestimate from 50 000 cycles until failure but was slightly improved with the addition of all ropes to the model fig 11 presents the results for rf prediction for rope a3 using rf at tree depth 4 using geometric features from all bend zones as shown in the previous r m s e results for rf the combined a and b training data performed either the same or to slight decrease in performance which is reflected in the rf graphs there is a noticeable period of overestimation in the combined a and b model between 40 000 and 60 000 cycles but returns to being closer to rul just after additionally both models have very small confidence intervals compared to the nn configurations fig 12 considers the predictions by nn2 on rope b2 when both geometric and thermal features from the dbz are considered the confidence interval in the prediction is significantly reduced and almost totally confined to the tolerance bounds this is seen at the majority of test times with the exception of between 0 to 40 000 test cycles the overestimation in the b model from 4000 cycles until failure is also corrected to being closer to the true rul values by introducing the a rope data fig 13 shows the rf prediction results of using svm with a linear kernel when using geometric and thermal features from the dbz the model trained using the b ropes data is shown to significantly overestimate rope health after around 11 000 cycles but when the a and b data is included this period of rf predictions is corrected albeit with some underestimation after 12 000 cycles 4 4 residual analysis a residual analysis is performed to further investigate rf predictions and to compare the differences in results depending on algorithm features and training data used fig 14 shows the residual analysis comparison of using rf with tree depth 4 and nn2 predictions for rope a2 using only geometric features from all bend zones in this specific case both models were trained using only the a rope data the rf model produces low residual values indicating closer agreement with the ground truth while nn2 prediction are shown to both overestimate and underestimate as indicated by the spread of residual values fig 15 presents the residual analysis comparison of using geometric and the combined geometric and thermal features this is done for rope b3 predictions made using nn2 with features from the dbz by including thermal data the magnitude of all residuals is reduced to be within 0 1 of the rf ground truth when comparing predicted and actual rf values predictions are more effective generally but there is little effect on improving the predictions at the end of the test fig 16 provides analysis of improvements that are possible by combining the a and b rope data sets in model training this is presented for rope a1 with nn2 using combined geometric and thermal data from all bend zones an improvement with the combined training set is observed with magnitude of the outermost outliers being reduced rope a1 completed the least amount of cycles at failure when compared to the other ropes in the a data set and showed poor prediction results on models trained on this data set 5 discussion model performance varied depending on the algorithm and the data set used a major difference shown was that rf performs better than nn for campaign a but nn performs better than rf in campaign b differences in performance can be explained by the training data used the size of the data set and algorithm mechanisms 5 1 recorded data and availability two of the ropes in campaign a ropes a1 and a4 broke where the rope splice was bent over the driving sheave this led to earlier failure than for the other ropes of the campaign and to failure which was not located where the cameras were at the test sheave still the failure mechanism was very similar to what caused failure in the other ropes tested in this study rf frequently identified the global elongation as the most important split variable in line with this overall sameness of failure mechanism of all ropes tested this variable showed a similar development for all ropes including ropes a1 and a4 it was chosen to include the ropes in the analysis a choice that has two positive effects excluding them would have lead to even less data for training the machine learning algorithm and as discussed earlier cbos test data are time consuming and expensive to obtain secondly in real life ropes will not always break where expected including ropes a1 and a4 in the data set makes the models able to handle some such cases where the deviation from the expectation is not too large the model stability is addressed through the 95 confidence interval for the predictions it was found that combining campaigns a and b in all cases resulted in a narrower confidence interval than from each of the campaigns alone for unstable models adding new samples is expected to change the model qualitatively resulting in wider confidence intervals conversely the present study s narrowing of the confidence intervals indicates a stable model 5 2 random forest rf is formed of several individual decision trees where data is separated based on feature values that give the purest split the global elongation shows a steady increase during testing and it will therefore create one of the best splits in the decision trees of the rfs however this feature will not be available to all trees in the forest due to feature bagging still the averaging over 200 trees will ensure its contribution to the overall forests this is shown in the residual analysis performed in fig 14 where rf has outperformed nn2 rf was also shown to have a steady balance between slight overestimation and underestimation of predicted rf compared to the true value in general increased tree depth increases random forest accuracy and improvements by increasing forest size tend to plateau in campaign b each rope had fewer records than in campaign a to avoid overfitting the result was shallower trees for this campaign giving less accurate rf results the data is split by random feature sampling in each tree there would be slightly more variation in the quality of fits due to data splits made on less suitable features this leads to less accurate rul predictions as indicated by the higher rmse and lower r 2 values 5 3 neural networks the nn algorithms performed better in campaign b than campaign a all input variables are considered when using nn and depending on the neurons that randomly dropout the network through regularisation this can influence the model a feature that varies very little during the testing only contributes noise to a model and impacts performance negatively a clear example is comparing the use of geometric and the combined geometric and thermal feature sets for campaign a where thermal features lead to a higher r m s e at the lower test tensions the temperatures do not vary significantly throughout the cbos tests but reach a steady temperature until failure thus contributing noise to a potential model formulation however the temperatures recorded in campaign b are noticeably higher and have more variation between the sbz and dbz in line with the decreasing rf therefore contributing to a better model due to campaign b having both less data coupled with more variation in measurements leads to nn finding a better model than developed for campaign a both nn configurations show slight overestimation in the latter stages of the cbos tests but not to the same extent as svm generally it is noted that despite inconsistent numbers of test cycles in campaign a it is still possible to achieve acceptable results within the range of 20 of the rul ground truth additionally nn is shown to struggle with predicting rul in the earlier stages of the testing in particular for some ropes in the data set initially the various widths lengths and temperatures monitored will not change until later in the test and therefore the networks struggles to predict the distinct rf values at this testing stage 5 4 support vector machine the svm algorithms performed poorly compared to the other algorithms applied in this study if the hyperplane fit to the data is poor and non representative it will in turn have a detrimental impact on rf prediction using the algorithm as with nn the presence of noise via lack of variation in certain features will negatively influence this fit this is particularly prevalent in campaign a however it is noticed that svm performed slightly better in campaign b due to the greater variation in values measured it is also shown that the fit created by the linear kernel suits this rope test data set better than the gaussian kernel the svm is also shown to overestimate rope health towards the later stages of the cbos tests potential improvements for svm could be reducing the number of features used to create a simpler model there is also further potential in hyperparameter optimisation for both linear and gaussian kernels that can contribute to improve models 5 5 feature selection creating models from different feature sets consisting of the different bending zones features also influences algorithm performance during cbos testing the sbz and dbz are subject to substantially more bending whereas there is none present in the sz therefore in line with what was previously stated about nn measurements from the sz essentially contribute noise in the modelling process as only the features that give the best splits in the data are considered from the random subsets in rf the likelihood that features from sz will be consistently picked as splitting criteria in individual trees is extremely low hence minimal effect on both r m s e and r 2 values however limiting the features used to only those from the dbz is shown to improve algorithm performance for both nn and svm there was very little difference between the results from models that used all features and the combination of sbz and dbz features but the most accurate results for svm were achieved by reducing to only training with dbz features more frequent repeated bending will cause more accumulated damage and variation in these features will relate better to the associated rul value the residual analysis performed in fig 15 also shows the advantage of combining both geometric and thermal features as training data the higher temperatures in campaign b in this example contribute features with greater variation and therefore improve the prediction capabilities of the nn2 model used in this example 5 6 combining data sets combining the two data sets for predictions based on cross validation had both a positive and negative impact depending on the algorithm considered the main benefactors of this approach were the nn configurations as shown by improved results in average r m s e and r 2 for both the a and b ropes introducing thermal features for a rope predictions led to decreased performance when only considering the a data set but improved for the cases where sbz dbz and dbz features are used with models trained using the a and b ropes this can be attributed to the different thermal behaviour in each data set with the thermal information from the b ropes contributing to better predictions from a b ropes prediction perspective combining the a and b data sets creates a larger training data set and improves estimations from both nn and svm this suggests that simply increasing the amount of training data with slightly different feature behaviours will benefit model fitting in these cases the observations support the finding from this study that unique rope types subject to different relative test tensions can be combined to produce more accurate results the residual analysis performed in fig 16 also shows the advantage of combining the separate test campaigns in campaign a the thermal data varied very little due to the lower test tension applied therefore the little variation in the thermal data would contribute noise to the modelling process the introduction of campaign b improved the models due to both the presence of similar global elongation trends and thermal features that showed more variation due to the higher test tension 6 future work and adaptation for field deployment from the perspective of rul prediction in cbos testing the effectiveness of ml approaches is influenced by the quality and quantity of data recorded though good prediction results are demonstrated with a small pool of data at two safety factors further ml application to cbos test sets performed at a wider range of lower safety factors is needed these further tests would also benefit from more frequent data recording that would give a more rounded picture of the performance of a specific rope type this would be beneficial for methods such as rf which gave excellent results in campaign a but had its performance inhibited by the limited tree depths in campaign b furthermore it is shown that these further enhanced data sets can be combined into a common training data pool that can be used to make predictions on new test data from distinct rope types from various test conditions data availability is another limiting factor to further development of ml algorithms for application to fibre ropes other engineering components such as bearings and motors benefit from publicly available datasets and can therefore specifically focus on further development of prognostics methods rather than the condition monitoring framework for data acquisition the data acquisition methods can also be further developed to improve the presented models the current method does not account for the internal degradation for the rope which would provide another perspective to assess damage in fibre rope this could be done through embedded sensors that could account for changes in internal temperature or further exploration of localised strain additionally as the structure of the rope fuses with the test progression acoustic sensors could be placed on the sheave or internally to monitor changes in the micro structure of the rope this study provides an overview of the main ml techniques used for rul prediction but each algorithm mentioned has potential for further exploration this was done on tabular data that dealt with measurable physical quantities such as width length and temperatures but there are still further opportunities for enhancement by using cnn to quantify damage in the rope condition directly from visual and thermal images this could be extended to automatically detect visible abrasion fluffiness polishing and broken strands from the same images used in this study ml as a method combined with current inspection methods would further facilitate its application in real time inspection of fibre ropes in cranes and would provide a useful additional source to make decisions on rope retirement however there is further work required to fully adapt the ml approach usage in offshore construction cranes firstly cbos testing is an example of a run to failure test where a constant tension is applied at the same rope sections in real practice it will be different sections of the rope that will be subject to bending depending on lift depth and sea state during operations other factors such as payload size the temperature at lift location and the operation time will also influence rope longevity data from potential lifting campaigns would have to be recorded as part of a wider rope condition monitoring system where data is continually added to form a model with historical data this would create a model that specifically pertains to fibre rope use for offshore lifting rather than relying on more commonly used s n curves for these specific types of ropes the findings from this study of different ropes at different relative test tensions show there is potential in using data from a fleet of fibre rope cranes performing different lifting operations to validate the condition of an individual fibre rope crane intelligent prognosis techniques would then be applied to assess this data and establish what are the most relevant features to be monitored in practice and further develop a retirement criteria based on informed data driven methods for condition based maintenance rather than manual inspection geared towards reactive and time based maintenance practices in this study it is shown that there are benefits from monitoring the length both locally and globally and the temperature in different bend zones such measurements would be made from sensors collecting visual and ir data ideally from a location near the main sheave from a rope that has clearly defined sections the global rope length measurement would also have to be incorporated through some form of embedded sensor measurements within the rope structure to be monitored continually during use this could be done in the form of fibre optic threads allowing the changes in the light propagation to be continually measured and estimates to be made on the global length changes 7 conclusion several approaches for rul prediction in fibre ropes during cbos testing are discussed in this work the algorithms in this study are capable of predicting a continuous target variable known as rf for ropes using features derived from an experimental set up that uses computer vision and thermal monitoring in this investigation machine learning methods such as neural networks random forest and support vector machine were applied for prognostics for two sets of cbos test data at different safety factors for data set a random forest showed the most promise as a rul prediction method while nn was the best performing algorithm in data set b the benefit of combining data from different types of ropes for training data for rul prediction is also demonstrated for nn and svm rf has been shown to be the most effective in this study particularly in cases where larger amounts of data are available allowing a suitably complex model to be developed based on features selected by the algorithm nn is also shown to be useful but slightly less effective compared to rf if large amounts of data are not available then nn application with more focus in including only relevant features is a useful fall back solution credit authorship contribution statement shaun falconer conceptualisation methodology software

20199,the specularity coefficient is an important input parameter in the johnson and jackson boundary conditions thus far research on this parameter has been lacking in the field of slurry flow simulations in this study the integration of the eulerian eulerian two fluid model with kinetic theory of granular flow and johnson and jackson boundary conditions is used to simulate the transportation of sand water slurry in horizontal pipelines a range of flow conditions including high and low velocities high and low concentrations coarse and fine particles and large and small pipes is considered to study the effect of the specularity coefficient on the predicted hydraulic gradient then the simulation results are compared with previous experimental measurements to determine the appropriate values of the specularity coefficient the hydraulic gradient is found to be positively correlated with the specularity coefficient in addition it is more sensitive to the specularity coefficient when the specularity coefficient is less than 0 1 the appropriate value of the specularity coefficient decreases with the flow velocity and increases with the solid volume fraction in the range of flow conditions considered the findings may be used as a reference for future simulations in the research field of slurry transport keywords slurry flow specularity coefficient hydraulic gradient horizontal pipeline 1 introduction in general sand clay and rock are transported in pipelines as slurries after being excavated during dredging trenching tunnel boring deep sea mining or oil and gas drilling an accurate estimation of the pressure drop or hydraulic gradient of the slurry is an essential prerequisite for the design and operation of the entire pipeline system miedema 2016 given the development of computer power and algorithms models based on computational fluid dynamics cfd have become powerful tools to achieve this goal currently the eulerian eulerian two fluid model tfm is considered as a satisfactory tradeoff between calculation accuracy and efficiency messa and matoušek 2020 therefore it is the most suitable method for engineering applications involving large particle assemblies two essential components that are integrated by tfm are the kinetic theory of granular flow ktgf and the wall boundary conditions bcs the former is used to model majority of the solid phase governing equations whereas the latter controls the interactions between the particles and the wall johnson and jackson bcs are widely used in numerical simulations of fluid solid multiphase flows they contain two bcs the first is for the slip velocity derived from the balance of force whereas the second is for the granular temperature derived from the balance of energy in both cases the specularity coefficient φ is an important input parameter that controls the tangential momentum transferred per particle wall collision johnson and jackson 1987 thus φ has an intrinsic impact on the predicted hydraulic gradient which gets the most attention from engineers hui et al 1984 first introduced φ and provided a detailed explanation on the determination of its value they noted that there was a lack of necessary distribution functions to average the possibilities of collision thus it was possible to conduct qualitative analysis on φ with microscale experiments but its quantity had to be determined empirically moreover such microscale experiments have not been reported in previous literature altantzis et al 2015 li and benyahia 2012 loha et al 2013 although it has been concluded that the value of φ is dependent on the large scale roughness of the surface boundary hui et al 1984 johnson and jackson 1987 many recent studies have demonstrated that φ is not only related to the properties of the boundary but also to the flow conditions thus it cannot be independently determined altantzis et al 2015 li and benyahia 2012 zhao et al 2016 presently the common approach to determine the value of φ is by fitting the predicted results to the macroscale experimental outputs such as pressure drop phase velocity or phase volume fraction table 1 lists the publications that have investigated the value of φ in the last 5 years these studies refer not only to the liquid solid slurries in horizontal pipelines but also to other granular flows to provide a more well rounded view it is apparent from table 1 that it can be concluded that extensive attempts have been made for the determination of φ regarding fluidization this is owing to the consensus that φ has a significant effect on the solid circulation time voidage pressure drop solid mass flow rate and cluster formation however with regard to the slurry transport in pipelines lesser efforts have been directed toward the determination of φ in some of the studies related to slurry transport the values of φ were not clearly specified chen et al 2009 ekambara et al 2009 hashemi et al 2016 kaushal et al 2012 kumar gopaliya and kaushal 2016 singh et al 2017 whereas in the other studies presented in table 1 the values of φ were given but there were no detailed explanations on the reasons for selecting them in addition most of the recommended φ values for the slurry were extracted from a limited set of working points therefore the variation of this parameter over a continuous range of flow conditions is unclear in the present study the sand water slurries transported in horizontal pipelines are simulated using tfm integrated with ktgf and johnson and jackson bcs a full assessment is conducted for the computational grid and the entry length to ensure that our research is based on a solid foundation the effect of the specularity coefficient φ 0 0 025 0 05 0 075 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 on the predicted hydraulic gradient is analyzed for slurries with different flow velocities solid volume fractions and particle and pipe diameters then the appropriate values of the specularity coefficient φ app are extracted based on experimental measurements and the relationship between φ app and the flow conditions is analyzed in the range of specularity coefficient values and flow conditions considered in this study the findings may serve as a reference for further simulations in the research field of slurry transport in pipelines 2 cfd modeling 2 1 geometry and grid given the simple geometry and symmetry of a horizontal pipeline system the computational domain is set up as half a cylinder with four boundary surfaces i e inlet outlet wall and plane of symmetry as illustrated in fig 1 therefore the number of grid cells involved in the computational process is halved in comparison with that of the entire cylinder the grid used in this study includes 626 562 cells 1 917 300 faces and 665 091 nodes as depicted in fig 2 a total of 851 and 40 nodes are evenly separated in the axial and circumferential directions respectively there are 27 nodes in the radial direction with more nodes placed in the vicinity of the wall owing to the high gradient of velocity and volume fraction in this area the detailed grid configuration and the grid dependency study are presented in appendix a in general the uniform distribution of the velocity and volume fraction for a phase is specified at the inlet kaushal et al 2012 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore the computational domain should be long enough to eliminate the influence of this inlet condition and to provide space for the full development of the slurry flow the minimum length between the inlet and the cross section downstream wherein the flow becomes fully developed is defined as the entry length colwell and shook 1988 in this study we set the entry length as 90d and the reason why this value is selected is discussed in detail in appendix b 2 2 eulerian model the slurry flow is studied using the tfm which describes any phase i e fluid or solid as an interpenetrating continuum with the same pressure all the phases should satisfy the conservation equations for mass momentum and energy to solve these conservation equations appropriate drag models and constitutive equations should be employed in addition a suitable turbulence model is required to obtain satisfactory hydrodynamic predictions in the fully developed turbulent flow table 2 lists the conservation equations for liquid solid flows the mass and momentum conservation equations eqs 2 5 are solved for the corresponding phases given that the investigated flows are assumed to be isothermal and there exists no mass transfer between the different phases the mass transfer term in the continuity and energy equations is not included in the momentum equation the lift force is obtained from the study conducted by moraga et al 1999 and the turbulent dispersion force is calculated based on the study conducted by burns et al 2004 based on the ktgf the kinetic energy caused by the particles random motion is quantified using granular temperature this is solved through the granular temperature transport equation eq 6 proposed by ding and gidaspow 1990 the gidaspow model gidaspow et al 1992 a combination of the wen and yu model wen and yu 1966 and the ergun equation ergun 1952 is used to specify the interphase exchange coefficients in eqs 4 and 5 the equations are listed in table 3 table 4 lists the basic constitutive equations derived from the ktgf the stress strain tensors in the momentum equations are calculated based on eqs 10 and 11 to solve the solid phase stress strain tensor two variables are introduced the first is the solid bulk viscosity accounting for the solid phase resistance to compression and expansion as given by eq 12 the second is the solid shear viscosity including the collisional kinetic and frictional parts as described by eqs 13 16 as given by eq 17 the solid pressure in the momentum equation is composed of a kinetic term and a term representing particle collisions for all the collision related terms a radial distribution function is introduced to control the particle collision probability herein we use a simple form given by ogawa et al 1980 presented in eq 18 the diffusion coefficient for granular energy collisional energy dissipation and energy exchange between different phases are represented by eqs 19 21 as closures for eq 6 k ε turbulence model for each phase is selected to describe the turbulent characteristics the basic turbulence equations are presented in table 5 while the detailed constitutive equations for closure of these equations can be found in our previous work li et al 2020 2 3 boundary conditions at the inlet the slurry bulk mean velocities v m that have been used by gillies 1993 are imposed uniformly for both phases while the local solid volume fractions averaged over the loop volume α s v are imposed uniformly for the solid phase the turbulent intensity is set at 5 and the viscosity ratio is set at 10 at the outlet a constant atmospheric pressure is specified at the plane of symmetry the symmetry bc is applied at the wall for the liquid phase the no slip condition is applied whereas for the solid phase the johnson and jackson bcs are applied the johnson and jackson bcs have been widely used for the simulation of multiphase flow and the main equations are listed in table 6 fig 3 provides an illustration for the derivation of johnson and jackson bcs when the particles interact with a flat frictional and fixed wall first as depicted in fig 3 and described by eq 24 in the area next to the boundary the condition for the particle slip velocity v slip is obtained by equating the tangential force per unit area exerted on the boundary by the particles to the corresponding stress within the particle assembly on the left hand side of eq 24 the first term represents the component of the bulk stress vector in the direction of v slip the second term denotes the rate of momentum transfer to the unit area of the boundary by collisions it is the product of the average tangential momentum transferred per collision φ π ρ s d 3 v slip 6 collision frequency for each particle 3 θ s and number of particles adjacent to the unit area of the boundary 1 a c the third term denotes the magnitude of the tangential friction component based on coulomb s law johnson and jackson 1987 second as depicted in fig 3 johnson and jackson 1987 introduced eq 25 based on the total energy and the true thermal balances over the control volume next to the wall boundary d is described in eq 26 and represents the rate of dissipation of pseudo thermal energy due to inelastic collisions of particles within the unit area of the boundary similar to the second term in eq 24 d is the product of the energy loss per collision collision frequency per particle and number of particles adjacent to the unit area of the boundary because the specularity coefficient is the main subject of our study it is explained in detail below the average tangential momentum transferred per collision defined by johnson and jackson 1987 is 29 m t w φ π ρ s d 3 v slip 6 we may express φ explicitly as 30 φ m t w ρ s π 6 d 3 v slip from eq 30 it is clear that φ is a fraction wherein the numerator is equal to the average tangential momentum transferred per collision and the denominator is equal to the average tangential momentum possessed by the particle a sphere this equation indicates that φ directly controls the relative amount of tangential momentum transferred from the particle to the wall and mathematically explains the reason for the variation of φ between zero for perfectly specular collisions and unity for perfectly diffuse collisions johnson and jackson 1987 2 4 solver settings a cfd software package ansys fluent 19 0 is employed to solve the equations described in section 2 3 using the finite volume method the time independent calculations are performed the flow field is initialized by the hybrid initialization method with the number of iterations set as 10 and the explicit under relaxation factor set as 1 the pressure based solver is used and the gradients are computed according to the least squares cell based methods for the pressure velocity coupling the phase coupled simple pc simple algorithm vasquez and ivanov 2000 is employed the momentum equations are discretized using the second order upwind scheme whereas the other equations are discretized using the first order upwind scheme achieving the computational convergence is highly dependent on the under relaxation factors which are carefully specified particularly for the momentum in the present study the under relaxation factors for pressure density body forces momentum volume fraction granular temperature turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate and turbulent viscosity are set as 0 2 0 5 0 5 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 and 0 5 for each scaled residual component a convergence criterion of 10 4 is specified in general the time required by a computer with an intel r core tm i7 7700 cpu to satisfy this convergence criterion is 6 h 3 simulations valuable measurement data can be obtained from previous experimental studies gillies 1993 gillies et al 2004 kaushal et al 2005 matoušek et al 2013 matoušek 2002 fig 4 summarizes the experimental cases selected from those proposed by gillies 1993 in this study all the comparisons are based on these eight experimental cases because 1 these cases covered a range of flow conditions i e low and high flow velocities low and high solid volume fractions fine and coarse particles and small and large pipe diameters thus investigating this range would provide a thorough understanding of the effect of the specularity coefficient and 2 these cases are selected in the way that different flow conditions can be compared directly e g the only difference between cases a and b is the solids concentration and by comparing them we can obtain the effect of solids concentration on the appropriate specularity coefficient and 3 in these cases gillies provided the measurement methods as well as sufficient details of the experimental outputs among them the hydraulic gradient and local solids concentration are two important variables that can be used for comparison cases of some other particle diameters and solids concentrations are not presented however the authors can provide corresponding results for the interested readers 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation a reliable cfd model should provide a reasonable prediction for the flow variables in the case of slurry pipe flows at least the predicted hydraulic gradient and local solids concentration distribution should be validated against the available experimental data messa and matoušek 2020 therefore before going deep into the study of the relationship of hydraulic gradient and specularity coefficient a validation section is needed to show the ability of the model to predict the local solids concentration distribution fig 5 shows the predicted local solids concentration profiles and the experimental data for case a to h for clarity only curves for φ 0 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 5 and 1 are shown when gillies 1993 conducted the experiment the local solids concentration was measured using a traversing γ ray density gauge the data was collected on 10 evenly separated levels from the pipe bottom in order to compare the present prediction with the experiment data the similar measurement method is used that is to select the solids concentration averaged over horizontal chord α s γ on the measured cross section which is located at l 85d where the outlet effect is negligible compared with gillies 1993 in the present study more data is collected with a shorter interval of δz r 0 05 it can be seen from fig 5 that qualitatively α s γ profiles predicted by the model agree with the experimental data and this agreement is satisfactory within the central region of the pipe 0 5 z r 0 5 when comparing figs 5 and 6 in section 4 2 it can be seen that a φ giving a reasonable prediction for the hydraulic gradient can also provide a satisfactory α s γ profile in addition gillies 1993 noticed an obvious reversal in the concentration gradient near the pipe bottom at a high mean velocity 3 1 m s for case f and this phenomenon is successively captured by the present model as shown in fig 5f 4 2 effect of specularity coefficient on hydraulic gradient fig 6 depicts the effect of φ on the hydraulic gradient i for 0 29 and 0 55 mm particle diameters sand slurries with α s v ranging from 0 15 to 0 34 in pipes of 53 2 and 263 mm inner diameters gillies 1993 observed the stationary and intermittent deposits at the bottom of the pipe when the mean velocity was low according to the classification proposed by doron and barnea 1996 such a flow regime is identified as a bed flow bf the corresponding areas in the figures are colored in dark gray on the contrary when the mean velocity is high all solids can be suspended in the pipe and such a flow regime is called a fully suspended fs flow the two vertical dashed lines in fig 6 correspond to the maximum velocity of bf and the minimum velocity of fs which are extracted directly from the experiments conducted by gillies 1993 the middle areas colored in light gray can be considered as either bf or fs owing to the measurement interval from fig 6 two basic trends can be distinguished first for each φ i increases with the increasing slurry mean bulk velocity v m this can be explained as follows from eq 29 it can be seen that if φ is fixed the average tangential momentum transferred per collision is proportional to the slip velocity v slip therefore when v m increases v slip increases and more momentum is transferred to the wall leading to an increase in i second at a fixed velocity the predicted value of i is positively correlated with φ this can be explained by the definition of φ as presented in eq 30 for each particle wall collision the higher the value of φ the greater the momentum transferred from the particle to the wall which increases the shear force on the wall and thus increasing the wall friction to the slurry therefore from a macroscopic viewpoint a larger value of i is observed these two variation trends are similar to the results extracted from li et al 2018a it is worth noting that as v m increases i becomes more sensitive to φ as shown in figs 6 and 7 for example in case h at v m 1 5 m s when φ increases from 0 to 1 the increase in i is 0 074 whereas at v m 3 1 m s the increase is 0 275 i e 3 72 times the former in addition it can be seen from fig 6 that for all cases when v m is fixed i is more sensitive to the lower values of φ particularly for φ 0 1 therefore more check points are required when 0 φ 0 1 this phenomenon is illustrated in fig 8 wherein for brevity reasons only case h is presented 4 3 appropriate value of specularity coefficient this study aims to provide a reference for determining the value of φ therefore based on the results summarized in fig 6 each appropriate value of φ denoted as φ app is attained by linear interpolation and presented in fig 9 because of the small interval between the two adjacent simulated φ the accuracy of such an interpolation process is believed sufficient to enhance readability a case label is attached in the lower part of fig 9 and the minimum and maximum values of φ app are specified at the ends of the corresponding curve for each case the range of φ app under all flow conditions is 0 019 0 593 the discussion below is based on fig 9 with regard to the relationship between φ app and v m the appropriate value of φ decreases with the increase in v m in all the examined cases a high value of v m leads to two opposite consequences on the force exerted on the unit area of the boundary due to particle wall collisions this is given by the second term on the left hand side of eq 24 the first consequence is that a high value of v m decreases the number of particles near the bottom at a high velocity the solid volume fraction is more uniformly distributed in the pipe leading to a shrinkage of the fraction profile near the bottom of the pipe as was observed by gillies 1993 which is reproduced in our simulation as shown in fig 10 the second consequence is that a high velocity increases the velocity fluctuation and the slip velocity of the particles near the wall this leads to more frequent particle wall collisions and more average tangential momentum is transferred per collision the latter consequence should be dominant so that a decreasing φ is required to restrict the excessive growth of the force exerted on the wall therefore from this point of view the role of φ is that of a tuner for the predicted hydraulic gradient with regard to the relationship between φ app and α s v the only difference between cases c and d is the value of α s v in all the examined values of v m the dense case d requires a larger φ than the dilute case c to obtain an accurate result this is also true for cases a and b e and f and g and h therefore a slurry flow with a higher α s v always requires a larger φ with regard to the relationship between φ app and d in a 263 mm pipe at v m 4 0 m s the value of φ app in case c is 0 165 which is 3 84 times that in case a 0 043 at v m 5 0 m s the value of φ app in case c is 3 26 times that in case a a similar result is observed in the comparison of the denser cases b and d wherein the value of φ app in case d is 9 42 times that in case b at v m 4 0 m s whereas it is 3 26 times that in case b at v m 5 0 m s thus it is can be concluded that a slurry with larger particles requires a considerably larger φ than a slurry with smaller particles however in a 53 2 mm pipe the value of φ app in cases e and g is less sensitive to the change in particle diameter when v m is approximately 1 5 m s the value of φ app in case e differs most from that in case g and the corresponding ratio of φ app is 2 28 in addition for the denser cases f and h the values of φ app are almost identical therefore in the large pipe particle diameter significantly affects φ app whereas in the small pipe this influence is diminished this phenomenon indicates that the particle and pipe diameters seem to have a combined impact on φ app to further analyze the combined impact of d and d on φ app the stokes number stk is introduced although stk is used more often in experimental fluid dynamics it can also act as an indicator showing the ability of particles to form a homogeneous mixture in the case of slurry flow in pipeline stk is defined as 31 s t k ρ s d 2 18 ρ l ν l 2 v m d fig 11 shows the relation between φ app and stk to eliminate the influence of different solids concentration only cases with α s v around 0 15 are presented it can be seen from fig 11 that as stk increases φ app decreases for all the cases this is consistent with the relation between v m and φ app because for a given case stk and v m are proportional and it can be seen clearly that φ app changes more rapidly in the range of low stk for case a which corresponds to low stk the value of δφ app δstk in the investigated range is 1 33 while for case e which corresponds to high stk this value is 0 07 this means that φ app is more sensitive in the case of the combination of fine particles and large pipes in addition it can be seen that for each case log φ app and stk are approximately linearly related which can be expressed in the form of log φ app a s t k b 4 4 specularity coefficient and flow regimes different flow regimes patterns associate with quite different particle support mechanisms tfm is a practical way to simulate hydraulic conveying of particles in the fully suspended flow however it is difficult for tfm to estimate the transition of different flow regimes messa and matoušek 2020 recently attempts have been made to extend the results from the rapid flow regime to all flow regimes using discrete element simulations wang 2020 one of such attempts is done with the method of cfd dem in the study of modeling and analysis of flow regimes in hydraulic conveying of coarse particles zhou et al 2020 however it is necessary and beneficial to explore the upper limit of the capacity of the tfm used in the present study and discuss the relation between the values of φ and the different flow patterns it can be seen from fig 6 that close to the lowest v m at which a thin stationary deposit of solids at the bottom of the pipe was observed by gillies 1993 the present model underpredicts the hydraulic gradient for cases c d f g and h even at φ 1 this underprediction of hydraulic gradient at extremely low v m is consistent with the founding by messa and matoušek 2020 therefore it is safe to use the present tfm in the flow regime of fs the relation between the ranges of φ app and the different flow patterns is not obvious however it can be seen in fig 9 that φ app changes more rapidly with v m in the range of bf than fs for case a the value of δφ app δv m in bf is 0 23 while in fs it is 0 03 for case b the value of δφ app δv m in bf is 0 47 while in fs it is 0 06 therefore φ app is more sensitive to v m in the flow regime of bf 5 conclusions in this study the sand water slurry flows in horizontal pipelines were simulated using the tfm integrated with the ktgf and johnson and jackson bcs after the model validation the effect of the specularity coefficient on the predicted hydraulic gradient was analyzed covering a range of flow conditions including different flow velocities solid volume fractions particle diameters and pipe diameters the following conclusions can be drawn at a fixed slurry bulk mean velocity the predicted hydraulic gradient is positively correlated with the specularity coefficient and is more sensitive to a specularity coefficient less than 0 1 then as the slurry bulk mean velocity increases the predicted hydraulic gradient becomes more sensitive to the specularity coefficient furthermore the simulation results were compared with previous experimental measurements to determine the appropriate values of the specularity coefficient under different flow conditions additionally the relationship between the appropriate specularity coefficient values and the flow conditions was discussed first we found that the appropriate value of the specularity coefficient decreases with an increasing slurry mean velocity second a slurry with a higher solid volume fraction always requires a larger specularity coefficient third in larger pipes particle diameter significantly affects the appropriate specularity coefficient value whereas in smaller pipes this influence is limited lastly the appropriate specularity coefficient is found more sensitive in the case of the combination of fine particles and large pipes and is more sensitive to the flow velocity in the flow regime of bf when a thin stationary deposit of solids at the bottom of the pipe appears tfm underestimates the hydraulic gradient indicating that providing reasonable estimates in the bf seems beyond the capability of tfm therefore further studies are needed to extend the application scope of this model investigation of more pipe diameters more particle diameters and other important parameters like pipe wall roughness are also required to pave the way to provide appropriate specularity coefficients with a wide range of applicability in addition it is believed that additional analytical theoretical analysis will strengthen our future work credit authorship contribution statement weihuang liu conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing

d 0 55 mm v m 3 1 m s α s v 0 3 φ 0 1 and l 60d for brevity only the piezometric head h of grids c f i e and d are presented in fig a 4 these five grids are selected because grids c f and i can demonstrate the effect of grid resolution on the cross section whereas grids f e and d can demonstrate the effect in the axial direction in fig a 4a in comparison with the finest grid i the value of h predicted by grid c has a small but distinct deviation grid f provides an almost similar result indicating that grid f has a sufficient resolution for the simulation in fig a 4b although grids d e and f have different node quantities in the axial direction no noticeable deviation is observed this implies that grid d is satisfactory therefore grid d is selected for all the simulations in this paper to verify the results a quantitative comparison of the hydraulic gradients is presented in table a 1 appendix b entry length during real pipe loop testing inlet flow disturbances occur because of the effects of the centrifugal pump valve and bend colwell and shook 1988 experimentally determined the entry length for horizontal pipeline slurry flows they concluded that for sand slurries the required entry length was at least 50d an entry length is also needed for simulations because of the uniformly distributed velocity and concentration that are always imposed at the inlet however there exists no consensus on the recommended value of the entry length owing to the differences in the examined flow conditions used cfd codes and expected computational accuracy values an entry length study is performed to ensure that the extracted data from our simulation is in the fully developed flow state case a v m 4 m s d 263 mm d 0 29 mm α s v 0 16 and φ 0 045 and an extended grid d with l 150d are selected to perform the simulation in fig b 1a five lines labeled with z 0 7r to 0 7r indicate the positions at which the outputs are measured in fig b 1b the black solid line represents the piezometric head along the pipe centerline whereas the red dashed line indicates the hydraulic gradient the number 0 63 is the relative error of i at 60d from 150d the outlet section at 90d this relative error decreases to 0 11 fig b 1c depicts the solid volume fraction development along the five lines after 60d all the curves begin to stabilize to certain values at 90d for z 0 7r 0 5r and 0 all the absolute values of the relative errors are below 1 for z 0 7r and 0 5r the relative errors are higher due to the rather low concentration in these areas this implies that a small change can result in a large disturbance to the relative error fig b 1d shows the solid phase velocity development along the five lines in comparison with fig b 1c small but obvious curve changes can be distinguished between 60d and 90d indicating that the velocity requires a longer distance to stabilize thus it can be concluded that when only the hydraulic gradient or solid volume fraction is considered a value of 60d is sufficient for the entry length if the effect of solid velocity is involved it is safe to extend the entry length to 90d to perform a reliable quantitative study we set the entry length as well as the computational domain to 90d

solid phase governing equations whereas the latter controls the interactions between the particles and the wall johnson and jackson bcs are widely used in numerical simulations of fluid solid multiphase flows they contain two bcs the first is for the slip velocity derived from the balance of force whereas the second is for the granular temperature derived from the balance of energy in both cases the specularity coefficient φ is an important input parameter that controls the tangential momentum transferred per particle wall collision johnson and jackson 1987 thus φ has an intrinsic impact on the predicted hydraulic gradient which gets the most attention from engineers hui et al 1984 first introduced φ and provided a detailed explanation on the determination of its value they noted that there was a lack of necessary distribution functions to average the possibilities of collision thus it was possible to conduct qualitative analysis on φ with microscale experiments but its quantity had to be determined empirically moreover such microscale experiments have not been reported in previous literature altantzis et al 2015 li and benyahia 2012 loha et al 2013 although it has been concluded that the value of φ is dependent on the large scale roughness of the surface boundary hui et al 1984 johnson and jackson 1987 many recent studies have demonstrated that φ is not only related to the properties of the boundary but also to the flow conditions thus it cannot be independently determined altantzis et al 2015 li and benyahia 2012 zhao et al 2016 presently the common approach to determine the value of φ is by fitting the predicted results to the macroscale experimental outputs such as pressure drop phase velocity or phase volume fraction table 1 lists the publications that have investigated the value of φ in the last 5 years these studies refer not only to the liquid solid slurries in horizontal pipelines but also to other granular flows to provide a more well rounded view it is apparent from table 1 that it can be concluded that extensive attempts have been made for the determination of φ regarding fluidization this is owing to the consensus that φ has a significant effect on the solid circulation time voidage pressure drop solid mass flow rate and cluster formation however with regard to the slurry transport in pipelines lesser efforts have been directed toward the determination of φ in some of the studies related to slurry transport the values of φ were not clearly specified chen et al 2009 ekambara et al 2009 hashemi et al 2016 kaushal et al 2012 kumar gopaliya and kaushal 2016 singh et al 2017 whereas in the other studies presented in table 1 the values of φ were given but there were no detailed explanations on the reasons for selecting them in addition most of the recommended φ values for the slurry were extracted from a limited set of working points therefore the variation of this parameter over a continuous range of flow conditions is unclear in the present study the sand water slurries transported in horizontal pipelines are simulated using tfm integrated with ktgf and johnson and jackson bcs a full assessment is conducted for the computational grid and the entry length to ensure that our research is based on a solid foundation the effect of the specularity coefficient φ 0 0 025 0 05 0 075 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 1 on the predicted hydraulic gradient is analyzed for slurries with different flow velocities solid volume fractions and particle and pipe diameters then the appropriate values of the specularity coefficient φ app are extracted based on experimental measurements and the relationship between φ app and the flow conditions is analyzed in the range of specularity coefficient values and flow conditions considered in this study the findings may serve as a reference for further simulations in the research field of slurry transport in pipelines 2 cfd modeling 2 1 geometry and grid given the simple geometry and symmetry of a horizontal pipeline system the computational domain is set up as half a cylinder with four boundary surfaces i e inlet outlet wall and plane of symmetry as illustrated in fig 1 therefore the number of grid cells involved in the computational process is halved in comparison with that of the entire cylinder the grid used in this study includes 626 562 cells 1 917 300 faces and 665 091 nodes as depicted in fig 2 a total of 851 and 40 nodes are evenly separated in the axial and circumferential directions respectively there are 27 nodes in the radial direction with more nodes placed in the vicinity of the wall owing to the high gradient of velocity and volume fraction in this area the detailed grid configuration and the grid dependency study are presented in appendix a in general the uniform distribution of the velocity and volume fraction for a phase is specified at the inlet kaushal et al 2012 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore the computational domain should be long enough to eliminate the influence of this inlet condition and to provide space for the full development of the slurry flow the minimum length between the inlet and the cross section downstream wherein the flow becomes fully developed is defined as the entry length colwell and shook 1988 in this study we set the entry length as 90d and the reason why this value is selected is discussed in detail in appendix b 2 2 eulerian model the slurry flow is studied using the tfm which describes any phase i e fluid or solid as an interpenetrating continuum with the same pressure all the phases should satisfy the conservation equations for mass momentum and energy to solve these conservation equations appropriate drag models and constitutive equations should be employed in addition a suitable turbulence model is required to obtain satisfactory hydrodynamic predictions in the fully developed turbulent flow table 2 lists the conservation equations for liquid solid flows the mass and momentum conservation equations eqs 2 5 are solved for the corresponding phases given that the investigated flows are assumed to be isothermal and there exists no mass transfer between the different phases the mass transfer term in the continuity and energy equations is not included in the momentum equation the lift force is obtained from the study conducted by moraga et al 1999 and the turbulent dispersion force is calculated based on the study conducted by burns et al 2004 based on the ktgf the kinetic energy caused by the particles random motion is quantified using granular temperature this is solved through the granular temperature transport equation eq 6 proposed by ding and gidaspow 1990 the gidaspow model gidaspow et al 1992 a combination of the wen and yu model wen and yu 1966 and the ergun equation ergun 1952 is used to specify the interphase exchange coefficients in eqs 4 and 5 the equations are listed in table 3 table 4 lists the basic constitutive equations derived from the ktgf the stress strain tensors in the momentum equations are calculated based on eqs 10 and 11 to solve the solid phase stress strain tensor two variables are introduced the first is the solid bulk viscosity accounting for the solid phase resistance to compression and expansion as given by eq 12 the second is the solid shear viscosity including the collisional kinetic and frictional parts as described by eqs 13 16 as given by eq 17 the solid pressure in the momentum equation is composed of a kinetic term and a term representing particle collisions for all the collision related terms a radial distribution function is introduced to control the particle collision probability herein we use a simple form given by ogawa et al 1980 presented in eq 18 the diffusion coefficient for granular energy collisional energy dissipation and energy exchange between different phases are represented by eqs 19 21 as closures for eq 6 k ε turbulence model for each phase is selected to describe the turbulent characteristics the basic turbulence equations are presented in table 5 while the detailed constitutive equations for closure of these equations can be found in our previous work li et al 2020 2 3 boundary conditions at the inlet the slurry bulk mean velocities v m that have been used by gillies 1993 are imposed uniformly for both phases while the local solid volume fractions averaged over the loop volume α s v are imposed uniformly for the solid phase the turbulent intensity is set at 5 and the viscosity ratio is set at 10 at the outlet a constant atmospheric pressure is specified at the plane of symmetry the symmetry bc is applied at the wall for the liquid phase the no slip condition is applied whereas for the solid phase the johnson and jackson bcs are applied the johnson and jackson bcs have been widely used for the simulation of multiphase flow and the main equations are listed in table 6 fig 3 provides an illustration for the derivation of johnson and jackson bcs when the particles interact with a flat frictional and fixed wall first as depicted in fig 3 and described by eq 24 in the area next to the boundary the condition for the particle slip velocity v slip is obtained by equating the tangential force per unit area exerted on the boundary by the particles to the corresponding stress within the particle assembly on the left hand side of eq 24 the first term represents the component of the bulk stress vector in the direction of v slip the second term denotes the rate of momentum transfer to the unit area of the boundary by collisions it is the product of the average tangential momentum transferred per collision φ π ρ s d 3 v slip 6 collision frequency for each particle 3 θ s and number of particles adjacent to the unit area of the boundary 1 a c the third term denotes the magnitude of the tangential friction component based on coulomb s law johnson and jackson 1987 second as depicted in fig 3 johnson and jackson 1987 introduced eq 25 based on the total energy and the true thermal balances over the control volume next to the wall boundary d is described in eq 26 and represents the rate of dissipation of pseudo thermal energy due to inelastic collisions of particles within the unit area of the boundary similar to the second term in eq 24 d is the product of the energy loss per collision collision frequency per particle and number of particles adjacent to the unit area of the boundary because the specularity coefficient is the main subject of our study it is explained in detail below the average tangential momentum transferred per collision defined by johnson and jackson 1987 is 29 m t w φ π ρ s d 3 v slip 6 we may express φ explicitly as 30 φ m t w ρ s π 6 d 3 v slip from eq 30 it is clear that φ is a fraction wherein the numerator is equal to the average tangential momentum transferred per collision and the denominator is equal to the average tangential momentum possessed by the particle a sphere this equation indicates that φ directly controls the relative amount of tangential momentum transferred from the particle to the wall and mathematically explains the reason for the variation of φ between zero for perfectly specular collisions and unity for perfectly diffuse collisions johnson and jackson 1987 2 4 solver settings a cfd software package ansys fluent 19 0 is employed to solve the equations described in section 2 3 using the finite volume method the time independent calculations are performed the flow field is initialized by the hybrid initialization method with the number of iterations set as 10 and the explicit under relaxation factor set as 1 the pressure based solver is used and the gradients are computed according to the least squares cell based methods for the pressure velocity coupling the phase coupled simple pc simple algorithm vasquez and ivanov 2000 is employed the momentum equations are discretized using the second order upwind scheme whereas the other equations are discretized using the first order upwind scheme achieving the computational convergence is highly dependent on the under relaxation factors which are carefully specified particularly for the momentum in the present study the under relaxation factors for pressure density body forces momentum volume fraction granular temperature turbulent kinetic energy turbulent dissipation rate and turbulent viscosity are set as 0 2 0 5 0 5 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 4 0 4 and 0 5 for each scaled residual component a convergence criterion of 10 4 is specified in general the time required by a computer with an intel r core tm i7 7700 cpu to satisfy this convergence criterion is 6 h 3 simulations valuable measurement data can be obtained from previous experimental studies gillies 1993 gillies et al 2004 kaushal et al 2005 matoušek et al 2013 matoušek 2002 fig 4 summarizes the experimental cases selected from those proposed by gillies 1993 in this study all the comparisons are based on these eight experimental cases because 1 these cases covered a range of flow conditions i e low and high flow velocities low and high solid volume fractions fine and coarse particles and small and large pipe diameters thus investigating this range would provide a thorough understanding of the effect of the specularity coefficient and 2 these cases are selected in the way that different flow conditions can be compared directly e g the only difference between cases a and b is the solids concentration and by comparing them we can obtain the effect of solids concentration on the appropriate specularity coefficient and 3 in these cases gillies provided the measurement methods as well as sufficient details of the experimental outputs among them the hydraulic gradient and local solids concentration are two important variables that can be used for comparison cases of some other particle diameters and solids concentrations are not presented however the authors can provide corresponding results for the interested readers 4 results and discussion 4 1 model validation a reliable cfd model should provide a reasonable prediction for the flow variables in the case of slurry pipe flows at least the predicted hydraulic gradient and local solids concentration distribution should be validated against the available experimental data messa and matoušek 2020 therefore before going deep into the study of the relationship of hydraulic gradient and specularity coefficient a validation section is needed to show the ability of the model to predict the local solids concentration distribution fig 5 shows the predicted local solids concentration profiles and the experimental data for case a to h for clarity only curves for φ 0 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 5 and 1 are shown when gillies 1993 conducted the experiment the local solids concentration was measured using a traversing γ ray density gauge the data was collected on 10 evenly separated levels from the pipe bottom in order to compare the present prediction with the experiment data the similar measurement method is used that is to select the solids concentration averaged over horizontal chord α s γ on the measured cross section which is located at l 85d where the outlet effect is negligible compared with gillies 1993 in the present study more data is collected with a shorter interval of δz r 0 05 it can be seen from fig 5 that qualitatively α s γ profiles predicted by the model agree with the experimental data and this agreement is satisfactory within the central region of the pipe 0 5 z r 0 5 when comparing figs 5 and 6 in section 4 2 it can be seen that a φ giving a reasonable prediction for the hydraulic gradient can also provide a satisfactory α s γ profile in addition gillies 1993 noticed an obvious reversal in the concentration gradient near the pipe bottom at a high mean velocity 3 1 m s for case f and this phenomenon is successively captured by the present model as shown in fig 5f 4 2 effect of specularity coefficient on hydraulic gradient fig 6 depicts the effect of φ on the hydraulic gradient i for 0 29 and 0 55 mm particle diameters sand slurries with α s v ranging from 0 15 to 0 34 in pipes of 53 2 and 263 mm inner diameters gillies 1993 observed the stationary and intermittent deposits at the bottom of the pipe when the mean velocity was low according to the classification proposed by doron and barnea 1996 such a flow regime is identified as a bed flow bf the corresponding areas in the figures are colored in dark gray on the contrary when the mean velocity is high all solids can be suspended in the pipe and such a flow regime is called a fully suspended fs flow the two vertical dashed lines in fig 6 correspond to the maximum velocity of bf and the minimum velocity of fs which are extracted directly from the experiments conducted by gillies 1993 the middle areas colored in light gray can be considered as either bf or fs owing to the measurement interval from fig 6 two basic trends can be distinguished first for each φ i increases with the increasing slurry mean bulk velocity v m this can be explained as follows from eq 29 it can be seen that if φ is fixed the average tangential momentum transferred per collision is proportional to the slip velocity v slip therefore when v m increases v slip increases and more momentum is transferred to the wall leading to an increase in i second at a fixed velocity the predicted value of i is positively correlated with φ this can be explained by the definition of φ as presented in eq 30 for each particle wall collision the higher the value of φ the greater the momentum transferred from the particle to the wall which increases the shear force on the wall and thus increasing the wall friction to the slurry therefore from a macroscopic viewpoint a larger value of i is observed these two variation trends are similar to the results extracted from li et al 2018a it is worth noting that as v m increases i becomes more sensitive to φ as shown in figs 6 and 7 for example in case h at v m 1 5 m s when φ increases from 0 to 1 the increase in i is 0 074 whereas at v m 3 1 m s the increase is 0 275 i e 3 72 times the former in addition it can be seen from fig 6 that for all cases when v m is fixed i is more sensitive to the lower values of φ particularly for φ 0 1 therefore more check points are required when 0 φ 0 1 this phenomenon is illustrated in fig 8 wherein for brevity reasons only case h is presented 4 3 appropriate value of specularity coefficient this study aims to provide a reference for determining the value of φ therefore based on the results summarized in fig 6 each appropriate value of φ denoted as φ app is attained by linear interpolation and presented in fig 9 because of the small interval between the two adjacent simulated φ the accuracy of such an interpolation process is believed sufficient to enhance readability a case label is attached in the lower part of fig 9 and the minimum and maximum values of φ app are specified at the ends of the corresponding curve for each case the range of φ app under all flow conditions is 0 019 0 593 the discussion below is based on fig 9 with regard to the relationship between φ app and v m the appropriate value of φ decreases with the increase in v m in all the examined cases a high value of v m leads to two opposite consequences on the force exerted on the unit area of the boundary due to particle wall collisions this is given by the second term on the left hand side of eq 24 the first consequence is that a high value of v m decreases the number of particles near the bottom at a high velocity the solid volume fraction is more uniformly distributed in the pipe leading to a shrinkage of the fraction profile near the bottom of the pipe as was observed by gillies 1993 which is reproduced in our simulation as shown in fig 10 the second consequence is that a high velocity increases the velocity fluctuation and the slip velocity of the particles near the wall this leads to more frequent particle wall collisions and more average tangential momentum is transferred per collision the latter consequence should be dominant so that a decreasing φ is required to restrict the excessive growth of the force exerted on the wall therefore from this point of view the role of φ is that of a tuner for the predicted hydraulic gradient with regard to the relationship between φ app and α s v the only difference between cases c and d is the value of α s v in all the examined values of v m the dense case d requires a larger φ than the dilute case c to obtain an accurate result this is also true for cases a and b e and f and g and h therefore a slurry flow with a higher α s v always requires a larger φ with regard to the relationship between φ app and d in a 263 mm pipe at v m 4 0 m s the value of φ app in case c is 0 165 which is 3 84 times that in case a 0 043 at v m 5 0 m s the value of φ app in case c is 3 26 times that in case a a similar result is observed in the comparison of the denser cases b and d wherein the value of φ app in case d is 9 42 times that in case b at v m 4 0 m s whereas it is 3 26 times that in case b at v m 5 0 m s thus it is can be concluded that a slurry with larger particles requires a considerably larger φ than a slurry with smaller particles however in a 53 2 mm pipe the value of φ app in cases e and g is less sensitive to the change in particle diameter when v m is approximately 1 5 m s the value of φ app in case e differs most from that in case g and the corresponding ratio of φ app is 2 28 in addition for the denser cases f and h the values of φ app are almost identical therefore in the large pipe particle diameter significantly affects φ app whereas in the small pipe this influence is diminished this phenomenon indicates that the particle and pipe diameters seem to have a combined impact on φ app to further analyze the combined impact of d and d on φ app the stokes number stk is introduced although stk is used more often in experimental fluid dynamics it can also act as an indicator showing the ability of particles to form a homogeneous mixture in the case of slurry flow in pipeline stk is defined as 31 s t k ρ s d 2 18 ρ l ν l 2 v m d fig 11 shows the relation between φ app and stk to eliminate the influence of different solids concentration only cases with α s v around 0 15 are presented it can be seen from fig 11 that as stk increases φ app decreases for all the cases this is consistent with the relation between v m and φ app because for a given case stk and v m are proportional and it can be seen clearly that φ app changes more rapidly in the range of low stk for case a which corresponds to low stk the value of δφ app δstk in the investigated range is 1 33 while for case e which corresponds to high stk this value is 0 07 this means that φ app is more sensitive in the case of the combination of fine particles and large pipes in addition it can be seen that for each case log φ app and stk are approximately linearly related which can be expressed in the form of log φ app a s t k b 4 4 specularity coefficient and flow regimes different flow regimes patterns associate with quite different particle support mechanisms tfm is a practical way to simulate hydraulic conveying of particles in the fully suspended flow however it is difficult for tfm to estimate the transition of different flow regimes messa and matoušek 2020 recently attempts have been made to extend the results from the rapid flow regime to all flow regimes using discrete element simulations wang 2020 one of such attempts is done with the method of cfd dem in the study of modeling and analysis of flow regimes in hydraulic conveying of coarse particles zhou et al 2020 however it is necessary and beneficial to explore the upper limit of the capacity of the tfm used in the present study and discuss the relation between the values of φ and the different flow patterns it can be seen from fig 6 that close to the lowest v m at which a thin stationary deposit of solids at the bottom of the pipe was observed by gillies 1993 the present model underpredicts the hydraulic gradient for cases c d f g and h even at φ 1 this underprediction of hydraulic gradient at extremely low v m is consistent with the founding by messa and matoušek 2020 therefore it is safe to use the present tfm in the flow regime of fs the relation between the ranges of φ app and the different flow patterns is not obvious however it can be seen in fig 9 that φ app changes more rapidly with v m in the range of bf than fs for case a the value of δφ app δv m in bf is 0 23 while in fs it is 0 03 for case b the value of δφ app δv m in bf is 0 47 while in fs it is 0 06 therefore φ app is more sensitive to v m in the flow regime of bf 5 conclusions in this study the sand water slurry flows in horizontal pipelines were simulated using the tfm integrated with the ktgf and johnson and jackson bcs after the model validation the effect of the specularity coefficient on the predicted hydraulic gradient was analyzed covering a range of flow conditions including different flow velocities solid volume fractions particle diameters and pipe diameters the following conclusions can be drawn at a fixed slurry bulk mean velocity the predicted hydraulic gradient is positively correlated with the specularity coefficient and is more sensitive to a specularity coefficient less than 0 1 then as the slurry bulk mean velocity increases the predicted hydraulic gradient becomes more sensitive to the specularity coefficient furthermore the simulation results were compared with previous experimental measurements to determine the appropriate values of the specularity coefficient under different flow conditions additionally the relationship between the appropriate specularity coefficient values and the flow conditions was discussed first we found that the appropriate value of the specularity coefficient decreases with an increasing slurry mean velocity second a slurry with a higher solid volume fraction always requires a larger specularity coefficient third in larger pipes particle diameter significantly affects the appropriate specularity coefficient value whereas in smaller pipes this influence is limited lastly the appropriate specularity coefficient is found more sensitive in the case of the combination of fine particles and large pipes and is more sensitive to the flow velocity in the flow regime of bf when a thin stationary deposit of solids at the bottom of the pipe appears tfm underestimates the hydraulic gradient indicating that providing reasonable estimates in the bf seems beyond the capability of tfm therefore further studies are needed to extend the application scope of this model investigation of more pipe diameters more particle diameters and other important parameters like pipe wall roughness are also required to pave the way to provide appropriate specularity coefficients with a wide range of applicability in addition it is believed that additional analytical theoretical analysis will strengthen our future work credit authorship contribution statement weihuang liu conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing

d 0 55 mm v m 3 1 m s α s v 0 3 φ 0 1 and l 60d for brevity only the piezometric head h of grids c f i e and d are presented in fig a 4 these five grids are selected because grids c f and i can demonstrate the effect of grid resolution on the cross section whereas grids f e and d can demonstrate the effect in the axial direction in fig a 4a in comparison with the finest grid i the value of h predicted by grid c has a small but distinct deviation grid f provides an almost similar result indicating that grid f has a sufficient resolution for the simulation in fig a 4b although grids d e and f have different node quantities in the axial direction no noticeable deviation is observed this implies that grid d is satisfactory therefore grid d is selected for all the simulations in this paper to verify the results a quantitative comparison of the hydraulic gradients is presented in table a 1 appendix b entry length during real pipe loop testing inlet flow disturbances occur because of the effects of the centrifugal pump valve and bend colwell and shook 1988 experimentally determined the entry length for horizontal pipeline slurry flows they concluded that for sand slurries the required entry length was at least 50d an entry length is also needed for simulations because of the uniformly distributed velocity and concentration that are always imposed at the inlet however there exists no consensus on the recommended value of the entry length owing to the differences in the examined flow conditions used cfd codes and expected computational accuracy values an entry length study is performed to ensure that the extracted data from our simulation is in the fully developed flow state case a v m 4 m s d 263 mm d 0 29 mm α s v 0 16 and φ 0 045 and an extended grid d with l 150d are selected to perform the simulation in fig b 1a five lines labeled with z 0 7r to 0 7r indicate the positions at which the outputs are measured in fig b 1b the black solid line represents the piezometric head along the pipe centerline whereas the red dashed line indicates the hydraulic gradient the number 0 63 is the relative error of i at 60d from 150d the outlet section at 90d this relative error decreases to 0 11 fig b 1c depicts the solid volume fraction development along the five lines after 60d all the curves begin to stabilize to certain values at 90d for z 0 7r 0 5r and 0 all the absolute values of the relative errors are below 1 for z 0 7r and 0 5r the relative errors are higher due to the rather low concentration in these areas this implies that a small change can result in a large disturbance to the relative error fig b 1d shows the solid phase velocity development along the five lines in comparison with fig b 1c small but obvious curve changes can be distinguished between 60d and 90d indicating that the velocity requires a longer distance to stabilize thus it can be concluded that when only the hydraulic gradient or solid volume fraction is considered a value of 60d is sufficient for the entry length if the effect of solid velocity is involved it is safe to extend the entry length to 90d to perform a reliable quantitative study we set the entry length as well as the computational domain to 90d
