4935,water resource managers depend on the collection of accurate hydrometric data for various modeling and planning projects an essential use of hydrometric data includes hydrologic modelling and forecasting to support decision making in water resources planning and management it is therefore essential to design hydrometric monitoring networks while considering the relationship between data collection and model application a new model based network design strategy is proposed that embeds hydrological models into a multi objective evolutionary algorithm facilitating direct optimization according to the model based design objectives this method is compared to the traditional model based approach used to design hydrometric monitoring networks the traditional approach is to first conduct optimization using secondary design objectives that are not model based to identify a set of optimal networks hydrological models are then applied as a post processing mechanism to identify which of the optimal networks best satisfy the model orientated design objectives or users needs in this investigation the well established dual entropy multi objective optimization demo approach was employed to conduct the initial network design based on the principles of information theory followed by post processing with rainfall runoff models two case studies are evaluated a monitoring network reduction in the fraser river basin and a network augmentation in an upstream subsection of the churchill river basin results show that embedding models in the optimization algorithm consistently yields better network configurations compared to those identified using the traditional method it is shown that a smaller size optimal network that outperforms larger size networks can be identified directly by the proposed method the models and model performance criteria used in the design process can be readily adapted allowing for a user directed design capable of addressing problem specific objectives on a case by case basis keywords hydrometric monitoring networks entropy hydrological modelling optimization 1 introduction a hydrometric network is a collection of stations that provide point source monitoring of the quality or quantity of various hydrological processes at discrete temporal intervals world meteorological organization 2008 such networks are leveraged to collect discharge rates along natural channel corridors halverson and fleming 2015 stosic et al 2017 monitor the quality of groundwater reservoirs mogheir and singh 2002 kollat et al 2011 and to assess the spatial distribution of precipitation across a watershed krstanovic and singh 1992 wang et al 2019 point source measurements from monitoring networks do not provide the fine spatial and temporal resolution of areal datasets developed with remote sensing technologies however continued in situ data collection is still required to enable the validation of remote sensing products and prolong the historical record of well established monitoring stations swenson et al 2006 ragettli et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 climate change is also continually contributing to deviations from the historical record thereby limiting hydrologists and engineers in their ability to rely on assumptions of stationarity when leveraging hydrometric data for design and decision making purposes vaze et al 2010 françois et al 2019 the successful adaptation of modeling and design strategies to account for non stationarity in both meteorological statistics and land use characteristics is dependent on the continued collection of accurate hydrometric data preferably at increasingly finer spatial and temporal resolutions however in many countries around the world the number of operational hydrometric monitoring stations is decreasing mishra and coulibaly 2009 2010 the reduction in the global density of many monitoring networks can be attributed to a combination of aging infrastructure increasing capital costs for new stations and diminishing operational budgets for the maintenance of existing networks ruhi et al 2018 therefore the optimal design of hydrometric monitoring networks is needed to facilitate the continued capture of fundamental hydrologic data while accounting for practical design constraints imposed by financial and physical limitations furthermore given the natural progression from data collection to model calibration and ultimately model application it is logical to develop a process for the design of hydrometric monitoring networks that considers the implications of network design on model performance and utility optimal network design requires the spatial distribution of stations in a network to result in a non dominated system with respect to pareto dominance when considering the chosen design criteria typical network design objectives include minimizing network size or cost tasker and moss 1979 luo et al 2016 maximizing the amount of information collected by the network alfonso et al 2010 samuel et al 2013 and minimizing the collection of redundant information werstuck and coulibaly 2018 employing multiple objectives in the design process typically produces a pareto front of non dominated solutions the comparison between pareto optimal solutions represents a trade off such that the selection of one solution over another results in an improvement of one design objective to the detriment of a different objective applying weights to objective functions provides decision makers with a means to determine a single optimal network when considering multiple design criteria li et al 2012 ultimately the number of candidate networks selected and their respective spatial distributions varies depending on which technique or methodology is employed in the network design process mishra and coulibaly 2009 provided an extensive review of the techniques commonly employed in the design of surface water networks for the monitoring of precipitation and streamflow some of the primary design methodologies reviewed include statistical analysis rodríguez iturbe and mejía 1974 burn and goulter 1991 spatial interpolation techniques karnieli 1990 weisse and bois 2002 entropy based methods husain 1989 joo et al 2019 various optimization procedures kollat et al 2008 reed and kollat 2012 network design based on physiographic characteristics laize 2004 nour et al 2006 and several hybrid approaches pardo igúzquiza 1998 markus et al 2003 while all network design methods have their distinct merits and shortcomings recent studies have shown that the design of hydrometric networks using multi objective optimization with entropy based optimization objectives is well suited to the design of robust multipurpose monitoring networks samuel et al 2013 keum et al 2017 the dual entropy multi objective optimization demo approach samuel et al 2013 is a notable example of integrating the principles of information theory into a multi objective optimization framework to design streamflow monitoring networks demo designs general purpose hydrometric networks by employing a multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea to assess candidate monitoring networks based on multiple design objectives related to information theory traditionally demo identifies candidate networks by seeking to maximize the joint entropy of a network while simultaneously minimizing total correlation demo is adaptable and capable of addressing problem specific design characteristics by incorporating additional design objectives leach et al 2015 2016 keum and coulibaly 2017a recently keum et al 2018 added conceptual hydrological models as post processors to the network design process to further evaluate candidate networks according to model performance statistics this type of evaluation creates opportunities for user directed designs that consider the impact of data collection on specific modeling applications for instance when designing a network for flood forecasting purposes networks that promote the collection of hydrometric data leading to the effective modeling of peak flows may be favored previously studies that utilize hydrological models as part of the network design process xu et al 2013 2015 keum et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 typically do so by using hydrological models as part of a post processing procedure firstly intermediate design objectives such as those traditionally applied by demo guide the network design process by generating a set of non dominated candidate networks hydrological models are then used to further evaluate and filter the original solution set according to the primary design objectives which are at least in part some combination of model performance criteria applying models as a post processing mechanism does not enable a unified review and assessment of the relationship between data collection model calibration and model application as part of a single continuous design process for instance networks should be considered as optimal based on the primary design objectives which are derived from model performance statistics however optimal networks based on these primary objectives can be unidentified if dominated during an optimization process facilitated by intermediate objectives embedding hydrological models and when necessary the model calibration procedure into existing moeas addresses this issue by enabling moeas to explore the solution space according to the primary design objectives directly this research compares a newly proposed model based network design technique which embeds hydrological models into moeas to the traditional approach of applying models as a post processing mechanism semi distributed models are applied to facilitate the design of streamflow monitoring networks in two large canadian watersheds both approaches generate a set of pareto optimal networks that assess the trade off between maximizing model performance at select flood sensitive catchments fsc and minimizing network size this study considered flood sensitive catchments as priority sites where model performance should be optimized however it is important to note the proposed methodology is flexible and can be adaptedto prioritize model performance at specific catchments on a case by case basis maps visually summarizing the spatial distribution of station selection frequency and model performance at fsc are presented for all design scenarios thereafter conclusions and observations regarding the differences between the two investigated model based design strategies are discussed 2 study areas and data 2 1 fraser river basin upstream of the town of hope canada 2 1 1 study area general description the fraser river basin frb upstream of the town of hope is one of two study areas this portion of the watershed has a drainage area of 217 000 square kilometers or 90 of the total frb discharging directly to the pacific ocean the fraser river basin drains approximately a quarter of all streamflow in british columbia canada the headwaters of the fraser river originate in the northeastern extents of the watershed in the rocky mountains the river generally flows southward merging with the nechako river the chilcotin river and other major tributaries before draining into the strait of georgia and discharging into the salish sea southwest of the city of vancouver benke and cushing 2005 the terrain in the basin is classified mainly as mountainous with a 3950 m elevation differential between its high point and the basin outlet more than 90 of the watershed is undeveloped the only major urban centers excluding the greater vancouver metropolitan area immediately surrounding the outlet are prince george and kamloops nevertheless many small towns and semi isolated settlements are located along the major drainage corridors the frb is culturally significant to many first nations communities and is considered one of the most ecologically important riverine habitats for salmon in the world northcote and larkin 1989 the climatic profile of the frb is spatially diverse with notable variations in climate and vegetative cover between the coastal mountainous and plateau regions annual precipitation rates average 400 800 mm in the interior plateaus but can exceed 3000 mm year in the coastal and mountainous portions of the basin the average air temperature increase from 0 5 c in the north to 7 5 c in the south as the elevation of the watershed decreases benke and cushing 2005 the semi distributed hydrological models leveraged in this study utilize daily temperature and precipitation as forcing inputs the gridded daily canadian precipitation analysis capa dataset was used to obtain precipitation data for this study area thiessen polygon analysis facilitated spatial interpolation of daily temperature observations taken from 134 meteorological stations to generate daily temperature data representative of specific catchments 2 1 2 study area existing hydrometric network the study area has 106 streamflow monitoring stations to consider during the network design process the world meteorological organization wmo guidelines recommend a network density of one station per 1000 km2 1875 km2 and 2750 km2 for mountainous hilly undulating and coastal regions respectively the frb is a mixture of all three regions therefore an average network density of one station per 1875 km2 is the recommended network density these guidelines suggest a network of 116 stations only 10 stations more than currently exist in the frb given that the frb is relatively well gauged by wmo guidelines a network reduction design was facilitated instead of a more traditional network augmentation by performing a network reduction in the frb only observed time series associated with existing stations are considered during the design process this in turn allows for a proof of concept scenario that is not dependent on the assumptions and uncertainty associated with the generation of synthetic time series for potential station locations network design applications require some stations to be defined as existing or fixed unless the objective is to design the entire monitoring network from scratch for the frb the 43 non first order gauged catchment outlets were considered as existing stations these stations are included as part of each candidate network identified during the design process consequently the remaining 63 first order catchments outlets were treated as pseudo potential stations essentially variations in the spatial distribution of the most upstream monitoring stations characterize the differences between the optimal networks identified for this study area keum and coulibaly 2017b suggest utilizing at least 10 years of continuous daily data when designing hydrometric networks using demo based on this recommendation 10 years of daily streamflow data from 2003 to 2012 most recent data available were obtained for the 106 stations included for use in this study missing streamflow values were infilled using inverse distance weighting drainage area ratio idw dar regionalization several studies have identified idw dar as one of the most effective regionalization techniques for infilling missing streamflow measurements in canadian watersheds samuel et al 2013 werstuck and coulibaly 2017 land use maps government of canada 2010 were used in conjunction with data from the 2016 canadian census to identify the flood sensitive catchments fsc in the frb fig 1 provides maps visualizing the spatial distribution of stations land use and fsc in the frb table 1 summarizes the primary study area statistics pertaining to the network design process 2 2 churchill river basin upstream of the otter rapids canada 2 2 1 study area general description headwaters for the churchill river originate in northeastern alberta at beaver lake and northern saskatchewan around the wollaston lake area the river runs eastward passing through the provinces of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba before discharging into hudson bay benke and cushing 2005 approximately 75 of the flow through the churchill river is diverted to the south into the more extensive nelson river system at southern indian lake in north central manitoba partial diversion of the churchill river into the nelson valley system was conducted in 1976 to enhance hydropower development in the downstream extents of the nelson river valley newbury et al 1984 the cold and dry climate of the churchill river basin crb is characteristic of subarctic regions lane and sykes 1982 the frost free period ranges from 60 to 120 days annually mean daily air temperatures range from as low as 27 5 c in january to as high as 17 5 c in july the rain shadow effect of the rocky mountains to the west limits annual precipitation to 400 600 mm year on average concerning land use the crb is mostly undeveloped the landscape is generally dominated by forest and wetlands zubrycki et al 2016 except for limited agricultural and urban development predominately located along the southern boundary of the watershed the portion of the crb upstream of otter rapids acts as the second study area for this research investigation this region represents a total drainage area of 119 000 square kilometers the entire study area is upstream of the major river diversion by selecting a primarily naturalized portion of the watershed upstream of any significant anthropogenic alterations the need to make modelling assumptions to account for the impact of damming or water retrievals was eliminated 2 2 2 study area existing hydrometric network as with the frb land use maps government of canada 2010 were used in conjunction with data from the 2016 canadian census to identify the fsc in the crb fig 2 provides maps visualizing the spatial distribution of stations land use and fsc in the crb table 1 provides the study area statistics related to the network design process based on wmo guidelines a watershed the size of the study area with an interior plains physiographic classification should have a network density of one streamflow monitoring station per 1875 km2 world meteorological organization 2008 translating to a recommended network density of 64 stations the existing monitoring network is comprised of only 13 stations therefore the crb can be considered poorly gauged by wmo minimum network densityguidelines a network augmentation design was performed by applying the proposed research methodology the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model results for the nelson churchill river basin ncrb stadnyk and bajracharya 2019 provide time series for potential station locations in some instances the sub catchment configurations utilized in the hype model set up were aggregated to reduce the number of potential stations and by extension the computational cost aggregation of sub catchments was only performed in unpopulated and undeveloped areas as the emphasis of the study was to identify monitoring network configurations that optimize model performance at flood sensitive or highly developed catchments a total of 13 existing stations and 78 potential stations were considered in the network design process gaps in observed time series for existing stations were infilled using hype model output the hydrological global forcing data hydro gfd reanalysis dataset provides daily temperature and precipitation time series representative of individual catchments berg et al 2018 a ten year daily times series record from 2001 to 2010 was applied to conduct the network augmentation representing the most recent ten year period suitable for analysis based on the availability of hype model results 2 3 description of data sources 2 3 1 canadian precipitation analysis capa the canadian precipitation analysis or capa provides gridded accumulated precipitation for most of north america including the entire frb precipitation estimates are available daily at six hour intervals for a gridded network with a 10 km spatial resolution capa integrates short term numerical weather predictions from the regional deterministic prediction system rdps developed by environment canada with in situ measurements from a variety of ground based monitoring networks a robust series of quality control measures are in place to mitigate the impact of erroneous data measurements on the quality of the final analysis studies have shown that precipitation estimates from capa are generally more accurate than estimates from raw rdps lespinas et al 2015 capa data were aggregated and averaged on a catchment by catchment basis to generate forcing data for the semi distributed rainfall runoff models applied during the network design process in the frb 2 3 2 hydrological global forcing data hydrogfd the hydrological global forcing data reanalysis dataset provides global daily forcing data estimates at 0 5 spatial resolution hydrogfd is a successor to the watch forcing data era interim wfdei method weedon et al 2011 similar to capa various reanalysis datasets are updated corrected using observed in situ measurements previous studies using the european and arctic hype models have utilized hydrogfd to generate forcing inputs a modified subset of the arctic hype model was used to generate synthetic time series for potential stations in the crb data consistency was maintained by using the same precipitation and temperature time series to calibrate semi distributed mac hbv and sac sma models as part of the crb network design 3 methodology two distinct research approaches are applied fig 3 provides a flowchart delineating the steps and processes that comprise both methods a more detailed description of both approaches follows thereafter the first method that was applied seeks to identify a set of optimal networks by initially applying a modified version of demo followed by post processing using hydrological models when conducting network designs a certain number of stations are typically designated as existing or fixed existing stations constitute a baseline network and are considered part of every candidate network analyzed throughout the design process a set of potential stations are also identified the purpose of the network design is to identify which combination of potential stations best complements the existing network with respect to desired design criteria therefore time series for both existing and potential stations represent the inputs to a typical network design process for this investigation modified demo inputs were prepared by coupling observed streamflow time series for existing monitoring stations with either synthetic streamflow time series for potential stations in the case of the crb or more observed streamflow time series for pseudo potential stations in the case of the frb an moea is used to identify pareto optimal networks by seeking to maximize joint entropy minimize total correlation and maximize the number of gauged stations at fsc fsc are manually identified using the land use maps provided with figs 1 and 2 maximizing the number of gauged stations at fsc was included as an optimization objective because it was anticipated networks which heavily gauge fsc will offer better average model performance at these locations each pareto optimal network identified by the modified demo analysis provides output observations for the multi site calibration of semi distributed sac sma and mac hbv models dynamically dimensioned search dds performs the model calibrations in this study forcing data is provided from a combination of capa and spatially interpolated ground based measurements for the frb and the hydro gfd reanalysis dataset for the crb non dominance is then reassessed based on the overarching network design objectives maximizing average calibrated kling gupta efficiency kge a model performance metric at fsc and minimizing network size this post processing mechanism ultimately identifies a smaller subset of networks when compared with the original set of networks identified by demo that are most suitable for streamflow modeling 3 1 information theory based metrics marginal entropy is an information theory based metric that can be used to quantify the amount of information associated with a given time series observed at a single monitoring station marginal entropy is defined as follows shannon 1948 husain 1989 1 h x i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where p x i refers to the probability of observation x i after being binned accordingly occurring within an observed time series n is the number of bins in the associated time series histogram and h x is the marginal entropy of the dataset measured in bits the amount of information present within an entire monitoring network can be evaluated by calculating the joint entropy of the network joint entropy is formulated mathematically as follows shannon 1948 husain 1989 2 h x 1 x n i 1 n 1 j 1 n 2 k 1 nn p x 1 i x 2 j x n k log 2 p x 1 i x 2 j x n k where x 1 i x 2 j x n k represents distinct observations belonging to time series x 1 x n p x 1 i x 2 j x n k is the probability of these observations occurring at the same temporal interval once binned according to the related binning intervals n 1 n 2 n n if there is no redundant information present in a monitoring network then the joint entropy of the network is equal to the sum of the marginal entropies associated with each station in instances where redundant information is present in a network or system the amount of redundant information is referred to as the total correlation total correlation is equal to the difference between the sum of the marginal entropies for all stations and the joint entropy of the network and is represented as follows mcgill 1954 watanabe 1960 3 c x 1 x n i 1 n h x i h x 1 x n 3 2 experiment data preparation and processing 3 2 1 delineation of flood sensitive catchments fsc were manually delineated using the land use maps provided with figs 1 and 2 firstly the land use and distribution of settlements within each sub catchment was reviewed individually non first order catchments with any form of development urban areas cropland dense road or infrastructure networks etc were then designated as flood sensitive additionally all catchments gauged by an existing monitoring stations in the crb were also identified as fsc this conservative approach was taken to identify all sub catchments where flood events could potentially cause substantial damage depending on the purpose of the network design investigation decision makers could apply stricter methods to identify sensitive or highly important catchments that should be prioritized during the network design process 3 2 2 data quantization discrete entropy calculations require precisely measured data to be selectively binned into smaller coarser datasets the configuration of optimal networks identified using entropy based design strategies is sensitive to the selection of quantization techniques fahle et al 2015 however a universally preferred method has not yet been identified keum and coulibaly 2017a for this research observed and simulated discharge rates in units of cubic meters per second were converted to mm day by dividing by catchment drainage areas a bin width of 1 mm day was then applied with values rounded up to the nearest integer previous investigations using demo have applied a similar technique samuel et al 2013 werstuck and coulibaly 2017 the mathematical representation of this procedure is as follows 4 x r x where x r is the quantized value and x is the observed value to be binned 3 2 3 streamflow regionalization streamflow time series for the existing and pseudo potential stations within the frb required infilling to account for missing measurements data gaps in observed hydrometric time series can be a result of many factors including equipment failure seasonal inactivity and deactivation of a station during the midst of the selected 10 year monitoring period missing streamflow measurements were infilled using the inverse distance weighting drainage area ratio method studies have consistently shown through cross validation that idw dar is one of the best regionalization techniques for infilling streamflow data in canadian watersheds samuel et al 2013 werstuck and coulibaly 2017 idw dar is calculated using the following equations 5 q u i 1 n w i a u a i α q i w i h i 2 i 1 n h i 2 where q u is regionalized streamflow a u is the drainage area of the catchment of interest a i is a drainage area associated with a catchment whose times series is being used to facilitate the regionalization α is a fitting parameter set equal to 1 w i is a weighting coefficient and h i is the distance between the centroid of the catchment whose times series is being infilled and the centroid of the neighboring catchment facilitating the regionalization it should be noted setting the fitting parameter α equal to one has been found to be optimal for demo based applications samuel et al 2013 3 2 4 synthetic streamflow generation with hype model the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model is a semi distributed model developed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi sub catchments are first categorized as either land or lake and are then further spatially refined into classes each of which represents a fraction of the total sub catchment area classes are demarcated based on a combination of vegetation soil land use and topographic characteristics developed based on the traditional hbv and hbv np models hype is capable of simulating catchment discharge runoff in addition to the transfer of nitrogen and phosphorus through the modeled area lindström et al 2010 a hype model of the combined nelson churchill river basin was used to generate synthetic time series for potential streamflow monitoring stations in the crb this variant of hype was developed at the university of manitoba based on the hudson bay drainage basin hype model which is a subset of the arctic hype model initially developed by smhi alterations to predecessors were made to produce the ncrb hype model including adding modeling routines refining catchment characteristics and adjusting calibration procedures to better account for frozen soils prairie potholes and localized flow regulation further information on the development of the ncrb hype model is provided in stadnyk and bajracharya 2019 it is important to note that the generation of a synthetic timeseries is required so that potential station locations can be evaluated as part of the optimization process output from the ncrb hype model was chosen as an alternative to idw dar regionalization for the crb because the crb is not well gauged and would therefore require significant interpolation of results additionally idw dar cannot adequately account for prairie pothole effects whereas the ncrb hype model can 3 3 multi objective evolutionary algorithm the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii developed by deb et al 2002 is one of the most widely applied moeas in the field of water resources kollat et al 2008 further details regarding the nsga ii algorithm and its application to this study are provided in the supplemental section 3 4 streamflow modeling two hydrological models were incorporated into the network design process to evaluate the hydrometric networks best suited to support streamflow modeling within the selected study areas the two models chosen were the mcmaster university hydrologiska byrans vattenbalansavdelning mac hbv model and the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma both models are lumped conceptual rainfall runoffs models that were configured in a semi distributed fashion channel routing between sub catchments was facilitated using the muskingum routing method moreover both sac sma and mac hbv require daily time series for precipitation and temperature as inputs ten years of observed streamflow data were used for model calibration allowing for a one year spin up period and a nine year calibration period for the frb daily time series from 2003 to 2012 were employed whereas the timeframe for the crb was 2001 2010 further details on the two models are provided in the supplemental section selecting two models allows an assessment of how model selection may or may not significantly impact network design results 3 4 1 model performance criteria model performance criteria such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge quantitatively assess how accurately a simulated model output compares to the corresponding historical observations nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 1998 kge was selected as the calibration function objective and was also used to assess model performance for the calibration period an optimal kge score is 1 0 which occurs when the two times series being compared to one another are identical kge is defined mathematically as gupta et al 1998 6 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed time series α is the ratio of the standard deviation for the simulated times series to the standard deviation of the observed time series which quantifies the relative variability of the two datasets β is the quotient of the mean of the simulated time series divided by the mean of the observed time series this ratio measures the bias present in the two datasets 3 4 2 model calibration algorithm the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm developed by tolson and shoemaker 2007 was used to calibrate the model parameters for both the mac hbv and sac sma models dds is a stochastic optimization process that is capable of efficiently locating a near global optimal solution for problems with high dimensionality dds has two main parameters the number of algorithm iterations and the search coefficient for this study the standard search coefficient 0 2 as recommended for general applications by tolson and shoemaker 2007 was applied embedding the model calibration process which is itself an optimization procedure into an moea is computationally expensive and requires the use of supercomputing resources and parallel computing architecture to process results in a reasonable timeframe in this study 1000 dds iterations were applied for model calibration allowing for identification of near optimal model parameter sets while limiting computational workload to manageable levels 4 results 4 1 approach 1 identification of optimal networks through demo solutions post processing using hydrologic models the modified demo analysis employed as the initial phase in approach 1 identified 699 pareto optimal networks for the frb and 4599 pareto optimal networks for the crb during the optimization process network size was allowed to vary from the size of the existing network to a fully gauged network where all potential station locations are selected the range in joint entropy amongst the pareto optimal solutions set was 9 79 11 04 bits and 6 65 9 98 bits for the frb and crb respectively the decision variables applied in network design are binary since a station is either included or else excluded from each potential network for a system with binary decision variables the saturated or maximum joint entropy is equal to the binary logarithm of the number of temporal intervals assessed in this investigation 10 years of daily data or 3652 time steps were evaluated equating to a saturated entropy of 11 83 bits the range in joint entropy values identified using the modified demo analysis for both study areas are reasonable as they approach but do not exceed the saturated entropy networks with saturated entropy may indicate inappropriate data quantization where data was binned too finely resulting in unique time series while demo maximizes joint entropy to maximize network information content total correlation is also minimized to limit redundancies network total correlation ranged from 52 02 to 125 73 for the frb compared to a range of 5 12 89 27 for the crb when compared with the crb the frb has more existing stations furthermore many of the frb stations are clustered together in the downstream extents of the watershed in comparison the existing crb monitoring network is very sparsely gauged and not highly clustered geospatially therefore there is more informational redundancy present in the existing frb network which is reflected in the differences between the minimum total correlations for networks identified by demo for the two study areas assessing networks entirely on the principles of information theory does not allow for a user directed design that promotes the modeling of streamflow at fsc specifically it was expected that networks which heavily gauge fsc would contribute to better calibrated models for simulating streamflow at these manually identified locations thus a third optimization objective maximizing the number of fsc gauged was added to the traditional demo objectives to account for this expectation the fsc are densely gauged by the existing frb network resulting in minimal variability for that design objective when compared to the crb where the majority of fsc are ungauged a summary of the modified demo results for both study areas is provided as part of table 2 each optimal solution generated by the modified demo analysis is non dominated when compared to the rest of the corresponding solution set fig 4 a and b are three variable pareto fronts illustrating the tradeoffs between selecting different optimal solutions for both study areas the pareto front for the frb shows an apparent plateau after a joint entropy of 11 bits is reached the maximum network size amongst optimal networks identified was also only 80 stations compared to a potential maximum of 106 stations if all potential stations were gauged the choice to perform a network reduction design in the frb is consequently further justified as network analysis based on entropy theory shows adding additional stations does not significantly improve the information content of candidate networks in contrast the pareto front for the crb does not exhibit a plateau effect and the maximum network size amongst optimal networks is 89 stations which is just two short of a fully gauged network increasing network size up to near the prescribed upper limit continues to improve network information content thereby justifying the choice to perform a network augmentation in the crb demo generates many non dominated solutions semi distributed mac hbv and sac sma models post processed the demo output to reduce the number of networks decision makers need to consider for implementation and to determine which of the optimal networks are most suitable for streamflow modeling applications the model based design objectives applied during the post processing procedure were to maximize kge at fsc and minimize network size this process is visually represented as a series of scatter plots in fig 4c f all the networks generated from demo are re plotted according to the post processing results with non dominated solutions based on the primary design objectives shown as bolded markers the post processing procedure significantly reduces the number of optimal solutions from 699 to 7 8 for the frb and from 4599 to 40 41 for the crb the frb has a well established existing network with 43 stations many of which gauge fsc from fig 4c and e it is evident that when evaluating the merits of adding additional stations to frb the benefit obtained from gauging additional headwater catchments on improving model calibration is limited for both models after the first five stations are added and non existent once a network size of 67 stations is exceeded conversely for the sparsely gauged crb approach one results establish a consistent and generally linear trend between increasing network size and improving calibrated model performance as seen in fig 4d and f in terms of model model comparisons the semi distributed sac sma and mac hbv models offer similar levels of performance in both study areas 4 2 approach 2 identification of optimal networks through multi objective optimization with embedded hydrological models approach two embeds hydrological models and their calibration process into nsga ii to allow for the optimization algorithm to search the solution space according to the primary optimization objectives directly comparative pareto fronts for the non dominated solutions determined by both approaches using each model are provided in fig 5 for the frb and fig 6 for the crb both figures also illustrate the baseline model performance obtained using the existing network to calibrate the sac sma model in addition to the model performance associated with calibration using a fully gauged network as with approach one the overall performance of mac hbv and sac sma for approach two is nearly equivalent more important to note is that embedding hydrological models into the moea while significantly more computationally demanding consistently identifies networks that provide superior model performance for any given network size when compared to the networks identified using hydrologic models as a post processing mechanism the range in model performance and network size identified by both approaches are summarized as part of table 2 figs 5 and 6 illustrate that the approach 2 pareto fronts of optimal solutions for both study areas plateau and then truncate once a specific network size is achieved in all instances regardless of the study area and model selected optimal model performance is not obtained using a fully gauged network for the frb a network with 70 stations offers better performance than a fully gauged network containing an additional 36 stations for the crb the best model performance is obtained using a network with 68 stations 23 stations less dense than a fully gauged network it is clear that merely adding more stations or observations to the calibration process does not guarantee improved model performance at fsc eventually incorporating observations from additional stations can degrade model performance this degradation can be attributed to the incorporation of time series with erroneous measurements or utilizing observations from stations that monitor flow regimes uncharacteristic of adjoining catchments due to significant variability in representative physiographic characteristics or unaccounted for flow regulation instead of merely improving network density it is more important to determine the optimal spatial distribution of potential stations to complement and augment the observations provided from the existing networks furthermore the approach 2 pareto fronts for both study areas initially exhibit a roughly linear relationship between increasing network size and improving average model performance at fsc however as more dense optimal networks are identified the gradient of this trend smooths out and effectively transitions into a plateau where further increasing network density offers no significant improvement to model performance in instances where cost constraints do not force the network manager to select asmaller optimal network this transition point identifies the best optimal network for the frb the transition point occurs at network density of 55 stations and for the crb the network density is 57 stations figs 7 and 8 illustrate the spatial distribution of these best optimal networks identified using both hydrological models for the frb and crb respectively figs 7 and 8 indicate that the spatial distribution of the best optimal networks are only slightly sensitive to model selection for the frb the best optimal networks identified using the two hydrological models are 67 percent similar the similarity percentage for the crb is 77 percent more importantly for network designs facilitated by both rainfall runoff models the best optimal networks identified by approach 2 provide better performance and are generally significantly less dense networks than the best performing networks identified using approach 1 overall the approach 2 results indicate that embedding models into a moea enables the identification of smaller less costly networks that more effectively meet user needs when compared with the networks identified using the traditional approach of applying hydrological models as a post processing mechanism 4 3 bubble maps to compare spatial distribution of optimal networks bubble maps were crafted to visually assess the spatial distribution of all pareto optimal solutions identified using both approaches using these maps allows for an assessment of how the selection of the network design strategy impacts the spatial distribution of the identified optimal networks the number of optimal networks identified ranged from 7 to 41 depending on the study area and model selection it is impractical to present different network maps for each optimal network identified in this investigation individually instead the information presented in the bubble maps is based on average or aggregated statistics pertaining to a single optimal solution set as a result eight different maps or scenarios are presented one for each approach study area and model combination it is essential to note that the results represented by the bubble maps are based on averaged results across the entire optimal solutions sets identified for a given design scenario therefore an individual optimal network should not be simply selected by choosing some combination of the more frequently selected stations because doing so would not guarantee selection of an actual optimal network when comparing the two approaches using figs 9 and 10 the fsc are on average more frequently gauged and better modelled by the optimal solution sets identified using approach 2 this is visually apparent from the larger and greener nodes at fsc for the approach 2 maps non fsc are also generally less frequently selected by networks identified using approach 2 in comparison to networks identified using approach 1 in terms of model model comparisons for approach 2 the most frequently selected stations large nodes reflecting a selection frequency greater than 50 are consistently the same for both rainfall runoff models with only slight variations average model performance at fsc is also only slightly sensitive to model selection in summary the first approach employs computationally efficient secondary design objectives to search the whole solution space identify a set of pareto optimal networks based on those objectives and then reassess for non dominance based on the overarching or primary design criteria in contrast the second proposed approach embeds hydrological models and their multi site calibration process directly into the moea allowing for direct optimization according to the primary design objectives while substantially more computationally demanding the second approach is necessary to ensure that optimal networks according to the primary design objectives are not left unidentified if considered dominated during the modified demo analysis optimal networks according to the primary design objectives may be dominated during the first approach because secondary or intermediate objectives facilitate the optimization process associated with demo 5 discussion two distinct model based network design strategies were evaluated as part of this study model based network design represents a measurement based evaluation of hydrometric networks in this type of procedure a hydrological model is employed to quantify the change in model error associated with varying sets of observed data resulting from different spatial configurations of potential monitoring networks chacon hurtado et al 2017 the selection of which model and model performance criteria to use can be varied depending on the intended design application enabling user directed designs previous research using a model based approach for network design dong et al 2005 xu et al 2013 keum et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 employed models as part of a post processing procedure intermediate or secondary design objectives methods are used to identify an initial set of candidate networks that set of networks is then filtered or further evaluated using hydrological models to measure how effectively the observational dataset from each network reduces model error as measured by a manually defined set of model performance criteria the first approach applied in this study follows this same general procedure and applies entropy based design objectives as the intermediate objectives similar to keum et al 2018 this approach is shown to identify a subset of networks that are pareto optimal from an information theory perspective while also performing well based on the model directed design objectives however this process of applying hydrological models as a post processing mechanism does not represent a direct cohesive and fully continuous evaluation of the relationship between data collection model calibration and model performance for complex problems where the number of potential candidate networks to assess is significant as with this study networks that are optimal based on the primary model performance based decision making objectives may be unidentified during the initial design process facilitated by those initial intermediate objectives in these instances approach 2 is recommended as it allows for the whole solution spaced to be searched according the primary model based objectives directly since models are embedded directly into the optimization algorithm the results of this research show that in instances where decision making is based solely on the model based objectives it is preferable to apply approach 2 as better results are consistently obtained when compared to approach 1 6 conclusions the main findings of this study are as follows model based network design strategies provide a highly adaptable methodology for user directed designs of hydrometric monitoring networks potential streamflow monitoring network configurations for two large canadian river basins were investigated using two distinct approaches the first is the traditional model based approach where models are applied as a post processing mechanism the second approach embeds models directly into the optimization algorithm this investigation found the second approach identified better performing solutions when evaluating potential networks using model based design criteria therefore based on the findings of this research it is recommended that when using a model based network design strategy that models be embedded into the optimization algorithms where computationally feasible this integration allows for direct optimization according to model based decision making criteria future research should better investigate the sensitivity of network design results to the selection of which model and model performance statistics are used in the design process perhaps using models and design objectives combinations that are more suited to the modeling of specific portions of the hydrograph will emphasis the gauging of stations in distinct spatial regions lastly there is a need to develop new design strategies that can address the challenges associated with climate change currently historical time series observed at existing stations are used in conjunction with synthetic time series generated for potential station locations therefore a ten year historical time record may be used to design a network intended to function with minimal changes for twenty or more years into the future without any consideration for the impacts associated with climate change by leveraging global and regional climate models to generate projected hydrometric time series it is possible to assess the sensitivity of network design strategies including those presented in this investigation to a dynamic and variable climate credit authorship contribution statement jacob ursulak methodology software formal

4935,water resource managers depend on the collection of accurate hydrometric data for various modeling and planning projects an essential use of hydrometric data includes hydrologic modelling and forecasting to support decision making in water resources planning and management it is therefore essential to design hydrometric monitoring networks while considering the relationship between data collection and model application a new model based network design strategy is proposed that embeds hydrological models into a multi objective evolutionary algorithm facilitating direct optimization according to the model based design objectives this method is compared to the traditional model based approach used to design hydrometric monitoring networks the traditional approach is to first conduct optimization using secondary design objectives that are not model based to identify a set of optimal networks hydrological models are then applied as a post processing mechanism to identify which of the optimal networks best satisfy the model orientated design objectives or users needs in this investigation the well established dual entropy multi objective optimization demo approach was employed to conduct the initial network design based on the principles of information theory followed by post processing with rainfall runoff models two case studies are evaluated a monitoring network reduction in the fraser river basin and a network augmentation in an upstream subsection of the churchill river basin results show that embedding models in the optimization algorithm consistently yields better network configurations compared to those identified using the traditional method it is shown that a smaller size optimal network that outperforms larger size networks can be identified directly by the proposed method the models and model performance criteria used in the design process can be readily adapted allowing for a user directed design capable of addressing problem specific objectives on a case by case basis keywords hydrometric monitoring networks entropy hydrological modelling optimization 1 introduction a hydrometric network is a collection of stations that provide point source monitoring of the quality or quantity of various hydrological processes at discrete temporal intervals world meteorological organization 2008 such networks are leveraged to collect discharge rates along natural channel corridors halverson and fleming 2015 stosic et al 2017 monitor the quality of groundwater reservoirs mogheir and singh 2002 kollat et al 2011 and to assess the spatial distribution of precipitation across a watershed krstanovic and singh 1992 wang et al 2019 point source measurements from monitoring networks do not provide the fine spatial and temporal resolution of areal datasets developed with remote sensing technologies however continued in situ data collection is still required to enable the validation of remote sensing products and prolong the historical record of well established monitoring stations swenson et al 2006 ragettli et al 2015 xiao et al 2015 climate change is also continually contributing to deviations from the historical record thereby limiting hydrologists and engineers in their ability to rely on assumptions of stationarity when leveraging hydrometric data for design and decision making purposes vaze et al 2010 françois et al 2019 the successful adaptation of modeling and design strategies to account for non stationarity in both meteorological statistics and land use characteristics is dependent on the continued collection of accurate hydrometric data preferably at increasingly finer spatial and temporal resolutions however in many countries around the world the number of operational hydrometric monitoring stations is decreasing mishra and coulibaly 2009 2010 the reduction in the global density of many monitoring networks can be attributed to a combination of aging infrastructure increasing capital costs for new stations and diminishing operational budgets for the maintenance of existing networks ruhi et al 2018 therefore the optimal design of hydrometric monitoring networks is needed to facilitate the continued capture of fundamental hydrologic data while accounting for practical design constraints imposed by financial and physical limitations furthermore given the natural progression from data collection to model calibration and ultimately model application it is logical to develop a process for the design of hydrometric monitoring networks that considers the implications of network design on model performance and utility optimal network design requires the spatial distribution of stations in a network to result in a non dominated system with respect to pareto dominance when considering the chosen design criteria typical network design objectives include minimizing network size or cost tasker and moss 1979 luo et al 2016 maximizing the amount of information collected by the network alfonso et al 2010 samuel et al 2013 and minimizing the collection of redundant information werstuck and coulibaly 2018 employing multiple objectives in the design process typically produces a pareto front of non dominated solutions the comparison between pareto optimal solutions represents a trade off such that the selection of one solution over another results in an improvement of one design objective to the detriment of a different objective applying weights to objective functions provides decision makers with a means to determine a single optimal network when considering multiple design criteria li et al 2012 ultimately the number of candidate networks selected and their respective spatial distributions varies depending on which technique or methodology is employed in the network design process mishra and coulibaly 2009 provided an extensive review of the techniques commonly employed in the design of surface water networks for the monitoring of precipitation and streamflow some of the primary design methodologies reviewed include statistical analysis rodríguez iturbe and mejía 1974 burn and goulter 1991 spatial interpolation techniques karnieli 1990 weisse and bois 2002 entropy based methods husain 1989 joo et al 2019 various optimization procedures kollat et al 2008 reed and kollat 2012 network design based on physiographic characteristics laize 2004 nour et al 2006 and several hybrid approaches pardo igúzquiza 1998 markus et al 2003 while all network design methods have their distinct merits and shortcomings recent studies have shown that the design of hydrometric networks using multi objective optimization with entropy based optimization objectives is well suited to the design of robust multipurpose monitoring networks samuel et al 2013 keum et al 2017 the dual entropy multi objective optimization demo approach samuel et al 2013 is a notable example of integrating the principles of information theory into a multi objective optimization framework to design streamflow monitoring networks demo designs general purpose hydrometric networks by employing a multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea to assess candidate monitoring networks based on multiple design objectives related to information theory traditionally demo identifies candidate networks by seeking to maximize the joint entropy of a network while simultaneously minimizing total correlation demo is adaptable and capable of addressing problem specific design characteristics by incorporating additional design objectives leach et al 2015 2016 keum and coulibaly 2017a recently keum et al 2018 added conceptual hydrological models as post processors to the network design process to further evaluate candidate networks according to model performance statistics this type of evaluation creates opportunities for user directed designs that consider the impact of data collection on specific modeling applications for instance when designing a network for flood forecasting purposes networks that promote the collection of hydrometric data leading to the effective modeling of peak flows may be favored previously studies that utilize hydrological models as part of the network design process xu et al 2013 2015 keum et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 typically do so by using hydrological models as part of a post processing procedure firstly intermediate design objectives such as those traditionally applied by demo guide the network design process by generating a set of non dominated candidate networks hydrological models are then used to further evaluate and filter the original solution set according to the primary design objectives which are at least in part some combination of model performance criteria applying models as a post processing mechanism does not enable a unified review and assessment of the relationship between data collection model calibration and model application as part of a single continuous design process for instance networks should be considered as optimal based on the primary design objectives which are derived from model performance statistics however optimal networks based on these primary objectives can be unidentified if dominated during an optimization process facilitated by intermediate objectives embedding hydrological models and when necessary the model calibration procedure into existing moeas addresses this issue by enabling moeas to explore the solution space according to the primary design objectives directly this research compares a newly proposed model based network design technique which embeds hydrological models into moeas to the traditional approach of applying models as a post processing mechanism semi distributed models are applied to facilitate the design of streamflow monitoring networks in two large canadian watersheds both approaches generate a set of pareto optimal networks that assess the trade off between maximizing model performance at select flood sensitive catchments fsc and minimizing network size this study considered flood sensitive catchments as priority sites where model performance should be optimized however it is important to note the proposed methodology is flexible and can be adaptedto prioritize model performance at specific catchments on a case by case basis maps visually summarizing the spatial distribution of station selection frequency and model performance at fsc are presented for all design scenarios thereafter conclusions and observations regarding the differences between the two investigated model based design strategies are discussed 2 study areas and data 2 1 fraser river basin upstream of the town of hope canada 2 1 1 study area general description the fraser river basin frb upstream of the town of hope is one of two study areas this portion of the watershed has a drainage area of 217 000 square kilometers or 90 of the total frb discharging directly to the pacific ocean the fraser river basin drains approximately a quarter of all streamflow in british columbia canada the headwaters of the fraser river originate in the northeastern extents of the watershed in the rocky mountains the river generally flows southward merging with the nechako river the chilcotin river and other major tributaries before draining into the strait of georgia and discharging into the salish sea southwest of the city of vancouver benke and cushing 2005 the terrain in the basin is classified mainly as mountainous with a 3950 m elevation differential between its high point and the basin outlet more than 90 of the watershed is undeveloped the only major urban centers excluding the greater vancouver metropolitan area immediately surrounding the outlet are prince george and kamloops nevertheless many small towns and semi isolated settlements are located along the major drainage corridors the frb is culturally significant to many first nations communities and is considered one of the most ecologically important riverine habitats for salmon in the world northcote and larkin 1989 the climatic profile of the frb is spatially diverse with notable variations in climate and vegetative cover between the coastal mountainous and plateau regions annual precipitation rates average 400 800 mm in the interior plateaus but can exceed 3000 mm year in the coastal and mountainous portions of the basin the average air temperature increase from 0 5 c in the north to 7 5 c in the south as the elevation of the watershed decreases benke and cushing 2005 the semi distributed hydrological models leveraged in this study utilize daily temperature and precipitation as forcing inputs the gridded daily canadian precipitation analysis capa dataset was used to obtain precipitation data for this study area thiessen polygon analysis facilitated spatial interpolation of daily temperature observations taken from 134 meteorological stations to generate daily temperature data representative of specific catchments 2 1 2 study area existing hydrometric network the study area has 106 streamflow monitoring stations to consider during the network design process the world meteorological organization wmo guidelines recommend a network density of one station per 1000 km2 1875 km2 and 2750 km2 for mountainous hilly undulating and coastal regions respectively the frb is a mixture of all three regions therefore an average network density of one station per 1875 km2 is the recommended network density these guidelines suggest a network of 116 stations only 10 stations more than currently exist in the frb given that the frb is relatively well gauged by wmo guidelines a network reduction design was facilitated instead of a more traditional network augmentation by performing a network reduction in the frb only observed time series associated with existing stations are considered during the design process this in turn allows for a proof of concept scenario that is not dependent on the assumptions and uncertainty associated with the generation of synthetic time series for potential station locations network design applications require some stations to be defined as existing or fixed unless the objective is to design the entire monitoring network from scratch for the frb the 43 non first order gauged catchment outlets were considered as existing stations these stations are included as part of each candidate network identified during the design process consequently the remaining 63 first order catchments outlets were treated as pseudo potential stations essentially variations in the spatial distribution of the most upstream monitoring stations characterize the differences between the optimal networks identified for this study area keum and coulibaly 2017b suggest utilizing at least 10 years of continuous daily data when designing hydrometric networks using demo based on this recommendation 10 years of daily streamflow data from 2003 to 2012 most recent data available were obtained for the 106 stations included for use in this study missing streamflow values were infilled using inverse distance weighting drainage area ratio idw dar regionalization several studies have identified idw dar as one of the most effective regionalization techniques for infilling missing streamflow measurements in canadian watersheds samuel et al 2013 werstuck and coulibaly 2017 land use maps government of canada 2010 were used in conjunction with data from the 2016 canadian census to identify the flood sensitive catchments fsc in the frb fig 1 provides maps visualizing the spatial distribution of stations land use and fsc in the frb table 1 summarizes the primary study area statistics pertaining to the network design process 2 2 churchill river basin upstream of the otter rapids canada 2 2 1 study area general description headwaters for the churchill river originate in northeastern alberta at beaver lake and northern saskatchewan around the wollaston lake area the river runs eastward passing through the provinces of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba before discharging into hudson bay benke and cushing 2005 approximately 75 of the flow through the churchill river is diverted to the south into the more extensive nelson river system at southern indian lake in north central manitoba partial diversion of the churchill river into the nelson valley system was conducted in 1976 to enhance hydropower development in the downstream extents of the nelson river valley newbury et al 1984 the cold and dry climate of the churchill river basin crb is characteristic of subarctic regions lane and sykes 1982 the frost free period ranges from 60 to 120 days annually mean daily air temperatures range from as low as 27 5 c in january to as high as 17 5 c in july the rain shadow effect of the rocky mountains to the west limits annual precipitation to 400 600 mm year on average concerning land use the crb is mostly undeveloped the landscape is generally dominated by forest and wetlands zubrycki et al 2016 except for limited agricultural and urban development predominately located along the southern boundary of the watershed the portion of the crb upstream of otter rapids acts as the second study area for this research investigation this region represents a total drainage area of 119 000 square kilometers the entire study area is upstream of the major river diversion by selecting a primarily naturalized portion of the watershed upstream of any significant anthropogenic alterations the need to make modelling assumptions to account for the impact of damming or water retrievals was eliminated 2 2 2 study area existing hydrometric network as with the frb land use maps government of canada 2010 were used in conjunction with data from the 2016 canadian census to identify the fsc in the crb fig 2 provides maps visualizing the spatial distribution of stations land use and fsc in the crb table 1 provides the study area statistics related to the network design process based on wmo guidelines a watershed the size of the study area with an interior plains physiographic classification should have a network density of one streamflow monitoring station per 1875 km2 world meteorological organization 2008 translating to a recommended network density of 64 stations the existing monitoring network is comprised of only 13 stations therefore the crb can be considered poorly gauged by wmo minimum network densityguidelines a network augmentation design was performed by applying the proposed research methodology the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model results for the nelson churchill river basin ncrb stadnyk and bajracharya 2019 provide time series for potential station locations in some instances the sub catchment configurations utilized in the hype model set up were aggregated to reduce the number of potential stations and by extension the computational cost aggregation of sub catchments was only performed in unpopulated and undeveloped areas as the emphasis of the study was to identify monitoring network configurations that optimize model performance at flood sensitive or highly developed catchments a total of 13 existing stations and 78 potential stations were considered in the network design process gaps in observed time series for existing stations were infilled using hype model output the hydrological global forcing data hydro gfd reanalysis dataset provides daily temperature and precipitation time series representative of individual catchments berg et al 2018 a ten year daily times series record from 2001 to 2010 was applied to conduct the network augmentation representing the most recent ten year period suitable for analysis based on the availability of hype model results 2 3 description of data sources 2 3 1 canadian precipitation analysis capa the canadian precipitation analysis or capa provides gridded accumulated precipitation for most of north america including the entire frb precipitation estimates are available daily at six hour intervals for a gridded network with a 10 km spatial resolution capa integrates short term numerical weather predictions from the regional deterministic prediction system rdps developed by environment canada with in situ measurements from a variety of ground based monitoring networks a robust series of quality control measures are in place to mitigate the impact of erroneous data measurements on the quality of the final analysis studies have shown that precipitation estimates from capa are generally more accurate than estimates from raw rdps lespinas et al 2015 capa data were aggregated and averaged on a catchment by catchment basis to generate forcing data for the semi distributed rainfall runoff models applied during the network design process in the frb 2 3 2 hydrological global forcing data hydrogfd the hydrological global forcing data reanalysis dataset provides global daily forcing data estimates at 0 5 spatial resolution hydrogfd is a successor to the watch forcing data era interim wfdei method weedon et al 2011 similar to capa various reanalysis datasets are updated corrected using observed in situ measurements previous studies using the european and arctic hype models have utilized hydrogfd to generate forcing inputs a modified subset of the arctic hype model was used to generate synthetic time series for potential stations in the crb data consistency was maintained by using the same precipitation and temperature time series to calibrate semi distributed mac hbv and sac sma models as part of the crb network design 3 methodology two distinct research approaches are applied fig 3 provides a flowchart delineating the steps and processes that comprise both methods a more detailed description of both approaches follows thereafter the first method that was applied seeks to identify a set of optimal networks by initially applying a modified version of demo followed by post processing using hydrological models when conducting network designs a certain number of stations are typically designated as existing or fixed existing stations constitute a baseline network and are considered part of every candidate network analyzed throughout the design process a set of potential stations are also identified the purpose of the network design is to identify which combination of potential stations best complements the existing network with respect to desired design criteria therefore time series for both existing and potential stations represent the inputs to a typical network design process for this investigation modified demo inputs were prepared by coupling observed streamflow time series for existing monitoring stations with either synthetic streamflow time series for potential stations in the case of the crb or more observed streamflow time series for pseudo potential stations in the case of the frb an moea is used to identify pareto optimal networks by seeking to maximize joint entropy minimize total correlation and maximize the number of gauged stations at fsc fsc are manually identified using the land use maps provided with figs 1 and 2 maximizing the number of gauged stations at fsc was included as an optimization objective because it was anticipated networks which heavily gauge fsc will offer better average model performance at these locations each pareto optimal network identified by the modified demo analysis provides output observations for the multi site calibration of semi distributed sac sma and mac hbv models dynamically dimensioned search dds performs the model calibrations in this study forcing data is provided from a combination of capa and spatially interpolated ground based measurements for the frb and the hydro gfd reanalysis dataset for the crb non dominance is then reassessed based on the overarching network design objectives maximizing average calibrated kling gupta efficiency kge a model performance metric at fsc and minimizing network size this post processing mechanism ultimately identifies a smaller subset of networks when compared with the original set of networks identified by demo that are most suitable for streamflow modeling 3 1 information theory based metrics marginal entropy is an information theory based metric that can be used to quantify the amount of information associated with a given time series observed at a single monitoring station marginal entropy is defined as follows shannon 1948 husain 1989 1 h x i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where p x i refers to the probability of observation x i after being binned accordingly occurring within an observed time series n is the number of bins in the associated time series histogram and h x is the marginal entropy of the dataset measured in bits the amount of information present within an entire monitoring network can be evaluated by calculating the joint entropy of the network joint entropy is formulated mathematically as follows shannon 1948 husain 1989 2 h x 1 x n i 1 n 1 j 1 n 2 k 1 nn p x 1 i x 2 j x n k log 2 p x 1 i x 2 j x n k where x 1 i x 2 j x n k represents distinct observations belonging to time series x 1 x n p x 1 i x 2 j x n k is the probability of these observations occurring at the same temporal interval once binned according to the related binning intervals n 1 n 2 n n if there is no redundant information present in a monitoring network then the joint entropy of the network is equal to the sum of the marginal entropies associated with each station in instances where redundant information is present in a network or system the amount of redundant information is referred to as the total correlation total correlation is equal to the difference between the sum of the marginal entropies for all stations and the joint entropy of the network and is represented as follows mcgill 1954 watanabe 1960 3 c x 1 x n i 1 n h x i h x 1 x n 3 2 experiment data preparation and processing 3 2 1 delineation of flood sensitive catchments fsc were manually delineated using the land use maps provided with figs 1 and 2 firstly the land use and distribution of settlements within each sub catchment was reviewed individually non first order catchments with any form of development urban areas cropland dense road or infrastructure networks etc were then designated as flood sensitive additionally all catchments gauged by an existing monitoring stations in the crb were also identified as fsc this conservative approach was taken to identify all sub catchments where flood events could potentially cause substantial damage depending on the purpose of the network design investigation decision makers could apply stricter methods to identify sensitive or highly important catchments that should be prioritized during the network design process 3 2 2 data quantization discrete entropy calculations require precisely measured data to be selectively binned into smaller coarser datasets the configuration of optimal networks identified using entropy based design strategies is sensitive to the selection of quantization techniques fahle et al 2015 however a universally preferred method has not yet been identified keum and coulibaly 2017a for this research observed and simulated discharge rates in units of cubic meters per second were converted to mm day by dividing by catchment drainage areas a bin width of 1 mm day was then applied with values rounded up to the nearest integer previous investigations using demo have applied a similar technique samuel et al 2013 werstuck and coulibaly 2017 the mathematical representation of this procedure is as follows 4 x r x where x r is the quantized value and x is the observed value to be binned 3 2 3 streamflow regionalization streamflow time series for the existing and pseudo potential stations within the frb required infilling to account for missing measurements data gaps in observed hydrometric time series can be a result of many factors including equipment failure seasonal inactivity and deactivation of a station during the midst of the selected 10 year monitoring period missing streamflow measurements were infilled using the inverse distance weighting drainage area ratio method studies have consistently shown through cross validation that idw dar is one of the best regionalization techniques for infilling streamflow data in canadian watersheds samuel et al 2013 werstuck and coulibaly 2017 idw dar is calculated using the following equations 5 q u i 1 n w i a u a i α q i w i h i 2 i 1 n h i 2 where q u is regionalized streamflow a u is the drainage area of the catchment of interest a i is a drainage area associated with a catchment whose times series is being used to facilitate the regionalization α is a fitting parameter set equal to 1 w i is a weighting coefficient and h i is the distance between the centroid of the catchment whose times series is being infilled and the centroid of the neighboring catchment facilitating the regionalization it should be noted setting the fitting parameter α equal to one has been found to be optimal for demo based applications samuel et al 2013 3 2 4 synthetic streamflow generation with hype model the hydrological predictions for the environment hype model is a semi distributed model developed by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi sub catchments are first categorized as either land or lake and are then further spatially refined into classes each of which represents a fraction of the total sub catchment area classes are demarcated based on a combination of vegetation soil land use and topographic characteristics developed based on the traditional hbv and hbv np models hype is capable of simulating catchment discharge runoff in addition to the transfer of nitrogen and phosphorus through the modeled area lindström et al 2010 a hype model of the combined nelson churchill river basin was used to generate synthetic time series for potential streamflow monitoring stations in the crb this variant of hype was developed at the university of manitoba based on the hudson bay drainage basin hype model which is a subset of the arctic hype model initially developed by smhi alterations to predecessors were made to produce the ncrb hype model including adding modeling routines refining catchment characteristics and adjusting calibration procedures to better account for frozen soils prairie potholes and localized flow regulation further information on the development of the ncrb hype model is provided in stadnyk and bajracharya 2019 it is important to note that the generation of a synthetic timeseries is required so that potential station locations can be evaluated as part of the optimization process output from the ncrb hype model was chosen as an alternative to idw dar regionalization for the crb because the crb is not well gauged and would therefore require significant interpolation of results additionally idw dar cannot adequately account for prairie pothole effects whereas the ncrb hype model can 3 3 multi objective evolutionary algorithm the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii developed by deb et al 2002 is one of the most widely applied moeas in the field of water resources kollat et al 2008 further details regarding the nsga ii algorithm and its application to this study are provided in the supplemental section 3 4 streamflow modeling two hydrological models were incorporated into the network design process to evaluate the hydrometric networks best suited to support streamflow modeling within the selected study areas the two models chosen were the mcmaster university hydrologiska byrans vattenbalansavdelning mac hbv model and the sacramento soil moisture accounting model sac sma both models are lumped conceptual rainfall runoffs models that were configured in a semi distributed fashion channel routing between sub catchments was facilitated using the muskingum routing method moreover both sac sma and mac hbv require daily time series for precipitation and temperature as inputs ten years of observed streamflow data were used for model calibration allowing for a one year spin up period and a nine year calibration period for the frb daily time series from 2003 to 2012 were employed whereas the timeframe for the crb was 2001 2010 further details on the two models are provided in the supplemental section selecting two models allows an assessment of how model selection may or may not significantly impact network design results 3 4 1 model performance criteria model performance criteria such as nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge quantitatively assess how accurately a simulated model output compares to the corresponding historical observations nash and sutcliffe 1970 gupta et al 1998 kge was selected as the calibration function objective and was also used to assess model performance for the calibration period an optimal kge score is 1 0 which occurs when the two times series being compared to one another are identical kge is defined mathematically as gupta et al 1998 6 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed time series α is the ratio of the standard deviation for the simulated times series to the standard deviation of the observed time series which quantifies the relative variability of the two datasets β is the quotient of the mean of the simulated time series divided by the mean of the observed time series this ratio measures the bias present in the two datasets 3 4 2 model calibration algorithm the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm developed by tolson and shoemaker 2007 was used to calibrate the model parameters for both the mac hbv and sac sma models dds is a stochastic optimization process that is capable of efficiently locating a near global optimal solution for problems with high dimensionality dds has two main parameters the number of algorithm iterations and the search coefficient for this study the standard search coefficient 0 2 as recommended for general applications by tolson and shoemaker 2007 was applied embedding the model calibration process which is itself an optimization procedure into an moea is computationally expensive and requires the use of supercomputing resources and parallel computing architecture to process results in a reasonable timeframe in this study 1000 dds iterations were applied for model calibration allowing for identification of near optimal model parameter sets while limiting computational workload to manageable levels 4 results 4 1 approach 1 identification of optimal networks through demo solutions post processing using hydrologic models the modified demo analysis employed as the initial phase in approach 1 identified 699 pareto optimal networks for the frb and 4599 pareto optimal networks for the crb during the optimization process network size was allowed to vary from the size of the existing network to a fully gauged network where all potential station locations are selected the range in joint entropy amongst the pareto optimal solutions set was 9 79 11 04 bits and 6 65 9 98 bits for the frb and crb respectively the decision variables applied in network design are binary since a station is either included or else excluded from each potential network for a system with binary decision variables the saturated or maximum joint entropy is equal to the binary logarithm of the number of temporal intervals assessed in this investigation 10 years of daily data or 3652 time steps were evaluated equating to a saturated entropy of 11 83 bits the range in joint entropy values identified using the modified demo analysis for both study areas are reasonable as they approach but do not exceed the saturated entropy networks with saturated entropy may indicate inappropriate data quantization where data was binned too finely resulting in unique time series while demo maximizes joint entropy to maximize network information content total correlation is also minimized to limit redundancies network total correlation ranged from 52 02 to 125 73 for the frb compared to a range of 5 12 89 27 for the crb when compared with the crb the frb has more existing stations furthermore many of the frb stations are clustered together in the downstream extents of the watershed in comparison the existing crb monitoring network is very sparsely gauged and not highly clustered geospatially therefore there is more informational redundancy present in the existing frb network which is reflected in the differences between the minimum total correlations for networks identified by demo for the two study areas assessing networks entirely on the principles of information theory does not allow for a user directed design that promotes the modeling of streamflow at fsc specifically it was expected that networks which heavily gauge fsc would contribute to better calibrated models for simulating streamflow at these manually identified locations thus a third optimization objective maximizing the number of fsc gauged was added to the traditional demo objectives to account for this expectation the fsc are densely gauged by the existing frb network resulting in minimal variability for that design objective when compared to the crb where the majority of fsc are ungauged a summary of the modified demo results for both study areas is provided as part of table 2 each optimal solution generated by the modified demo analysis is non dominated when compared to the rest of the corresponding solution set fig 4 a and b are three variable pareto fronts illustrating the tradeoffs between selecting different optimal solutions for both study areas the pareto front for the frb shows an apparent plateau after a joint entropy of 11 bits is reached the maximum network size amongst optimal networks identified was also only 80 stations compared to a potential maximum of 106 stations if all potential stations were gauged the choice to perform a network reduction design in the frb is consequently further justified as network analysis based on entropy theory shows adding additional stations does not significantly improve the information content of candidate networks in contrast the pareto front for the crb does not exhibit a plateau effect and the maximum network size amongst optimal networks is 89 stations which is just two short of a fully gauged network increasing network size up to near the prescribed upper limit continues to improve network information content thereby justifying the choice to perform a network augmentation in the crb demo generates many non dominated solutions semi distributed mac hbv and sac sma models post processed the demo output to reduce the number of networks decision makers need to consider for implementation and to determine which of the optimal networks are most suitable for streamflow modeling applications the model based design objectives applied during the post processing procedure were to maximize kge at fsc and minimize network size this process is visually represented as a series of scatter plots in fig 4c f all the networks generated from demo are re plotted according to the post processing results with non dominated solutions based on the primary design objectives shown as bolded markers the post processing procedure significantly reduces the number of optimal solutions from 699 to 7 8 for the frb and from 4599 to 40 41 for the crb the frb has a well established existing network with 43 stations many of which gauge fsc from fig 4c and e it is evident that when evaluating the merits of adding additional stations to frb the benefit obtained from gauging additional headwater catchments on improving model calibration is limited for both models after the first five stations are added and non existent once a network size of 67 stations is exceeded conversely for the sparsely gauged crb approach one results establish a consistent and generally linear trend between increasing network size and improving calibrated model performance as seen in fig 4d and f in terms of model model comparisons the semi distributed sac sma and mac hbv models offer similar levels of performance in both study areas 4 2 approach 2 identification of optimal networks through multi objective optimization with embedded hydrological models approach two embeds hydrological models and their calibration process into nsga ii to allow for the optimization algorithm to search the solution space according to the primary optimization objectives directly comparative pareto fronts for the non dominated solutions determined by both approaches using each model are provided in fig 5 for the frb and fig 6 for the crb both figures also illustrate the baseline model performance obtained using the existing network to calibrate the sac sma model in addition to the model performance associated with calibration using a fully gauged network as with approach one the overall performance of mac hbv and sac sma for approach two is nearly equivalent more important to note is that embedding hydrological models into the moea while significantly more computationally demanding consistently identifies networks that provide superior model performance for any given network size when compared to the networks identified using hydrologic models as a post processing mechanism the range in model performance and network size identified by both approaches are summarized as part of table 2 figs 5 and 6 illustrate that the approach 2 pareto fronts of optimal solutions for both study areas plateau and then truncate once a specific network size is achieved in all instances regardless of the study area and model selected optimal model performance is not obtained using a fully gauged network for the frb a network with 70 stations offers better performance than a fully gauged network containing an additional 36 stations for the crb the best model performance is obtained using a network with 68 stations 23 stations less dense than a fully gauged network it is clear that merely adding more stations or observations to the calibration process does not guarantee improved model performance at fsc eventually incorporating observations from additional stations can degrade model performance this degradation can be attributed to the incorporation of time series with erroneous measurements or utilizing observations from stations that monitor flow regimes uncharacteristic of adjoining catchments due to significant variability in representative physiographic characteristics or unaccounted for flow regulation instead of merely improving network density it is more important to determine the optimal spatial distribution of potential stations to complement and augment the observations provided from the existing networks furthermore the approach 2 pareto fronts for both study areas initially exhibit a roughly linear relationship between increasing network size and improving average model performance at fsc however as more dense optimal networks are identified the gradient of this trend smooths out and effectively transitions into a plateau where further increasing network density offers no significant improvement to model performance in instances where cost constraints do not force the network manager to select asmaller optimal network this transition point identifies the best optimal network for the frb the transition point occurs at network density of 55 stations and for the crb the network density is 57 stations figs 7 and 8 illustrate the spatial distribution of these best optimal networks identified using both hydrological models for the frb and crb respectively figs 7 and 8 indicate that the spatial distribution of the best optimal networks are only slightly sensitive to model selection for the frb the best optimal networks identified using the two hydrological models are 67 percent similar the similarity percentage for the crb is 77 percent more importantly for network designs facilitated by both rainfall runoff models the best optimal networks identified by approach 2 provide better performance and are generally significantly less dense networks than the best performing networks identified using approach 1 overall the approach 2 results indicate that embedding models into a moea enables the identification of smaller less costly networks that more effectively meet user needs when compared with the networks identified using the traditional approach of applying hydrological models as a post processing mechanism 4 3 bubble maps to compare spatial distribution of optimal networks bubble maps were crafted to visually assess the spatial distribution of all pareto optimal solutions identified using both approaches using these maps allows for an assessment of how the selection of the network design strategy impacts the spatial distribution of the identified optimal networks the number of optimal networks identified ranged from 7 to 41 depending on the study area and model selection it is impractical to present different network maps for each optimal network identified in this investigation individually instead the information presented in the bubble maps is based on average or aggregated statistics pertaining to a single optimal solution set as a result eight different maps or scenarios are presented one for each approach study area and model combination it is essential to note that the results represented by the bubble maps are based on averaged results across the entire optimal solutions sets identified for a given design scenario therefore an individual optimal network should not be simply selected by choosing some combination of the more frequently selected stations because doing so would not guarantee selection of an actual optimal network when comparing the two approaches using figs 9 and 10 the fsc are on average more frequently gauged and better modelled by the optimal solution sets identified using approach 2 this is visually apparent from the larger and greener nodes at fsc for the approach 2 maps non fsc are also generally less frequently selected by networks identified using approach 2 in comparison to networks identified using approach 1 in terms of model model comparisons for approach 2 the most frequently selected stations large nodes reflecting a selection frequency greater than 50 are consistently the same for both rainfall runoff models with only slight variations average model performance at fsc is also only slightly sensitive to model selection in summary the first approach employs computationally efficient secondary design objectives to search the whole solution space identify a set of pareto optimal networks based on those objectives and then reassess for non dominance based on the overarching or primary design criteria in contrast the second proposed approach embeds hydrological models and their multi site calibration process directly into the moea allowing for direct optimization according to the primary design objectives while substantially more computationally demanding the second approach is necessary to ensure that optimal networks according to the primary design objectives are not left unidentified if considered dominated during the modified demo analysis optimal networks according to the primary design objectives may be dominated during the first approach because secondary or intermediate objectives facilitate the optimization process associated with demo 5 discussion two distinct model based network design strategies were evaluated as part of this study model based network design represents a measurement based evaluation of hydrometric networks in this type of procedure a hydrological model is employed to quantify the change in model error associated with varying sets of observed data resulting from different spatial configurations of potential monitoring networks chacon hurtado et al 2017 the selection of which model and model performance criteria to use can be varied depending on the intended design application enabling user directed designs previous research using a model based approach for network design dong et al 2005 xu et al 2013 keum et al 2018 zeng et al 2018 employed models as part of a post processing procedure intermediate or secondary design objectives methods are used to identify an initial set of candidate networks that set of networks is then filtered or further evaluated using hydrological models to measure how effectively the observational dataset from each network reduces model error as measured by a manually defined set of model performance criteria the first approach applied in this study follows this same general procedure and applies entropy based design objectives as the intermediate objectives similar to keum et al 2018 this approach is shown to identify a subset of networks that are pareto optimal from an information theory perspective while also performing well based on the model directed design objectives however this process of applying hydrological models as a post processing mechanism does not represent a direct cohesive and fully continuous evaluation of the relationship between data collection model calibration and model performance for complex problems where the number of potential candidate networks to assess is significant as with this study networks that are optimal based on the primary model performance based decision making objectives may be unidentified during the initial design process facilitated by those initial intermediate objectives in these instances approach 2 is recommended as it allows for the whole solution spaced to be searched according the primary model based objectives directly since models are embedded directly into the optimization algorithm the results of this research show that in instances where decision making is based solely on the model based objectives it is preferable to apply approach 2 as better results are consistently obtained when compared to approach 1 6 conclusions the main findings of this study are as follows model based network design strategies provide a highly adaptable methodology for user directed designs of hydrometric monitoring networks potential streamflow monitoring network configurations for two large canadian river basins were investigated using two distinct approaches the first is the traditional model based approach where models are applied as a post processing mechanism the second approach embeds models directly into the optimization algorithm this investigation found the second approach identified better performing solutions when evaluating potential networks using model based design criteria therefore based on the findings of this research it is recommended that when using a model based network design strategy that models be embedded into the optimization algorithms where computationally feasible this integration allows for direct optimization according to model based decision making criteria future research should better investigate the sensitivity of network design results to the selection of which model and model performance statistics are used in the design process perhaps using models and design objectives combinations that are more suited to the modeling of specific portions of the hydrograph will emphasis the gauging of stations in distinct spatial regions lastly there is a need to develop new design strategies that can address the challenges associated with climate change currently historical time series observed at existing stations are used in conjunction with synthetic time series generated for potential station locations therefore a ten year historical time record may be used to design a network intended to function with minimal changes for twenty or more years into the future without any consideration for the impacts associated with climate change by leveraging global and regional climate models to generate projected hydrometric time series it is possible to assess the sensitivity of network design strategies including those presented in this investigation to a dynamic and variable climate credit authorship contribution statement jacob ursulak methodology software formal

4936,δ13c and d14c measurements on dissolved inorganic carbon dic particulate organic carbon poc and aquatic plants from a karst spring and two spring fed ponds in laqiao maolan township libo county southeastern guizhou of china in january july and october of 2013 have been carried out to understand the roles of aquatic photosynthesis through dic uptake in surface karst waters the mean d14c and δ13c values of dic for the spring midstream pond mp and downstream pond dp are 26 36 and 13 2 6 56 and 12 3 and 0 64 and 9 2 respectively the carbon source for the dic is mainly from biogenic co2 rather than the dissolution of limestone rock as the d14c and δ13c of limestone are about 1000 and 2 respectively the enrichment trend of d14cdic and δ13cdic from the spring to the dp indicates co2 exchange between atmospheric co2 and dic because d14c and δ13c values of atmospheric co2 are ca 50 and 8 respectively the average d14cpoc values in the spring mp and dp were 325 123 and 158 respectively which are all lower than these of the dic in each reservoir the lower d14c values of the poc may be caused by older soil carbon from surface runoff and dust fall more aquatic algae were formed through photosynthesis in the stream ponds especially in summer shown by strongly increased d14cpoc and evidence of growth in eds sem analyses furthermore the d14c values of the submerged aquatic plants range from 153 to 26 reflecting that the aquatic plants used dic for photosynthesis the d14c value of an emergent plant which uses atmospheric co2 during photosynthesis is 52 5 0 3 equivalent to the atmospheric d14c seasonal variations of d14cdic and δ13cdic are influenced by soil co2 input primary productivity in the ponds and co2 exchange hydrochemical condition show lower d14c values but higher δ13c values in cold dry season and vice versa in summer rainy season a simple mass balance calculation indicates 90 of carbon for the spring dic is from biogenic co2 with higher contribution in summer due to higher productivity although this simple calculation may overestimate the biogenic co2 it indicates that organic decomposition is a major carbon source for dic in the karst hydrological system the results of the present study have implications for 14c dating on aquatic plant remains regional and perhaps global carbon budgets and the different behaviors of 13c and 14c in karst systems keywords karst surface water dic poc stable carbon isotope radiocarbon aquatic photosynthesis 1 introduction sourced from watershed inputs and influenced by fluvial processes sun et al 2015 riverine input of dissolved and particulate carbons to oceans can play an important role in regional and global carbon budgets meybeck 1982 degens et al 1991 marwick et al 2015 xue et al 2017 ge et al 2020 for most rivers dissolved inorganic carbon dic that is dominated by bicarbonate ion comes mainly from chemical weathering of carbonates and silicates in their drainage basins there are complex processes involved in the dic cycling in river systems including oxidation of organic matter precipitation or dissolution of carbonates co2 exchange with the atmosphere and photosynthesis buhl et al 1991 aucour et al 1999 sun et al 2011 liu et al 2017 falkowski and raven 2007 estimated that approximately 50 of the photosynthesis on earth occurs in aquatic environments therefore aquatic carbon fixation is particularly relevant in the regulation of the global carbon cycles the role of ocean aquatic photosynthesis in the uptake of co2 and or hco3 has been studied intensively e g falkowski 1997 cassar et al 2004 tortell et al 2008 on the other hand the role of terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis in the co2 uptake is more complicated and less studied how does terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis utilize dic to form the autochthonous organic carbon and what is the carbon budget of terrestrial aquatic systems in global carbon cycles because karst water system contains abundant dic in natural waters carbon sources and their transformation as well as aquatic photosynthesis are particularly important in regional carbon budgets liu et al 2010 2015 liu 2013 liu and dreybrodt 2015 in studies of the xijiang river and its tributaries in a karst area of sw china sun et al 2011 2015 pointed out that the fractions transformed from carbonate sourced dic through photosynthesis of aquatic organisms ranged from 3 4 to 20 5 in the rainy season and from 12 3 to 22 1 in the dry season implying an important sink of atmospheric co2 in river systems however the process of transformation from dic into organic carbon in karst water is still poorly understood carbon isotopes are often used for tracing carbon sources and isotopic fractionations among phases and or materials in natural water systems e g taylor and fox 1996 yang et al 1996 atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 amiotte suchet et al 1999 aucour et al 1999 das et al 2005 han et al 2010 kanduč et al 2012 tsypin and macpherson 2012 zhao et al 2015a however using only δ13c in tracing carbon sources often encounters problems associated with source and process overlaps raymond and bauer 2001a radiocarbon isotope 14c has a much greater dynamic range 1000 to 200 compared to δ13c 40 to 2 and offers a particularly powerful tracer of the origin of c pools and their cycling within aquatic ecosystems raymond et al 2004 sun et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 ishikawa et al 2015 liu et al 2017 thus combining δ13c and d14c values in different carbon species dic poc dissolved organic carbon doc and plants can certainly provide much more detailed information on the source age residence time and transformation of carbon in an aquatic system and can overcome problems associated with source overlap raymond and bauer 2001a 2001b 2001c the present study uses stable and radioactive carbon isotopes 13c 14c of dic poc and aquatic plants in a karst aquatic system in southwestern china for identifying carbon sources and processes of carbon transformation this study aims to identify the contribution of aquatic photosynthesis in the carbon cycle of this setting 2 study site located in libo county of guizhou province in sw china maolan national reserve is well known for its dense virgin evergreen forests growing on cone karst and is listed by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco as a world nature heritage site libo karst one of the three clusters of south china karst whc unesco org fig 1 with a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual rainfall in the virgin forest area is about 1750 mm nearly 80 of precipitation occurring in the monsoon season from april to september and the annual mean air temperature is about 17 c zhou 1987 the lithology in this area is mainly dolomitic limestone of middle and lower carboniferous age jiang et al 2008 liu et al 2007 han et al 2010 chen et al 2014 soils in the study area are relatively thin and discontinuous with thickness of 30 40 cm often existing in rock fractures however a unique natural complexity of karst forest appears in this karst geomorphological setting under subtropical monsoons zhou 1987 the forest contains mixed deciduous broadleaved trees which form a stable ecosystem maolan spring is a ca hco3 type epikarst spring with flow rates that vary from 0 05 to 3 l s during the year liu et al 2007 it is situated at the base of a cone karst slope that is covered by virgin karst forest fig 2 shows full views of the spring channel and the receiving ponds mp midstream pond and dp downstream pond a large quantity of submerged plants chiefly hydrilla verticillata grows in mp in the spring some submerged plants chiefly charophyta exist whereas no submerged plants appear in dp weirs were built to control spring and pond outflows the weir for the spring was built in 2002 for long term monitoring of water stage and flow calculation liu et al 2007 whereas the weirs for mp and dp were built in 2004 but have only been monitored since 2011 liu et al 2015 water from the spring at the monitoring site fig 1d flows into a channel and enters a small pool fig 2 spring channel then enters the mp the distance from the spring outlet and mp is 38 m the water chemistry and flow rate of the spring were monitored at the spring outlet fig 1d all water poc and plant samples for the spring were also collected at the site shown in fig 1d the volume of the spring reservoir is rather small with 0 5 2 m in area and 0 5 m deep which approximately yields a volume 0 5 m3 the average spring discharge was 0 6 l s in january 2 l s in july and 0 9 l s in october with relatively stable flow rates during each month the areas of mp and dp were 280 m2 and 1300 m2 respectively the water depth of mp is shallow so that its volume is much smaller about 60 m3 than that of dp nearly 1300 m3 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2015 the spring and pond setting is an ideal natural monitoring system for study of carbon cycle and transformation in surface karst water water from the spring enters the mp and dp directly with very short residence time the ponds have the same environment no other underground flows enter the ponds although the influence of surface runoff and direct rainfall on the hydrological system was not quantified there was no rainfall recorded during the sampling dates in the rainy season water chemistry of dp may be buffered by its large size compared to the mp using the fore mentioned spring flow rates we can estimate the water residence time in mp was 28 h in january 8 h in july and 19 h in october considering no evaporation and other inputs for dp the estimated residence time was 25 days in january 7 5 days in july and 17 days in october the above estimation indicates that water residence time in mp was much shorter than that in dp so that the effects of environmental influence on water chemistry and biological activity between mp and dp are different 3 methods 3 1 sample collection and pretreatment measurements of hydrochemical parameters flow rate temperature ph conductivity dissolved oxygen and ions and collections of samples dic poc plants from the spring and the two spring fed ponds were conducted during 27 28 january winter 24 25 july summer and 24 25 october autumn of 2013 water samples for δ13cdic and d14cdic were collected in pre cleaned evacuated 60 ml glass vials with no air space one drop of saturated hgcl2 solution was added to each sample to prevent microbial activity and samples were kept at 4 c in the laboratory until analysis the preserved samples for δ13cdic and d14cdic analyses were acidified with pure phosphoric acid raymond et al 2004 and then evolved co2 was purified on a vacuum extraction line after cryogenic removal of h2o using a liquid nitrogen ethanol trap water samples were filtered by a vacuum filtration device through 0 7 μm whatman gf f filter papers 47 mm in diameter which were pre weighed after combustion at 450 c for 6 h the gf f filter papers were freeze dried and analyzed for poc after removing the inorganic carbon by reaction with hcl fumes in the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry eg lab at the institute of geochemistry chinese academy of science guiyang the treated poc samples on the papers were then combusted with cuo powder and ag wire at 850 c in an evacuated 9 mm quartz tube in the accelerator mass spectrometer ams radiocarbon dating laboratory of the national taiwan university ntuams lab yields of co2 were quantified using an absolute pressure gauge on a vacuum extraction line and aliquots were taken for d14c measurements by ams at ntuams lab and for δ13c measurements by irms in the eg lab plant samples collected from the spring and mp were pretreated in the ntuams lab following the standard 14c methods of oxford radiocarbon accelerator unit orau to ensure that any adsorbed carbon dioxide was removed brock et al 2010 samples were rinsed with distilled water and freeze dried prior to combustion and graphitization the dried samples 2 mg were then treated using the same procedures used for poc samples 3 2 in situ titration and chemical analysis field titrations were used to measure the alkalinity and ca2 of water with the aquamerck alkalinity test and hardness test since the majority of dissolved inorganic carbon species in the karst water when ph is around 8 the alkalinity measurement is close to hco3 in the karst environment ca2 and mg2 are the major ions but ca2 is 2 3 times larger than mg2 thus we use the results of the alkalinity test and hardness test as the results of hco3 and ca2 measurements the precisions for hco3 and ca2 measurements are 6 mg l and 1 mg l respectively two sets of 60 ml samples were transferred in acid washed hydroplastic bottles for chemical analysis of cations and anions after filtering through 0 45 μm millipore filters the samples for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 0 using concentrated nitric acid parameters of temperature ph electronic conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ by a hand held wtw 350 water quality meter with 1σ error of 2 the water samples were taken back to the eg lab to determine cation concentrations of na k ca2 and mg2 through an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and anion concentrations of so4 2 cl and no3 by a dionex ics 90 ion chromatography all measured hydrochemical parameters are listed in tables 1 and 2 since the concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 did not vary significantly for each reservoir during each sampling month table 2 lists only the average values of them from table 2 one can see ca2 is the major cation and hco3 is the major anion which is the feature of karst hydrology

concentrations of seven major ions liu et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 2015a since the host rocks in the study region are limestone and dolomite intercalated with gypsum strata ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 are the major ions with the recorded temperature and ph as well as the measured ion concentrations calculations of pco2 and sic were processed through the program watspec wigley 1977 based on the following equations 1 pco 2 hco 3 h k 1 k co2 2 si c log ca 2 co 3 2 k c where k1 kco2 and kc are the equilibrium constants for carbonic acid h2co3 co2 and calcite dissolution respectively if sic 0 water is supersaturated with respect to calcite and if sic 0 water is undersaturated the calculated pco2 and sic values are listed in table 1 3 4 continuous monitoring of daily variations in hydrochemical conditions diurnal cycles of the 3 water bodies were monitored in 3 seasons in situ hydrochemical parameters temperature ph ec and do were measured every 15 min using a wtw 350i multiline p3 automated device two to three water samples for δ13cdic analyses were collected over the course of a day table 3 lists the hydrochemical parameters corresponding to the δ13cdic samples the monitoring device wtw for the dp was broken at 14 00 pm in the afternoon of 10 25 2013 so that there was no hydrochemical record for the last five δ13cdic samples of the dp in table 3 3 5 carbon isotopic analysis poc and plant samples were combusted by the method described in section 3 1 and the purified co2 was sealed in a glass tube for δ13c measurement the δ13cdic δ13cpoc and δ13cplant were determined on a mat 252 mass spectrometer with dual inlet in the eg lab results are in tables 3 and 4 relative to v pdb and have 0 15 1σ precision the purified co2 of dic poc and plant samples for d14c measurements were placed on the graphitization line under vacuum of 10 3 mbar in the ntuams lab when exposed to 400 mg zn at 450 c for reaction the co2 was reduced to graphite with fe fe c 3

b v hvee in the ntuams lab each batch of sample targets was run with three targets of oxalic acid standards oxii 4900c three targets of carbonate backgrounds ntub and two targets of inter comparison samples all standard background and inter comparison targets were processed with the same procedures as the sample targets all reported d14c values were corrected for carbon isotopic fractionation using δ13c values of the samples measured with 14c by the ams stuiver and polach 1977 the ams 14c counting statistical error for oxii is generally 0 5 and all ams 14c dates are listed in table 4 3 6 scanning electron microscopy sem structures and elemental contents of some poc samples were analyzed by an oxford instruments field emission scanning electron microscope sem with an emax energy eds system in the department of geosciences at national taiwan university the images and chemical compositions of some algae particles can be detected by the eds sem the results are shown in fig 12 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry of the spring pond system table 1 shows the values of the measured water temperature ph ec do ca2 hco3 and δ13cdic as well as the calculated pco2 and sic values in january july and october at each site data measured and samples collected from the different months represent hydrochemical conditions corresponding to soil activity and primary productivity in the study site under typical climatic conditions of different seasons being january for winter july for summer and october for autumn respectively the measured results in table 2 indicate that ca2 and hco3 are the major cation and anion which come from dissolution of limestone and soil carbonate so that the karst water system belongs to ca hco3 type these ions dominate the changes of the electrical conductivity ec shown by strong positive correlations between hco3 and ec fig 3a and by generally positive trends for ca2 and ec fig 3b previous studies have demonstrated that such positive correlations commonly exist in the karst water of the study area chen et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 2015a hence variations of the measured ec can reflect changes in hco3 concentration of the karst water fig 3 shows that ca2 and hco3 concentrations in the spring pool are generally higher than these in mp and dp and the variation of ca2 and hco3 concentrations in mp are much larger than these in dp this is because the ca2 and hco3 concentrations are affected by dilution caco3 precipitation depending on buffering capacity of the carbonate system atmospheric exchange and biological productivity to a different extent for each site in the study area rainy season is in the summer but no rain event occurred during the sampling dates so that dilution from surface runoff might be small in fact if dilution effect caused lower concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in the spring fed ponds one would see lower ca2 and hco3 concentrations in july especially in the mp however this was not the case table 1 since the input water of mp and dp came mainly from the spring co2 degassing of the water will increase ph which might lead to caco3 precipitation and decrease of ca2 and hco3 biological uptake of co2 in mp and dp may further reduce the tco2 i e total co2 including dissolve co2 gas hco3 and co3 2 ions the consequence of those processes can be seen by changes in ph sic and pco2 shown in figs 4 and 5 in figs 4a and 5d f the spring always has the lowest ph consequently the calculated pco2 in the spring is higher than these in mp and dp and sic is generally lower fig 4b the monitoring results also indicate that the spring water temperature 2 c variation and ec 10 variation remained relatively constant through the year fig 5 reflecting a relatively uniform source water the summer spring water 7 24 25 2013 has the lowest ph and the highest pco2 with an unsaturated sic value 0 table 1 probably because higher subsurface biological activity in soil during the summer added additional co2 as indicated by the more negative value for δ13c the above observations provide the following basic information 1 the spring has relatively stable hydrochemical conditions over the course of the year with stable water temperature the lowest ph highest ec as well as ca2 and hco3 concentrations and high pco2 2 seasonally there is a higher subsurface co2 contribution to the spring water during the summer causing lower ph higher pco2 and unsaturated sic 3 the absence of significant diurnal changes suggests very low biological activity and caco3 precipitation occur in the spring pool and 4 from the spring to mp and dp loss of co2 from degassing caco3 precipitation and biological uptake change the hydrochemical conditions and isotopic composition of the dic in the water based on these observations and carbon isotope values we will discuss the carbon source and transformation processes changes in the hydrochemical parameters and carbon isotopic compositions of mp and dp should have the similar trends and processes considering that they have the same source water and environmental conditions however as mentioned above the volume and depth of mp are much smaller than that of dp so that the water residence time of mp is much shorter than that of dp in mp abundant submerged plants dominated by chara fragilis exist whereas fewer aquatic plants exist in the spring and dp fig 2 and as shown by the diurnal changes the primary productivity in mp is much stronger than that in dp fig 5 the diurnal hydrochemical variations of mp and dp fig 5 will help in understanding controlling factors on the daily variations of dic during these monitoring days there was no rainfall event to directly affect the hydrological condition the ph is positively correlated with the water temperature the ec varied negatively with t and ph the variation patterns are similar in all seasons so that one should not expect variation of seasonal soil co2 input to cause such changes these daily changes should largely depend on co2 degassing caco3 precipitation aquatic photosynthesis and respiration influenced by water temperature and sunlight de montety et al 2011 chen et al 2014 yang et al 2015 as calculated earlier the water residence time of sp mp and dp were 1 h 8 28 h and 7 25 days respectively with much shorter time in july one should consider the water replacement in mp the water temperature increased from morning to late afternoon and then decreased continuously to the next morning as water temperature increases co2 degassing and caco3 precipitation increase consequently ph increases and ec mainly hco3 and ca2 decreases aquatic photosynthesis increases during the daytime while aquatic respiration occurs during the nighttime the former process will take up co2 and the latter process will release co2 compared to dp the large variations of ph and ec in mp should be caused by much stronger aquatic photosynthesis and respiration in the smaller water body the daily hydrochemical variation also provides insight to the changes in carbon isotopic composition 4 2 δ13cdic variation in the karst water system dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the spring comes primarily from co2 released by organic matter oxidation and limestone bedrock dissolution in the subsurface the dic of the spring water is the main supply of the dic in mp and dp as water flows to mp and dp co2 degassing caco3 precipitation aquatic photosynthesis and respiration and surface runoff dilution can affect the dic concentration and carbon isotopic fractionation in a study of dic behavior and δ13cdic in three karst water catchments of guizhou zhao et al 2015a summarized the factors influencing dic concentration and δ13cdic including 1 carbonate bedrock dissolution and caco3 precipitation relative to water residence time which is controlled by rates of groundwater flow geomorphology and initial ph of surface water 2 soil co2 input controlled by vegetation soil coverage and thickness and land use 3 exchange with atmospheric co2 and 4 aquatic plant photosynthesis and respiration in the water system δ13cdic variations in the sp mp and dp during each sampling period fig 6 show several characteristics first δ13cdic values in the spring were lower than mp and dp during all sampling periods second δ13cdic values in all 3 settings were lower in july and october and the highest in january third δ13cdic generally co varies with ph in each reservoir showing lower δ13cdic corresponding to lower ph fig 7 this finding agrees well with the results of zhao et al 2015a the above observations indicate that 1 assuming that decaying vegetation releases δ13cdic with 25 and the limestone is near 0 dic input to the spring comes mainly from soil co2 rather than limestone bedrock dissolution 2 groundwater input to mp and dp is negligible and their dic is mainly from the spring 3 dilution of tco2 by surface water runoff rainfall to the karst water system is minor 4 the δ13c of the source water is controlled by the soil co2 input which is the major factor influencing seasonal δ13cdic in each reservoir with lower δ13c in the summer rainy season 5 the large diurnal variations of ph ec sic and pco2 in mp indicate that aquatic photosynthesis respiration is much more important for the carbonate system than co2 degassing caco3 precipitation in mp however since the water residence time in mp is close to one day part of the variations in mp is caused by inflow of spring water into the pond the observation 4 can be demonstrated by the strong correlation of δ13cdic ph in the spring fig 8a the dominance of aquatic photosynthesis and respiration in mp reflects its abundant aquatic plant community considering hco3 is the dominating ion in tco2 we use a plot of δ13cdic 1 hco3 to illustrate the influence of aquatic photosynthesis fig 8b shows that a strong correlation in mp indicates the effect of photosynthesis although the relation may also be influenced by carbonate precipitation and co2 escape to the atmosphere the average δ13cdic values with sample standard deviations for january 27 28 2013 in the spring mp and dp were 11 18 0 11 7 84 0 94 and 7 95 0 18 respectively table 3 in general δ13c of soil co2 in guizhou ranges from 20 to 24 unpublished data the spring water tco2 should be a mixture of carbon released by soil respiration and dissolution of the carbonate bedrock assuming an average δ13c of soil gas co2 in the study area is 22 the carbon isotopic fractionation at 20 c will lead to 8 5 increase as it dissolves to become hco3 chacko et al 2001 so that the dic in the surface water supplied from vadose zone respiration to the spring should have a δ13c value around 13 5 carbonate dissolution in the soil and through limestone bedrock along the passageway to the spring is a second source carbon isotopes in marine limestone and dolostone have been reported to range from 1 to 2 clark and fritz 1997 so δ13c of the dic from limestone dissolution should be around 1 chacko et al 2001 the measured δ13cdic of the spring is 11 18 using the following simple mass balance equation we can calculate the percentages of dic from soil co2 f1 and limestone dissolution f2 3 δ m carbon isotope of the carbon mixture f 1 δ 1 f 2 δ 2 4 f 1 f 2 1 where δm δ13cdic δ13c of the dic in the spring 11 18 δ1 13 5 and δ2 1 the carbon fraction from limestone dissolution is about 18 6 whereas the carbon fraction from soil co2 is 81 4 this mass balance calculation is quite different from the view implied by reaction 5 that would suggest dic contribution in the karst water should come from an equal mixture of limestone dissolution and oxidized organic material hendy 1971 5 h 2 co 3 caco 3 ca 2 2 hco 3 if this was the case then the δ13c of the spring water would be 7 25 in fact many cave studies show that soil co2 is a major source of total co2 in cave and epi karst waters and lighter δ13c of cave and epi karst waters in the summer is due to more contribution of soil co2 e g li et al 2011 2012 zhao et al 2015a the δ13cdic measurements of the spring pool indicates that the 18 6 contribution of carbonate dissolution is very likely under cooler water temperature and longer water residence time in the seepage path during the dry winter season high temperature in the rainy season leads to increased biomass productivity strong root respiration and organic decomposition providing more soil co2 with low δ13c atkin et al 2000 on the other hand fast flow rate of seepage water reduces groundwater residence times resulting in decreased carbonate dissolution per ml zhao et al 2015a the average δ13cdic value of the spring in july 24 25 was 15 11 0 11 with the lowest ph negative sic and the highest pco2 confirming the above interpretations again using 22 for the δ13c of soil gas co2 and 30 c for the summer temperature the carbon isotopic fractionation between hco3 aq and co2 g can be estimated chacko et al 2001 6 1000 lnα hco3 aq and co2 g 0 0945 t c 10 41 an enrichment of 7 55 should exist from soil co2 to hco3 in the seepage water thus the estimated δ13c of the seepage water should be about 15 as the measured δ13cdic value of the spring is 15 11 0 11 it means that carbon contribution of limestone bedrock dissolution in the summer is minor if there is apparent co2 degassing and or limestone bedrock dissolution in the seepage water its δ13cdic value should become heavier caco3 precipitation in the spring during july 24 25 was unlikely because sic 0 the average δ13cdic value of the spring in october 24 25 was 12 42 0 39 n 20 a similar estimation of the carbon contribution from soil co2 is 90 comparing the δ13cdic values between the spring and dp during the three sampling periods about 3 enrichment in the δ13cdic occurred from the spring to dp in each period and the variation patterns of the δ13cdic in the two reservoirs were very similar fig 7 the 3 enrichment can only be explained by the following processes 1 co2 degassing 2 co2 exchange between dic and the atmospheric co2 3 increase co3 2 hco3 ratio due to ph increase 4 aquatic photosynthesis and 5 carbonate dissolution since other processes such as caco3 precipitation aquatic respiration and organic decomposition lead to δ13cdic depletion process 5 is unlikely because the sic values for dp are 0 table 1 processes 1 to 3 occur simultaneously but have different degrees of influences on carbon isotopic fractionation co2 degassing leads to 12c preferentially entering the atmosphere and pco2 decrease in the water which results in ph increase and sic rise the increased ph will further elevate the co3 2 hco3 ratio in the water that is process 3 to have about 1 enrichment of δ13cdic palmer et al 2001 the ph increase and pco2 decrease from the spring to the spring fed ponds support the processes 1 and 3 process 2 co2 exchange between the dic of the karst water and the atmospheric co2 is happening all the time as the δ13c of escaping co2 gas about 22 in the spring is lighter than the δ13c of atmospheric co2 8 process 2 will lead to enrichment of δ13cdic in the karst water however equilibrium co2 exchange would not affect ph of the karst water nevertheless the influences of processes 1 to 3 on the δ13cdic change from the spring to the spring fed ponds can happen simultaneously using δ13c only it is difficult to identify the relative importance of processes 1 to 3 aquatic photosynthesis respiration is an important process influencing isotopic composition de montety et al 2011 pointed out that photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic plants are the dominant processes controlling in stream diel isotopic variation in daytime a simultaneous increase of δ13cdic and decrease of dic indicates that photosynthesis is a primary control on dic concentrations liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 fig 8 shows that correlation of δ13cdic and ph in mp was not very strong fig 8a but correlation of δ13cdic and 1 hco3 in mp was rather strong fig 8b indicating the influence of biological activity on the isotopic signal in mp in this karst water system biological activity was relatively weak in the spring and dp so that the influence of aquatic photosynthesis and respiration on their δ13cdic was negligible especially in winter time however diurnal variations of the δ13cdic of the spring and dp during the october sampling period show some modest variation in both spring and dp reservoirs fig 7c those variations in the δ13cdic may not be attributed to aquatic photosynthesis and respiration in the water bodies instead the variations may be caused by the δ13c changes from the input water to the spring fig 9 shows that the δ13cdic of the spring and dp do not co vary perfectly with their ph ec and do through time since the dic of the spring comes mainly from the soil co2 its δ13cdic variation may reflect δ13c change in the soil water for example the decreased δ13cdic during the night of october 24 might be attributed to low δ13c of soil water due to plant respiration shown by low do and low ph fig 9 in general aquatic photosynthesis using co2 of dic and producing oxygen will increase ph co3 2 hco3 ratio and sic this reduces pco2 and ec if caco3 precipitates gattuso et al 1999 the δ13cdic of the water should increase as organic carbon formation preferentially uptakes 12c yang et al 1996 aquatic plant respiration has the opposite effects therefore if aquatic photosynthesis and respiration is significant one should see above correlations among δ13cdic ph do sic pco2 and ec fig 10 demonstrates these correlations among δ13cdic ph do sic pco2 and ec in mp where abundant aquatic plants exist during daytime aquatic plants uptake co2 aq for photosynthesis facilitating precipitation of calcite at night on the other hand respiration becomes the major process and produces co2 in the water that can cause the dissolution of calcite aquatic photosynthesis and respiration can be described by the following simplified reactions 7 ca 2 2hco 3 caco 3 x co 2 h 2 o 1 x ch 2 o o 2 daytime 8 6h 2 o 6co 2 c 6 h 12 o 6 6o 2 9 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2hco 3 night 10 c 6 h 12 o 6 6o 2 6h 2 o 6co 2 as discussed before respiration in soil affects the δ13c ph ec and do of the source water bedrock dissolution co2 degassing exchange with the atmosphere change of co3 2 hco3 ratio caco3 precipitation aquatic photosynthesis respiration and all these can influence δ13cdic however these factors have different time scales and depend on biological conditions fig 10 shows that change of soil respiration is the major factor controlling δ13cdic and hydrochemistry on seasonal or longer time scales with low δ13c ph and do but high ec and pco2 in summer in winter both soil respiration and aquatic biological activity are less apparent changes in hydrochemical condition become dominant factors the δ13cdic of mp increased with increased water temperature ph co3 2 hco3 ratio and photosynthesis during daytime the situation reversed during night time fig 10 in addition when biological activity is strong the effect of co2 degassing becomes minor for instance co2 degassing should reach a maximum at noon on 10 25 2013 but the highest δ13cdic appeared at 16 00 showing influence of photosynthesis on the δ13cdic 4 3 d14c signatures of dic in the karst water system d14c expresses the 14c 12c ratio as pmc 1 1000 where pmc denotes fraction of modern carbon which is defined as the atmospheric 14c in 1950 ce in 1950 ce pmc 1 and d14c 0 for a sample older than 60 ka its pmc is close to zero and d14c 1000 owing to nuclear weapon testing in the atmosphere its d14c reached to 800 in 1964 then started to decrease primarily due to dilution as it mixed with other carbon reservoirs including the terrestrial biosphere the upper ocean and fossil fuel co2 input in 2013 the atmospheric d14c was about 40 in north hemisphere hua et al 2013 plants grown in land will have d14c values similar to that of the atmospheric co2 an emerged plant sparganium stoloniferum in table 4 has d14c of 52 5 0 3 which can represent the atmospheric d14c in the study site although 14c may be somewhat higher in the soil carbon pool that is decaying if soil co2 is completely from decomposition of organic carbon including plants and animals which has the same d14c value as the atmospheric d14c its d14c is about 40 considering dic of the spring water comes from soil co2 and carbonate dissolution in the soil and along the seepage pass way one may simply estimate the fractions of the two endmembers by the eqs 3 and 4 to make the model simple we do not consider the selective oxidation of young or old organic carbon which could affect the 14c mass balance the d14cdic values of the spring in january july and october of 2013 were 68 8 2 2 average of 22 5 and 18 1 and 28 8 respectively table 4 giving δ1 40 soil co2 and δ2 1000 limestone rock then the contribution of soil co2 to the dic in the spring in the january july and october were 90 96 and 93 respectively the percentage of limestone dissolution was 10 if the d14c of the soil co2 is smaller than the atmospheric d14c then the estimated contribution of limestone dissolution should be even smaller the mass balance calculation of the d14c supports the result of the δ13cdic nevertheless estimation by the d14cdic shows the co2 contribution from carbonate dissolution to the dic in the karst water system is 10 and the contribution of soil co2 or carbonate dissolution is higher or lower in the summer time the co2 of the dic is mainly from soil co2 this result may provide constraints for radiocarbon dating of stalagmite samples li et al 2015 yin et al 2017 zhao et al 2015b 2017 compared to the spring the d14cdic values of mp and dp should be higher more positive because co2 exchange with the atmosphere allows d14cdic to approach the atmospheric d14c the d14cdic values of mp and dp are complicated as shown in table 4 and fig 11 sometimes the d14cdic values of the ponds were higher than these of the spring but sometimes they were lower as discussed before co2 degassing co2 exchange with the atmosphere increased co3 2 hco3 ratio and photosynthesis will lead to increased δ13cdic and caco3 precipitation and respiration will cause δ13cdic decrease among these processes only co2 exchange with the atmosphere and respiration will influence d14cdic co2 exchange with the atmosphere always leads to increased d14cdic the influence of respiration on d14cdic depends on the co2 input from the respiration if the co2 input from the respiration has a d14c value higher than the d14cdic of the water the mixture will have higher d14cdic otherwise the mixture will have lower d14cdic normally respiration of terrestrial plants should provide a higher d14c value but respiration of aquatic plants might not it is interesting that the samples taken from both mp and dp in the mornings had lower d14cdic with lower δ13cdic do and sic values but high pco2 whereas the samples taken in the afternoons had higher d14cdic with relatively high δ13cdic do and sic values but low pco2 table 3 and fig 10 the results clearly demonstrate the influence of co2 exchange with the atmosphere accompanied by co2 degassing and aquatic respiration since the aquatic respiration caused both d14cdic and δ13cdic decreases especially in the summer time one may expect that the d14c of the co2 decomposed from organic carbon is relatively low however whether the decomposed organic carbon which had low d14c comes from soil or in the aquatic system is unclear the downstream pond should have weak aquatic respiration but both d14cdic and δ13cdic during the july sampling period show strong depletion reflecting a significant amount of organic carbon decomposed therefore it is possible that the co2 of respiration may come from older soil carbonate dissolution should not cause the δ13cdic decrease so it cannot be the mechanism to explain the decreased d14cdic especially in july and october 4 4 d14c of poc in the karst water system poc samples in this study were collected through 0 7 μm whatman gf f filter papers 47 mm in diameter and consist of suspended particles in water sample weights are generally a few mg the suspended particles include algae formed in the water and detritus from aeolian dust and surface runoff since the algae are only a few μm in size it is impossible to separate enough algae particles for ams 14c measurements therefore the d14cpoc value is for the total organic carbon toc of a poc sample the average d14cpoc values in the spring mp and dp during january 27 28 2013 were 353 223 average of 175 and 270 6 and 256 average of three poc values respectively with a total average of 261 77 n 6 much lower than d14cdic values for dic in the corresponding sites table 4 and fig 11 it is not surprising that d14cpoc value of surface fresh water is lower than the atmospheric d14c for instance kao and liu 1996 found that an average d14c value of poc samples from lanyang hsi lanyang river was 875 the d14cpoc values of samples from zhujiang and xijiang rivers varied from 425 to 65 and 425 to 201 respectively wei et al 2010 sun et al 2011 liu et al 2017 this is probably due to old organic carbon from detrital input through aerosol and surface runoff ishikawa et al 2012 pointed out that the primary production in surface water transfers 14c depleted carbon from carbonated rock into stream ecosystem food webs liu et al 2017 also pointed out that poc is older than dic in the zhujiang river consistent with a reservoir effect associated with poc spiraling suspension re deposition in streams and rivers the absolute ages of dic and poc in riverine systems are influenced by the geomorphic and hydrologic variations in different watersheds besides poc spiraling suspension re deposition reason co2 exchange with atmosphere is another reason for the d14cpoc the d14cdic in the corresponding sites dic in the surface water can have strong co2 exchange with atmosphere whereas poc cannot have co2 exchange with the atmosphere theoretically if all poc were formed throughout photosynthesis by taking up dissolved co2 in the water endogenous their d14c values would be close to the d14cdic in the corresponding sites however all d14cpoc are much lower than the d14cdic in the corresponding sites indicating the majority of poc comes exogenously from detritus during the winter primary productivity is low so that algae production can be also low the eds sem analyses shown in fig 12a provide such evidence showing more detritus and low carbon contents in the january samples hence the poc collected in january 27 28 of 2013 contains mainly detrital carbon which has older 14c ages the d14cpoc values of the samples collected from mp and dp during july 24 25 and october 24 25 of 2013 range from 124 to 26 with an average of 74 33 n 8 this average d14cpoc value is much higher than the average d14cpoc value of the winter samples 223 68 reflecting abundant algae formed in the ponds during warm seasons the eds sem results show abundant algae and high c contents in the july from the ponds fig 12b as the d14cpoc of exogenous poc is unknown however currently we are not able to independently estimate how much poc was exogenous surface runoff and aeolian dust because all the d14cpoc values are much lower than the atmospheric d14c even in mp during the summer time our next question is whether the algae growing in the warm seasons uses dic in the ponds or not to answer this question we need to know the d14c of pure algae grown in the ponds unfortunately we are unable to separate detrital poc and algae from a sample and even if the separation is possible the amount of algae is not enough to date in the ntuams lab nevertheless the poc in the epi karst system comes mainly from exogenous source in the winter time but contains abundant algae endogenous in the spring fed ponds during the warm seasons the next section will show biological uptake of dic through aquatic photosynthesis in the epi karst system 4 5 d14c signature of aquatic plants the aquatic plants collected from the spring and mp are three submerged plants hydrilla verticillata charophyceae and spirogyra and one emerged plant sparganium stoloniferum table 4 the d14c values of the submerged plants range from 152 5 1 8 to 25 7 0 2 with an average of 87 5 57 9 n 6 all significantly lower than the d14c value 52 5 0 3 of the emerged plant which is equivalent to the local atmospheric d14c the results clearly demonstrate the submerged plants uptake their co2 from dic in the water if the submerged plants used atmospheric co2 only then their d14c values should be close to that of emerged plants nielsen 1946 determined that some plants could assimilate not only free co2 but also hco3 in fact more and more studies demonstrate that aquatic plants uptake dic for photosynthesis e g li et al 2019 blyakharchuk et al 2020 waterson and canuel 2008 showed that the proportion from dic transformation to toc in the mississippi river by aquatic photosynthesis could be 20 and 57 as revealed by lipid biomarker and δ13ctoc analyses this loss of dic will be partly transformed into organic carbon as stated in eq 7 sun et al 2011 and eventually partly buried as autochthonous organic matter liu et al 2011 this process constitutes a biological carbon pump bcp de la rocha and passow 2007 liu et al 2017 and increases the organic carbon preservation potential in the ponds liu et al 2015 as liu et al 2015 suggested if the terrestrial bcp effect is strong enough as in the case of midstream pond including both algae poc and plants there is a carbon sink by drawing co2 directly from the atmosphere to surface water this organic carbon is buried in the sediments and its storage should be better quantified in the carbon cycle models currently quantitative estimation of the dic fraction used for submerged plants during aquatic photosynthesis in the karst water system is limited by long term measurements of d14cdic in a year this study shows that the d14cdic varies during a day table 4 so that the d14cdic value used for photosynthesis of submerged plants is uncertain we cannot use the d14c values of dic and submerged plants in table 4 for a mass balance calculation however one may ask why the d14c of the submerged plants in the spring pool during october 132 5 and 152 5 was much lower than those during january 30 1 and july 25 7 in order to lower the d14c of the submerged plants either the local atmospheric d14c or the d14cdic of the spring during autumn was lower first of all the study site is a forest environment far away from urban area so there is no evidence that the local atmospheric d14c should be significantly lower second if the submerged plants used only atmospheric co2 for photosynthesis their d14c would be positive and not related to d14cdic variation our hypothesis for the lower d14c of submerged plants in the spring during october is that the submerged plants have strong co2 uptake from dic during photosynthesis and the long term d14cdic in the spring was lower during late summer to autumn due to decomposition of organic matter shown by reactions 9 and 10 both poc with d14c of 200 450 decomposition and carbonate with d14c of 1000 dissolution can contribute to low d14c co2 however we think that the organic matter decomposition should be main reason as the δ13c of the submerged plants were lower in october than those in january and july table 3 geyh et al 1998 suggested that the primary 14c sources in freshwater aquatic environments are atmospheric co2 exchange at the air water interface and groundwater input of dic however their explanation did not consider the process of carbon transformation our study indicates that 1 the majority of tco2 in the studied water comes from soil biogenic co2 rather than limestone dissolution 2 submerged plants and algae formation through aquatic photosynthesis probably use larges amount of co2 from the dic rather than the atmospheric co2 directly and 3 aquatic photosynthesis in karst water can produce not only organic matter but also carbonate through the reactions shown by reactions 7 and 8 the carbon buried through this process is considered as a carbon sink nevertheless our study illustrates that a strong biological pump effect in terrestrial surface waters should be considered as another important natural carbon sink similar to the atmospheric co2 removal into the oceans ducklow et al 2001 passow and carlson 2012 in addition the 14c ages of submerged plants are on the order of several hundreds and thousands of years this means that plant remains from lake sediments and peat mires especially in karst regions may have initial 14c ages 14c dating of aquatic plants should be done with caution 5 conclusions variations in hydrochemical data δ13c and d14c values of dic poc and plants in maolan spring pond system during january 27 28 july 24 25 and october 24 25 of 2013 have been studied influences of soil respiration adding co2 carbonate dissolution co2 degassing and exchange with atmospheric co2 co3 2 hco3 ratio change aquatic photosynthesis and respiration and mixing of detrital carbon on temporal and spatial variations in δ13c and d14c values of dic poc and plants have been discussed our understanding of the carbon source and processes in the karst water system can be summarized as follows 1 co2 produced by respiration in soils is the major source for the dic of the spring system with higher input in the summer due to stronger biological activity under warm and wet conditions changes in soil co2 input is the major controlling factor for the variations of δ13c and d14c on seasonal or longer scales this discovery indicates that dissolution of co2 from the gas phase in soils is a significant factor in the carbon dynamic of this karst setting 2 δ13c and d14c have different behaviors during the processes of co2 degassing and exchange with atmospheric co2 co3 2 hco3 ratio change carbonate dissolution and precipitation and aquatic photosynthesis d14c is a better carbon source indicator when δ13c and d14c are enriched simultaneously in the system it reflects enhanced aquatic photosynthesis accompanied by co2 exchange with the atmospheric co2 whereas simultaneous depletion of δ13c and d14c indicates plant respiration and or organic matter decomposition diurnal variations of δ13cdic in the karst water aquatic photosynthesis and respiration have stronger influence than hydrochemical changes when the system has abundant aquatic plants the mass balance estimate based on d14cdic results indicates that the contribution of respired soil co2 to the dic in the spring may be 90 3 d14cpoc is much lower than the d14cdic value in the corresponding sites in the winter this is due to effect of spiraling that introduces exogenous poc but not attributed to dic uptake the increased d14cpoc values in warm seasons are attributed to greater algae formation which reduces the old carbon influence from the detritus 4 emerged aquatic plants use atmospheric co2 directly for organic carbon formation through photosynthesis so that the initial 14c age is small however submerged plants and algae primarily use dic to form

4936,δ13c and d14c measurements on dissolved inorganic carbon dic particulate organic carbon poc and aquatic plants from a karst spring and two spring fed ponds in laqiao maolan township libo county southeastern guizhou of china in january july and october of 2013 have been carried out to understand the roles of aquatic photosynthesis through dic uptake in surface karst waters the mean d14c and δ13c values of dic for the spring midstream pond mp and downstream pond dp are 26 36 and 13 2 6 56 and 12 3 and 0 64 and 9 2 respectively the carbon source for the dic is mainly from biogenic co2 rather than the dissolution of limestone rock as the d14c and δ13c of limestone are about 1000 and 2 respectively the enrichment trend of d14cdic and δ13cdic from the spring to the dp indicates co2 exchange between atmospheric co2 and dic because d14c and δ13c values of atmospheric co2 are ca 50 and 8 respectively the average d14cpoc values in the spring mp and dp were 325 123 and 158 respectively which are all lower than these of the dic in each reservoir the lower d14c values of the poc may be caused by older soil carbon from surface runoff and dust fall more aquatic algae were formed through photosynthesis in the stream ponds especially in summer shown by strongly increased d14cpoc and evidence of growth in eds sem analyses furthermore the d14c values of the submerged aquatic plants range from 153 to 26 reflecting that the aquatic plants used dic for photosynthesis the d14c value of an emergent plant which uses atmospheric co2 during photosynthesis is 52 5 0 3 equivalent to the atmospheric d14c seasonal variations of d14cdic and δ13cdic are influenced by soil co2 input primary productivity in the ponds and co2 exchange hydrochemical condition show lower d14c values but higher δ13c values in cold dry season and vice versa in summer rainy season a simple mass balance calculation indicates 90 of carbon for the spring dic is from biogenic co2 with higher contribution in summer due to higher productivity although this simple calculation may overestimate the biogenic co2 it indicates that organic decomposition is a major carbon source for dic in the karst hydrological system the results of the present study have implications for 14c dating on aquatic plant remains regional and perhaps global carbon budgets and the different behaviors of 13c and 14c in karst systems keywords karst surface water dic poc stable carbon isotope radiocarbon aquatic photosynthesis 1 introduction sourced from watershed inputs and influenced by fluvial processes sun et al 2015 riverine input of dissolved and particulate carbons to oceans can play an important role in regional and global carbon budgets meybeck 1982 degens et al 1991 marwick et al 2015 xue et al 2017 ge et al 2020 for most rivers dissolved inorganic carbon dic that is dominated by bicarbonate ion comes mainly from chemical weathering of carbonates and silicates in their drainage basins there are complex processes involved in the dic cycling in river systems including oxidation of organic matter precipitation or dissolution of carbonates co2 exchange with the atmosphere and photosynthesis buhl et al 1991 aucour et al 1999 sun et al 2011 liu et al 2017 falkowski and raven 2007 estimated that approximately 50 of the photosynthesis on earth occurs in aquatic environments therefore aquatic carbon fixation is particularly relevant in the regulation of the global carbon cycles the role of ocean aquatic photosynthesis in the uptake of co2 and or hco3 has been studied intensively e g falkowski 1997 cassar et al 2004 tortell et al 2008 on the other hand the role of terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis in the co2 uptake is more complicated and less studied how does terrestrial aquatic photosynthesis utilize dic to form the autochthonous organic carbon and what is the carbon budget of terrestrial aquatic systems in global carbon cycles because karst water system contains abundant dic in natural waters carbon sources and their transformation as well as aquatic photosynthesis are particularly important in regional carbon budgets liu et al 2010 2015 liu 2013 liu and dreybrodt 2015 in studies of the xijiang river and its tributaries in a karst area of sw china sun et al 2011 2015 pointed out that the fractions transformed from carbonate sourced dic through photosynthesis of aquatic organisms ranged from 3 4 to 20 5 in the rainy season and from 12 3 to 22 1 in the dry season implying an important sink of atmospheric co2 in river systems however the process of transformation from dic into organic carbon in karst water is still poorly understood carbon isotopes are often used for tracing carbon sources and isotopic fractionations among phases and or materials in natural water systems e g taylor and fox 1996 yang et al 1996 atekwana and krishnamurthy 1998 amiotte suchet et al 1999 aucour et al 1999 das et al 2005 han et al 2010 kanduč et al 2012 tsypin and macpherson 2012 zhao et al 2015a however using only δ13c in tracing carbon sources often encounters problems associated with source and process overlaps raymond and bauer 2001a radiocarbon isotope 14c has a much greater dynamic range 1000 to 200 compared to δ13c 40 to 2 and offers a particularly powerful tracer of the origin of c pools and their cycling within aquatic ecosystems raymond et al 2004 sun et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 ishikawa et al 2015 liu et al 2017 thus combining δ13c and d14c values in different carbon species dic poc dissolved organic carbon doc and plants can certainly provide much more detailed information on the source age residence time and transformation of carbon in an aquatic system and can overcome problems associated with source overlap raymond and bauer 2001a 2001b 2001c the present study uses stable and radioactive carbon isotopes 13c 14c of dic poc and aquatic plants in a karst aquatic system in southwestern china for identifying carbon sources and processes of carbon transformation this study aims to identify the contribution of aquatic photosynthesis in the carbon cycle of this setting 2 study site located in libo county of guizhou province in sw china maolan national reserve is well known for its dense virgin evergreen forests growing on cone karst and is listed by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco as a world nature heritage site libo karst one of the three clusters of south china karst whc unesco org fig 1 with a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual rainfall in the virgin forest area is about 1750 mm nearly 80 of precipitation occurring in the monsoon season from april to september and the annual mean air temperature is about 17 c zhou 1987 the lithology in this area is mainly dolomitic limestone of middle and lower carboniferous age jiang et al 2008 liu et al 2007 han et al 2010 chen et al 2014 soils in the study area are relatively thin and discontinuous with thickness of 30 40 cm often existing in rock fractures however a unique natural complexity of karst forest appears in this karst geomorphological setting under subtropical monsoons zhou 1987 the forest contains mixed deciduous broadleaved trees which form a stable ecosystem maolan spring is a ca hco3 type epikarst spring with flow rates that vary from 0 05 to 3 l s during the year liu et al 2007 it is situated at the base of a cone karst slope that is covered by virgin karst forest fig 2 shows full views of the spring channel and the receiving ponds mp midstream pond and dp downstream pond a large quantity of submerged plants chiefly hydrilla verticillata grows in mp in the spring some submerged plants chiefly charophyta exist whereas no submerged plants appear in dp weirs were built to control spring and pond outflows the weir for the spring was built in 2002 for long term monitoring of water stage and flow calculation liu et al 2007 whereas the weirs for mp and dp were built in 2004 but have only been monitored since 2011 liu et al 2015 water from the spring at the monitoring site fig 1d flows into a channel and enters a small pool fig 2 spring channel then enters the mp the distance from the spring outlet and mp is 38 m the water chemistry and flow rate of the spring were monitored at the spring outlet fig 1d all water poc and plant samples for the spring were also collected at the site shown in fig 1d the volume of the spring reservoir is rather small with 0 5 2 m in area and 0 5 m deep which approximately yields a volume 0 5 m3 the average spring discharge was 0 6 l s in january 2 l s in july and 0 9 l s in october with relatively stable flow rates during each month the areas of mp and dp were 280 m2 and 1300 m2 respectively the water depth of mp is shallow so that its volume is much smaller about 60 m3 than that of dp nearly 1300 m3 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2015 the spring and pond setting is an ideal natural monitoring system for study of carbon cycle and transformation in surface karst water water from the spring enters the mp and dp directly with very short residence time the ponds have the same environment no other underground flows enter the ponds although the influence of surface runoff and direct rainfall on the hydrological system was not quantified there was no rainfall recorded during the sampling dates in the rainy season water chemistry of dp may be buffered by its large size compared to the mp using the fore mentioned spring flow rates we can estimate the water residence time in mp was 28 h in january 8 h in july and 19 h in october considering no evaporation and other inputs for dp the estimated residence time was 25 days in january 7 5 days in july and 17 days in october the above estimation indicates that water residence time in mp was much shorter than that in dp so that the effects of environmental influence on water chemistry and biological activity between mp and dp are different 3 methods 3 1 sample collection and pretreatment measurements of hydrochemical parameters flow rate temperature ph conductivity dissolved oxygen and ions and collections of samples dic poc plants from the spring and the two spring fed ponds were conducted during 27 28 january winter 24 25 july summer and 24 25 october autumn of 2013 water samples for δ13cdic and d14cdic were collected in pre cleaned evacuated 60 ml glass vials with no air space one drop of saturated hgcl2 solution was added to each sample to prevent microbial activity and samples were kept at 4 c in the laboratory until analysis the preserved samples for δ13cdic and d14cdic analyses were acidified with pure phosphoric acid raymond et al 2004 and then evolved co2 was purified on a vacuum extraction line after cryogenic removal of h2o using a liquid nitrogen ethanol trap water samples were filtered by a vacuum filtration device through 0 7 μm whatman gf f filter papers 47 mm in diameter which were pre weighed after combustion at 450 c for 6 h the gf f filter papers were freeze dried and analyzed for poc after removing the inorganic carbon by reaction with hcl fumes in the state key laboratory of environmental geochemistry eg lab at the institute of geochemistry chinese academy of science guiyang the treated poc samples on the papers were then combusted with cuo powder and ag wire at 850 c in an evacuated 9 mm quartz tube in the accelerator mass spectrometer ams radiocarbon dating laboratory of the national taiwan university ntuams lab yields of co2 were quantified using an absolute pressure gauge on a vacuum extraction line and aliquots were taken for d14c measurements by ams at ntuams lab and for δ13c measurements by irms in the eg lab plant samples collected from the spring and mp were pretreated in the ntuams lab following the standard 14c methods of oxford radiocarbon accelerator unit orau to ensure that any adsorbed carbon dioxide was removed brock et al 2010 samples were rinsed with distilled water and freeze dried prior to combustion and graphitization the dried samples 2 mg were then treated using the same procedures used for poc samples 3 2 in situ titration and chemical analysis field titrations were used to measure the alkalinity and ca2 of water with the aquamerck alkalinity test and hardness test since the majority of dissolved inorganic carbon species in the karst water when ph is around 8 the alkalinity measurement is close to hco3 in the karst environment ca2 and mg2 are the major ions but ca2 is 2 3 times larger than mg2 thus we use the results of the alkalinity test and hardness test as the results of hco3 and ca2 measurements the precisions for hco3 and ca2 measurements are 6 mg l and 1 mg l respectively two sets of 60 ml samples were transferred in acid washed hydroplastic bottles for chemical analysis of cations and anions after filtering through 0 45 μm millipore filters the samples for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 0 using concentrated nitric acid parameters of temperature ph electronic conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do were measured in situ by a hand held wtw 350 water quality meter with 1σ error of 2 the water samples were taken back to the eg lab to determine cation concentrations of na k ca2 and mg2 through an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes and anion concentrations of so4 2 cl and no3 by a dionex ics 90 ion chromatography all measured hydrochemical parameters are listed in tables 1 and 2 since the concentrations of k na ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 did not vary significantly for each reservoir during each sampling month table 2 lists only the average values of them from table 2 one can see ca2 is the major cation and hco3 is the major anion which is the feature of karst hydrology 3 3 calculating co2 partial pressure and calcite saturation index co2 partial pressure pco2 and the calcite saturation index sic are calculated from a geochemical model with ph temperature and concentrations of seven major ions liu et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 2015a since the host rocks in the study region are limestone and dolomite intercalated with gypsum strata ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 are the major ions with the recorded temperature and ph as well as the measured ion concentrations calculations of pco2 and sic were processed through the program watspec wigley 1977 based on the following equations 1 pco 2 hco 3 h k 1 k co2 2 si c log ca 2 co 3 2 k c where k1 kco2 and kc are the equilibrium constants for carbonic acid h2co3 co2 and calcite dissolution respectively if sic 0 water is supersaturated with respect to calcite and if sic 0 water is undersaturated the calculated pco2 and sic values are listed in table 1 3 4 continuous monitoring of daily variations in hydrochemical conditions diurnal cycles of the 3 water bodies were monitored in 3 seasons in situ hydrochemical parameters temperature ph ec and do were measured every 15 min using a wtw 350i multiline p3 automated device two to three water samples for δ13cdic analyses were collected over the course of a day table 3 lists the hydrochemical parameters corresponding to the δ13cdic samples the monitoring device wtw for the dp was broken at 14 00 pm in the afternoon of 10 25 2013 so that there was no hydrochemical record for the last five δ13cdic samples of the dp in table 3 3 5 carbon isotopic analysis poc and plant samples were combusted by the method described in section 3 1 and the purified co2 was sealed in a glass tube for δ13c measurement the δ13cdic δ13cpoc and δ13cplant were determined on a mat 252 mass spectrometer with dual inlet in the eg lab results are in tables 3 and 4 relative to v pdb and have 0 15 1σ precision the purified co2 of dic poc and plant samples for d14c measurements were placed on the graphitization line under vacuum of 10 3 mbar in the ntuams lab when exposed to 400 mg zn at 450 c for reaction the co2 was reduced to graphite with fe fe c 3 5 1 under 550 c for 6 8 h graphite samples were pressed into targets and measured for their 14c 12c and 13c 12c ratios with a 1 0 mv tandetron model 4110 bo ams made by high voltage engineering europa b v hvee in the ntuams lab each batch of sample targets was run with three targets of oxalic acid standards oxii 4900c three targets of carbonate backgrounds ntub and two targets of inter comparison samples all standard background and inter comparison targets were processed with the same procedures as the sample targets all reported d14c values were corrected for carbon isotopic fractionation using δ13c values of the samples measured with 14c by the ams stuiver and polach 1977 the ams 14c counting statistical error for oxii is generally 0 5 and all ams 14c dates are listed in table 4 3 6 scanning electron microscopy sem structures and elemental contents of some poc samples were analyzed by an oxford instruments field emission scanning electron microscope sem with an emax energy eds system in the department of geosciences at national taiwan university the images and chemical compositions of some algae particles can be detected by the eds sem the results are shown in fig 12 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry of the spring pond system table 1 shows the values of the measured water temperature ph ec do ca2 hco3 and δ13cdic as well as the calculated pco2 and sic values in january july and october at each site data measured and samples collected from the different months represent hydrochemical conditions corresponding to soil activity and primary productivity in the study site under typical climatic conditions of different seasons being january for winter july for summer and october for autumn respectively the measured results in table 2 indicate that ca2 and hco3 are the major cation and anion which come from dissolution of limestone and soil carbonate so that the karst water system belongs to ca hco3 type these ions dominate the changes of the electrical conductivity ec shown by strong positive correlations between hco3 and ec fig 3a and by generally positive trends for ca2 and ec fig 3b previous studies have demonstrated that such positive correlations commonly exist in the karst water of the study area chen et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 2015a hence variations of the measured ec can reflect changes in hco3 concentration of the karst water fig 3 shows that ca2 and hco3 concentrations in the spring pool are generally higher than these in mp and dp and the variation of ca2 and hco3 concentrations in mp are much larger than these in dp this is because the ca2 and hco3 concentrations are affected by dilution caco3 precipitation depending on buffering capacity of the carbonate system atmospheric exchange and biological productivity to a different extent for each site in the study area rainy season is in the summer but no rain event occurred during the sampling dates so that dilution from surface runoff might be small in fact if dilution effect caused lower concentrations of ca2 and hco3 in the spring fed ponds one would see lower ca2 and hco3 concentrations in july especially in the mp however this was not the case table 1 since the input water of mp and dp came mainly from the spring co2 degassing of the water will increase ph which might lead to caco3 precipitation and decrease of ca2 and hco3 biological uptake of co2 in mp and dp may further reduce the tco2 i e total co2 including dissolve co2 gas hco3 and co3 2 ions the consequence of those processes can be seen by changes in ph sic and pco2 shown in figs 4 and 5 in figs 4a and 5d f the spring always has the lowest ph consequently the calculated pco2 in the spring is higher than these in mp and dp and sic is generally lower fig 4b the monitoring results also indicate that the spring water temperature 2 c variation and ec 10 variation remained relatively constant through the year fig 5 reflecting a relatively uniform source water the summer spring water 7 24 25 2013 has the lowest ph and the highest pco2 with an unsaturated sic value 0 table 1 probably because higher subsurface biological activity in soil during the summer added additional co2 as indicated by the more negative value for δ13c the above observations provide the following basic information 1 the spring has relatively stable hydrochemical conditions over the course of the year with stable water temperature the lowest ph highest ec as well as ca2 and hco3 concentrations and high pco2 2 seasonally there is a higher subsurface co2 contribution to the spring water during the summer causing lower ph higher pco2 and unsaturated sic 3 the absence of significant diurnal changes suggests very low biological activity and caco3 precipitation occur in the spring pool and 4 from the spring to mp and dp loss of co2 from degassing caco3 precipitation and biological uptake change the hydrochemical conditions and isotopic composition of the dic in the water based on these observations and carbon isotope values we will discuss the carbon source and transformation processes changes in the hydrochemical parameters and carbon isotopic compositions of mp and dp should have the similar trends and processes considering that they have the same source water and environmental conditions however as mentioned above the volume and depth of mp are much smaller than that of dp so that the water residence time of mp is much shorter than that of dp in mp abundant submerged plants dominated by chara fragilis exist whereas fewer aquatic plants exist in the spring and dp fig 2 and as shown by the diurnal changes the primary productivity in mp is much stronger than that in dp fig 5 the diurnal hydrochemical variations of mp and dp fig 5 will help in understanding controlling factors on the daily variations of dic during these monitoring days there was no rainfall event to directly affect the hydrological condition the ph is positively correlated with the water temperature the ec varied negatively with t and ph the variation patterns are similar in all seasons so that one should not expect variation of seasonal soil co2 input to cause such changes these daily changes should largely depend on co2 degassing caco3 precipitation aquatic photosynthesis and respiration influenced by water temperature and sunlight de montety et al 2011 chen et al 2014 yang et al 2015 as calculated earlier the water residence time of sp mp and dp were 1 h 8 28 h and 7 25 days respectively with much shorter time in july one should consider the water replacement in mp the water temperature increased from morning to late afternoon and then decreased continuously to the next morning as water temperature increases co2 degassing and caco3 precipitation increase consequently ph increases and ec mainly hco3 and ca2 decreases aquatic photosynthesis increases during the daytime while aquatic respiration occurs during the nighttime the former process will take up co2 and the latter process will release co2 compared to dp the large variations of ph and ec in mp should be caused by much stronger aquatic photosynthesis and respiration in the smaller water body the daily hydrochemical variation also provides insight to the changes in carbon isotopic composition 4 2 δ13cdic variation in the karst water system dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the spring comes primarily from co2 released by organic matter oxidation and limestone bedrock dissolution in the subsurface the dic of the spring water is the main supply of the dic in mp and dp as water flows to mp and dp co2 degassing caco3 precipitation aquatic photosynthesis and respiration and surface runoff dilution can affect the dic concentration and carbon isotopic fractionation in a study of dic behavior and δ13cdic in three karst water catchments of guizhou zhao et al 2015a summarized the factors influencing dic concentration and δ13cdic including 1 carbonate bedrock dissolution and caco3 precipitation relative to water residence time which is controlled by rates of groundwater flow geomorphology and initial ph of surface water 2 soil co2 input controlled by vegetation soil coverage and thickness and land use 3 exchange with atmospheric co2 and 4 aquatic plant photosynthesis and respiration in the water system δ13cdic variations in the sp mp and dp during each sampling period fig 6 show several characteristics first δ13cdic values in the spring were lower than mp and dp during all sampling periods second δ13cdic values in all 3 settings were lower in july and october and the highest in january third δ13cdic generally co varies with ph in each reservoir showing lower δ13cdic corresponding to lower ph fig 7 this finding agrees well with the results of zhao et al 2015a the above observations indicate that 1 assuming that decaying vegetation releases δ13cdic with 25 and the limestone is near 0 dic input to the spring comes mainly from soil co2 rather than limestone bedrock dissolution 2 groundwater input to mp and dp is negligible and their dic is mainly from the spring 3 dilution of tco2 by surface water runoff rainfall to the karst water system is minor 4 the δ13c of the source water is controlled by the soil co2 input which is the major factor influencing seasonal δ13cdic in each reservoir with lower δ13c in the summer rainy season 5 the large diurnal variations of ph ec sic and pco2 in mp indicate that aquatic photosynthesis respiration is much more important for the carbonate system than co2 degassing caco3 precipitation in mp however since the water residence time in mp is close to one day part of the variations in mp is caused by inflow of spring water into the pond the observation 4 can be demonstrated by the strong correlation of δ13cdic ph in the spring fig 8a the dominance of aquatic photosynthesis and respiration in mp reflects its abundant aquatic plant community considering hco3 is the dominating ion in tco2 we use a plot of δ13cdic 1 hco3 to illustrate the influence of aquatic photosynthesis fig 8b shows that a strong correlation in mp indicates the effect of photosynthesis although the relation may also be influenced by carbonate precipitation and co2 escape to the atmosphere the average δ13cdic values with sample standard deviations for january 27 28 2013 in the spring mp and dp were 11 18 0 11 7 84 0 94 and 7 95 0 18 respectively table 3 in general δ13c of soil co2 in guizhou ranges from 20 to 24 unpublished data the spring water tco2 should be a mixture of carbon released by soil respiration and dissolution of the carbonate bedrock assuming an average δ13c of soil gas co2 in the study area is 22 the carbon isotopic fractionation at 20 c will lead to 8 5 increase as it dissolves to become hco3 chacko et al 2001 so that the dic in the surface water supplied from vadose zone respiration to the spring should have a δ13c value around 13 5 carbonate dissolution in the soil and through limestone bedrock along the passageway to the spring is a second source carbon isotopes in marine limestone and dolostone have been reported to range from 1 to 2 clark and fritz 1997 so δ13c of the dic from limestone dissolution should be around 1 chacko et al 2001 the measured δ13cdic of the spring is 11 18 using the following simple mass balance equation we can calculate the percentages of dic from soil co2 f1 and limestone dissolution f2 3 δ m carbon isotope of the carbon mixture f 1 δ 1 f 2 δ 2 4 f 1 f 2 1 where δm δ13cdic δ13c of the dic in the spring 11 18 δ1 13 5 and δ2 1 the carbon fraction from limestone dissolution is about 18 6 whereas the carbon fraction from soil co2 is 81 4 this mass balance calculation is quite different from the view implied by reaction 5 that would suggest dic contribution in the karst water should come from an equal mixture of limestone dissolution and oxidized organic material hendy 1971 5 h 2 co 3 caco 3 ca 2 2 hco 3 if this was the case then the δ13c of the spring water would be 7 25 in fact many cave studies show that soil co2 is a major source of total co2 in cave and epi karst waters and lighter δ13c of cave and epi karst waters in the summer is due to more contribution of soil co2 e g li et al 2011 2012 zhao et al 2015a the δ13cdic measurements of the spring pool indicates that the 18 6 contribution of carbonate dissolution is very likely under cooler water temperature and longer water residence time in the seepage path during the dry winter season high temperature in the rainy season leads to increased biomass productivity strong root respiration and organic decomposition providing more soil co2 with low δ13c atkin et al 2000 on the other hand fast flow rate of seepage water reduces groundwater residence times resulting in decreased carbonate dissolution per ml zhao et al 2015a the average δ13cdic value of the spring in july 24 25 was 15 11 0 11 with the lowest ph negative sic and the highest pco2 confirming the above interpretations again using 22 for the δ13c of soil gas co2 and 30 c for the summer temperature the carbon isotopic fractionation between hco3 aq and co2 g can be estimated chacko et al 2001 6 1000 lnα hco3 aq and co2 g 0 0945 t c 10 41 an enrichment of 7 55 should exist from soil co2 to hco3 in the seepage water thus the estimated δ13c of the seepage water should be about 15 as the measured δ13cdic value of the spring is 15 11 0 11 it means that carbon contribution of limestone bedrock dissolution in the summer is minor if there is apparent co2 degassing and or limestone bedrock dissolution in the seepage water its δ13cdic value should become heavier caco3 precipitation in the spring during july 24 25 was unlikely because sic 0 the average δ13cdic value of the spring in october 24 25 was 12 42 0 39 n 20 a similar estimation of the carbon contribution from soil co2 is 90 comparing the δ13cdic values between the spring and dp during the three sampling periods about 3 enrichment in the δ13cdic occurred from the spring to dp in each period and the variation patterns of the δ13cdic in the two reservoirs were very similar fig 7 the 3 enrichment can only be explained by the following processes 1 co2 degassing 2 co2 exchange between dic and the atmospheric co2 3 increase co3 2 hco3 ratio due to ph increase 4 aquatic photosynthesis and 5 carbonate dissolution since other processes such as caco3 precipitation aquatic respiration and organic decomposition lead to δ13cdic depletion process 5 is unlikely because the sic values for dp are 0 table 1 processes 1 to 3 occur simultaneously but have different degrees of influences on carbon isotopic fractionation co2 degassing leads to 12c preferentially entering the atmosphere and pco2 decrease in the water which results in ph increase and sic rise the increased ph will further elevate the co3 2 hco3 ratio in the water that is process 3 to have about 1 enrichment of δ13cdic palmer et al 2001 the ph increase and pco2 decrease from the spring to the spring fed ponds support the processes 1 and 3 process 2 co2 exchange between the dic of the karst water and the atmospheric co2 is happening all the time as the δ13c of escaping co2 gas about 22 in the spring is lighter than the δ13c of atmospheric co2 8 process 2 will lead to enrichment of δ13cdic in the karst water however equilibrium co2 exchange would not affect ph of the karst water nevertheless the influences of processes 1 to 3 on the δ13cdic change from the spring to the spring fed ponds can happen simultaneously using δ13c only it is difficult to identify the relative importance of processes 1 to 3 aquatic photosynthesis respiration is an important process influencing isotopic composition de montety et al 2011 pointed out that photosynthesis and respiration of aquatic plants are the dominant processes controlling in stream diel isotopic variation in daytime a simultaneous increase of δ13cdic and decrease of dic indicates that photosynthesis is a primary control on dic concentrations liu et al 2015 yang et al 2015 fig 8 shows that correlation of δ13cdic and ph in mp was not very strong fig 8a but correlation of δ13cdic and 1 hco3 in mp was rather strong fig 8b indicating the influence of biological activity on the isotopic signal in mp in this karst water system biological activity was relatively weak in the spring and dp so that the influence of aquatic photosynthesis and respiration on their δ13cdic was negligible especially in winter time however diurnal variations of the δ13cdic of the spring and dp during the october sampling period show some modest variation in both spring and dp reservoirs fig 7c those variations in the δ13cdic may not be attributed to aquatic photosynthesis and respiration in the water bodies instead the variations may be caused by the δ13c changes from the input water to the spring fig 9 shows that the δ13cdic of the spring and dp do not co vary perfectly with their ph ec and do through time since the dic of the spring comes mainly from the soil co2 its δ13cdic variation may reflect δ13c change in the soil water for example the decreased δ13cdic during the night of october 24 might be attributed to low δ13c of soil water due to plant respiration shown by low do and low ph fig 9 in general aquatic photosynthesis using co2 of dic and producing oxygen will increase ph co3 2 hco3 ratio and sic this reduces pco2 and ec if caco3 precipitates gattuso et al 1999 the δ13cdic of the water should increase as organic carbon formation preferentially uptakes 12c yang et al 1996 aquatic plant respiration has the opposite effects therefore if aquatic photosynthesis and respiration is significant one should see above correlations among δ13cdic ph do sic pco2 and ec fig 10 demonstrates these correlations among δ13cdic ph do sic pco2 and ec in mp where abundant aquatic plants exist during daytime aquatic plants uptake co2 aq for photosynthesis facilitating precipitation of calcite at night on the other hand respiration becomes the major process and produces co2 in the water that can cause the dissolution of calcite aquatic photosynthesis and respiration can be described by the following simplified reactions 7 ca 2 2hco 3 caco 3 x co 2 h 2 o 1 x ch 2 o o 2 daytime 8 6h 2 o 6co 2 c 6 h 12 o 6 6o 2 9 caco 3 co 2 h 2 o ca 2 2hco 3 night 10 c 6 h 12 o 6 6o 2 6h 2 o 6co 2 as discussed before respiration in soil affects the δ13c ph ec and do of the source water bedrock dissolution co2 degassing exchange with the atmosphere change of co3 2 hco3 ratio caco3 precipitation aquatic photosynthesis respiration and all these can influence δ13cdic however these factors have different time scales and depend on biological conditions fig 10 shows that change of soil respiration is the major factor controlling δ13cdic and hydrochemistry on seasonal or longer time scales with low δ13c ph and do but high ec and pco2 in summer in winter both soil respiration and aquatic biological activity are less apparent changes in hydrochemical condition become dominant factors the δ13cdic of mp increased with increased water temperature ph co3 2 hco3 ratio and photosynthesis during daytime the situation reversed during night time fig 10 in addition when biological activity is strong the effect of co2 degassing becomes minor for instance co2 degassing should reach a maximum at noon on 10 25 2013 but the highest δ13cdic appeared at 16 00 showing influence of photosynthesis on the δ13cdic 4 3 d14c signatures of dic in the karst water system d14c expresses the 14c 12c ratio as pmc 1 1000 where pmc denotes fraction of modern carbon which is defined as the atmospheric 14c in 1950 ce in 1950 ce pmc 1 and d14c 0 for a sample older than 60 ka its pmc is close to zero and d14c 1000 owing to nuclear weapon testing in the atmosphere its d14c reached to 800 in 1964 then started to decrease primarily due to dilution as it mixed with other carbon reservoirs including the terrestrial biosphere the upper ocean and fossil fuel co2 input in 2013 the atmospheric d14c was about 40 in north hemisphere hua et al 2013 plants grown in land will have d14c values similar to that of the atmospheric co2 an emerged plant sparganium stoloniferum in table 4 has d14c of 52 5 0 3 which can represent the atmospheric d14c in the study site although 14c may be somewhat higher in the soil carbon pool that is decaying if soil co2 is completely from decomposition of organic carbon including plants and animals which has the same d14c value as the atmospheric d14c its d14c is about 40 considering dic of the spring water comes from soil co2 and carbonate dissolution in the soil and along the seepage pass way one may simply estimate the fractions of the two endmembers by the eqs 3 and 4 to make the model simple we do not consider the selective oxidation of young or old organic carbon which could affect the 14c mass balance the d14cdic values of the spring in january july and october of 2013 were 68 8 2 2 average of 22 5 and 18 1 and 28 8 respectively table 4 giving δ1 40 soil co2 and δ2 1000 limestone rock then the contribution of soil co2 to the dic in the spring in the january july and october were 90 96 and 93 respectively the percentage of limestone dissolution was 10 if the d14c of the soil co2 is smaller than the atmospheric d14c then the estimated contribution of limestone dissolution should be even smaller the mass balance calculation of the d14c supports the result of the δ13cdic nevertheless estimation by the d14cdic shows the co2 contribution from carbonate dissolution to the dic in the karst water system is 10 and the contribution of soil co2 or carbonate dissolution is higher or lower in the summer time the co2 of the dic is mainly from soil co2 this result may provide constraints for radiocarbon dating of stalagmite samples li et al 2015 yin et al 2017 zhao et al 2015b 2017 compared to the spring the d14cdic values of mp and dp should be higher more positive because co2 exchange with the atmosphere allows d14cdic to approach the atmospheric d14c the d14cdic values of mp and dp are complicated as shown in table 4 and fig 11 sometimes the d14cdic values of the ponds were higher than these of the spring but sometimes they were lower as discussed before co2 degassing co2 exchange with the atmosphere increased co3 2 hco3 ratio and photosynthesis will lead to increased δ13cdic and caco3 precipitation and respiration will cause δ13cdic decrease among these processes only co2 exchange with the atmosphere and respiration will influence d14cdic co2 exchange with the atmosphere always leads to increased d14cdic the influence of respiration on d14cdic depends on the co2 input from the respiration if the co2 input from the respiration has a d14c value higher than the d14cdic of the water the mixture will have higher d14cdic otherwise the mixture will have lower d14cdic normally respiration of terrestrial plants should provide a higher d14c value but respiration of aquatic plants might not it is interesting that the samples taken from both mp and dp in the mornings had lower d14cdic with lower δ13cdic do and sic values but high pco2 whereas the samples taken in the afternoons had higher d14cdic with relatively high δ13cdic do and sic values but low pco2 table 3 and fig 10 the results clearly demonstrate the influence of co2 exchange with the atmosphere accompanied by co2 degassing and aquatic respiration since the aquatic respiration caused both d14cdic and δ13cdic decreases especially in the summer time one may expect that the d14c of the co2 decomposed from organic carbon is relatively low however whether the decomposed organic carbon which had low d14c comes from soil or in the aquatic system is unclear the downstream pond should have weak aquatic respiration but both d14cdic and δ13cdic during the july sampling period show strong depletion reflecting a significant amount of organic carbon decomposed therefore it is possible that the co2 of respiration may come from older soil carbonate dissolution should not cause the δ13cdic decrease so it cannot be the mechanism to explain the decreased d14cdic especially in july and october 4 4 d14c of poc in the karst water system poc samples in this study were collected through 0 7 μm whatman gf f filter papers 47 mm in diameter and consist of suspended particles in water sample weights are generally a few mg the suspended particles include algae formed in the water and detritus from aeolian dust and surface runoff since the algae are only a few μm in size it is impossible to separate enough algae particles for ams 14c measurements therefore the d14cpoc value is for the total organic carbon toc of a poc sample the average d14cpoc values in the spring mp and dp during january 27 28 2013 were 353 223 average of 175 and 270 6 and 256 average of three poc values respectively with a total average of 261 77 n 6 much lower than d14cdic values for dic in the corresponding sites table 4 and fig 11 it is not surprising that d14cpoc value of surface fresh water is lower than the atmospheric d14c for instance kao and liu 1996 found that an average d14c value of poc samples from lanyang hsi lanyang river was 875 the d14cpoc values of samples from zhujiang and xijiang rivers varied from 425 to 65 and 425 to 201 respectively wei et al 2010 sun et al 2011 liu et al 2017 this is probably due to old organic carbon from detrital input through aerosol and surface runoff ishikawa et al 2012 pointed out that the primary production in surface water transfers 14c depleted carbon from carbonated rock into stream ecosystem food webs liu et al 2017 also pointed out that poc is older than dic in the zhujiang river consistent with a reservoir effect associated with poc spiraling suspension re deposition in streams and rivers the absolute ages of dic and poc in riverine systems are influenced by the geomorphic and hydrologic variations in different watersheds besides poc spiraling suspension re deposition reason co2 exchange with atmosphere is another reason for the d14cpoc the d14cdic in the corresponding sites dic in the surface water can have strong co2 exchange with atmosphere whereas poc cannot have co2 exchange with the atmosphere theoretically if all poc were formed throughout photosynthesis by taking up dissolved co2 in the water endogenous their d14c values would be close to the d14cdic in the corresponding sites however all d14cpoc are much lower than the d14cdic in the corresponding sites indicating the majority of poc comes exogenously from detritus during the winter primary productivity is low so that algae production can be also low the eds sem analyses shown in fig 12a provide such evidence showing more detritus and low carbon contents in the january samples hence the poc collected in january 27 28 of 2013 contains mainly detrital carbon which has older 14c ages the d14cpoc values of the samples collected from mp and dp during july 24 25 and october 24 25 of 2013 range from 124 to 26 with an average of 74 33 n 8 this average d14cpoc value is much higher than the average d14cpoc value of the winter samples 223 68 reflecting abundant algae formed in the ponds during warm seasons the eds sem results show abundant algae and high c contents in the july from the ponds fig 12b as the d14cpoc of exogenous poc is unknown however currently we are not able to independently estimate how much poc was exogenous surface runoff and aeolian dust because all the d14cpoc values are much lower than the atmospheric d14c even in mp during the summer time our next question is whether the algae growing in the warm seasons uses dic in the ponds or not to answer this question we need to know the d14c of pure algae grown in the ponds unfortunately we are unable to separate detrital poc and algae from a sample and even if the separation is possible the amount of algae is not enough to date in the ntuams lab nevertheless the poc in the epi karst system comes mainly from exogenous source in the winter time but contains abundant algae endogenous in the spring fed ponds during the warm seasons the next section will show biological uptake of dic through aquatic photosynthesis in the epi karst system 4 5 d14c signature of aquatic plants the aquatic plants collected from the spring and mp are three submerged plants hydrilla verticillata charophyceae and spirogyra and one emerged plant sparganium stoloniferum table 4 the d14c values of the submerged plants range from 152 5 1 8 to 25 7 0 2 with an average of 87 5 57 9 n 6 all significantly lower than the d14c value 52 5 0 3 of the emerged plant which is equivalent to the local atmospheric d14c the results clearly demonstrate the submerged plants uptake their co2 from dic in the water if the submerged plants used atmospheric co2 only then their d14c values should be close to that of emerged plants nielsen 1946 determined that some plants could assimilate not only free co2 but also hco3 in fact more and more studies demonstrate that aquatic plants uptake dic for photosynthesis e g li et al 2019 blyakharchuk et al 2020 waterson and canuel 2008 showed that the proportion from dic transformation to toc in the mississippi river by aquatic photosynthesis could be 20 and 57 as revealed by lipid biomarker and δ13ctoc analyses this loss of dic will be partly transformed into organic carbon as stated in eq 7 sun et al 2011 and eventually partly buried as autochthonous organic matter liu et al 2011 this process constitutes a biological carbon pump bcp de la rocha and passow 2007 liu et al 2017 and increases the organic carbon preservation potential in the ponds liu et al 2015 as liu et al 2015 suggested if the terrestrial bcp effect is strong enough as in the case of midstream pond including both algae poc and plants there is a carbon sink by drawing co2 directly from the atmosphere to surface water this organic carbon is buried in the sediments and its storage should be better quantified in the carbon cycle models currently quantitative estimation of the dic fraction used for submerged plants during aquatic photosynthesis in the karst water system is limited by long term measurements of d14cdic in a year this study shows that the d14cdic varies during a day table 4 so that the d14cdic value used for photosynthesis of submerged plants is uncertain we cannot use the d14c values of dic and submerged plants in table 4 for a mass balance calculation however one may ask why the d14c of the submerged plants in the spring pool during october 132 5 and 152 5 was much lower than those during january 30 1 and july 25 7 in order to lower the d14c of the submerged plants either the local atmospheric d14c or the d14cdic of the spring during autumn was lower first of all the study site is a forest environment far away from urban area so there is no evidence that the local atmospheric d14c should be significantly lower second if the submerged plants used only atmospheric co2 for photosynthesis their d14c would be positive and not related to d14cdic variation our hypothesis for the lower d14c of submerged plants in the spring during october is that the submerged plants have strong co2 uptake from dic during photosynthesis and the long term d14cdic in the spring was lower during late summer to autumn due to decomposition of organic matter shown by reactions 9 and 10 both poc with d14c of 200 450 decomposition and carbonate with d14c of 1000 dissolution can contribute to low d14c co2 however we think that the organic matter decomposition should be main reason as the δ13c of the submerged plants were lower in october than those in january and july table 3 geyh et al 1998 suggested that the primary 14c sources in freshwater aquatic environments are atmospheric co2 exchange at the air water interface and groundwater input of dic however their explanation did not consider the process of carbon transformation our study indicates that 1 the majority of tco2 in the studied water comes from soil biogenic co2 rather than limestone dissolution 2 submerged plants and algae formation through aquatic photosynthesis probably use larges amount of co2 from the dic rather than the atmospheric co2 directly and 3 aquatic photosynthesis in karst water can produce not only organic matter but also carbonate through the reactions shown by reactions 7 and 8 the carbon buried through this process is considered as a carbon sink nevertheless our study illustrates that a strong biological pump effect in terrestrial surface waters should be considered as another important natural carbon sink similar to the atmospheric co2 removal into the oceans ducklow et al 2001 passow and carlson 2012 in addition the 14c ages of submerged plants are on the order of several hundreds and thousands of years this means that plant remains from lake sediments and peat mires especially in karst regions may have initial 14c ages 14c dating of aquatic plants should be done with caution 5 conclusions variations in hydrochemical data δ13c and d14c values of dic poc and plants in maolan spring pond system during january 27 28 july 24 25 and october 24 25 of 2013 have been studied influences of soil respiration adding co2 carbonate dissolution co2 degassing and exchange with atmospheric co2 co3 2 hco3 ratio change aquatic photosynthesis and respiration and mixing of detrital carbon on temporal and spatial variations in δ13c and d14c values of dic poc and plants have been discussed our understanding of the carbon source and processes in the karst water system can be summarized as follows 1 co2 produced by respiration in soils is the major source for the dic of the spring system with higher input in the summer due to stronger biological activity under warm and wet conditions changes in soil co2 input is the major controlling factor for the variations of δ13c and d14c on seasonal or longer scales this discovery indicates that dissolution of co2 from the gas phase in soils is a significant factor in the carbon dynamic of this karst setting 2 δ13c and d14c have different behaviors during the processes of co2 degassing and exchange with atmospheric co2 co3 2 hco3 ratio change carbonate dissolution and precipitation and aquatic photosynthesis d14c is a better carbon source indicator when δ13c and d14c are enriched simultaneously in the system it reflects enhanced aquatic photosynthesis accompanied by co2 exchange with the atmospheric co2 whereas simultaneous depletion of δ13c and d14c indicates plant respiration and or organic matter decomposition diurnal variations of δ13cdic in the karst water aquatic photosynthesis and respiration have stronger influence than hydrochemical changes when the system has abundant aquatic plants the mass balance estimate based on d14cdic results indicates that the contribution of respired soil co2 to the dic in the spring may be 90 3 d14cpoc is much lower than the d14cdic value in the corresponding sites in the winter this is due to effect of spiraling that introduces exogenous poc but not attributed to dic uptake the increased d14cpoc values in warm seasons are attributed to greater algae formation which reduces the old carbon influence from the detritus 4 emerged aquatic plants use atmospheric co2 directly for organic carbon formation through photosynthesis so that the initial 14c age is small however submerged plants and algae primarily use dic to form organic carbon through aquatic photosynthesis so that they may have initial 14c ages up to a few thousand years the magnitude of carbon burial related to aquatic photosynthesis in fresh water systems should be re evaluated in global carbon cycle budgets credit authorship contribution statement min zhao bo chen hao yan and rui yang conducted field work and lab work except ams 14c dating zhao and li

4937,the seasonal change in lake water storage lwssc reflect periodic fluctuations of the basin scale water balance however the role of lwssc in regulating the water budget at the global scale has not yet been investigated based on straight forward observations quantifying lwssc is necessary especially under the context of global change available in situ measurements of lake water levels and volumes are still scarce therefore the global surface water datasets of joint research centre and multi source satellite altimetry datasets through mathematical statistics methods are used in this study to address this issue we estimate the lwssc of 463 lakes and reservoirs worldwide with areas greater than 10 km2 which represent nearly 64 of the total global lake area and 93 of the total lake volume capacity results show that the global seasonal water storage variation of these examined water bodies is 1390 91 78 91 km3 comprising 869 44 67 35 km3 from lakes and 521 46 41 11 km3 from reservoirs the relatively large estimates of lwssc are concentrated in north american and african basins among the watersheds the seasonal fluctuations of lakes in the north american lawrence basin make up the most substantial magnitude of 10 76 of the global lwssc the latitudinal direction zonality of lwssc is relatively significant the lwssc is concentrated between 30 n and 60 n in the northern hemisphere and between the equator and 30 s in the southern hemisphere considering the geographic similarity and climatological zonality the global lwssc estimates are also extrapolated to other lakes without direct satellite altimetry observations on the basis of the average rate of the examined lakes distributed in the same köppen geiger climate classification zones the lwssc is calculated with a consequence of 488 23 14 72 km3 for these extrapolated lakes indicating an estimate of 1357 67 68 94 km3 for the lwssc of the global natural lakes 10 km2 this initial estimation of lwssc at a global scale will greatly help the improvement of our understanding of the seasonal behavior of lakes and reservoirs in regulating global and regional water cycles and the contribution of terrestrial water storage to sea level rise keywords seasonality lake water storage reservoir satellite altimetry water cycle landsat 1 introduction lakes are regarded as one of the most significant stores of terrestrial surface liquid water and play a crucial role in regulating regional climate balancing ecosystems and protecting biodiversity the lake water resources are also widely utilized in different human related activities such as water conservation hydropower irrigation and cultivation johnston et al 2011 wada et al 2014 zarfl et al 2015 in the past decades lakes in different regions have undergone various degrees of change because of global change williamson et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 sterling et al 2013 global warming or the rapid increase in surface temperatures has accelerated the melting of polar ice caps and the sea ice around them this phenomenon has also increased the humidity which brings more precipitation and further increases the unevenness of the distribution of lake water storage wang et al 2018 erler et al 2019 consequently changes in lakes and reservoirs are increasingly concerned and all of their morphodynamic characteristics e g water area water level and water storage are particularly observed in changing environments crétaux et al 2016 the current situation and variation trend of lake water storage is the basis for the estimation of the terrestrial water availability and becomes a particular subject for assessments of present and future water resources as a result the lake water storage change plays an important role in the global hydrological cycle and influences the hydrologic process hirschi et al 2006 yeh and famiglietti 2008 seasonal change in lake water storage lwssc is an essential element in the global or regional water budget it reflects the seasonal fluctuation of hydrological regime of lakes although lake water storage change in typical basins hirschi et al 2006 sheffield et al 2009 pan et al 2012 ehalt macedo et al 2019 hamlington et al 2019 borja et al 2020 or seasonal fluctuation of typical lakes and reservoirs gronewold and stow 2014 zhou et al 2016 borja et al 2020 has been studied previously the seasonal change of water storage in lakes and reservoirs has not yet been measured directly at the global scale at present in situ lake water storage measurements are sparse especially in developing countries duan and bastiaanssen 2013 since heterogeneous in situ networks are always poorly shared at global level biancamaria et al 2016 the global lwssc has been difficult to estimate and has not been known as a result the role of lwssc in modulating global water cycles and the contribution to sea level rise has been challenging to estimate remote sensing provides an effective and straight forward way of monitoring lakes and reservoirs in the macroscale area and has gained much attention in recent years studies on water extent monitoring have been conducted using different optical sensors and analyses of lake changes in interannual and decadal timescales du et al 2014 pekel et al 2014 yao et al 2015 feng et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 khandelwal et al 2017 yang et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 numerous studies have shown the possibility of observing water surface elevation on the basis of satellite altimetry by using different altimeter missions birkett 1995 frappart et al 2006 da silva et al 2010 schwatke et al 2015a villadsen et al 2015 zawadzki and ablain 2016 zhang et al 2019 to measure long term lake water level at the global scale recent studies have proposed altimetry datasets such as the hydroweb database established by laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos laboratory of studies in space geophysics and oceanography crétaux et al 2011 database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti schwatke et al 2015b and the us department of agriculture usda global reservoir and lake monitoring g realm datasets birkett et al 2011 consequently analyzing the lake water storage variations becomes possible through these combinations of multi satellite data and optical remote sensing images furthermore the changes in lake water storage could be estimated based on the time series of water area and water level changes lu et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 avisse et al 2017 yao et al 2019 thus estimating the global lwssc based on multi source measurements is feasible and necessary to reveal the magnitude of the seasonal water cycle in the global water budget making the lwssc spatially and temporally comprehensive monitoring lakes and reservoirs about their morphodynamic characteristics using remote sensing have been approached mentioned above however the straight forward estimation of the global lwssc using remote sensing or geospatial data sets has yet been done our objective is to employ a simple and effective method to estimate the seasonal change in lake water storage at a global scale from satellite observations here we quantify the lwssc with uncertainty estimates of global lakes and reservoirs based on the global surface water gsw datasets of the joint research centre jrc and all available altimetry level time series from hydroweb dahiti and g realm we then extrapolate the lwssc estimates to other lakes without direct satellite measurements based on the average seasonal water level variation of the examined lakes within the same climatological zones according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 we aim to advance existing understanding of the role of the seasonal behavior of lakes and reservoirs in regulating the global and regional water cycles and the contribution of terrestrial water storage to sea level rise 2 study area and data 2 1 investigated lakes and reservoirs worldwide in the study a total of 463 lakes and reservoirs with long term satellite altimetry measurements were selected to estimate the global lwssc and investigate their spatial patterns see supplementary information table s1 for attribute information of lakes and reservoirs studied fig 1 shows the locations of these lakes and reservoirs with lake area size and distribution these contained 283 natural lakes and 180 reservoirs located on every continent all the 463 large and medium sized global lakes 149 from north america 136 from asia 74 from south america 54 from africa 39 from europe 11 from oceania are over 10 km2 in size these lakes with a total area of 1393 25 thousand km2 and a total volume of 171 thousand km3 represent nearly 64 of the global lake area and 93 of the total volume capacity the information on these lakes was obtained from the hydrolakes database http www hydrosheds org messager et al 2016 2 2 study data 2 2 1 altimetry water level datasets in this study water level time series from three merged altimetry data platforms namely hydroweb dahiti and g realm databases were used as input data for the lwssc estimation established by legos the hydroweb database was a combination of topex poseidon jason 1 2 3 envisat and gfo measurements crétaux et al 2011 this database contained the time series of water level observations with a decimeter precision for 155 global lakes and reservoirs selected in this study the dahiti database was based on a widespread outlier rejection and a kalman filter approach and incorporated with cross calibrated multi mission altimeter data from topex poseidon jason 1 2 3 envisat ers 1 2 cryosat 2 and saral altika schwatke et al 2015a the dahiti database was reported to achieve more accurate height information with an rmse as low as 4 5 cm for large lakes and several decimeters for smaller lakes than the other available altimeter databases busker et al 2019 operated by usda g realm database merged topex poseidon jason 1 2 3 and envisat missions with temporal resolutions varying from 10 to 35 days birkett et al 2011 the 10 day g realm product which contains sufficient temporally data was selected in this study 2 2 2 lake and reservoir area data this study used the yearly water classification history data layer of the jrc gsw dataset pekel et al 2016 to calculate the annual maximum minimum and average surface areas of lakes and reservoirs investigated the jrc gsw dataset is a high resolution stack of images that maps the spatial and temporal distributions of surface water over the last 35 years from 1984 to 2018 this dataset was produced based on the entire image archive of the landsat 5 7 and 8 it recorded the months and years of water land cover water changes seasonality and persistence at 30 m resolution pekel et al 2016 the yearly water classification history data set provided information on the seasonality of the water year to year over the world we could distinguish seasonal water and permanent water of lake and reservoir area each year through the yearly water classification history data 3 methods 3 1 constructing water level time series of lakes first we generated monthly mean values by integrating all of the water level observations and then averaging all the measurements for each lake in each month second we filtered the surface elevation data from a combination of satellite altimeters which met the requirements of owning a time series of five consecutive years during 1992 to 2018 and surface area larger than 10 km2 finally we obtained the monthly water levels for all the study lakes and reservoirs fig 2 shows the number of observed lakes with a different number of observation years of water level a total of 92 lakes had complete altimetry time series during the study period 1992 2018 accounting for nearly 20 of the total number of studied lakes the time series of altimetry water levels for most of the study lakes 92 7 have a temporal coverage of 9 years whereas only 34 lakes had been observed for less than 9 years the median of the observed period was 13 years for the examined lakes 3 2 retrieval of annual average inundation area of lakes we used the yearly water classification history dataset a set of maps in a raster format showing annual global water land cover with surface water changes from 1984 to 2018 we examined the inundation areas of lakes and reservoirs from the 27 years dataset from 1992 to 2018 considering the time range of altimetry water level data we classified four categories in the dataset permanent water seasonal water land and no observations fig 3 we selected the seasonal and permanent water categories to calculate the annual average maximum seasonal and permanent water pixels and minimum permanent water pixels areas of each lake or reservoir on the google earth engine platform we then obtained the multi year averaged maximum and minimum lake areas by averaging the maximum and minimum lake areas recorded within the study periods as an example of the retrieval of the annual average inundation area of lakes studied we performed the sample and processing of the aral sea showed in fig 3 3 3 estimation of seasonal water storage and uncertainty in general the bottom morphology of lakes and reservoirs was assumed to be regular with a pyramidal shape abileah et al 2011 therefore the seasonal water storage variations δvi can be derived from the following equation taube 2000 1 δ h ij 1 n i n h ij max h ij min 2 δ v j δ h ij a ij max a ij min a ij max a ij min 3 where δ h ij is the multi year mean seasonal water level change defined as hmax hmin in the year i of lake j reflected the intra annual level range h ijmax is the maximum water level and h ijmin is the minimum water level from altimetry for the year i of lake j a jmax and a jmin are the multi year mean calculated maximum and minimum lake areas derived from the gsw dataset δ v j is the seasonal water storage variations of the lake j moreover the uncertainty of estimation is calculated considering the changes in surface water level the average maximum area and the minimum area of study lakes by using eq 3

maximum water surface area the minimum water surface area and the lwssc v with standard deviations stds of the target lakes and reservoirs per continent the majority of the studied lakes are located in asia and north america which make up more than 60 quantity 285 proportion 62 while the smallest target number of lakes 11 in oceania a majority of them belong to australia globally the lwssc of studied water bodies is 1390 91 78 91 km3 the north american lakes show the highest seasonal fluctuation of water storage of 435 18 42 08 km3 given that most lakes in this continent have large surface areas europe has an lwssc of approximately 311 64 48 68 km3 owing to the super large lake caspian sea assigned to europe when categorizedby continents the lakes in europe lead in terms of maximum and minimum water surface area of 462 4 12 77 thousand km2 and 459 2 11 75 thousand km2 respectively the lakes in south america 186 28 01 km3 and africa 250 15 29 19 km3 show high variability in water surface level with 4 54 1 45 m and 3 86 1 63 m respectively suggesting their complex topography and highly hydro climatological dynamic variations however the causes of seasonal fluctuations in the lakes in these two continents are not entirely identical the vast lake inundation areas have dominated the lwssc of the african water bodies frequent flooding of the major river lagoons and reservoirs in south america dominates the seasonal fluctuations accompanied by the variations in water level 4 2 analyses of the spatial characteristic of the lwssc of global lakes and reservoirs fig 4 shows the spatial distribution map of the lwssc estimates of different water bodies the lwssc are calculated with 10 latitude longitude summaries on the right and underneath panels of the global map fig 4 globally the study lakes and reservoirs show significant seasonal fluctuations the total lwssc of examined lakes and reservoirs are 869 44 67 35 and 521 46 41 11 km3 respectively considerable lwssc are distributed in the north american lakes the south american large reservoirs the eurasian lakes and the africa great rift valley lakes the caspian sea of eurasia exhibits a significant seasonal fluctuation with the largest lwssc 144 85 44 98 km3 the second largest lwssc are observed for the great rift valley lakes in africa and the great lakes in north america including malawi lake victoria lake lake superior lake michigan and lake huron the seasonal fluctuation of each lake is between 27 14 11 to 31 6 71 km3 furthermore the study reservoirs also have large lwssc guri reservoir 37 78 24 84 km3 in south america has led the largest lwssc among the analyzed reservoirs tucurui reservoir south america lake nasser africa and lake volta africa have relatively high seasonal fluctuations over 20 km3 compared withother study reservoirs the latitudinal direction zonality of lwssc can be clearly observed in fig 4 the lwssc is mainly distributed in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere a secondary lwssc peak distributed in the low latitudes is also observed around the equator the lwssc is less obvious in the middle and high latitudes of the southern hemisphere due to fewer observed lakes in this area among the investigated basins the higher magnitudes of lwssc are distributed in the mackenzie basin north america the saint lawrence basin north america the amazon basin south america the nile basin africa the caspian sea eurasia and the yenisei basin eurasia the studied lakes in the saint lawrence basin where the north american great lakes are located make up the largest proportion of nearly 11 10 76 of the global lwssc in summary the amount of lwssc is more concentrated between 30 n and 60 n of the northern hemisphere the amount of lwssc is focused between the equator and 30 s of southern hemisphere 4 3 analyses of long term lwssc estimates based on typical lakes to further reveal the change in the characteristics of lwssc throughout the study period we select five lakes and reservoirs located in different basins with considerable seasonal fluctuations and long term satellite altimetry measurements as examples to demonstrate the annual lwssc time series as shown in fig 5 the estimated lwssc of the study lakes is between the maximum and the minimum annual lwssc the caspian sea with a surface area of 0 38 million km2 is the largest lake in the world mehdinia et al 2020 this lake has exhibited a fluctuating pattern displaying the seasonally fluctuating increase in the water storage during 1992 to 2018 fig 5c this lake s estimated lwssc of 144 85 44 98 km3 is between the lower annual lwssc of 21 41 11 41 km3 and the upper annual lwssc of 227 54 89 29 km3 and close to the annual average lwssc of 135 82 62 01 km3 other estimated lwssc of typical lakes also reflected the average level of interannual fluctuations for example malawi lake at 31 45 14 57 km3 lower limit 26 63 11 01 km3 upper limit 38 14 17 93 km3 superior lake at 30 97 16 32 km3 lower limit 13 94 6 87 km3 upper limit 57 38 27 65 km3 guri reservoir at 37 78 24 84 km3 lower limit 14 41 4 83 km3 upper limit 77 93 41 45 km3 and kuybyshev reservoir at 18 76 6 29 km3 lower limit 9 19 4 39 km3 upper limit 25 23 12 58 km3 intuitively the lwssc is dependable on the seasonal changes of lake level for example the synchronous feature between the time series variation of lwssc and water level are marked as the red and blue stripes in fig 5 however the interannual variations of the lwssc do not always depend on the changing trend of water level in the long term the pattern for these examined lakes can be divided into three categories the first category includes lake superior guri reservoir and the caspian sea as the water level decreases in these bodies of water the lwssc increases especially for the caspian sea the second category is represented by the malawi lake whose water level and lwssc are increasing synchronously the third category includes the kuybyshev reservoir which is characterized by decreasing lwssc but rising water levels 5 discussion 5 1 comparison among different lwssc calculation methods in this study the seasonal amplitudes of lake water level were estimated by calculating the multi year averaged differences between intra annual maximum and minimum water levels this process was termed as the lwssc mean method we applied here the seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess stl method to decompose the time series seasonal variations of water level and compare them with the performance of lwssc estimation results used in this study the stl was a statistical method of decomposing a time series data into four components containing data display seasonality trend and residual we employed the seasonal amplitudes to replace multi year variations in water levels to calculate the lwssc this process was termed as the lwssc stl method then we picked four lakes i e tanganyika lake malawi lake huron lake and kuybyshev reservoir with diverse water level ranges and long term satellite altimetry measurements to conduct a comparison among different lwssc calculation methods the two methods used to estimate the lwssc and the annual time series of seasonal fluctuations of water storage are shown beneath the stl decomposition of water level for each lake in fig 6 generally the estimates derived from the lwssc stl method were smaller than those obtained from the lwssc mean method the lwssc stl method decomposed the high frequency noise signal and several years of periodic vibration trend although the lwssc mean method could smooth seasonal fluctuations in the trend it cannot eliminate high frequency noises and periodic variations however the lwssc of tanganyika lake 21 35 km3 malawi lake 22 19 km3 huron lake 20 73 km3 and kuybyshev reservoir 14 03 km3 calculated using the lwssc stl method were within the standard deviation range of estimates by the lwssc mean method e g tanganyika lake 24 67 8 41 km3 malawi lake 31 45 14 57 km3 huron lake 27 86 14 11 km3 and kuybyshev reservoir 18 76 6 29 km3 moreover the biases of the lwssc exhibited by the lwssc mean method for the sample lakes were within 30 compared with the result derived from the lwssc stl method no complete and regular time series of water level was used because of the absence of satellite altimetry data in many lakes therefore the lwssc mean method can still be acceptable to estimate the lwssc 5 2 estimation of the lwssc of other global lakes without direct satellite measurements given that the satellite altimetry was limited to their footprint size incomplete observations and other reasons we could not cover every lake especially those with small surface areas considering the geographic similarity and the climate regulating effect of climatological zonality on lake water storage we assumed that the lakes had relatively comparable seasonal fluctuations in the same climate zone accordingly we employed the three level classification system of köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 to estimate the lwssc of 14 333 global lakes determined by the hydrolakes database with surface areas above 10 km2 without direct altimetry satellite measurements see fig 7 for the climate area distribution we excluded the reservoirs in this estimation because the water storage changes in this body of water were regulated by human operations then we extrapolated the lwssc of the unobserved lakes on the basis of geographically and lake capacity weighted and provided a summary with the examined lakes by climate zone as shown in table 2 the maximum lwssc was found with 515 12 36 86 km3 in the df climate df for snow and fully humid together with hot summer warm summer and cool summer north american and eurasian lake groups had the most lwssc because of the abundance of lakes in the df climate zone the lakes in the df climate especially those with snow climate and fully humid with cool summer zone exhibited the maximum lwssc value of 300 83 18 54 km3 the minimum lwssc amount of 1 13 0 23 km3 observed in the as climate zone as for equatorial savannah with dry summer was due to their limited number of lakes in summary the total lwssc of examined and extrapolated lakes were 869 44 67 35 and 488 23 14 72 km3 respectively the lwssc of 283 observed lakes occupied a proportion of 64 04 compared with 1357 67 68 94 km3 which is the total occupied proportion of the lakes with surface areas above 10 km2 worldwide the number of lakes whether examined or extrapolated in this study occupied a similar proportion in each climate zone or continent therefore the estimated lwssc can be extended to global lakes as a significant reference currently the number of lakes is of large uncertainty due to their global distribution verpoorter et al 2014 this global estimate only considered lakes with the water mask above 10 km2 from the hydrolakes database the global estimate methodology could be employed to future high resolution measurements satellite missions for instance the surface water and ocean topography swot satellite mission which goals to detect lakes with an area large 250 250 m2 biancamaria et al 2016 6 conclusion this study estimated the lwssc for a total of 463 global lakes and reservoirs worldwide with inundation areas above 10 km2 by combining the jrc gsw dataset with the satellite altimetry datasets which represent nearly 64 of the global lake area and 93 of the total lake volume the lwssc of these examined water bodies was estimated at 1390 91 78 91 km3 including 869 44 67 35 km3 for natural lakes and 521 46 41 11 km3 for reservoirs the zonality in latitudinal direction of lwssc is relatively significant the amount of lwssc was more concentrated between 30 n and 60 n of the northern hemisphere the larger lwssc can be observed between the equator and 30 s of the southern hemisphere lwssc in north america great lakes made up the most substantial magnitude of nearly 11 10 76 of the seasonal water storage variations of the global lakes the basins with relatively large seasonal lake water storage variations concentrated in north america and africa had a significant seasonal fluctuation with more uncertainty we also extrapolated a total of 14 616 global lakes 10 km2 with total lwssc of 1357 67 68 94 km3 on the basis of the examined lakes within the similar climatological and hydrological zones the inadequate coverage of satellite altimetry measurements on lake water level especially for the continents oceania and africa was considered a limitation for the global lwssc estimation in this study therefore future studies are encouraged to develop different techniques to decrease the no data percentage in lake observations in the prospective study plan recently launched or planned satellite altimetry missions e g icesat 2 and swot and increasing altimetry water level databases will be a great help in improving the spatial coverage of lake water bodies and quantification accuracy of lwssc credit authorship contribution statement tan chen conceptualization data curation formal analysis

4937,the seasonal change in lake water storage lwssc reflect periodic fluctuations of the basin scale water balance however the role of lwssc in regulating the water budget at the global scale has not yet been investigated based on straight forward observations quantifying lwssc is necessary especially under the context of global change available in situ measurements of lake water levels and volumes are still scarce therefore the global surface water datasets of joint research centre and multi source satellite altimetry datasets through mathematical statistics methods are used in this study to address this issue we estimate the lwssc of 463 lakes and reservoirs worldwide with areas greater than 10 km2 which represent nearly 64 of the total global lake area and 93 of the total lake volume capacity results show that the global seasonal water storage variation of these examined water bodies is 1390 91 78 91 km3 comprising 869 44 67 35 km3 from lakes and 521 46 41 11 km3 from reservoirs the relatively large estimates of lwssc are concentrated in north american and african basins among the watersheds the seasonal fluctuations of lakes in the north american lawrence basin make up the most substantial magnitude of 10 76 of the global lwssc the latitudinal direction zonality of lwssc is relatively significant the lwssc is concentrated between 30 n and 60 n in the northern hemisphere and between the equator and 30 s in the southern hemisphere considering the geographic similarity and climatological zonality the global lwssc estimates are also extrapolated to other lakes without direct satellite altimetry observations on the basis of the average rate of the examined lakes distributed in the same köppen geiger climate classification zones the lwssc is calculated with a consequence of 488 23 14 72 km3 for these extrapolated lakes indicating an estimate of 1357 67 68 94 km3 for the lwssc of the global natural lakes 10 km2 this initial estimation of lwssc at a global scale will greatly help the improvement of our understanding of the seasonal behavior of lakes and reservoirs in regulating global and regional water cycles and the contribution of terrestrial water storage to sea level rise keywords seasonality lake water storage reservoir satellite altimetry water cycle landsat 1 introduction lakes are regarded as one of the most significant stores of terrestrial surface liquid water and play a crucial role in regulating regional climate balancing ecosystems and protecting biodiversity the lake water resources are also widely utilized in different human related activities such as water conservation hydropower irrigation and cultivation johnston et al 2011 wada et al 2014 zarfl et al 2015 in the past decades lakes in different regions have undergone various degrees of change because of global change williamson et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 sterling et al 2013 global warming or the rapid increase in surface temperatures has accelerated the melting of polar ice caps and the sea ice around them this phenomenon has also increased the humidity which brings more precipitation and further increases the unevenness of the distribution of lake water storage wang et al 2018 erler et al 2019 consequently changes in lakes and reservoirs are increasingly concerned and all of their morphodynamic characteristics e g water area water level and water storage are particularly observed in changing environments crétaux et al 2016 the current situation and variation trend of lake water storage is the basis for the estimation of the terrestrial water availability and becomes a particular subject for assessments of present and future water resources as a result the lake water storage change plays an important role in the global hydrological cycle and influences the hydrologic process hirschi et al 2006 yeh and famiglietti 2008 seasonal change in lake water storage lwssc is an essential element in the global or regional water budget it reflects the seasonal fluctuation of hydrological regime of lakes although lake water storage change in typical basins hirschi et al 2006 sheffield et al 2009 pan et al 2012 ehalt macedo et al 2019 hamlington et al 2019 borja et al 2020 or seasonal fluctuation of typical lakes and reservoirs gronewold and stow 2014 zhou et al 2016 borja et al 2020 has been studied previously the seasonal change of water storage in lakes and reservoirs has not yet been measured directly at the global scale at present in situ lake water storage measurements are sparse especially in developing countries duan and bastiaanssen 2013 since heterogeneous in situ networks are always poorly shared at global level biancamaria et al 2016 the global lwssc has been difficult to estimate and has not been known as a result the role of lwssc in modulating global water cycles and the contribution to sea level rise has been challenging to estimate remote sensing provides an effective and straight forward way of monitoring lakes and reservoirs in the macroscale area and has gained much attention in recent years studies on water extent monitoring have been conducted using different optical sensors and analyses of lake changes in interannual and decadal timescales du et al 2014 pekel et al 2014 yao et al 2015 feng et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 khandelwal et al 2017 yang et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 numerous studies have shown the possibility of observing water surface elevation on the basis of satellite altimetry by using different altimeter missions birkett 1995 frappart et al 2006 da silva et al 2010 schwatke et al 2015a villadsen et al 2015 zawadzki and ablain 2016 zhang et al 2019 to measure long term lake water level at the global scale recent studies have proposed altimetry datasets such as the hydroweb database established by laboratoire d etudes en géophysique et océanographie spatiales legos laboratory of studies in space geophysics and oceanography crétaux et al 2011 database for hydrological time series of inland waters dahiti schwatke et al 2015b and the us department of agriculture usda global reservoir and lake monitoring g realm datasets birkett et al 2011 consequently analyzing the lake water storage variations becomes possible through these combinations of multi satellite data and optical remote sensing images furthermore the changes in lake water storage could be estimated based on the time series of water area and water level changes lu et al 2013 zheng et al 2016 avisse et al 2017 yao et al 2019 thus estimating the global lwssc based on multi source measurements is feasible and necessary to reveal the magnitude of the seasonal water cycle in the global water budget making the lwssc spatially and temporally comprehensive monitoring lakes and reservoirs about their morphodynamic characteristics using remote sensing have been approached mentioned above however the straight forward estimation of the global lwssc using remote sensing or geospatial data sets has yet been done our objective is to employ a simple and effective method to estimate the seasonal change in lake water storage at a global scale from satellite observations here we quantify the lwssc with uncertainty estimates of global lakes and reservoirs based on the global surface water gsw datasets of the joint research centre jrc and all available altimetry level time series from hydroweb dahiti and g realm we then extrapolate the lwssc estimates to other lakes without direct satellite measurements based on the average seasonal water level variation of the examined lakes within the same climatological zones according to the köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 we aim to advance existing understanding of the role of the seasonal behavior of lakes and reservoirs in regulating the global and regional water cycles and the contribution of terrestrial water storage to sea level rise 2 study area and data 2 1 investigated lakes and reservoirs worldwide in the study a total of 463 lakes and reservoirs with long term satellite altimetry measurements were selected to estimate the global lwssc and investigate their spatial patterns see supplementary information table s1 for attribute information of lakes and reservoirs studied fig 1 shows the locations of these lakes and reservoirs with lake area size and distribution these contained 283 natural lakes and 180 reservoirs located on every continent all the 463 large and medium sized global lakes 149 from north america 136 from asia 74 from south america 54 from africa 39 from europe 11 from oceania are over 10 km2 in size these lakes with a total area of 1393 25 thousand km2 and a total volume of 171 thousand km3 represent nearly 64 of the global lake area and 93 of the total volume capacity the information on these lakes was obtained from the hydrolakes database http www hydrosheds org messager et al 2016 2 2 study data 2 2 1 altimetry water level datasets in this study water level time series from three merged altimetry data platforms namely hydroweb dahiti and g realm databases were used as input data for the lwssc estimation established by legos the hydroweb database was a combination of topex poseidon jason 1 2 3 envisat and gfo measurements crétaux et al 2011 this database contained the time series of water level observations with a decimeter precision for 155 global lakes and reservoirs selected in this study the dahiti database was based on a widespread outlier rejection and a kalman filter approach and incorporated with cross calibrated multi mission altimeter data from topex poseidon jason 1 2 3 envisat ers 1 2 cryosat 2 and saral altika schwatke et al 2015a the dahiti database was reported to achieve more accurate height information with an rmse as low as 4 5 cm for large lakes and several decimeters for smaller lakes than the other available altimeter databases busker et al 2019 operated by usda g realm database merged topex poseidon jason 1 2 3 and envisat missions with temporal resolutions varying from 10 to 35 days birkett et al 2011 the 10 day g realm product which contains sufficient temporally data was selected in this study 2 2 2 lake and reservoir area data this study used the yearly water classification history data layer of the jrc gsw dataset pekel et al 2016 to calculate the annual maximum minimum and average surface areas of lakes and reservoirs investigated the jrc gsw dataset is a high resolution stack of images that maps the spatial and temporal distributions of surface water over the last 35 years from 1984 to 2018 this dataset was produced based on the entire image archive of the landsat 5 7 and 8 it recorded the months and years of water land cover water changes seasonality and persistence at 30 m resolution pekel et al 2016 the yearly water classification history data set provided information on the seasonality of the water year to year over the world we could distinguish seasonal water and permanent water of lake and reservoir area each year through the yearly water classification history data 3 methods 3 1 constructing water level time series of lakes first we generated monthly mean values by integrating all of the water level observations and then averaging all the measurements for each lake in each month second we filtered the surface elevation data from a combination of satellite altimeters which met the requirements of owning a time series of five consecutive years during 1992 to 2018 and surface area larger than 10 km2 finally we obtained the monthly water levels for all the study lakes and reservoirs fig 2 shows the number of observed lakes with a different number of observation years of water level a total of 92 lakes had complete altimetry time series during the study period 1992 2018 accounting for nearly 20 of the total number of studied lakes the time series of altimetry water levels for most of the study lakes 92 7 have a temporal coverage of 9 years whereas only 34 lakes had been observed for less than 9 years the median of the observed period was 13 years for the examined lakes 3 2 retrieval of annual average inundation area of lakes we used the yearly water classification history dataset a set of maps in a raster format showing annual global water land cover with surface water changes from 1984 to 2018 we examined the inundation areas of lakes and reservoirs from the 27 years dataset from 1992 to 2018 considering the time range of altimetry water level data we classified four categories in the dataset permanent water seasonal water land and no observations fig 3 we selected the seasonal and permanent water categories to calculate the annual average maximum seasonal and permanent water pixels and minimum permanent water pixels areas of each lake or reservoir on the google earth engine platform we then obtained the multi year averaged maximum and minimum lake areas by averaging the maximum and minimum lake areas recorded within the study periods as an example of the retrieval of the annual average inundation area of lakes studied we performed the sample and processing of the aral sea showed in fig 3 3 3 estimation of seasonal water storage and uncertainty in general the bottom morphology of lakes and reservoirs was assumed to be regular with a pyramidal shape abileah et al 2011 therefore the seasonal water storage variations δvi can be derived from the following equation taube 2000 1 δ h ij 1 n i n h ij max h ij min 2 δ v j δ h ij a ij max a ij min a ij max a ij min 3 where δ h ij is the multi year mean seasonal water level change defined as hmax hmin in the year i of lake j reflected the intra annual level range h ijmax is the maximum water level and h ijmin is the minimum water level from altimetry for the year i of lake j a jmax and a jmin are the multi year mean calculated maximum and minimum lake areas derived from the gsw dataset δ v j is the seasonal water storage variations of the lake j moreover the uncertainty of estimation is calculated considering the changes in surface water level the average maximum area and the minimum area of study lakes by using eq 3 3 δ v std δ h 2 a max s t d 2 a min s t d 2 δ h std 2 a max 2 a min 2 when calculated the aggregated uncertainties we employed the error propagation law showed like the eq 4 4 δ v s t d s u m δ v s t d 1 2 δ v s t d 2 2 δ v stdj 1 2 δ v stdj 2 where δ v std is the standard deviation of estimated lwssc defined as the uncertainty of each lake δ h is the multi year mean seasonal water level change and δ h std is the mean standard deviation of multi year δ h a max and a min are the multi year mean calculated maximum and minimum lake areas derived from the gsw dataset a m a x s t d and a m i n s t d are the standard deviations of maximum and minimum lake areas in different years δ v s t d s u m is the aggregated uncertainties based on error propagation law by the eq 4 4 results 4 1 analyses of lwssc estimates by continent the lwssc of 463 water bodies lakes and reservoirs 10 km2 located in different continents are estimated table 1 provides the summary of the water level changes h the maximum water surface area the minimum water surface area and the lwssc v with standard deviations stds of the target lakes and reservoirs per continent the majority of the studied lakes are located in asia and north america which make up more than 60 quantity 285 proportion 62 while the smallest target number of lakes 11 in oceania a majority of them belong to australia globally the lwssc of studied water bodies is 1390 91 78 91 km3 the north american lakes show the highest seasonal fluctuation of water storage of 435 18 42 08 km3 given that most lakes in this continent have large surface areas europe has an lwssc of approximately 311 64 48 68 km3 owing to the super large lake caspian sea assigned to europe when categorizedby continents the lakes in europe lead in terms of maximum and minimum water surface area of 462 4 12 77 thousand km2 and 459 2 11 75 thousand km2 respectively the lakes in south america 186 28 01 km3 and africa 250 15 29 19 km3 show high variability in water surface level with 4 54 1 45 m and 3 86 1 63 m respectively suggesting their complex topography and highly hydro climatological dynamic variations however the causes of seasonal fluctuations in the lakes in these two continents are not entirely identical the vast lake inundation areas have dominated the lwssc of the african water bodies frequent flooding of the major river lagoons and reservoirs in south america dominates the seasonal fluctuations accompanied by the variations in water level 4 2 analyses of the spatial characteristic of the lwssc of global lakes and reservoirs fig 4 shows the spatial distribution map of the lwssc estimates of different water bodies the lwssc are calculated with 10 latitude longitude summaries on the right and underneath panels of the global map fig 4 globally the study lakes and reservoirs show significant seasonal fluctuations the total lwssc of examined lakes and reservoirs are 869 44 67 35 and 521 46 41 11 km3 respectively considerable lwssc are distributed in the north american lakes the south american large reservoirs the eurasian lakes and the africa great rift valley lakes the caspian sea of eurasia exhibits a significant seasonal fluctuation with the largest lwssc 144 85 44 98 km3 the second largest lwssc are observed for the great rift valley lakes in africa and the great lakes in north america including malawi lake victoria lake lake superior lake michigan and lake huron the seasonal fluctuation of each lake is between 27 14 11 to 31 6 71 km3 furthermore the study reservoirs also have large lwssc guri reservoir 37 78 24 84 km3 in south america has led the largest lwssc among the analyzed reservoirs tucurui reservoir south america lake nasser africa and lake volta africa have relatively high seasonal fluctuations over 20 km3 compared withother study reservoirs the latitudinal direction zonality of lwssc can be clearly observed in fig 4 the lwssc is mainly distributed in the middle and high latitudes of the northern hemisphere a secondary lwssc peak distributed in the low latitudes is also observed around the equator the lwssc is less obvious in the middle and high latitudes of the southern hemisphere due to fewer observed lakes in this area among the investigated basins the higher magnitudes of lwssc are distributed in the mackenzie basin north america the saint lawrence basin north america the amazon basin south america the nile basin africa the caspian sea eurasia and the yenisei basin eurasia the studied lakes in the saint lawrence basin where the north american great lakes are located make up the largest proportion of nearly 11 10 76 of the global lwssc in summary the amount of lwssc is more concentrated between 30 n and 60 n of the northern hemisphere the amount of lwssc is focused between the equator and 30 s of southern hemisphere 4 3 analyses of long term lwssc estimates based on typical lakes to further reveal the change in the characteristics of lwssc throughout the study period we select five lakes and reservoirs located in different basins with considerable seasonal fluctuations and long term satellite altimetry measurements as examples to demonstrate the annual lwssc time series as shown in fig 5 the estimated lwssc of the study lakes is between the maximum and the minimum annual lwssc the caspian sea with a surface area of 0 38 million km2 is the largest lake in the world mehdinia et al 2020 this lake has exhibited a fluctuating pattern displaying the seasonally fluctuating increase in the water storage during 1992 to 2018 fig 5c this lake s estimated lwssc of 144 85 44 98 km3 is between the lower annual lwssc of 21 41 11 41 km3 and the upper annual lwssc of 227 54 89 29 km3 and close to the annual average lwssc of 135 82 62 01 km3 other estimated lwssc of typical lakes also reflected the average level of interannual fluctuations for example malawi lake at 31 45 14 57 km3 lower limit 26 63 11 01 km3 upper limit 38 14 17 93 km3 superior lake at 30 97 16 32 km3 lower limit 13 94 6 87 km3 upper limit 57 38 27 65 km3 guri reservoir at 37 78 24 84 km3 lower limit 14 41 4 83 km3 upper limit 77 93 41 45 km3 and kuybyshev reservoir at 18 76 6 29 km3 lower limit 9 19 4 39 km3 upper limit 25 23 12 58 km3 intuitively the lwssc is dependable on the seasonal changes of lake level for example the synchronous feature between the time series variation of lwssc and water level are marked as the red and blue stripes in fig 5 however the interannual variations of the lwssc do not always depend on the changing trend of water level in the long term the pattern for these examined lakes can be divided into three categories the first category includes lake superior guri reservoir and the caspian sea as the water level decreases in these bodies of water the lwssc increases especially for the caspian sea the second category is represented by the malawi lake whose water level and lwssc are increasing synchronously the third category includes the kuybyshev reservoir which is characterized by decreasing lwssc but rising water levels 5 discussion 5 1 comparison among different lwssc calculation methods in this study the seasonal amplitudes of lake water level were estimated by calculating the multi year averaged differences between intra annual maximum and minimum water levels this process was termed as the lwssc mean method we applied here the seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on loess stl method to decompose the time series seasonal variations of water level and compare them with the performance of lwssc estimation results used in this study the stl was a statistical method of decomposing a time series data into four components containing data display seasonality trend and residual we employed the seasonal amplitudes to replace multi year variations in water levels to calculate the lwssc this process was termed as the lwssc stl method then we picked four lakes i e tanganyika lake malawi lake huron lake and kuybyshev reservoir with diverse water level ranges and long term satellite altimetry measurements to conduct a comparison among different lwssc calculation methods the two methods used to estimate the lwssc and the annual time series of seasonal fluctuations of water storage are shown beneath the stl decomposition of water level for each lake in fig 6 generally the estimates derived from the lwssc stl method were smaller than those obtained from the lwssc mean method the lwssc stl method decomposed the high frequency noise signal and several years of periodic vibration trend although the lwssc mean method could smooth seasonal fluctuations in the trend it cannot eliminate high frequency noises and periodic variations however the lwssc of tanganyika lake 21 35 km3 malawi lake 22 19 km3 huron lake 20 73 km3 and kuybyshev reservoir 14 03 km3 calculated using the lwssc stl method were within the standard deviation range of estimates by the lwssc mean method e g tanganyika lake 24 67 8 41 km3 malawi lake 31 45 14 57 km3 huron lake 27 86 14 11 km3 and kuybyshev reservoir 18 76 6 29 km3 moreover the biases of the lwssc exhibited by the lwssc mean method for the sample lakes were within 30 compared with the result derived from the lwssc stl method no complete and regular time series of water level was used because of the absence of satellite altimetry data in many lakes therefore the lwssc mean method can still be acceptable to estimate the lwssc 5 2 estimation of the lwssc of other global lakes without direct satellite measurements given that the satellite altimetry was limited to their footprint size incomplete observations and other reasons we could not cover every lake especially those with small surface areas considering the geographic similarity and the climate regulating effect of climatological zonality on lake water storage we assumed that the lakes had relatively comparable seasonal fluctuations in the same climate zone accordingly we employed the three level classification system of köppen geiger climate classification kottek et al 2006 to estimate the lwssc of 14 333 global lakes determined by the hydrolakes database with surface areas above 10 km2 without direct altimetry satellite measurements see fig 7 for the climate area distribution we excluded the reservoirs in this estimation because the water storage changes in this body of water were regulated by human operations then we extrapolated the lwssc of the unobserved lakes on the basis of geographically and lake capacity weighted and provided a summary with the examined lakes by climate zone as shown in table 2 the maximum lwssc was found with 515 12 36 86 km3 in the df climate df for snow and fully humid together with hot summer warm summer and cool summer north american and eurasian lake groups had the most lwssc because of the abundance of lakes in the df climate zone the lakes in the df climate especially those with snow climate and fully humid with cool summer zone exhibited the maximum lwssc value of 300 83 18 54 km3 the minimum lwssc amount of 1 13 0 23 km3 observed in the as climate zone as for equatorial savannah with dry summer was due to their limited number of lakes in summary the total lwssc of examined and extrapolated lakes were 869 44 67 35 and 488 23 14 72 km3 respectively the lwssc of 283 observed lakes occupied a proportion of 64 04 compared with 1357 67 68 94 km3 which is the total occupied proportion of the lakes with surface areas above 10 km2 worldwide the number of lakes whether examined or extrapolated in this study occupied a similar proportion in each climate zone or continent therefore the estimated lwssc can be extended to global lakes as a significant reference currently the number of lakes is of large uncertainty due to their global distribution verpoorter et al 2014 this global estimate only considered lakes with the water mask above 10 km2 from the hydrolakes database the global estimate methodology could be employed to future high resolution measurements satellite missions for instance the surface water and ocean topography swot satellite mission which goals to detect lakes with an area large 250 250 m2 biancamaria et al 2016 6 conclusion this study estimated the lwssc for a total of 463 global lakes and reservoirs worldwide with inundation areas above 10 km2 by combining the jrc gsw dataset with the satellite altimetry datasets which represent nearly 64 of the global lake area and 93 of the total lake volume the lwssc of these examined water bodies was estimated at 1390 91 78 91 km3 including 869 44 67 35 km3 for natural lakes and 521 46 41 11 km3 for reservoirs the zonality in latitudinal direction of lwssc is relatively significant the amount of lwssc was more concentrated between 30 n and 60 n of the northern hemisphere the larger lwssc can be observed between the equator and 30 s of the southern hemisphere lwssc in north america great lakes made up the most substantial magnitude of nearly 11 10 76 of the seasonal water storage variations of the global lakes the basins with relatively large seasonal lake water storage variations concentrated in north america and africa had a significant seasonal fluctuation with more uncertainty we also extrapolated a total of 14 616 global lakes 10 km2 with total lwssc of 1357 67 68 94 km3 on the basis of the examined lakes within the similar climatological and hydrological zones the inadequate coverage of satellite altimetry measurements on lake water level especially for the continents oceania and africa was considered a limitation for the global lwssc estimation in this study therefore future studies are encouraged to develop different techniques to decrease the no data percentage in lake observations in the prospective study plan recently launched or planned satellite altimetry missions e g icesat 2 and swot and increasing altimetry water level databases will be a great help in improving the spatial coverage of lake water bodies and quantification accuracy of lwssc credit authorship contribution statement tan chen conceptualization data curation formal analysis

4938,global food systems rely on irrigated agriculture and most of these systems in turn depend on fresh sources of groundwater in this study we demonstrate that groundwater development even without overdraft can transform a fresh open basin into an evaporation dominated closed basin system such that most of the groundwater rather than exiting via stream baseflow and lateral subsurface flow exits predominantly by evapotranspiration from irrigated lands in these newly closed hydrologic basins just as in other closed basins groundwater salinization is inevitable because dissolved solids cannot escape and the basin is effectively converted into a salt sink we first provide a conceptual model of this process called anthropogenic basin closure and groundwater salinization abcsal we examine the temporal dynamics of abcsal using the tulare lake basin california as a case study for a large irrigated agricultural region with mediterranean climate overlying an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system even with modern water management practices that arrest historic overdraft results indicate that shallow aquifers 36 m deep exceed maximum contaminant levels for total dissolved solids on decadal timescales intermediate 132 m and deep aquifers 187 m essential for drinking water and irrigated crops are impacted within two to three centuries hence abcsal resulting from groundwater development constitutes a largely unrecognized constraint on groundwater sustainable yield on similar timescales to aquifer depletion in the tulare lake basin and poses a serious challenge to groundwater quality sustainability even when water levels are stable results suggest that agriculturally intensive groundwater basins worldwide may be susceptible to abcsal keywords hydrogeology basin closure groundwater salinization 1 introduction groundwater from major aquifer systems supplies 43 of the world s irrigation water siebert et al 2010 as a result of excessive groundwater development

2010 another class of groundwater contaminants are total dissolved solids tds also referred to as salts or salinity tds are sourced both naturally e g produced by rock water interactions and anthropogenically e g imported by surface water for irrigation elevated tds is an indicator of human impact on freshwater systems ayers and westcot 1985 kaushal et al 2014 and reduces agricultural

exhibit discoloration unpleasant odor and taste and may be unsuitable for human consumption or irrigation hem 1985 fresh water is defined as containing tds less than 1 000 mg l brackish water ranges

werner et al 2013 2 naturally occurring salinization in closed surface water basins i e endorheic basins and playas eugster and hardie 1978 hardie and eugster 1970 3 high water tables causing groundwater evaporation and soil salinization via capillary rise datta and de jong 2002 barrett lennard 2003 chaudhuri and ale 2014 hillel 1992 and 4 soil salinization due to irrigation hanson et al 1999 bernstein and francois 1973 hillel 2000 this study describes a fifth type of groundwater salinization that remains largely unexplored salinization of an entire groundwater basin created by historically excessive pumping then sustained by the inability of a closed groundwater system to discharge salts henceforth we refer to this fifth type as anthropogenic basin closure and groundwater salinization abcsal this fifth type of salinization abcsal is related to naturally occurring closed basin salinization case 2 above but has significantly different phenomenology it is therefore useful to first consider the difference between an open fresh hydrologic basin and a naturally closed saline basin an open fresh groundwater basin has sufficient natural outlets for tds such as baseflow to streams and lateral subsurface flow across basin boundaries which maintains a balance between salinity that is naturally generated within the basin i e mineral dissolution and salinity that is exported out of the basin basins containing fresh groundwater exist only because they have outlets for both the circulating groundwater and the dissolved salts therein originating from intrabasin rocks and sediments domenico and schwartz 1998 in contrast closed hydrologic basins common in arid to semiarid regions worldwide naturally form when a outflow by surface water or groundwater flows is absent or small and b evaporation is the dominant mechanism by which water exits the basin hardie and eugster 1970 eugster and hardie 1978 jones and deocampo 2003 because tds concentrations in precipitation are low around 10 1 mg l most tds originates from rock water reactions in surface runoff and in the subsurface salts may accumulate at the evaporative boundaries of the basin at or immediately below the surface where discharging groundwater evaporates or at the bottom of a surface depression in terminal and sometimes ephemeral lakes that collect runoff baseflow and spring outflow wooding et al 1997 richter and kreitler 1986 examples of naturally closed hydrologic basins with saline features at or near the land surface are found worldwide playas and salt flats such as those in the great basin usa and salar de uyuni bolivia saline lakes like the great salt lake usa and the dead sea middle east in extremely arid deserts such as the arabian and atacama and in the unsaturated subsurface of semi arid regions with insufficient precipitation to recharge groundwater scanlon et al 1997 kreitler 1993 in this paper we argue that sufficient groundwater development can lower groundwater levels in an open to semi open and relatively fresh basin thus converting it into a closed basin which then salinates in a distinctly different manner from those described in 1 4 first moderate to large amounts of groundwater development may result in sufficient reduction of groundwater levels that reduce or eliminate natural baseflow to streams russo and lall 2017 barlow and leake 2015 hunt 1999 and reverse existing groundwater gradients at subsurface outflow boundaries fig 1 a progressively greater closed basin conditions diminish and eventually entirely eliminate natural tds export from the groundwater basin fig 1b furthermore if the basin is irrigated crop evapotranspiration becomes the dominant water outflow from the basin leaving behind salts that are returned to the groundwater basin via irrigation return flows and recharge from precipitation across the globe water level stabilization in such overdrafted basins is sometimes achieved by importing additional surface water however water imports can add significant salt to the basin moreover even when balancing the water budget with imported water this does not stop the abcsal process if groundwater does not have exits e g baseflow to streams or lateral subsurface outflow and if water continues to leave the basin predominantly through evapotranspiration which leaves behind salts although these latter two conditions are similar to those in a naturally closed basin 2 hardie and eugster 1970 jones and deocampo 2003 vertical groundwater fluxes under abcsal are in the opposite direction from natural basin salinization and thus the location of salinization is different in a naturally closed basin salinization occurs at the land surface due to upward groundwater discharge under abcsal pumping and recharge from irrigation lead to a net downward flux then mobilize salts left behind by irrigated crops downward into the production zone of the groundwater basin before they are recycled by pumping wells to the land surface and the process repeats importantly we point out that the long term continuous decline of groundwater storage is not a necessary condition for abcsal rather even in basins where groundwater levels are stable and hence assumed to be free of overdraft as long as they remain physically closed they will salinate furthermore although for simplicity we describe basins as either open or closed in reality closure ranges from 0 100 i e fully open to fully closed and gradations of basin closure exist which impact the rate of salinization and hence the long term temporal and vertical spatial salt distribution except for the most extremely exploited aquifers one of which we explore in this study many aquifers will fall somewhere between fully open to fully closed and not exactly at one extreme in this research we illustrate the development of abcsal in a historically open freshwater basin using the agriculturally intensive tulare lake basin tlb in california s southern central valley as a case study previous research in the tlb has shown evidence of salt accumulation in groundwater via simple water and salt budgets schmidt 1975 and shallow aquifer salt accumulation from sediment dissolution processes in highly soluble calcium and magnesium carbonates and sulfates schoups et al 2005 other studies have shown that tds concentrations in tlb groundwater have increased over the last century hansen et al 2018 lindsey and johnson 2018 and suggested this is the result of pumping for municipal and irrigation supply which has caused shallow higher tds groundwater to be driven downward into deeper aquifers we are not aware of prior work that has placed these trends into the context of abcsal or quantified potential rates of salinization across a range of aquifer depths and timescales our aim in this study is to assess the first order salt balance and timescales over which the tlb as a large production aquifer system becomes regionally degraded over most of the vertical extent of its nearly 200 m thick main production zone we conservatively assume that under recent state regulation groundwater overdraft is arrested but not reversed we compare timescales of abcsal degradation against the estimated lifespan of the greater central valley aquifer i e 390 years at historical overdraft rates faunt et al 2009 challenge the notion that the depletion of groundwater storage is a more urgent issue than the degradation of groundwater quality in the tlb and in other basins with abcsal conditions and consider the water management implications and the steps required to reverse extensive basin scale groundwater salinization the management would likely involve both hydrologic opening of the basin to provide natural outlets for salt a reduction of sources of salinity and the development of regional groundwater quality management models fogg and labolle 2006 crwqcb 2018 the adaptation might involve the eventual desalination of most groundwater pumped from the basin producing a future economic burden that should be anticipated and evaluated as it bears on the security of water food and energy resources this paper is organized as follows first we describe the hydrogeology water budget and water quality of the study site then we describe and justify our approach involving a simple 1d mixing cell solute transport model next we present our results and finally we discuss the implications of the research the limitations of our approach and the extensibility of the study to other areas 2 methods 2 1 study area in selecting the tlb as our study site we looked for 1 a history of intensive groundwater pumping and irrigation 2 availability of historical water budget and water quality data and 3 social and economic significance the tlb fig 2 occupies the southern third of the central valley california and is bounded by the coast ranges to the west the tehachapi mountains to the south and the southern sierra nevada to the east geology strongly influences dissolved solid concentrations in the clastic sedimentary aquifer system composed of fluvial and alluvial fan deposits calcium and magnesium sulfates and carbonates in coast range sediment in the western tlb are more soluble than sediments from the predominately crystalline rocks of the sierra nevada to the east thus the groundwater in the western basin tends to have higher tds fujii and swain 1995 belitz and heimes 1990 deverel and millard 1988 fresh groundwater in the tlb spans depths from land surface to around 1 000 m where brackish water and marine deposits limit the development of groundwater resources desimone et al 2010 kang and jackson 2016 above this deep brackish zone is a major freshwater aquifer system in combination with a natural endowment of significant but intermittent runoff from surrounding uplands abundant fresh groundwater has transformed the tlb into one of the most heavily irrigated and economically productive agricultural regions in the world hanak et al 2011 at its peak in the 1980s approximately 14 164 km 2 of its 44 110 km 2 were irrigated tnc 2014 today roughly 12 140 km 2 remain irrigated with a total gross value of all agricultural crops and products at 23 4 billion usd in 2017 fankhauser 2018 hook 2018 l wright 2018 m wright 2017 although a tlb water budget from pre development times is not available the surface and subsurface hydrologic characteristics of the basin which is a part of the larger central valley sedimentary basin fig 2 indicate that it was hydrologically open we first discuss the surface hydrologic aspects despite the shallow topographic depression in which tulare lake used to exist the freshwater lake periodically filled up and overflowed northward into the san joaquin river grunsky 1898 davis et al 1959 providing an outlet for any accumulated salts reconstructions of historical tulare lake level indicate that in 19 of the 29 years from 1850 to 1878 it filled up and flowed out of the basin to the north usbr 1970 this water and salt exit via intermittent surface inundation would be different than say baseflow to a stream but would accomplish the same flushing function no overflows are documented after 1878 due to the diversion of tributary waters for agricultural irrigation and municipal water use ecorp 2007 the subsurface characteristics also indicate open hydrologic conditions there is significant evidence that groundwater flowed northward into the adajacent san joaquin basin in pre development times circa early 1900s this evidence includes 1 historical measurements of central valley groundwater tds showing lowest tds values in the tlb with increasing tds to the north into the san joaquin basin mendenhall et al 1916 table 23 consistent with northward groundwater flow and the accompanying down hydraulic gradient groundwater chemistry evolution that is routinely observed in sedimentary basins e g palmer and cherry 1984 2 the regional south to north topographic gradient to provide the driving force for gravity driven flow in the same direction out of the tlb even if there existed shallower local groundwater flow components from north to south at the subtle depression that collected tulare lake e g refer to classic work of tóth 1970 on topographically controlled gravity driven flow

direction than the horizontal e g weissmann et al 2002 and faunt et al 2009 thereby minimizing influence of subtle topographic features like the tulare lake depression on all but the shallowest groundwater flow components e g refer to tóth 1970 and related work summarizing our conceptual model of the pre development tlb hydrologic system is one in which the subtle topographic depression that collected the typically 12 m deep tulare lake preston 1990 together with the periodic overflow of the lake and discharge to the north resulted in a partly open surface drainage system further the larger topographic and geologic structure of the basin together with groundwater chemistry evidence indicates there was net northward groundwater flow making the tlb groundwater system an open hydrologic basin in pre development times parts of tlb may have been salinating to some degree before development due to shallow evaporation of groundwater and surface water case 3 in introduction in contrast to the abcsal process that we describe in this paper portions of the tlb closed under pre development conditions would lead to salt accumulation in and near its playas e g buena vista lake tulare lake an evaporative boundary of the basin and endpoint to all surface water discharge case 2 above this is consistent with observations of high salinity near and in these lakebeds hansen et al 2018 fujii and swain 1995 although there exist local areas of shallow groundwater with elevated salinity on the west side of the tlb these areas are typically associated with salt mobilization out of alluvial sediments originating from marine sedimentary source rocks in the coast ranges and not from basin closure by the time regional groundwater levels were mapped in the early twentieth century the tlb showed signs of closure groundwater flow across the northern boundary was minimal and flowed north to south into the tlb mendenhall et al 1916 ingerson 1941 although pre groundwater development pre 1850 water budgets are unavailable two large scale regional groundwater flow models of the central valley brush et al 2013 faunt et al 2009 provide decadal groundwater budgets for early 1932 1941 and post groundwater development 2000 2009 timescales relative to the decadal hydrologic water year budgets of early groundwater development post groundwater development water budgets show much higher pumping crop evapotranspiration and recharge brush et al 2013 as groundwater levels fell gaining streams transitioned to losing streams and subsurface inflow along the northern basin boundary slightly increased fig 2 groundwater discharge to surface water almost entirely ceased surface water exits the basin in rare years when the kings kaweah and kern rivers produce sufficiently large floods mostly runoff from the surrounding uplands evapotranspiration from irrigated crops has become the dominant water outflow and this flow is much greater than it was during early groundwater development brush et al 2013 taken together these hydrologic changes have transitioned the tlb into an anthropogenically closed groundwater system with commensurate onset of abcsal 2 2 mixing cell model development given the large space and time scales of interest and the large scale effectively one dimensional vertical flow conditions in the basin due to pumping and recharge we used a lumped parameter approach based on upscaling water fluxes of a fully three dimensional groundwater model although local hydrogeologic conditions vary and can lead to locally complex three dimensional flow and transport our focus here is on large scale salinization behavior and time scales thus an upscaled model was appropriately parsimonious moreover upscaling the advection dispersion equation to regional scales remains a scientific and computing challenge guo et al 2020 guo et al 2019 beyond the scope of this study mixing cell models also called discrete state compartment models are computationally inexpensive and have successfully been used in place of complex flow models to provide rapid first order estimates of water budgets mass flux and contaminant concentrations campana 1975 campana and simpson 1984 campana 1987 carroll et al 2008 kirk and campana 1990 tc 1982 a mixing cell approach segments the system into a set of control volumes in each iteration the incoming water displaces an equivalent volume of water then mixes with the remaining cell contents and new concentrations are calculated at each cell specifically we use the modified mixing cell model consistent with fick s law tc 1982 here we represent the tlb groundwater system through a one dimensional vertical column of discrete control volumes cells given the predominance of vertical downward flow at the aquifer system scale we assume that each cell consists of a fraction f of sediments participating in groundwater flow and salt transport with porosity η we neglect flows and rock water interactions in sediments not participating in transport of proportion 1 f more details below the thickness of each cell is chosen such that the advective travel time δ t of water and salt downward through each cell is exactly 50 years synchronized tipping bucket model see eq 4 below thus full mixing occurs at each cell even as the groundwater flow velocity decreases with depth to determine the

layer comprising around 1 of the model volume porosity η is set to 0 40 the average for the tlb coarse and fine sediment porosities do not appreciably differ averaging around 0 40 with an interquartile range of 0 39 0 41 for all textures as demonstrated in abundant core analyses johnson et al 1968 and discussed further in appendix table a 5 and fig a 9 hence we did not consider varying η across aquifer layers to account for mass contribution from natural dissolution of geologic minerals we define a zero order source term called the rock water interaction coefficient ρ ml 3 rock dissolution along groundwater flow paths is well documented in sedimentary aquifers palmer and cherry 1984 oetting et al 1996 tóth 1999 mahlknecht et al 2004 cloutier et al 2008 we obtain a representative mass dissolution rate from the slope of a representative tds profile for the tlb from land surface to the base of fresh water williamson et al 1989 kang and jackson 2016 the product of the rock water interaction coefficient ρ and the cell volume v is the additional mass accumulated from rock water interactions in the cell we also evaluate an alternative scenario with ρ 0 we solve 3

for the 40 year period from 1961 10 31 to 2001 09 30 to obtain an average annual tlb groundwater budget an equivalent average annual landscape root zone budget is provided in appendix table a 2 this post groundwater development water management time frame is characterized by pumping and overdraft in addition to wet dry above normal below normal and critical water year types the c2vsim change in groundwater storage is defined as 5 δ s r b c i n p where δ s is change in groundwater storage l 3 r is basin recharge from streams lakes and watersheds l 3 b is lateral mountain front recharge from streams and watersheds l 3 c is subsidence based flow from clay compaction l 3 i is subsurface inflow from the north l 3 n is net deep percolation predominately from irrigation water l 3 and p is groundwater pumping l 3 the dominant budget terms are p r and n table 1 to demonstrate abcsal under long term conditions that avoid further overdraft but not basin closure we solve the mixing cell model eqs 30 and 4 alternatively for δ s alt δ c alt 0 overdraft is eliminated with an alternate budget table 1 which adds managed aquifer recharge m as inflow to the top mixing cell fig 3 and reduces pumping to an alternative pumping level p alt we add m 0 68 km 3 which was determined by a prior study as the maximum theoretical recharge available to the san joaquin valley which includes the tlb assuming unlimited infrastructure and water transfer ability hanak et al 2019 eliminating overdraft in this way effectively maintains a steady state saturated model that remains closed to due to lack of baseflow and groundwater outflow hence the water level is immobile but the salt front can move thus simulating salt migration without drying out cells due to overdraft since m represents captured surface water flow we assign it the same tds as natural water 32 5 mg l discussed below we also simulated m with a tds of 0 mg l appendix table a 9 and found that it had a negligible impact on resulting salt concentrations presented in this study appendix table a 8 the alternate reduced pumping p alt is computed by rearranging 5 adding m and setting δ s alt c alt 0 6 p alt r b m i n therefore the modified no overdraft alternate groundwater budget is 7 δ s alt r b c alt m i n p alt 0 the salt budget is calculated by assigning a tds concentration to each term in the groundwater budget 7 tds for natural waters e g stream lake and managed aquifer recharge budget terms were determined to be 32 5 mg l by computing the median of the sampling distribution of sample tds medians in tlb stream samples usgs 2016 from 1951 2019 appendix fig a 7 and table a 3 similarly the tds of diverted surface water was calculated to be 264 5 mg l as the average annual water and salt budget from 1985 1994 of two major surface water conveyance structures the california state water project and the state water project cismowski et al 2006 appendix table a 3 salt and water budgets are detailed in table 1 2 3 2 velocity depth profile to explicitly solve for the mixing cell discretization 4 we fit a linear model to the c2vsim vertical darcy velocities reported for each finite element cell in the three layer c2vsim grid at the layer to layer boundaries due to increases in recharge and pumping caused by groundwater development and irrigation the groundwater flow system is vertically dominant and thus supports the application of a 1d vertically oriented model to account for groundwater velocity change in the alternate groundwater budget 7 groundwater velocity is scaled proportional to the decrease in vertical volumetric flow rate p alt p c 0 85 a 15 reduction this is equivalent to the ratio of net downward volumetric flow in the alternate budget to the net downward volumetric flow in the historical budget table 1 8 q z β 0 β 1 z p alt p c where β 0 and β 1 are the regression coefficients appendix table a 4 and the overall change reduction in velocity is 15 mixing cell thickness 4 is determined by computing q j from 8 for the depth z of the bottom of the mixing cell j 1 top of cell j to ensure consistency between the water balance terms in 5 and the approximated vertical velocity profile 8 we compute the water mass balance error mb error j for each mixing cell j 9 mb error j q j 1 j i j p alt j q j j 1 for the uppermost mixing cell j 1 we rearrange 9 replacing q j 1 j

cell by cell change in storage are reported in appendix table a 7 2 3 3 evapoconcentration and pumping evapotranspiration removes a majority of total applied water leaving behind dissolved solids in the crop rootzone that eventually migrate into groundwater we model the evapoconcentration of tds in total applied water a combination of pumped groundwater and imported surface water diversions by accounting for the application efficiency burt et al 1997 and thus the fraction of water that remains after evapotranspiration 11 c n m d m p v d v p 1 1 e a c d p 1 e a c n is the concentration of net deep percolation after accounting for evapotranspiration m d and m p are the mass and v d and v p are the volume of surface water diversions d and pumping p respectively c d p is the concentration of total applied water from surface water diversions and pumping calculated by mixing diversions and pumped groundwater in their respective proportions see appendix table a 4 and e a is the application efficiency which has a measured regional average of 0 78 in the tulare basin sandoval solis et al 2013 and agrees with measured values in hydrologically similar areas hanson et al 1995 howell 2003 alternatively the c2vsim landscape soil water budget appendix table a 2 provides an application efficiency e a of 0 88 when considering the amount of water infiltrating into the soil and deep percolation for sensitivity analysis we run simulations for several e a between 0 78 and 0 88 to further explore model outcome uncertainty for the stacked mixing cell model we assume that p alt in the no overdraft groundwater budget 6 is distributed uniformly with depth from the water table to the last mixing cell m similarly we assume lateral inflow i is uniformly distributed across depth from cell 2 to cell m therefore pumping is proportional to mixing cell thickness and the salt mass flux due to pumping during time step k in mixing cell j is 12 m j k v j f η f η i 1 n v i pc j k

profile the initial tds depth profile is determined by fitting a linear model to the pre 1960 tds depth measurements fig 4 cswrcb 2019c due to the influence of freshwater recharge at the land surface and rock water interactions pre 1960 tds generally increases with depth consistent with observations of increasing tds with depth in the region kang and jackson 2016 kharaka and thordsen 1992 desimone et al 2010 2 3 5 ensemble simulation we assign a uniform probability distribution to the parameters of which we are least certain and discrete values to those that are measured appendix table a 6 then perform monte carlo simulation to generate an ensemble output the mixing cell model is evaluated 1 000 times which the computational simplicity of a lumped model permits modeling uncertainty in this way with a distributed parameter 3d flow and transport model would be computationally prohibitive parameter ranges are estimated from literature for rock water interaction coefficient williamson et al 1989 kang and jackson 2016 detailed in section 2 2 as described in section 2 3 3 application efficiency is both measured sandoval solis et al 2013 and calculated from c2vsim brush et al 2013 to show the influence of rock water interactions on the progression of closed basin salinization we simulate two basic scenarios 1 no rock water interactions mass accumulates from water budget inputs 2 rock water interactions are present mass accumulates from water budget inputs but also internally via rock water interactions see section 2 2 for details 3 results 3 1 groundwater and salt budget the average historical c2vsim groundwater budget in the tlb from 1961 10 31 to 2001 09 30 table 1 reflects post groundwater development conditions pumping removes an average of 6 76 km 3 yr from the groundwater system natural recharge from streams lakes and watersheds adds an average of 2 45 km 3 yr and net deep percolation of agricultural irrigation adds an average of 1 89 km 3 yr smaller sources of water inflow include subsidence flow 0 57 km 3 yr lateral mountain front recharge from streams and watersheds 0 24 km 3 yr and subsurface inflow from the north 0 01 km 3 yr the alternate budget table 1 used in this study eliminates overdraft δ s 0 and is identical to historical budget described above except that pumping p alt is reduced to 5 26 km 3 yr managed aquifer recharge m is added at a rate of 0 68 km 3 yr and subsidence flow c alt is reduced to 0 importantly in this alternative budget the basin remains closed salt inputs to the system fig 5 a come from pumped groundwater water budget terms and rock water interactions groundwater pumping for agriculture is unlike other water budget terms i m r b and rock water interactions in that it does not add new salt into the system but rather recycles existing salt from deeper layers to the land surface and back into shallow groundwater via irrigation discussed in section 3 2 in the no rock water interactions scenario ρ 0 the median mass recycled by pumped groundwater exceeds the mass input of all other water budget terms by a factor of 2 0 to 3 9 depending on the timeframe considered when rock water interactions are present ρ 0 they initially contribute a comparable mass to groundwater pumping around 4 mt yr but with time salt accumulates in the aquifer and the mass recycled by groundwater pumping exceeds the mass imparted by rock water interactions fig 5a annually surface water diversions add 1 5 mt yr of salt to the study site this is around 13 times the amount of all other non pumping water budget terms combined i m r b which add only 0 11 mt yr we estimate that rock water interactions add between 3 3 and 4 6 mt yr of salt this exceeds the mass introduced by imported surface water and is comparable to the mass recycled by groundwater pumping due to the closed basin hydrology of the study site there are no exits for salt to leave the system instead pumping and irrigation recycle salts within the basin and evapotranspiration by crops at the land surface increases the concentration of net deep percolation which recharges groundwater fig 5b evapoconcentration by crops at the land surface increases the average concentration of total applied water pumped groundwater combined with surface water diversions by 5 1 6 8 times its original amount regardless of whether rock water interactions are absent or present as previously discussed since pumped groundwater concentration increases with time total applied water and thus net deep percolation also become increasingly saline over time 3 2 progression of groundwater salinization the shallow aquifer 36 m is heavily impacted by the recycling of salts via pumping and irrigation and exceeds the freshwater concentration threshold 1 000 mg l within decadal timescales fig 6 intermediate 132 m and deep aquifers 187 m exceed 1 000 mg l within century long timescales uncertainty in the salt balance results from parameter uncertainty expressed in the monte carlo simulation section 2 3 5 which affects the distribution of calculated salt concentrations at the salt front deeper layer insensitivity results from being insulated from the salt front a top down source accordingly shallow layer uncertainty increases over time because salt is continuously added through top down irrigation and recharge let us first summarize the results with no rock water interactions at the beginning of the simulation year 1960 initial tds concentration increases gradually with depth fig 4 and appendix table a 8 shallow aquifer salinity is 506 mg l after 50 yrs with ρ 0 average shallow aquifer salinity reaches a median concentration of 934 mg l with an interquartile range iqr of 829 1 083 mg l thus the tds depth profile at t 50 begins to invert i e shallow aquifer salinity exceeds deep aquifer salinity consistent with modern day observed tds depth relationships in the tlb hansen et al 2018 after 200 yrs year 2160 shallow aquifers reach brackish tds levels with a median tds of 1 241 mg l iqr 1 031 1 576 mg l finally after 300 yrs year 2310 median shallow aquifer tds approaches nearly 1 477 mg l iqr 1 175 1 993 mg l intermediate and deep aquifers are impacted much later than shallow systems and approach the freshwater tds threshold on timescales of two to three centuries after 200 yrs year 2160 intermediate aquifer median tds is 907 mg l iqr 830 1 017 mg l after 300 yrs year 2260 deep aquifers iqr 841 995 mg l experience the first arrival of the lumped salt front in the rock water interactions present scenario ρ 0 the progression of groundwater salinization follows approximately the same trend and timescale as the scenario without rock water interactions described above but the resulting concentrations are significantly greater and deep groundwater salinates faster in both scenarios the greatest change in salinity occurs in the shallow aquifer within the first 50 yrs which is due to the introduction of mass from total applied water i e diversions and pumped groundwater and the inability for that mass to exit because of basin closure moreover regardless of whether rock water interactions are included the slope of the tds depth profile fig 6 gradually inverts and amplifies and shallow groundwater becomes saltier than deep groundwater thus even in the absence of rock water interactions moderate and constant salt inputs mostly due to recycled groundwater and imported surface water are sufficient to salinate shallow aquifers within decades and deep aquifers within centuries 3 3 additional perspective on the model lumped mixing cell models have a relatively small number of parameters are computationally inexpensive conceptually simple and importantly can represent the dominant hydrologic features of a system these strengths come with some tradeoffs mixing cell models can be used to simplify groundwater flow and contaminant transport by ignoring horizontal flow geologic heterogeneity dispersion diffusion sorption and reactive transport strong vertical hydraulic gradients induced by pumping in agriculturally dominant systems like the tlb produce vertically dominated flow systems brush et al 2013 faunt et al 2009 in upscaling these distributed models to the regional scale the dominant role of vertical flux becomes apparent and explains why the mixing cell model captures the salient features of regional abcsal degradation for more sub regional or local applications a fully three dimensional distributed parameter model representing the effects of preferential flow and tailing on solute transport would be more appropriate zhang et al 2006 guo et al 2019 guo et al 2020 henri and harter 2019 additionally we assume that the early groundwater development tds depth relationship is approximately equal to observed pre 1960 tds data over the model domain 212 m deep these measurements appendix fig a 8 are well distributed we experimented with different values for the initial tds depth profile and found that the results were relatively insensitive to the initial conditions as the imported salt and the salt generated by rock water interactions greatly exceeds the initial salt load moreover in this study we model tds as a lumped term yet it should be noted that tds is a combination of many solutes which differ in their impact to crops toxicity and reactivity with the subsurface in the tlb the dominant salts include cations and anions from geochemical weathering of multi mineralic clastic sedimentary deposits containing carbonate as well as silicate minerals e g calcium magnesium sodium carbonate e g sodium calcium bicarbonate schoups et al 2005 hansen et al 2018 but in other basins this may not be the case therefore the impact to fresh groundwater in other basins depend on the types and relative abundances of solutes present nevertheless the geochemical make up of sedimentary particles in the central valley of california is typical of that found in many other sedimentary basins lastly in our tlb study site historical groundwater pumping has reduced groundwater levels such that basin outflow even in rare wet years is essentially negligible hence we found it appropriate and parsimonious to use an average water budget that maintains constant hydrologic basin closure over time however other basins both open and closed will exhibit seasonal annual and decadal hydrologic variability for instance extreme rainfall and net deep percolation can temporarily induce basin outflows that export some of the accumulated salts the degree of which is a function of the salinity of the source s responsible for basin discharge e g surface water shallow or deep groundwater these cycles are not incorporated in the model presented but in sites where they are important they should be included 4 discussion 4 1 abcsal threatens regional groundwater quality and sustainable yield in this study we show that abcsal is a progressive regional scale hydrologic process where salts accumulate within an aquifer because basin closure eliminates exits for the salts in the tlb our calculated abcsal timescales have similar timescales to aquifer depletion are consistent with 3d random walk salt transport simulations and agree with observed decadal changes in shallow groundwater salinity in the tlb our estimates of decadal timescales for shallow aquifer 36 m salinization and two to three centuries for intermediate 132 m and deep aquifers 187 m are similar to the estimated 390 year timescale of central valley aquifer depletion by scanlon et al 2012 who assumed a remaining water storage of 860 km 3 in the year 2000 and a depletion rate of 2 2 km 3 yr scanlon et al 2012 also noted that aquifer lifespan is likely shorter than 390 years in the tlb due to focused groundwater depletion in the area thus abcsal which constitutes a slow moving form of regional groundwater quality degradation may significantly constrain groundwater sustainable yield on similar timescales to aquifer depletion in the tlb this study s predicted salinization time frames i e decades for shallow systems centuries for deep systems are consistent with random walk salt and nitrate particle transport simulations in detailed 3d heterogeneous alluvial aquifers henri and harter 2019 zhang et al 2006 which suggests that the simple mixing cell model captures key transport dynamics thus these results provide a useful basis for future research using more complex distributed parameter regional scale transport models incorporating geologic heterogeneity and transient boundary conditions moreover measured tds change from historic to modern time periods in the tlb agree with this study s modeled changes in tds over similar time periods and horizontally averaged depth scales hansen et al 2018 measured a 110 850 mg l interquartile range iqr increase in shallow aquifer 50 m tds from historic 1910 to modern 1993 2015 time periods in the tlb our results indicate an iqr increase in shallow aquifer 37 m tds of 323 717 mg l depending on the inclusion of rock water interactions ρ in eq 3 and over similar timescales 1960 to 2010 especially given that groundwater development for agriculture in the tlb largely commenced around 1950 this study s smaller iqr compared to hansen et al 2018 may suggest that our model parameters are over constrained and thus do not reproduce the wider distribution of observed tds iqr increase however it is also possible that the larger iqr from hansen et al 2018 indicates insufficient sampling i e a perfectly random spatial sample with enough observations might yield a more constrained distribution of tds measurements that more closely approximate the true population iqr nonetheless given the broad aim of this study to estimate the approximate timescales of regionally downward salinization of the production aquifer under abcsal the evolution of mass flux described by our model generally agrees with observations of shallow aquifer tds increase in the tlb unsustainable groundwater management eventually leads to undesirable effects giordano 2009 sustainable groundwater management act 2014 such as chronic groundwater level declines and depletion of groundwater storage well failure pauloo et al 2020 increased energy costs for pumping wada et al 2010 land subsidence smith et al 2017 sea water intrusion zektser et al 2005 desiccation of groundwater dependent ecosystems tnc 2014 and groundwater quality degradation smith et al 2018 foster et al 2000 the negative externalities above are recognized consequences of unsustainable groundwater extraction however abcsal which progressively deteriorates groundwater quality over decades to centuries may be considered an additional unrecognized threat to regional groundwater quality and sustainability in the tlb and a constraint on groundwater sustainable yield in other food production regions of the world 4 2 key features of abcsal abcsal arises from groundwater development and is sustained by basin closure once a basin in closed salinization does not depend on groundwater overdraft per se but rather on the closure itself which prevents the basin from discharging salts our findings indicate that the long term fate of basins closed by groundwater pumping may be similar to that of naturally closed basins hardie and eugster 1970 jones and deocampo 2003 however unlike naturally occurring closed basins salt cycling in agriculturally intensive closed basins is driven by human made water management decisions and may progress more rapidly near the onset of the 21st century average vertical groundwater movement in the central valley increased by about 6 times the rate from pre development conditions mainly as a result of agricultural recharge and withdrawal from public supply and irrigation wells williamson et al 1989 strong vertical transport coupled in a closed basin drives tds migration into deeper aquifers although groundwater levels in the tlb are in chronic decline scanlon et al 2012 groundwater overdraft is not a necessary condition for abcsal to occur to illustrate this point we eliminated overdraft eq 7 by increasing clean recharge m tds 32 5 mg l at 0 68 km 3 yr following hanak et al 2019 and reducing pumping by 15 we still observed groundwater salinization even though the water budget remained in steady state we also applied completely clean recharge with tds 0 mg l appendix table a 9 and found that it was insufficient to stop or reverse abcsal because it did not fix the underlying basin closure thus an area will accumulate salts if groundwater storage is stable or even increasing as long as the basin remains closed and salts cannot exit as our model assumes no overdraft conditions the results presented herein may be more severe if overpumping were instead to continue our study shows that abcsal is exacerbated by imported salts in surface water for irrigation and by groundwater pumping although both surface water and groundwater irrigation are present in our study area like overdraft they are not necessary conditions for abcsal however basins with significant groundwater irrigation are particularly susceptible because pumping lowers groundwater levels and cuts off lateral outflow and subsurface baseflow exits thus initiating abcsal the rate and magnitude of salinization depends on a variety of factors e g concentration of total applied water evapoconcentration vertical groundwater velocity but fundamentally depends on the severity of basin closure worldwide basins range from open i e natural salt exits maintain freshwater conditions to partially closed i e some salts exit but some remain and accumulate to fully closed e g salts have no exit and hence accumulate in deep groundwater groundwater salinization timescales in partially closed basins may be longer than those calculated in this study for the tlb which is completely closed conversely some basins may salinate at faster rates than calculated for the tlb depending on the hydrologic features represented in our mixing model 4 3 implications for groundwater management this study demonstrates that if irrigated groundwater basins are operated in a way that hydrologically closes them groundwater salinization abcsal is inevitable it further demonstrates that the timescales of this phenomenon in the tlb are similar to those over which the groundwater in storage would be virtually exhausted according to classic concepts of overdraft we know how to prevent overdraft by for example decreasing pumping or increasing recharge this raises the parallel question how do we prevent abcsal in other words how do we both develop groundwater resources while also keeping groundwater basins hydrologically open conceptually one way to both pump abundant amounts of groundwater and to keep the water table sufficiently shallow to produce groundwater discharge via baseflow and lateral flow to adjacent basins is to significantly increase groundwater recharge in california this could in theory be accomplished by storing less water in surface reservoirs and storing more water in groundwater via managed aquifer recharge operations kocis and dahlke 2017 ghasemizade et al 2019 gailey et al 2019 such an approach would be a radical shift from how our current civilization chooses to store water mainly in surface reservoirs in the discussion that follows we are not so much advocating such a paradigm shift in water resources management as we are suggesting the need for the beginnings of new conversations in water resources management about how to manage groundwater and surface water jointly in a way that better ensures the sustainability of both one challenge of filling up a groundwater basin enough to open it is to manage the water table sufficiently to prevent undesirable waterlogging effects this would require changes in basin water resources management within a carefully managed scheme in which the pumping and recharge are optimized such that the basin opens up while preventing the water table from getting so high that bare soil evaporation exacerbates salinization as happened on the west side of the san joaquin valley schoups et al 2005 belitz and phillips 1995 the technology to monitor a groundwater basin and model it sufficiently to tightly manage it for optimal water table elevations does in fact exist calderwood et al 2020 but would require levels of groundwater monitoring modeling and decision making that are well beyond what is normally done additionally achieving vast quantities of recharge will require strategic siting maples et al 2019 to ensure that the subsurface geology can accommodate the recharge within a time frame that does not jeopardize the health of overlying crops dahlke et al 2018 or negatively impair other land uses in the tlb a further challenge would be that additional sources of clean recharge water within the tlb watersheds are not large enough to accomplish the requisite amounts of recharge as rather drastic amounts of pumping reduction would likely be necessary unless water for recharge could be imported from wetter northern central valley watersheds hanak et al 2019 moreover conditions of reduced pumping and increased recharge will still lead to vertically dominant solute migration thus the application of clean recharge in addition to diluting and lessening the overall salt load will also contribute to vertical migration of the salt front hence the short and long term consequences on groundwater quality of increasing clean recharge and reducing pumping need investigation which in turn would require the development of regional groundwater quality management models fogg and labolle 2006 kourakos and harter 2014 if re operation of the groundwater basin to increase groundwater storage and open the basin does not happen water users in the tlb will ultimately be faced with desalinating pumped groundwater for drinking water and irrigation the ultimate costs of which remain unknown if inland closed basin salinization proceeds at the historical rates projected in this study the salinity of pumped groundwater may exceed thresholds safe for crop health within decades to a few centuries depending on the depth of pumped groundwater as prices for technology like reverse osmosis fall and arid countries pioneer large scale inland desalination plants for brackish groundwater nativ 2004 tal 2006 desalination cost must be weighed against the cost of adaptive water management e g fallowing fields securing higher quality imported water managed aquifer recharge hanak et al 2019 moreover economically beneficial uses of recovered salt e g manufacturing table salt road salt and mineral commodities may offset desalination costs ongoing un mitigated abcsal may require new technology and irrigation methods to utilize saline water in agriculture beltrán 1999 and the conversion to and development of genetically modified salt tolerant crops yamaguchi and blumwald 2005 in order to probe the full impact of abcsal in the tlb particularly on shallow aquifers which are critical to food and drinking water security worldwide in this study we assumed no water management intervention as salinity accumulates in reality water users would adapt to increasingly saline aquifers by pumping from deeper less saline aquifers fallowing fields mixing saline water with cleaner water and desalinating pumped groundwater two and three centuries into the model the assumption of no intervention is increasingly unrealistic as the concentration of total applied water approaches thresholds dangerous to crop health and is likely to have prompted prior adaptive management we deemed it necessary to evaluate the model at timescales upwards of two and three centuries in order to allow salinization to reach intermediate and deep aquifers as our model assumes no intervention results past 50 years of simulation year 2010 should be interpreted as a worst case scenario urban groundwater pumping might also close groundwater basins however there are two key differences between the hydrology of urban and agricultural areas first in urban areas high evapotranspiration rates and subsequent salt concentration are unlikely unless large volumes of water are applied for landscape irrigation second a substantial fraction of urban groundwater pumping e g drinking water household use and industrial use typically exits the basin via wastewater discharge thus it is not returned to groundwater where it might salinate shallow aquifers as in the case of the tlb hence the threat of abcsal in urban basins is likely to be much less than the threat in agriculturally intensive basins where groundwater is developed and recycled internally 5 conclusions irrigated agriculture in overdrafted aquifer systems supplies much of the world s demand for food dalin et al 2017 in this study we demonstrate that intensive groundwater development can transform a fresh open basin into an evaporation dominated closed basin system a closed basin is effectively a salt sink aquifer salinization is inevitable because dissolved solids in groundwater cannot escape and are recycled through pumpage irrigation and evapoconcentration by crops this study provides a conceptual framework to understand this process which we call anthropogenic basin closure and groundwater salinization abcsal and a mixing cell model to provide first order estimates of ongoing aquifer salinization in the tlb located in california s central valley our model indicates progressive salinization 1 000 mg l of shallow aquifers 36 m within decades intermediate 132 m and deep aquifers 187 m are impacted within two to three centuries the tlb in california s southern central valley is less than one century into this experiment and the first signs of shallow aquifer salinization have been observed hansen et al 2018 crwqcb 2018 estimated salinization timescales are similar to estimated aquifer depletion timescales in the area scanlon et al 2012 underscoring the urgency of regional scale groundwater quality management importantly however while most groundwater quality management frameworks focus on contaminant source control abcsal can only be prevented by allowing contaminant discharge via hydrologic opening of the basin this study is a first order calculation of abcsal in an agriculturally intensive groundwater basin future research should emphasize a more comprehensive representation of subsurface transport processes through the development of groundwater quality management models key research questions that remain include investigating if managed aquifer recharge with relatively clean water may slow groundwater salinization it also remains to be tested if it is possible to reverse groundwater salinization by increasing recharge until a basin fills up and discharges tds into streams and lateral outflow which exit the basin the practical likelihood of this mitigation strategy would require re imagining integrated water resources management with a greater emphasis on subsurface storage ongoing abcsal without intervention may necessitate inland desalination to remediate saline groundwater resources the costs of which remain presently unknown traditionally the concept of long term sustainability of groundwater has hinged on the intuitive notion of not managing the basin in ways that result in eventual exhaustion of the groundwater stores herein we advance the less intuitive concept that long term sustainability of groundwater also hinges on the salt balance which in turn depends on how the groundwater quantity is managed fundamentally abcsal can only be prevented by managing the basin groundwater quality in ways that open the basin credit authorship contribution statement richard a pauloo conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology

4938,global food systems rely on irrigated agriculture and most of these systems in turn depend on fresh sources of groundwater in this study we demonstrate that groundwater development even without overdraft can transform a fresh open basin into an evaporation dominated closed basin system such that most of the groundwater rather than exiting via stream baseflow and lateral subsurface flow exits predominantly by evapotranspiration from irrigated lands in these newly closed hydrologic basins just as in other closed basins groundwater salinization is inevitable because dissolved solids cannot escape and the basin is effectively converted into a salt sink we first provide a conceptual model of this process called anthropogenic basin closure and groundwater salinization abcsal we examine the temporal dynamics of abcsal using the tulare lake basin california as a case study for a large irrigated agricultural region with mediterranean climate overlying an unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer system even with modern water management practices that arrest historic overdraft results indicate that shallow aquifers 36 m deep exceed maximum contaminant levels for total dissolved solids on decadal timescales intermediate 132 m and deep aquifers 187 m essential for drinking water and irrigated crops are impacted within two to three centuries hence abcsal resulting from groundwater development constitutes a largely unrecognized constraint on groundwater sustainable yield on similar timescales to aquifer depletion in the tulare lake basin and poses a serious challenge to groundwater quality sustainability even when water levels are stable results suggest that agriculturally intensive groundwater basins worldwide may be susceptible to abcsal keywords hydrogeology basin

werner et al 2013 2 naturally occurring salinization in closed surface water basins i e endorheic basins and playas eugster and hardie 1978 hardie and eugster 1970 3 high water tables causing groundwater evaporation and soil salinization via capillary rise datta and de jong 2002 barrett lennard 2003 chaudhuri and ale 2014 hillel 1992 and 4 soil salinization due to irrigation hanson et al 1999 bernstein and francois 1973 hillel 2000 this study describes a fifth type of groundwater salinization that remains largely unexplored salinization of an entire groundwater basin created by historically excessive pumping then sustained by the inability of a closed groundwater system to discharge salts henceforth we refer to this fifth type as anthropogenic basin closure and groundwater salinization abcsal this fifth type of salinization abcsal is related to naturally occurring closed basin salinization case 2 above but has significantly different phenomenology it is therefore useful to first consider the difference between an open fresh hydrologic basin and a naturally closed saline basin an open fresh groundwater basin has sufficient natural outlets for tds such as baseflow to streams and lateral subsurface flow across basin boundaries which maintains a balance between salinity that is naturally generated within the basin i e mineral dissolution and salinity that is exported out of the basin basins containing fresh groundwater exist only because they have outlets for both the circulating groundwater and the dissolved salts therein originating from intrabasin rocks and sediments domenico and schwartz 1998 in contrast closed hydrologic basins common in arid to semiarid regions worldwide naturally form when a outflow by surface water or groundwater flows is absent or small and b evaporation is the dominant mechanism by which water exits the basin hardie and eugster 1970 eugster and hardie 1978 jones and deocampo 2003 because tds concentrations in precipitation are low around 10 1 mg l most tds originates from rock water reactions in surface runoff and in the subsurface salts may accumulate at the evaporative boundaries of the basin at or immediately below the surface where discharging groundwater evaporates or at the bottom of a surface depression in terminal and sometimes ephemeral lakes that collect runoff baseflow and spring outflow wooding et al 1997 richter and kreitler 1986 examples of naturally closed hydrologic basins with saline features at or near the land surface are found worldwide playas and salt flats such as those in the great basin usa and salar de uyuni bolivia saline lakes like the great salt lake usa and the dead sea middle east in extremely arid deserts such as the arabian and atacama and in the unsaturated subsurface of semi arid regions with insufficient precipitation to recharge groundwater scanlon et al 1997 kreitler 1993 in this paper we argue that sufficient groundwater development can lower groundwater levels in an open to semi open and relatively fresh basin thus converting it into a closed basin which then salinates in a distinctly different manner from those described in 1 4 first moderate to large amounts of groundwater development may result in sufficient reduction of groundwater levels that reduce or eliminate natural baseflow to streams russo and lall 2017 barlow and leake 2015 hunt 1999 and reverse existing groundwater gradients at subsurface outflow boundaries fig 1 a progressively greater closed basin conditions diminish and eventually entirely eliminate natural tds export from the groundwater basin fig 1b furthermore if the basin is irrigated crop evapotranspiration becomes the dominant water outflow from the basin leaving behind salts that are returned to the groundwater basin via irrigation return flows and recharge from precipitation across the globe water level stabilization in such overdrafted basins is sometimes achieved by importing additional surface water however water imports can add significant salt to the basin moreover even when balancing the water budget with imported water this does not stop the abcsal process if groundwater does not have exits e g baseflow to streams or lateral subsurface outflow and if water continues to leave the basin predominantly through evapotranspiration which leaves behind salts although these latter two conditions are similar to those in a naturally closed basin 2 hardie and eugster 1970 jones and deocampo 2003 vertical groundwater fluxes under abcsal are in the opposite direction from natural basin salinization and thus the location of salinization is different in a naturally closed basin salinization occurs at the land surface due to upward groundwater discharge under abcsal pumping and recharge from irrigation lead to a net downward flux then mobilize salts left behind by irrigated crops downward into the production zone of the groundwater basin before they are recycled by pumping wells to the land surface and the process repeats importantly we point out that the long term continuous decline of groundwater storage is not a necessary condition for abcsal rather even in basins where groundwater levels are stable and hence assumed to be free of overdraft as long as they remain physically closed they will salinate furthermore although for simplicity we describe basins as either open or closed in reality closure ranges from 0 100 i e fully open to fully closed and gradations of basin closure exist which impact the rate of salinization and hence the long term temporal and vertical spatial salt distribution except for the most extremely exploited aquifers one of which we explore in this study many aquifers will fall somewhere between fully open to fully closed and not exactly at one extreme in this research we illustrate the development of abcsal in a historically open freshwater basin using the agriculturally intensive tulare lake basin tlb in california s southern central valley as a case study previous research in the tlb has shown evidence of salt accumulation in groundwater via simple water and salt budgets schmidt 1975 and shallow aquifer salt accumulation from sediment dissolution processes in highly soluble calcium and magnesium carbonates and sulfates schoups et al 2005 other studies have shown that tds concentrations in tlb groundwater have increased over the last century hansen et al 2018 lindsey and johnson 2018 and suggested this is the result of pumping for municipal and irrigation supply which has caused shallow higher tds groundwater to be driven downward into deeper aquifers we are not aware of prior work that has placed these trends into the context of abcsal or quantified potential rates of salinization across a range of aquifer depths and timescales our aim in this study is to assess the first order salt balance and timescales over which the tlb as a large production aquifer system becomes regionally degraded over most of the vertical extent of its nearly 200 m thick main production zone we conservatively assume that under recent state regulation groundwater overdraft is arrested but not reversed we compare timescales of abcsal degradation against the estimated lifespan of the greater central valley aquifer i e 390 years at historical overdraft rates faunt et al 2009 challenge the notion that the depletion of groundwater storage is a more urgent issue than the degradation of groundwater quality in the tlb and in other basins with abcsal conditions and consider the water management implications and the steps required to reverse extensive basin scale groundwater salinization the management would likely involve both hydrologic opening of the basin to provide natural outlets for salt a reduction of sources of salinity and the development of regional groundwater quality management models fogg and labolle 2006 crwqcb 2018 the adaptation might involve the eventual desalination of most groundwater pumped from the basin producing a future economic burden that should be anticipated and evaluated as it bears on the security of water food and energy resources this paper is organized as follows first we describe the hydrogeology water budget and water quality of the study site then we describe and justify our approach involving a simple 1d mixing cell solute transport model next we present our results and finally we discuss the implications of the research the limitations of our approach and the extensibility of the study to other areas 2 methods 2 1 study area in selecting the tlb as our study site we looked for 1 a history of intensive groundwater pumping and irrigation 2 availability of historical water budget and water quality data and 3 social and economic significance the tlb fig 2 occupies the southern third of the central valley california and is bounded by the coast ranges to the west the tehachapi mountains to the south and the southern sierra nevada to the east geology strongly influences dissolved solid concentrations in the clastic sedimentary aquifer system composed of fluvial and alluvial fan deposits calcium and magnesium sulfates and carbonates in coast range sediment in the western tlb are more soluble than sediments from the predominately crystalline rocks of the sierra nevada to the east thus the groundwater in the western basin tends to have higher tds fujii and swain 1995 belitz and heimes 1990 deverel and millard 1988 fresh groundwater in the tlb spans depths from land surface to around 1 000 m where brackish water and marine deposits limit the development of groundwater resources desimone et al 2010 kang and jackson 2016 above this deep brackish zone is a major freshwater aquifer system in combination with a natural endowment of significant but intermittent runoff from surrounding uplands abundant fresh groundwater has transformed the tlb into one of the most heavily irrigated and economically productive agricultural regions in the world hanak et al 2011 at its peak in the 1980s approximately 14 164 km 2 of its 44 110 km 2 were irrigated tnc 2014 today roughly 12 140 km 2 remain irrigated with a total gross value of all agricultural crops and products at 23 4 billion usd in 2017 fankhauser 2018 hook 2018 l wright 2018 m wright 2017 although a tlb water budget from pre development times is not available the surface and subsurface hydrologic characteristics of the basin which is a part of the larger central valley sedimentary basin fig 2 indicate that it was hydrologically open we first discuss the surface hydrologic aspects despite the shallow topographic depression in which tulare lake used to exist the freshwater lake periodically filled up and overflowed northward into the san joaquin river grunsky 1898 davis et al 1959 providing an outlet for any accumulated salts reconstructions of historical tulare lake level indicate that in 19 of the 29 years from 1850 to 1878 it filled up and flowed out of the basin to the north usbr 1970 this water and salt exit via intermittent surface inundation would be different than say baseflow to a stream but would accomplish the same flushing function no overflows are documented after 1878 due to the diversion of tributary waters for agricultural irrigation and municipal water use ecorp 2007 the subsurface characteristics also indicate open hydrologic conditions there is significant evidence that groundwater flowed northward into the adajacent san joaquin basin in pre development times circa early 1900s this evidence includes 1 historical measurements of central valley groundwater tds showing lowest tds values in the tlb with increasing tds to the north into the san joaquin basin mendenhall et al 1916 table 23 consistent with northward groundwater flow and the accompanying down hydraulic gradient groundwater chemistry evolution that is routinely observed in sedimentary basins e g palmer and cherry 1984 2 the regional south to north topographic gradient to provide the driving force for gravity driven flow in the same direction out of the tlb even if there existed shallower local groundwater flow components from north to south at the subtle depression that collected tulare lake e g refer to classic work of tóth 1970 on topographically controlled gravity driven flow systems and 3 horizontal stratification of fine and coarse textured sediments in the central valley sedimentary basin that results in much lower effective hydraulic conductivities in the vertical direction than the horizontal e g weissmann et al 2002 and faunt et al 2009 thereby minimizing influence of subtle topographic features like the tulare lake depression on all but the shallowest groundwater flow components e g refer to tóth 1970 and related work summarizing our conceptual model of the pre development tlb hydrologic system is one in which the subtle topographic depression that collected the typically 12 m deep tulare lake preston 1990 together with the periodic overflow of the lake and discharge to the north resulted in a partly open surface drainage system further the larger topographic and geologic structure of the basin together with groundwater chemistry evidence indicates there was net northward groundwater flow making the tlb groundwater system an open hydrologic basin in pre development times parts of tlb may have been salinating to some degree before development due to shallow evaporation of groundwater and surface water case 3 in introduction in contrast to the abcsal process that we describe in this paper portions of the tlb closed under pre development conditions would lead to salt accumulation in and near its playas e g buena vista lake tulare lake an evaporative boundary of the basin and endpoint to all surface water discharge case 2 above this is consistent with observations of high salinity near and in these lakebeds hansen et al 2018 fujii and swain 1995 although there exist local areas of shallow groundwater with elevated salinity on the west side of the tlb these areas are typically associated with salt mobilization out of alluvial sediments originating from marine sedimentary source rocks in the coast ranges and not from basin closure by the time regional groundwater levels were mapped in the early twentieth century the tlb showed signs of closure groundwater flow across the northern boundary was minimal and flowed north to south into the tlb mendenhall et al 1916 ingerson 1941 although pre groundwater development pre 1850 water budgets are unavailable two large scale regional groundwater flow models of the central valley brush et al 2013 faunt et al 2009 provide decadal groundwater budgets for early 1932 1941 and post groundwater development 2000 2009 timescales relative to the decadal hydrologic water year budgets of early groundwater development post groundwater development water budgets show much higher pumping crop evapotranspiration and recharge brush et al 2013 as groundwater levels fell gaining streams transitioned to losing streams and subsurface inflow along the northern basin boundary slightly increased fig 2 groundwater discharge to surface water almost entirely ceased surface water exits the basin in rare years when the kings kaweah and kern rivers produce sufficiently large floods mostly runoff from the surrounding uplands evapotranspiration from irrigated crops has become the dominant water outflow and this flow is much greater than it was during early groundwater development brush et al 2013 taken together these hydrologic changes have transitioned the tlb into an anthropogenically closed groundwater system with commensurate onset of abcsal 2 2 mixing cell model development given the large space and time scales of interest and the large scale effectively one dimensional vertical flow conditions in the basin due to pumping and recharge we used a lumped parameter approach based on upscaling water fluxes of a fully three dimensional groundwater model although local hydrogeologic conditions vary and can lead to locally complex three dimensional flow and transport our focus here is on large scale salinization behavior and time scales thus an upscaled model was appropriately parsimonious moreover upscaling the advection dispersion equation to regional scales remains a scientific and computing challenge guo et al 2020 guo et al 2019 beyond the scope of this study mixing cell models also called discrete state compartment models are computationally inexpensive and have successfully been used in place of complex flow models to provide rapid first order estimates of water budgets mass flux and contaminant concentrations campana 1975 campana and simpson 1984 campana 1987 carroll et al 2008 kirk and campana 1990 tc 1982 a mixing cell approach segments the system into a set of control volumes in each iteration the incoming water displaces an equivalent volume of water then mixes with the remaining cell contents and new concentrations are calculated at each cell specifically we use the modified mixing cell model consistent with fick s law tc 1982 here we represent the tlb groundwater system through a one dimensional vertical column of discrete control volumes cells given the predominance of vertical downward flow at the aquifer system scale we assume that each cell consists of a fraction f of sediments participating in groundwater flow and salt transport with porosity η we neglect flows and rock water interactions in sediments not participating in transport of proportion 1 f more details below the thickness of each cell is chosen such that the advective travel time δ t of water and salt downward through each cell is exactly 50 years synchronized tipping bucket model see eq 4 below thus full mixing occurs at each cell even as the groundwater flow velocity decreases with depth to determine the mixing cell parameters water fluxes throughout the vertical domain e g recharge vertical flow rate pumping are obtained by averaging i e mass conservative upscaling the tlb portion of a fully three dimensional heterogeneous groundwater flow model of the central valley brush et al 2013 the salt accumulation in a mixing cell at a discrete time k is a mass balance of the initial mass m k m incoming

c k 1 m k m k in m k out ρ v vf η where v l 3 is the total cell volume f is the fraction of sediments actively participating in groundwater flow and salt transport η is the porosity of those sediments and ρ ml 3 is rock water interaction coefficient the fraction f is found to be 0 99 brush et al 2013 which in the c2vsim model includes all textures but the corcoran clay a relatively impermeable clay layer comprising around 1 of the model volume porosity η is set to 0 40 the average for the tlb coarse and fine sediment porosities do not appreciably differ averaging around 0 40 with an interquartile range of 0 39 0 41 for all textures as demonstrated in abundant core analyses johnson et al 1968 and discussed further in appendix table a 5 and fig a 9 hence we did not consider varying η across aquifer layers to account for mass contribution from natural dissolution of geologic minerals we define a zero order source term called the rock water interaction coefficient ρ ml 3 rock dissolution along groundwater flow paths is well documented in sedimentary aquifers palmer and cherry 1984 oetting et al 1996 tóth 1999 mahlknecht et al 2004 cloutier et al 2008 we obtain a representative mass dissolution rate from the slope of a representative tds profile for the tlb from land surface to the base of fresh water williamson et al 1989 kang and jackson 2016 the product of the rock water interaction coefficient ρ and the cell volume v is the additional mass accumulated from rock water interactions in the cell we also evaluate an alternative scenario with ρ 0 we solve 3 sequentially over the stacked mixing cells from top to bottom and across seven 50 year time steps from 1960 initial condition to 2310 synchronized tipping bucket approach to obtain the variation of salinity with depth and time the discretization δ z j of the stacked series of mixing cells fig 3 is driven by the time step δ t 50 years and the representative basin scale vertical darcy velocity q j within the j th mixing cell 4 δ z j q j f η δ t since q j is depth dependent we solve 4 sequentially for j 1 m beginning at the water table to compute the vertical discretization of the stacked mixing cell model here we assume that the inflow into a mixing cell q j 1 j is representative of the flow rate q j throughout the cell thus to compute cell thicknesses with eq 4 the pumping p j lateral basin flow i j or subsidence flow c j fig 3 conceptually flow into or out of the mixing cell bottom the following sections provide further details on the parametrization of 3 and 4 2 3 boundary conditions model parameters and stochastic simulation initial conditions boundary conditions and model parameters are informed by the c2vsim groundwater flow model developed by the california department of water resources brush et al 2013 publicly available water quality data cswrcb 2019c and previous field studies of the tlb the following describes methods used to determine 1 water and salt budgets 2 salt fluxes from evaporative concentration and pumped groundwater 3 the groundwater velocity depth profile 4 the initial tds depth profile and 5 spatial parameters and aquifer properties lastly we discuss the simulation timescale and the role of stochastic simulation 2 3 1 water and salt budgets the water budget is based on c2vsim version 3 02 a 3 layer and 1 392 element regional scale finite element groundwater flow model of california s central valley alluvial aquifer system brush et al 2013 c2vsim is an application of the integrated water flow model iwfm dogrul et al 2018 a water resources management and planning model that simulates surface water stream groundwater interaction vadose zone flow and groundwater flow in the c2vsim model california s central valley aquifer is separated into 21 subregions and detailed land surface root zone and groundwater budgets for each subregion are calculated at monthly time steps from the 1923 to 2009 hydrologic years the tlb is represented by subregions 14 21 because of its detailed representation of surface groundwater interaction groundwater pumping three dimensional aquifer structure representation of significant land subsidence in the study site and calibration c2vsim was chosen as a reasonable representation of the tlb water budgets groundwater velocities and thus chosen to develop the mixing cell model the c2vsim model was run for the 40 year period from 1961 10 31 to 2001 09 30 to obtain an average annual tlb groundwater budget an equivalent average annual landscape root zone budget is provided in appendix table a 2 this post groundwater development water management time frame is characterized by pumping and overdraft in addition to wet dry above normal below normal and critical water year types the c2vsim change in groundwater storage is defined as 5 δ s r b c i n p where δ s is change in groundwater storage l 3 r is basin recharge from streams lakes and watersheds l 3 b is lateral mountain front recharge from streams and watersheds l 3 c is subsidence based flow from clay compaction l 3 i is subsurface inflow from the north l 3 n is net deep percolation predominately from irrigation water l 3 and p is groundwater pumping l 3 the dominant budget terms are p r and n table 1 to demonstrate abcsal under long term conditions that avoid further overdraft but not basin closure we solve the mixing cell model eqs 30 and 4 alternatively for δ s alt δ c alt 0 overdraft is eliminated with an alternate budget table 1 which adds managed aquifer recharge m as inflow to the top mixing cell fig 3 and reduces pumping to an alternative pumping level p alt we add m 0 68 km 3 which was determined by a prior study as the maximum theoretical recharge available to the san joaquin valley which includes the tlb assuming unlimited infrastructure and water transfer ability hanak et al 2019 eliminating overdraft in this way effectively maintains a steady state saturated model that remains closed to due to lack of baseflow and groundwater outflow hence the water level is immobile but the salt front can move thus simulating salt migration without drying out cells due to overdraft since m represents captured surface water flow we assign it the same tds as natural water 32 5 mg l discussed below we also simulated m with a tds of 0 mg l appendix table a 9 and found that it had a negligible impact on resulting salt concentrations presented in this study appendix table a 8 the alternate reduced pumping p alt is computed by rearranging 5 adding m and setting δ s alt c alt 0 6 p alt r b m i n therefore the modified no overdraft alternate groundwater budget is 7 δ s alt r b c alt m i n p alt 0 the salt budget is calculated by assigning a tds concentration to each term in the groundwater budget 7 tds for natural waters e g stream lake and managed aquifer recharge budget terms were determined to be 32 5 mg l by computing the median of the sampling distribution of sample tds medians in tlb stream samples usgs 2016 from 1951 2019 appendix fig a 7 and table a 3 similarly the tds of diverted surface water was calculated to be 264 5 mg l as the average annual water and salt budget from 1985 1994 of two major surface water conveyance structures the california state water project and the state water project cismowski et al 2006 appendix table a 3 salt and water budgets are detailed in table 1 2 3 2 velocity depth profile to explicitly solve for the mixing cell discretization 4 we fit a linear model to the c2vsim vertical darcy velocities reported for each finite element cell in the three layer c2vsim grid at the layer to layer boundaries due to increases in recharge and pumping caused by groundwater development and irrigation the groundwater flow system is vertically dominant and thus supports the application of a 1d vertically oriented model to account for groundwater velocity change in the alternate groundwater budget 7 groundwater velocity is scaled proportional to the decrease in vertical volumetric flow rate p alt p c 0 85 a 15 reduction this is equivalent to the ratio of net downward volumetric flow in the alternate budget to the net downward volumetric flow in the historical budget table 1 8 q z β 0 β 1 z p alt p c where β 0 and β 1 are the regression coefficients appendix table a 4 and the overall change reduction in velocity is 15 mixing cell thickness 4 is determined by computing q j from 8 for the depth z of the bottom of the mixing cell j 1 top of cell j to ensure consistency between the water balance terms in 5 and the approximated vertical velocity profile 8 we compute the water mass balance error mb error j for each mixing cell j 9 mb error j q j 1 j i j p alt j q j j 1 for the uppermost mixing cell j 1 we rearrange 9 replacing q j 1 j for the sum of n r and b and ignoring subsurface inflow i j fig 3 10 mb error 1 n r b m p alt 1 q 1 2 the cell by cell budget and mass balance errors which are effectively zero and equivalent to the cell by cell change in storage are reported in appendix table a 7 2 3 3 evapoconcentration and pumping evapotranspiration removes a majority of total applied water leaving behind dissolved solids in the crop rootzone that eventually migrate into groundwater we model the evapoconcentration of tds in total applied water a combination of pumped groundwater and imported surface water diversions by accounting for the application efficiency burt et al 1997 and thus the fraction of water that remains after evapotranspiration 11 c n m d m p v d v p 1 1 e a c d p 1 e a c n is the concentration of net deep percolation after accounting for evapotranspiration m d and m p are the mass and v d and v p are the volume of surface water diversions d and pumping p respectively c d p is the concentration of total applied water from surface water diversions and pumping calculated by mixing diversions and pumped groundwater in their respective proportions see appendix table a 4 and e a is the application efficiency which has a measured regional average of 0 78 in the tulare basin sandoval solis et al 2013 and agrees with measured values in hydrologically similar areas hanson et al 1995 howell 2003 alternatively the c2vsim landscape soil water budget appendix table a 2 provides an application efficiency e a of 0 88 when considering the amount of water infiltrating into the soil and deep percolation for sensitivity analysis we run simulations for several e a between 0 78 and 0 88 to further explore model outcome uncertainty for the stacked mixing cell model we assume that p alt in the no overdraft groundwater budget 6 is distributed uniformly with depth from the water table to the last mixing cell m similarly we assume lateral inflow i is uniformly distributed across depth from cell 2 to cell m therefore pumping is proportional to mixing cell thickness and the salt mass flux due to pumping during time step k in mixing cell j is 12 m j k v j f η f η i 1 n v i pc j k noting that the f η term drops out and summing over all mixing cells at time k gives the total mass flux from groundwater pumping m p k 13 m p k j 1 n v j i 1 n v i pc j k 2 3 4 initial tds depth profile the initial tds depth profile is determined by fitting a linear model to the pre 1960 tds depth measurements fig 4 cswrcb 2019c due to the influence of freshwater recharge at the land surface and rock water interactions pre 1960 tds generally increases with depth consistent with observations of increasing tds with depth in the region kang and jackson 2016 kharaka and thordsen 1992 desimone et al 2010 2 3 5 ensemble simulation we assign a uniform probability distribution to the parameters of which we are least certain and discrete values to those that are measured appendix table a 6 then perform monte carlo simulation to generate an ensemble output the mixing cell model is evaluated 1 000 times which the computational simplicity of a lumped model permits modeling uncertainty in this way with a distributed parameter 3d flow and transport model would be computationally prohibitive parameter ranges are estimated from literature for rock water interaction coefficient williamson et al 1989 kang and jackson 2016 detailed in section 2 2 as described in section 2 3 3 application efficiency is both measured sandoval solis et al 2013 and calculated from c2vsim brush et al 2013 to show the influence of rock water interactions on the progression of closed basin salinization we simulate two basic scenarios 1 no rock water interactions mass accumulates from water budget inputs 2 rock water interactions are present mass accumulates from water budget inputs but also internally via rock water interactions see section 2 2 for details 3 results 3 1 groundwater and salt budget the average historical c2vsim groundwater budget in the tlb from 1961 10 31 to 2001 09 30 table 1 reflects post groundwater development conditions pumping removes an average of 6 76 km 3 yr from the groundwater system natural recharge from streams lakes and watersheds adds an average of 2 45 km 3 yr and net deep percolation of agricultural irrigation adds an average of 1 89 km 3 yr smaller sources of water inflow include subsidence flow 0 57 km 3 yr lateral mountain front recharge from streams and watersheds 0 24 km 3 yr and subsurface inflow from the north 0 01 km 3 yr the alternate budget table 1 used in this study eliminates overdraft δ s 0 and is identical to historical budget described above except that pumping p alt is reduced to 5 26 km 3 yr managed aquifer recharge m is added at a rate of 0 68 km 3 yr and subsidence flow c alt is reduced to 0 importantly in this alternative budget the basin remains closed salt inputs to the system fig 5 a come from pumped groundwater water budget terms and rock water interactions groundwater pumping for agriculture is unlike other water budget terms i m r b and rock water interactions in that it does not add new salt into the system but rather recycles existing salt from deeper layers to the land surface and back into shallow groundwater via irrigation discussed in section 3 2 in the no rock water interactions scenario ρ 0 the median mass recycled by pumped groundwater exceeds the mass input of all other water budget terms by a factor of 2 0 to 3 9 depending on the timeframe considered when rock water interactions are present ρ 0 they initially contribute a comparable mass to groundwater pumping around 4 mt yr but with time salt accumulates in the aquifer and the mass recycled by groundwater pumping exceeds the mass imparted by rock water interactions fig 5a annually surface water diversions add 1 5 mt yr of salt to the study site this is around 13 times the amount of all other non pumping water budget terms combined i m r b which add only 0 11 mt yr we estimate that rock water interactions add between 3 3 and 4 6 mt yr of salt this exceeds the mass introduced by imported surface water and is comparable to the mass recycled by groundwater pumping due to the closed basin hydrology of the study site there are no exits for salt to leave the system instead pumping and irrigation recycle salts within the basin and evapotranspiration by crops at the land surface increases the concentration of net deep percolation which recharges groundwater fig 5b evapoconcentration by crops at the land surface increases the average concentration of total applied water pumped groundwater combined with surface water diversions by 5 1 6 8 times its original amount regardless of whether rock water interactions are absent or present as previously discussed since pumped groundwater concentration increases with time total applied water and thus net deep percolation also become increasingly saline over time 3 2 progression of groundwater salinization the shallow aquifer 36 m is heavily impacted by the recycling of salts via pumping and irrigation and exceeds the freshwater concentration threshold 1 000 mg l within decadal timescales fig 6 intermediate 132 m and deep aquifers 187 m exceed 1 000 mg l within century long timescales uncertainty in the salt balance results from parameter uncertainty expressed in the monte carlo simulation section 2 3 5 which affects the distribution of calculated salt concentrations at the salt front deeper layer insensitivity results from being insulated from the salt front a top down source accordingly shallow layer uncertainty increases over time because salt is continuously added through top down irrigation and recharge let us first summarize the results with no rock water interactions at the beginning of the simulation year 1960 initial tds concentration increases gradually with depth fig 4 and appendix table a 8 shallow aquifer salinity is 506 mg l after 50 yrs with ρ 0 average shallow aquifer salinity reaches a median concentration of 934 mg l with an interquartile range iqr of 829 1 083 mg l thus the tds depth profile at t 50 begins to invert i e shallow aquifer salinity exceeds deep aquifer salinity consistent with modern day observed tds depth relationships in the tlb hansen et al 2018 after 200 yrs year 2160 shallow aquifers reach brackish tds levels with a median tds of 1 241 mg l iqr 1 031 1 576 mg l finally after 300 yrs year 2310 median shallow aquifer tds approaches nearly 1 477 mg l iqr 1 175 1 993 mg l intermediate and deep aquifers are impacted much later than shallow systems and approach the freshwater tds threshold on timescales of two to three centuries after 200 yrs year 2160 intermediate aquifer median tds is 907 mg l iqr 830 1 017 mg l after 300 yrs year 2260 deep aquifers iqr 841 995 mg l experience the first arrival of the lumped salt front in the rock water interactions present scenario ρ 0 the progression of groundwater salinization follows approximately the same trend and timescale as the scenario without rock water interactions described above but the resulting concentrations are significantly greater and deep groundwater salinates faster in both scenarios the greatest change in salinity occurs in the shallow aquifer within the first 50 yrs which is due to the introduction of mass from total applied water i e diversions and pumped groundwater and the inability for that mass to exit because of basin closure moreover regardless of whether rock water interactions are included the slope of the tds depth profile fig 6 gradually inverts and amplifies and shallow groundwater becomes saltier than deep groundwater thus even in the absence of rock water interactions moderate and constant salt inputs mostly due to recycled groundwater and imported surface water are sufficient to salinate shallow aquifers within decades and deep aquifers within centuries 3 3 additional perspective on the model lumped mixing cell models have a relatively small number of parameters are computationally inexpensive conceptually simple and importantly can represent the dominant hydrologic features of a system these strengths come with some tradeoffs mixing cell models can be used to simplify groundwater flow and contaminant transport by ignoring horizontal flow geologic heterogeneity dispersion diffusion sorption and reactive transport strong vertical hydraulic gradients induced by pumping in agriculturally dominant systems like the tlb produce vertically dominated flow systems brush et al 2013 faunt et al 2009 in upscaling these distributed models to the regional scale the dominant role of vertical flux becomes apparent and explains why the mixing cell model captures the salient features of regional abcsal degradation for more sub regional or local applications a fully three dimensional distributed parameter model representing the effects of preferential flow and tailing on solute transport would be more appropriate zhang et al 2006 guo et al 2019 guo et al 2020 henri and harter 2019 additionally we assume that the early groundwater development tds depth relationship is approximately equal to observed pre 1960 tds data over the model domain 212 m deep these measurements appendix fig a 8 are well distributed we experimented with different values for the initial tds depth profile and found that the results were relatively insensitive to the initial conditions as the imported salt and the salt generated by rock water interactions greatly exceeds the initial salt load moreover in this study we model tds as a lumped term yet it should be noted that tds is a combination of many solutes which differ in their impact to crops toxicity and reactivity with the subsurface in the tlb the dominant salts include cations and anions from geochemical weathering of multi mineralic clastic sedimentary deposits containing carbonate as well as silicate minerals e g calcium magnesium sodium carbonate e g sodium calcium bicarbonate schoups et al 2005 hansen et al 2018 but in other basins this may not be the case therefore the impact to fresh groundwater in other basins depend on the types and relative abundances of solutes present nevertheless the geochemical make up of sedimentary particles in the central valley of california is typical of that found in many other sedimentary basins lastly in our tlb study site historical groundwater pumping has reduced groundwater levels such that basin outflow even in rare wet years is essentially negligible hence we found it appropriate and parsimonious to use an average water budget that maintains constant hydrologic basin closure over time however other basins both open and closed will exhibit seasonal annual and decadal hydrologic variability for instance extreme rainfall and net deep percolation can temporarily induce basin outflows that export some of the accumulated salts the degree of which is a function of the salinity of the source s responsible for basin discharge e g surface water shallow or deep groundwater these cycles are not incorporated in the model presented but in sites where they are important they should be included 4 discussion 4 1 abcsal threatens regional groundwater quality and sustainable yield in this study we show that abcsal is a progressive regional scale hydrologic process where salts accumulate within an aquifer because basin closure eliminates exits for the salts in the tlb our calculated abcsal timescales have similar timescales to aquifer depletion are consistent with 3d random walk salt transport simulations and agree with observed decadal changes in shallow groundwater salinity in the tlb our estimates of decadal timescales for shallow aquifer 36 m salinization and two to three centuries for intermediate 132 m and deep aquifers 187 m are similar to the estimated 390 year timescale of central valley aquifer depletion by scanlon et al 2012 who assumed a remaining water storage of 860 km 3 in the year 2000 and a depletion rate of 2 2 km 3 yr scanlon et al 2012 also noted that aquifer lifespan is likely shorter than 390 years in the tlb due to focused groundwater depletion in the area thus abcsal which constitutes a slow moving form of regional groundwater quality degradation may significantly constrain groundwater sustainable yield on similar timescales to aquifer depletion in the tlb this study s predicted salinization time frames i e decades for shallow systems centuries for deep systems are consistent with random walk salt and nitrate particle transport simulations in detailed 3d heterogeneous alluvial aquifers henri and harter 2019 zhang et al 2006 which suggests that the simple mixing cell model captures key transport dynamics thus these results provide a useful basis for future research using more complex distributed parameter regional scale transport models incorporating geologic heterogeneity and transient boundary conditions moreover measured tds change from historic to modern time periods in the tlb agree with this study s modeled changes in tds over similar time periods and horizontally averaged depth scales hansen et al 2018 measured a 110 850 mg l interquartile range iqr increase in shallow aquifer 50 m tds from historic 1910 to modern 1993 2015 time periods in the tlb our results indicate an iqr increase in shallow aquifer 37 m tds of 323 717 mg l depending on the inclusion of rock water interactions ρ in eq 3 and over similar timescales 1960 to 2010 especially given that groundwater development for agriculture in the tlb largely commenced around 1950 this study s smaller iqr compared to hansen et al 2018 may suggest that our model parameters are over constrained and thus do not reproduce the wider distribution of observed tds iqr increase however it is also possible that the larger iqr from hansen et al 2018 indicates insufficient sampling i e a perfectly random spatial sample with enough observations might yield a more constrained distribution of tds measurements that more closely approximate the true population iqr nonetheless given the broad aim of this study to estimate the approximate timescales of regionally downward salinization of the production aquifer under abcsal the evolution of mass flux described by our model generally agrees with observations of shallow aquifer tds increase in the tlb unsustainable groundwater management eventually leads to undesirable effects giordano 2009 sustainable groundwater management act 2014 such as chronic groundwater level declines and depletion of groundwater storage well failure pauloo et al 2020 increased energy costs for pumping wada et al 2010 land subsidence smith et al 2017 sea water intrusion zektser et al 2005 desiccation of groundwater dependent ecosystems tnc 2014 and groundwater quality degradation smith et al 2018 foster et al 2000 the negative externalities above are recognized consequences of unsustainable groundwater extraction however abcsal which progressively deteriorates groundwater quality over decades to centuries may be considered an additional unrecognized threat to regional groundwater quality and sustainability in the tlb and a constraint on groundwater sustainable yield in other food production regions of the world 4 2 key features of abcsal abcsal arises from groundwater development and is sustained by basin closure once a basin in closed salinization does not depend on groundwater overdraft per se but rather on the closure itself which prevents the basin from discharging salts our findings indicate that the long term fate of basins closed by groundwater pumping may be similar to that of naturally closed basins hardie and eugster 1970 jones and deocampo 2003 however unlike naturally occurring closed basins salt cycling in agriculturally intensive closed basins is driven by human made water management decisions and may progress more rapidly near the onset of the 21st century average vertical groundwater movement in the central valley increased by about 6 times the rate from pre development conditions mainly as a result of agricultural recharge and withdrawal from public supply and irrigation wells williamson et al 1989 strong vertical transport coupled in a closed basin drives tds migration into deeper aquifers although groundwater levels in the tlb are in chronic decline scanlon et al 2012 groundwater overdraft is not a necessary condition for abcsal to occur to illustrate this point we eliminated overdraft eq 7 by increasing clean recharge m tds 32 5 mg l at 0 68 km 3 yr following hanak et al 2019 and reducing pumping by 15 we still observed groundwater salinization even though the water budget remained in steady state we also applied completely clean recharge with tds 0 mg l appendix table a 9 and found that it was insufficient to stop or reverse abcsal because it did not fix the underlying basin closure thus an area will accumulate salts if groundwater storage is stable or even increasing as long as the basin remains closed and salts cannot exit as our model assumes no overdraft conditions the results presented herein may be more severe if overpumping were instead to continue our study shows that abcsal is exacerbated by imported salts in surface water for irrigation and by groundwater pumping although both surface water and groundwater irrigation are present in our study area like overdraft they are not necessary conditions for abcsal however basins with significant groundwater irrigation are particularly susceptible because pumping lowers groundwater levels and cuts off lateral outflow and subsurface baseflow exits thus initiating abcsal the rate and magnitude of salinization depends on a variety of factors e g concentration of total applied water evapoconcentration vertical groundwater velocity but fundamentally depends on the severity of basin closure worldwide basins range from open i e natural salt exits maintain freshwater conditions to partially closed i e some salts exit but some remain and accumulate to fully closed e g salts have no exit and hence accumulate in deep groundwater groundwater salinization timescales in partially closed basins may be longer than those calculated in this study for the tlb which is completely closed conversely some basins may salinate at faster rates than calculated for the tlb depending on the hydrologic features represented in our mixing model 4 3 implications for groundwater management this study demonstrates that if irrigated groundwater basins are operated in a way that hydrologically closes them groundwater salinization abcsal is inevitable it further demonstrates that the timescales of this phenomenon in the tlb are similar to those over which the groundwater in storage would be virtually exhausted according to classic concepts of overdraft we know how to prevent overdraft by for example decreasing pumping or increasing recharge this raises the parallel question how do we prevent abcsal in other words how do we both develop groundwater resources while also keeping groundwater basins hydrologically open conceptually one way to both pump abundant amounts of groundwater and to keep the water table sufficiently shallow to produce groundwater discharge via baseflow and lateral flow to adjacent basins is to significantly increase groundwater recharge in california this could in theory be accomplished by storing less water in surface reservoirs and storing more water in groundwater via managed aquifer recharge operations kocis and dahlke 2017 ghasemizade et al 2019 gailey et al 2019 such an approach would be a radical shift from how our current civilization chooses to store water mainly in surface reservoirs in the discussion that follows we are not so much advocating such a paradigm shift in water resources management as we are suggesting the need for the beginnings of new conversations in water resources management about how to manage groundwater and surface water jointly in a way that better ensures the sustainability of both one challenge of filling up a groundwater basin enough to open it is to manage the water table sufficiently to prevent undesirable waterlogging effects this would require changes in basin water resources management within a carefully managed scheme in which the pumping and recharge are optimized such that the basin opens up while preventing the water table from getting so high that bare soil evaporation exacerbates salinization as happened on the west side of the san joaquin valley schoups et al 2005 belitz and phillips 1995 the technology to monitor a groundwater basin and model it sufficiently to tightly manage it for optimal water table elevations does in fact exist calderwood et al 2020 but would require levels of groundwater monitoring modeling and decision making that are well beyond what is normally done additionally achieving vast quantities of recharge will require strategic siting maples et al 2019 to ensure that the subsurface geology can accommodate the recharge within a time frame that does not jeopardize the health of overlying crops dahlke et al 2018 or negatively impair other land uses in the tlb a further challenge would be that additional sources of clean recharge water within the tlb watersheds are not large enough to accomplish the requisite amounts of recharge as rather drastic amounts of pumping reduction would likely be necessary unless water for recharge could be imported from wetter northern central valley watersheds hanak et al 2019 moreover conditions of reduced pumping and increased recharge will still lead to vertically dominant solute migration thus the application of clean recharge in addition to diluting and lessening the overall salt load will also contribute to vertical migration of the salt front hence the short and long term consequences on groundwater quality of increasing clean recharge and reducing pumping need investigation which in turn would require the development of regional groundwater quality management models fogg and labolle 2006 kourakos and harter 2014 if re operation of the groundwater basin to increase groundwater storage and open the basin does not happen water users in the tlb will ultimately be faced with desalinating pumped groundwater for drinking water and irrigation the ultimate costs of which remain unknown if inland closed basin salinization proceeds at the historical rates projected in this study the salinity of pumped groundwater may exceed thresholds safe for crop health within decades to a few centuries depending on the depth of pumped groundwater as prices for technology like reverse osmosis fall and arid countries pioneer large scale inland desalination plants for brackish groundwater nativ 2004 tal 2006 desalination cost must be weighed against the cost of adaptive water management e g fallowing fields securing higher quality imported water managed aquifer recharge hanak et al 2019 moreover economically beneficial uses of recovered salt e g manufacturing table salt road salt and mineral commodities may offset desalination costs ongoing un mitigated abcsal may require new technology and irrigation methods to utilize saline water in agriculture beltrán 1999 and the conversion to and development of genetically modified salt tolerant crops yamaguchi and blumwald 2005 in order to probe the full impact of abcsal in the tlb particularly on shallow aquifers which are critical to food and drinking water security worldwide in this study we assumed no water management intervention as salinity accumulates in reality water users would adapt to increasingly saline aquifers by pumping from deeper less saline aquifers fallowing fields mixing saline water with cleaner water and desalinating pumped groundwater two and three centuries into the model the assumption of no intervention is increasingly unrealistic as the concentration of total applied water approaches thresholds dangerous to crop health and is likely to have prompted prior adaptive management we deemed it necessary to evaluate the model at timescales upwards of two and three centuries in order to allow salinization to reach intermediate and deep aquifers as our model assumes no intervention results past 50 years of simulation year 2010 should be interpreted as a worst case scenario urban groundwater pumping might also close groundwater basins however there are two key differences between the hydrology of urban and agricultural areas first in urban areas high evapotranspiration rates and subsequent salt concentration are unlikely unless large volumes of water are applied for landscape irrigation second a substantial fraction of urban groundwater pumping e g drinking water household use and industrial use typically exits the basin via wastewater discharge thus it is not returned to groundwater where it might salinate shallow aquifers as in the case of the tlb hence the threat of abcsal in urban basins is likely to be much less than the threat in agriculturally intensive basins where groundwater is developed and recycled internally 5 conclusions irrigated agriculture in overdrafted aquifer systems supplies much of the world s demand for food dalin et al 2017 in this study we demonstrate that intensive groundwater development can transform a fresh open basin into an evaporation dominated closed basin system a closed basin is effectively a salt sink aquifer salinization is inevitable because dissolved solids in groundwater cannot escape and are recycled through pumpage irrigation and evapoconcentration by crops this study provides a conceptual framework to understand this process which we call anthropogenic basin closure and groundwater salinization abcsal and a mixing cell model to provide first order estimates of ongoing aquifer salinization in the tlb located in california s central valley our model indicates progressive salinization 1 000 mg l of shallow aquifers 36 m within decades intermediate 132 m and deep aquifers 187 m are impacted within two to three centuries the tlb in california s southern central valley is less than one century into this experiment and the first signs of shallow aquifer salinization have been observed hansen et al 2018 crwqcb 2018 estimated salinization timescales are similar to estimated aquifer depletion timescales in the area scanlon et al 2012 underscoring the urgency of regional scale groundwater quality management importantly however while most groundwater quality management frameworks focus on contaminant source control abcsal can only be prevented by allowing contaminant discharge via hydrologic opening of the basin this study is a first order calculation of abcsal in an agriculturally intensive groundwater basin future research should emphasize a more comprehensive representation of subsurface transport processes through the development of groundwater quality management models key research questions that remain include investigating if managed aquifer recharge with relatively clean water may slow groundwater salinization it also remains to be tested if it is possible to reverse groundwater salinization by increasing recharge until a basin fills up and discharges tds into streams and lateral outflow which exit the basin the practical likelihood of this mitigation strategy would require re imagining integrated water resources management with a greater emphasis on subsurface storage ongoing abcsal without intervention may necessitate inland desalination to remediate saline groundwater resources the costs of which remain presently unknown traditionally the concept of long term sustainability of groundwater has hinged on the intuitive notion of not managing the basin in ways that result in eventual exhaustion of the groundwater stores herein we advance the less intuitive concept that long term sustainability of groundwater also hinges on the salt balance which in turn depends on how the groundwater quantity is managed fundamentally abcsal can only be prevented by managing the basin groundwater quality in ways that open the basin credit authorship contribution statement richard a pauloo conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology

4939,the tailing of breakthrough curves btcs commonly observed in the field is often associated with the existence of pools in karst conduits the transient storage model was always used to simulate the btc tailing caused by the storage zone i e pool however the relationship between parameters in this model and pool volume is not clear which is very useful for the understanding of the internal geometry of the conduit using this model or prediction of the contaminant transport in this paper we performed a series of indoor tracer experiments in a pool pipe system involving two different pool structures symmetrical pool sp and asymmetrical pool asp with different positions sizes and numbers to explore the relationship between model parameters and the pool volume several experiments were conducted in the asp of 20 cm with different discharges so as to investigate the effect of turbulent flow condition on model parameters the experimental results indicate that the duration time of the btc and the mean residence time of the solute increase linearly with the pool volume pool size or pool number for the model parameters the cross sectional area of the storage zone as or the calculated volume vs of the storage zone using as shows a good linear relationship with the pool volume vp as 0 0078vp 3e 06 vs 0 8195vp 0 0003 r 2 0 95 indicating a potential to use this parameter which is almost constant with the discharge to roughly estimate the pool volume the cross sectional area a of the main channel does not change with the pool volume and changes little with the discharge it has a close value to the actual cross sectional area the remaining parameters dispersion coefficient d and exchange coefficient α have strong connections with the pool type pool distribution or flow condition which can hardly be used to deduce the internal conduit structure directly the relationships between model parameters and the pool volume are helpful to use the model parameters to identify the conduit geometry roughly keywords transient storage model pool volume tracer experiments solute transport 1 introduction karst aquifers are an important water resource on a global scale since they provide drinking water supply to more than 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2007 most karst aquifers are seen as a two component system the conduit where the majority of transport occurs and the matrix where the majority of fluid and solute are stored ford and williams 2007 chang et al 2019 the conduits in karst aquifers which are the preferential internal drainage paths morales et al 2010 primarily cause the rapid spreading of contaminants and surface water that easily enter the subsurface through swallow holes and mix with groundwater making the aquifer vulnerable to contamination morales et al 2007 studying the solute transport in karst conduits is very significant for the prediction and prevention of groundwater pollution in karst regions the tracer test is a valuable tool goldscheider et al 2008 in karst aquifers to obtain a basic understanding of groundwater trajectories and solute transport processes furthermore the quantitative tracer tests can provide more detailed effective information regarding solute transport such as average velocity dispersion and retardation etc through quantitative analysis of the breakthrough curves btcs field 2002 and interpretation of the btcs based on numerical models hauns et al 2001 massei et al 2006 goldscheider 2008 a significant problem often encountered when evaluating tracer tests conducted in karst aquifers is the occurrence of multi peaked btcs goldscheider et al 2008 dewaide et al 2018 and btc tailing field and pinsky 2000 the multi peaked btcs are commonly attributed to the effect of multiple conduit structures field and leij 2012 dewaide et al 2018 tinet et al 2019 the tailing of btc is mostly associated with solute detention which can be created by the two processes the adsorption desorption process wu and hunkeler 2013 and the interaction between the main conduit and storage zones or dead zones bencala and walters 1983 hauns et al 2001 which is the main factor causing solute detention martin and mcgutchenon 1998 the adsorption desorption process owing to the sediments within karst conduits may be not significant mainly due to the conservative solutes are often used in field tracer tests hence possible sediments within conduits are not considered in this paper the storage zones refer to eddies or vortices in a conduit and matrix surrounding the conduit that are stagnant relative to the faster fluids near the center of the conduit runkel 1998 solutes reside in the storage zones temporarily before returning into the main conduit for the matrix with significant permeability the water and solute are exchanged between the conduits and matrix martin and dean 2001 raeisi et al 2007 ronayne 2013 due to the hydraulic pressure difference between them li et al 2008 frank et al 2019 and the possible matrix diffusion leading to the tailing of btc if the solutes forced into the matrix subsequently back again however this paper mainly focuses on solute transport in the turbulent conduit flow of highly karstified aquifers with limited conduit matrix exchange peterson and wicks 2005 field and pinsky 2000 the storage zones in karst conduits which occur due to eddies or vortices mainly result from the localized variations in conduit geometry pool solution pockets or ceiling pockets or the surface irregularities of conduits scallop deposited sediment cave breakdown etc field and pinsky 2000 hauns et al 2001 field 2002 ford and williams 2007 among these factors the pool is a common structure in the karst conduit to produce a pronounced btc tailing because of slow velocity eddies that form in it which has been highlighted by the previous studies hauns et al 2001 zhang and boufadel 2010 zhao et al 2017 hauns et al 2001 had used the computational flow dynamics cfd model to interpret the btc tailing caused by the flow reversal zone within pools zhang and boufadel 2010 found the pool would enhance longitudinal spreading and increase the residence time of the solute in the stream through the numerical experiments based on mike21 a software developed by dhi water and environment dhi water and environment 2003 zhao et al 2017 conducted several tracer experiments to investigate the effect of the pool within the conduit on the btc these studies mainly focused on the internal physical process of solute transport or the interpretation of the btc tailing caused by the pool however with the increasing application of numerical models to interpret or predict the btc there is a need to investigate the relationship between model parameters and the internal geometry of the conduit i e the pool volume so that we can deduce the conduit geometry from the calibrated parameters by the btc or confine the parameter uncertainty of the model if the internal geometry of the conduit is already known by far few studies concentrate on this topic zhao et al 2017 and zhao et al 2019 conducted a series of tracer experiments to give a preliminary result of qualitative relationships between model parameters and the number of pools within the conduit under different turbulent flow conditions however only one pool size was used in their experiments and the quantitative relationship between model parameters and the pool volume was not clear thus needing more additional work based on their studies in this paper we considered different pool volumes within the conduit by different pool sizes or number of pools to give a more detailed investigation of connections between model parameters and the pool volume in addition we also considered different positions of the pool in the conduit to evaluate the potential influence of the pool position on the btc or model parameters the classical one dimensional advection dispersion model is proved to be too simple to reproduce the pronounced tailing of the btc and extra processes causing the tailing should be considered in the model bencala and walters 1983 runkel 1998 field and pinsky 2000 hauns et al 2001 massei et al 2006 morales et al 2010 field and leij 2012 dewaide et al 2016 tinet et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the transient storage model was widely used to simulate the btcs in karst conduits for its ability to consider the solute exchange processes between the main conduit and the storage zones caused by the existing pool in the conduit dewaide et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 and this model was also widely used to simulate the solute transport in surface streams bencala and walters 1983 roberts et al 2007 jin et al 2009 rana et al 2017 jin et al 2009 observed that the cross sectional area of the storage zone in stream reaches increased with the number of beaver dams rana et al 2017 indicated that adding weirs significantly increased the main channel cross sectional area and storage zone cross sectional area but the exchange with storage zone decreased zhao et al 2019 used the transient storage model to simulate the btcs of the pool pipe system with different flow rates and indicated that the main channel cross sectional area and exchange coefficient generally increased and the storage zone cross sectional area showed a decreasing trend with flow rate yet to the best of our knowledge no studies so far have systematically related the model parameters in conduits to the pool volume owing to the pool geometry in the karst region is often unknown and uncontrollable however the relationship between the model parameters and the pool volume is key for identification of the conduit geometry in the karst region and prediction of solute transport in karst conduits this paper is organized as follows firstly detailed descriptions of the experimental setup the tracer experiments the analysis method of btcs and the transient storage model were introduced subsequently the variation of btcs was analyzed and the relationship between parameters in the transient storage model and the pool volume was explored and discussed finally the implications for identification of conduit geometry were analyzed and the errors of estimated geometrical parameters according to the relationship between model parameters and the pool volume were given the goals of this paper are i to investigate the effect of pool volume on experimental btcs under turbulent flow conditions ii to explore the relationship between model parameters and the pool volume iii to deduce the geometry of karst conduits using model parameters 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup a similar experimental setup to zhao et al 2017 and zhao et al 2019 was used to investigate the effect of the pool volume on btcs this pool pipe system is composed of a supplying reservoir a long circular pvc polyvinyl chloride hose and cubic pools with different sizes a diagram of the principal components of the experimental system is shown in fig 1 the supplying reservoir receives the inflow water and drains the water to the pipe system while keeping a constant head through a float style filled valve when the reservoir was full the valve would terminate the water inflow the size of the reservoir is 40 cm 40 cm 60 cm the reservoir was placed on the roof with an elevation difference of 7 8 m between the reservoir outlet and the pipe outlet providing enough discharge into the pool pipe system the pipe on the ground was operated in a similar rectangular shape fig 2 because of the limited laboratory space based on previous studies zhao et al 2017 two types of cubic pools were designed with different positions of entry and exit the asymmetrical pool asp with a diagonally opposite entry exit and the symmetrical pool sp with a parallel opposite entry exit locating in the pool center fig 3 different pool sizes were designed for asp and sp by considering different side lengths fig 4 l 10 cm 13 cm 15 cm 18 cm 20 cm 23 cm and 25 cm for asp the distance between the entry center and exit center equals zero point six multiplied by the side length fig 3b for each pool there is a vent on the top to exhaust air bubbles to keep the pipe and pools filled with water before the tracer injection as shown in fig 1 the discharge in the pipe is changed by an controlling valve and measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter gfm82 series with the measurement range from 0 5 m3 h to 21 2 m3 h and a resolution of 1 0 to ensure the stability of the discharge measurements the flow meter was placed 4 m downstream from the controlling valve and 4 m upstream from the tracer injection point for a laboratory scale physical model to be representative of the real scale system the criteria of geometric and dynamic similarity need to be fulfilled chanson 1999 wu and hunkeler 2013 mohammadi et al 2020 a laboratory scale physical model is geometrically similar to the real scale system if the length ratio of λ lfs lls as a length scale factor is fixed for all length scales chanson 1999 to maintain the same shape mohammadi et al 2020 where lfs and lls are the lengths of real and laboratory scales respectively due to circular or elliptical cross sections are common for phreatic cave passage ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 a circular pipe is selected to be approximately representative of a karst conduit which has been frequently used to investigate solute transport in karst conduits field and leij 2012 zhao et al 2017 the length ratio can be calculated as λ lf l where l and lf are the lengths of the laboratory pipe system and the real karst conduit respectively the pool volume will be λ 3 multiplied by the volume of the cubic pool which is in the realistic range hauns et al 2001 for full filled flow in the completely pressurized conduits the dynamic similarity is achieved provided that the reynolds number is the same between the experimental pipe and the real karst conduit the velocity in the real conduit should be v λ assuming constant fluid kinematic viscosity between them if v is the average velocity in the experimental pipe the average velocity of 0 5 m s in the experiments corresponds to a field velocity which is in a realistic range ford and williams 2007 barbera et al 2018 if the ratio belongs to one order of magnitude when designing the laboratory scale physical model it is reasonable to neglect roughness and tortuosity of the real karst conduits field 2002 zhang et al 2019 because they cannot produce a pronounced tailing of btc that can be caused by the pools and is the main study focus of this paper hence the simplified pool pipe system is much simpler compared to the real karst conduits with complex internal structure including roughness tortuosity and sinuosity etc and then the similitudes cannot be completely fulfilled 2 2 tracer experiments the conservative solute of 100 g l nacl solution was used as the tracer in the experiments and the tap water was utilized as a background solution given its relatively stable electrical conductivity the conductivity of tap water was measured before and during each experiment continuously and was around 1000 50 μs cm normally based on long time monitoring it is impractical to use deionized water in the experiments for huge water demand before the tracer experiments the valve was adjusted to keep a discharge we need the tracer experiments were conducted with merely a discharge of 0 884 m3 h in all pool structures except the asp of 20 cm in which the experiments were performed with various discharges of 0 530 m3 h 0 707 m3 h 0 884 m3 h 1 060 m3 h and 1 237 m3 h respectively so as to investigate the effects of turbulent flow condition on solute transport parameters the experiments were conducted by xiaoer zhao and qi li in the laboratory of water environment simulation in qingdao university of technology in the experiments two different ways different pool sizes l fig 4 or different number of pools n with the same size fig 5 were considered to change the pool volume vp in the pipe in addition the pool can be located at different positions in karst conduits which may also have a potential influence on the btcs even though the pool volume was the same therefore the tracer experiments with the same pool volume but different positions l1 l4 in fig 6 were also conducted to investigate the possible effect of the pool position on btcs from l1 to l4 the distance between the pool and outlet increases gradually for all experiments the straight length of the pool pipe system l is 104 5 m for each tracer experiment the volume of 5 ml nacl solution was injected instantaneously and the tracer concentration was monitored at the outlet of the pool pipe system the tracer concentration was measured indirectly by an online electrical conductivity instrument mettler toledo usa with a resolution of 1 µs cm which was converted into the nacl concentration using the calibration curve established by different concentrations of nacl solution prepared with the tap water then the change of nacl concentration with time was plotted to obtain the btcs the recording interval δt was set to 1 s to validate the accuracy of the experimental data each tracer experiment was conducted three times to ensure its repeatability 2 3 analysis of breakthrough curves the tracer btcs were analyzed in this paper using a methodology similar to morales et al 2007 and barbera et al 2018 accordingly a set of temporal metrics were estimated table 1 and their statistical relationships with the pool volume were presented most parameters are calculated using the qtracer2 program field 2002 except for the transient storage index tsi and t50 cp as shown in table 1 tsi describes the persistence of tailing in the observed btcs and provides an indicator of transient storage schmadel et al 2016 t50 cp indicates transport of the main tracer mass through conduits which caused the maximum concentration variation in the btc mohammadi et al 2018 2 4 transient storage model the transient storage model tsm was used to simulate the experimental results the tsm divides the simulated zone into the main channel and the storage zone with the linear solute exchange between these two zones bencala and walters 1983 the main channel is defined as that portion of the pool pipe system where advection and dispersion are the dominant transport processe i e the pipe part the pool as the storage zone leads to the temporary detainment of solutes transient storage in the eddies within the pool that are stationary relative to the faster moving waters near the center of the channel runkel 1998 the transient storage is the only physical process affecting solute concentrations in the storage zone and the solute in the storage zone is assumed to distribute uniformly and instantanesously at each time step the implementation of the transient storage model is based on the otis software runkel 1998 the chemical reaction was not considered because the conservative tracer nacl was used in the experiments the equations of tsm used in this study are 1 c t q a c x 1 a x ad c x α c s c 2 d c s dt α a a s c c s where t is time t and x is distance l c and cs are solute concentrations m l3 in the main channel and the storage zone respectively a and as are cross sectional areas l2 of the main channel and the storage zone respectively q is the discharge l3 t d is the dispersion coefficient l2 t and α is the exchange coefficient t 1 the model structure and physical meanings of transport parameters are shown in fig 7 the fitting procedure is based on a nonlinear least square algorithms of starpac runkel 1998 four transport parameters needed to be calibrated a as d and α and the storage zone volume vs was calculated by multiplying as and l dewaide et al 2016 vs as l the transport parameters were first adjusted manually through the trial and error tests once the fitting between the simulated curve and the observed btc was graphically acceptable the optimization procedure was realized to search the optimal estimated parameters using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse as the assessment criteria a step concentration profile was used as the upstream boundary because the tracer injection at ip was done within a short time the damköhler dai number was used to indicate the reliability of parameter identification wagner and harvey 1997 3 dai α 1 a a s l u where u is the average advective velocity u q a dai reflects the ratio of average advective transit time to the transient storage zone interaction timescale a small value of this index dai 1 indicates that the advective velocity is much larger than the exchange rate between the main channel and the storage zone and the parameters related to the storage zone cannot be inferred reliably conversely a high value of the index dai 1 means that the tracer mixes quickly in the stream and storage zone generating storage exchange that can hardly be distinguished from shear flow dispersion caused by velocity variations in the stream and thus resulting in parameter nonidentifiability kelleher et al 2013 consequently the parameter uncertainties are low when the dai value is on the order of 0 1 1 0 wagner and harvey 1997 the range of dai value from 0 6 to 60 which indicatied limited uncertainties was developed especially for instantaneous releases schmid 2004 and therefore applied to the experiments in this paper schmid et al 2010 3 results 3 1 experimental results 3 1 1 morphological analysis of btcs for each experiment the btcs of the three repeated experiments were almost the same most of the tracer recovery rates were higher than 90 showing a good mass balance tables s1 s3 the reynolds of all experiments was larger than 6000 indicating turbulent flow conditions these all demonstrated the reliability of the experimental results the btcs of all experiments are displayed in figs 8 11 and the characteristic parameters of btcs are summarized in tables s1 s3 fig 8 shows that the btcs exhibit limited variations when sp and asp were placed in different positions indicateing the relatively similar internal transport process if the system is seen as a whole from this aspect we can ignore the influence of the pool position on the model parameters as evident from fig 9 the measured btcs show the slope of rising limb decreases and the tailing increases obviously with the increase of pool size for both sp and asp the first arrival time of the tracer does not change as the pool size increases the peak concentration arrives at the same time for spbut arrives slightly later and later for asp with the increased pool size the peak concentration generally decreases with the increase of pool size although its decline is not distinct in some cases for sp comparing the btcs of asp and sp the morphology is significantly different there is a noticeable inflection point between the tail and the main part of btc for sp while the tails and the main part of btc connect smoothly for asp fig 10 shows the experimental btcs of different number of pools as the pools increase the slope of rising limb decreases and the btc becomes increasingly skewed to the right for both sp and asp the peak time increases for asp but keeps almost the same for sp with the increase of pools the peak concentration decreases for both pool types however the downward trend of cp is more significant in asp than in sp fig 11 illustrates the experimental btcs for the asp of 20 cm under different turbulent flow conditions showing that the slope of the rising limb increases slightly and the tailing decreases with the increase of discharge the first arrival time of tracer and the peak time arrive at the outlet of the pipe system gradually earlier and earlier with the discharge the magnitude of peak concentration is almost constant 3 1 2 variation of characteristic parameters fig 12 shows the trend of temporal metrics with an increasing pool volume vp associated with different pool sizes the temporal metrics except t50 cp in sp increases linearly with vp mostly r 2 0 98 t50 cp rises linearly in asp r 2 0 998 but it keeps almost constant in sp with an increasing vp fig 13 shows clearly linear relationships r 2 0 84 between most of the temporal metrics and the pool volume vp when vp increases with the number of pools except the transient storage index tsi in asp r 2 0 70 besides the exponential relationship exists between t50 cp and vp in sp as expected the temporal metrics of sp and asp differ from each other for all cases the duration time td and transient storage index tsi are higher in sp than in asp the mean residence time tm is slightly lower in sp than in asp sp has lower t50 cp compared with asp except when there are four pools in the pipe 3 2 simulation results as shown in supporting information tables s4 s6 all of the experimental btcs can be reproduced very well by the transient storage model with the nash coefficient larger than 0 99 most of the dai values are within the range from 0 6 to 60 with limited nonuniqueness problems schmid 2004 schmid et al 2010 an exception was the asp of 10 cm side length with a value of dai around 120 and the corresponding parameter set derived from this experiment was not used in the following analysis the variation relationships of model parameters with the increased pool volume caused by the changing size or number are displayed in figs 14 and 15 respectively the relationships are exhibited together in fig 16 in order to compare them effects of the flow condition on model parameters are displayed in fig 17 the fitting results of the relationships between model parameters and the pool volume are summarized in tables s7 3 2 1 relationships between model parameters and the pool size as seen in fig 14 the storage zone cross sectional area as and storage zone volume vs show good linear relationships with the pool volume vp r 2 0 998 the main channel cross sectional area a is also positively related to vp r 2 0 7 but with limited variations a ranges from 5 10e 4 to 5 17e 4 m2 in sp and from 5 17e 4 to 5 32e 4 m2 in asp basically the a can be seen as an unchanged parameter with the increase of pool size the dispersion coefficient d which ranges from 1 15e 2 to 3 96e 2 m2 s shows a clearly positive correlation with vp in asp r 2 0 986 while it keeps almost constant in sp with the value from 1 16e 2 to 1 56e 2 m2 s an apparent relationship between α and vp was not recognized for different pool types α changes slightly from 2 53e 3 to 4 66e 3 s 1 in sp and from 7 38e 3 to 8 86e 3 s 1 in asp the ratio of vs to vp decreases gradually from 1 18 to 0 84 in sp and from 0 92 to 0 79 in asp with the increased pool volume and most of the ratio is higher than 0 8 likewise the linear regression line of vs versus vp is close to the 1 1 line indicating that the storage zone volume obtained by the calibrated model is very close to the actual pool volume for both pool types 3 2 2 relationships between model parameters and the number of pools as shown in fig 15 the storage zone cross sectional area as and the storage zone volume vs show linear relationships with the pool volume vp for both sp and asp r 2 0 999 in which the exchange coefficient α also shows a linear correlation with vp r 2 0 985 the main channel cross sectional area a increases slightly from 5 20e 4 to 5 52e 4 m2 in asp and from 5 10e 4 to 5 12e 4 m2 in sp with the increased vp similar to the results for different pool sizes a can also be considered an unvaried parameter with the increase of vp the dispersion coefficient d with its value from 1 13e 2 to 1 22e 2 m2 s remains almost the same with the increased sps however it shows a positive correlation with vp r 2 0 794 and changes from 1 27e 2 to 2 12e 2 m2 s in asp the ratio of the storage zone volume vs to the pool volume vp increases from 0 92 to 1 0 in sp but decreases from 0 85 to 0 71 in asp gradually with the increased vp this may be because the main channel flow can transform into eddies in sp when water flows from one pool into the next but the eddies can transform into the main channel flow in asp the linear regression line of vs versus vp is identical to the 1 1 line in sp indicating the storage zone volume is the same as the actual pool volume in sp however the linear regression line of vs versus vp is obvious deviate from the 1 1 line in asp with the ratio of vs to vp ranging from 0 7 to 0 8 for more than one pool 3 2 3 relationships between model parameters and the pool volume as displayed in fig 16 the storage zone cross sectional area as both increases linearly with the pool volume vp for different pool sizes and numbers with the slope of the linear regression gently different thus a new regression of as as 0 0078vp 3e 06 the black line and vs vs 0 819vp 0 0003 the grey line versus vp was fitted using all the simulated data the grey line is close to the 1 1 line implying most of the storage zone volume is close to the actual pool volume the trend of the main channel cross sectional area a and dispersion coefficient d is similar between the two ways basically the a can be seen as an unchanged parameter with the increase of pool volume the d almost does not change in sp but increases with vp in asp the slope of the linear regression is larger in way 1 than in way 2 for asp the exchange coefficient α keeps almost the same in way 1 but increases linearly in way 2 with vp 3 2 4 effects of the turbulent flow condition on model parameters fig 17 displays the variation of model parameters in the asp of 20 cm with the increased discharge the dispersion coefficient and exchange coefficient both show clearly linear relationships with the discharge they increase significantly when the discharge rises from 0 530 m3 h to 1 237 m3 h the main channel cross sectional area also increases linearly but gently from 4 78e 4 m2 to 5 32e 4 m2 with the discharge changing merely 11 3 when the discharge rises to double more of the initial value on the contrary the storage zone cross sectional area remains almost constant although it seems to decrease with the discharge 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the pool volume on btcs in this study we investigated the effect of the pool volume on btcs by conducting tracer experiments in a pool pipe system with different pool positions pool sizes and pool numbers it was found that the btcs of the pipe with different pool positions keep almost invariable for two different pool types the btc tailing increases and the peak concentration decreases gradually with an increasing pool size or pool number which is consistent with previous studies zhao et al 2017 the decreasing trend of peak concentration is more significant in asp than in sp with an increasing pool size while the decreasing trend of peak concentration is more significant in sp than in asp with an increasing pool number the duration time the transient storage index the mean residence time and the t50 cp in asp show linear relationships with pool volume when the pool size increases the t50 cp keeps almost constant with an increasing pool volume in sp indicating that sp mainly influences the tails of btc rather than the transport of the main tracer mass the duration time the transient storage index in sp the mean residence time and the t50 cp in asp show clear positive correlations with pool volume associated with different pool numbers our experimental results compare well with the previous study jin et al 2009 4 2 relationships between model parameters and the pool volume the storage zone cross sectional area as increases linearly with the pool volume vp when the pool size or pool number increases owing to the increased storage zone volume vs within the pool the results are in agreement with an increase in immobile fluid regions due to the pool structures in karst conduits morales et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 and an increase in surface transient storage zones jin et al 2009 rana et al 2017 including side pools or back eddies along the stream channel in this paper the storage zones refer to eddies or recirculation zones rzs characterized by enclosed rotating flow regions developed in the pool with slow or stagnant flows hauns et al 2001 qian et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 the volume of eddies or rzs increases with the increase of pool volume leading to the increased storage zone volume vs the slope of the linear regression of as versus vp is slightly different fig 16 among different pool structures and which one should be used for prediction of the pool volume is unclear because the pool structure is often uncertain in the field therefore a new regression of as or vs versus vp as 0 0078vp 3e 06 vs 0 8195vp 0 0003 r 2 0 95 was obtained using all simulated data fig 16 the regression line of vs versus vp is close to the 1 1 line with the slope slightly lower than 1 implying most of the storage zone volume is close to the actual pool volume due to principal regions of the pools were identified as the storage zone in the model thus we can also use vs to deduce vp directly nevetheless the ratio of vs to vp is from 0 7 to 0 8 and lower than 1 for different number of asps meaning a large error for asp when using vs to deduce vp this may be due to a part of recirculation zones forming within the asp can move out the pool and into the main pipe fast and thus is deemed as the main channel flow in the model for the asp of 20 cm the as keeps almost unchanged with the discharge indicating the relationship of as with the pool volume may be the same among different discharges most of the main channel cross sectional area a vary limitedly with the changing of pool volume vp the pool pipe system includes a long pipe with a relatively high velocity and a pool with lower velocity and substantial storage the pipe occupies most of the experimental system and thus the pipe instead of the pool affect the main channel cross sectional area mainly the length of the pipe with the fixed cross sectional area keeps almost constant for different experiments as a result the main channel cross sectional area does not change with the pool volume and is close to the cross sectional area of the pipe 4 91e 4 m2 regardless of the pool structure the increase of a in the asp of 20 cm is little when the discharge increased from 0 530 m3 h to 1 237 m3 h its value is 4 78e 4 m2 and 5 09e 4 m2 respectively for the discharge of 0 530 m3 h and 0 707 m3 h implying the a will equal the cross sectional area of the pipe 4 91e 4 m2 when the discharge is between the two the dispersion coefficient d keeps almost unchanged in sp but increases linearly in asp when the pool volume vp increases with the pool size or the number of pools which can be explained by the following reasons the main channel refers to the central flow path through sp and is hardly impacted by the lateral flow reversals on both sides hauns et al 2001 qian et al 2012 thus the d almost does not change with the vp in sp in asp a large recirculation zone forms in the whole pool hauns et al 2001 where the main channel flow and the storage zone mixes intensely disturbing the main channel flow field obviously and increasing the dispersion therefore the increased recirculation zone size due to the increase of pool volume will increase the dispersion coefficient which is in line with the results provided by jin et al 2009 the relationship between d and vp is associated with not only the pool type but also the pool distribution because the d increases more obviously in asp when the pool volume increases with the pool size than with the pool number the relationship of d with vp also depends on the flow condition owing to it increases obviously with the discharge for the asp of 20 cm which is consistent with previous studies morales et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 the exchange coefficient α shows no apparent trend when the pool volume increases with the pool size it may be because the mixing intensity between the main channel flow and the storage zone does not change although the size of the recirculation zone increases with the pool size the flow velocity may be the main factor to affect the exchange intensity because the α in the asp of 20 cm increases linearly and clearly with the discharge the same as previous studies zhao et al 2017 2019 contrarily the α increases linearly with the number of pools therefore the relationship between α and vp depends on the pool distribution and the flow condition in addition α value is associated with pool type because higher α exists in asp than in sp causing shorter btc tails in asp mainly 4 3 implications for identification of conduit geometry the conduit network is the main flow path in the karst aquifer chang et al 2019 and the flow path diameter is vital for controlling transport in karst region thus estimates of diameters or other geometrical parameters provide critical information for water resource management in karst aquifers yet we often do not know the geometry of the conduit system because the underground conduit cannot be approached and investigated under most circumstances in this paper most of the model parameters show obvious correlations with the pool volume vp therefore the geometrical parameters of the conduit system can be deduced from the model parameters calibrated by the btcs the predicted parameters were subsequently compared to the actual values this comparison permitted a series of parameter errors to be derived with the error defined by δ p 100 p pre p act p act ppre predicted and pact actual parameter the strong linear regression relationship between as or vs and vp as 0 0078vp 3e 06 vs 0 8195vp 0 0003 r 2 0 95 was used for prediction of vp method 1 regardless of different structures the maximum error for the prediction of vp using this method is 20 6 table 2 in addition we can also estimate the pool volume to be the storage zone volume obtained by multiplying as with the conduit length l roughly method 2 because vs is close to vp in most cases most prediction errors for vp using this method are below 30 the prediction error using this method is larger for asp than for sp because the linear regression line between vs and vp is more deviate from the 1 1 line in asp than in sp this method should be applied when the relationship between as and vp is unknown and merely as or vs is known among the model parameters the main channel cross sectional area a is basically unvarying and close to the cross sectional area of the pipe thus we can obtain the average cross sectional area of the pipe ac from the calibrated a roughly with a maximum prediction error of 12 5 the volume of the pool pipe system v can be estimated by summing discharge through mean transit time t m field 2002 vojtechovska et al 2010 luhmann et al 2012 or peak time t p birk et al 2004 denoted as v 1 and v 2 subtracting the pool volume from the v 1 or v 2 gives the volume of the pipe vc 1 or vc 2 as summarized in table 3 subsequently the estimated length of the pipe lc 1 and lc 2 can be calculated by dividing the pipe volume vc 1 or vc 2 by the cross sectional area of the pipe finally the length of the pool pipe system equals the pipe length plus the size of the cubic pool l lc n l and the mean length is 103 2 m and 91 4 m respectively compared with l 2 l 1 is closer to the actual length of the pool pipe system 104 5 m suggesting the mean transit time seems to be more reasonable for quantitative identification of conduit geometry than the peak time which is consistent with the result obtained in vojtechovska et al 2010 the pool type can be estimated roughly by observing the length of btc tail and analyzing the value of exchange coefficient α normally the pool type is nearer to asp than to sp because the entry and exit are difficult to be positioned in one line within complex pool structure in karst region the pool distribution however is almost unknown making it difficult to determine the relationship between α or d and vp for using α and d to estimate the pool volume on the whole the relationships between model parameters and the pool volume help to identify the geometry of conduit in karst system nevetheless the identification of pool position may be impossible because the pool position has limited impact on the btcs and model parameters estimating the geometrical parameters under different turbulent flow conditions using the relationship obtained in this paper may bring about very limited error because the storage zone cross sectional area as keeps almost constant and the main channel cross sectional area a changes little with the discharge when the discharge increases more than twice from 0 530 m3 h to 1 237 m3 h the a should equal the cross sectional area of the pipe 4 91e 4 m2 when the discharge is between 0 530 m3 h and 0 707 m3 h hence the tracer tests should be performed in a lower discharge to estimate the average cross sectional area of the karst conduit using the calibrated a the obvious increase of the dispersion coefficient d and exchange coefficient α with the discharge would exert no effect on the identification of conduit geometry because the parameters were not used to deduce the internal conduit geometry directly the conduit matrix interaction which is limited and ignored in this research has a potential impact on model parameters the conduit matrix interaction would lead to the increase of as potentially because it increases the residence time of solute and significantly leads to the tailing of btc li et al 2008 and the matrix can been considered the storage zone therefore the slope of the linear regression between as and vp should be a little larger in actual karst conduit with limited conduit matrix interaction than that in this paper neglecting the conduit matrix interaction implying the estimated pool volume may be overestimated using the relationship in this paper although the water exchange between the conduit and matrix may cause the variation of discharge in the conduit raeisi et al 2007 frank et al 2019 it has little effect on the a because the flow condition has limited effect on the a as has been discussed in previous section contrarily the variation of discharge due to conduit matrix interaction could induce the remarkable change of d meanwhile the calibrated α value would become lower if conduit matrix interaction was considered because the intensity of conduit matrix exchange is lower than the exchange intensity between the pipe and pool however the change of the two parameters due to possible conduit matrix exchange has no influence on the identificantion of conduit geometry owing to the parameters are not used for estimation of the conduit geometry 5 conclusions we investigated the effect of the pool volume on btcs in karst conduits by performing instantaneous injection of conservative tracer in a pool pipe system with different pool positions pool sizes and number of pools in the laboratory experimental results indicate that the pool position has little effect on the btc the btc tailing increases and the peak concentration decreases gradually with the pool size or the number of pools the btc tailing decreases and the peak concentration keeps almost constant with the discharge for the asp of 20 cm most of the temporal metrics duration time transient storage index mean residence time and t50 cp increase linearly with pool volume when the pool volume increases with the pool size or number of pools the exception is that t50 cp in the symmetrical pool sp keeps almost the same with the increased pool size indicating sp mainly influences the tailings of btc rather than the transport process of the main tracer mass another exception is that t50 cp increases exponentially with the pool volume in sp when the pools increase the storage zone cross sectional area as increases linearly when the pool volume vp increases with the pool size or the number of pools due to the increased volume of eddies or recirculation zones within the pool the maximum error of vp prediction according to the relationship between as as 0 0078vp 3e 06 or vs vs 0 8195vp 0 0003 and vp is 20 6 also the vp can be forecasted using the storage zone volume because most of vs is close to vp the cross sectional area of the pipe can be roughly estimated by the main channel cross sectional area a because a keeps almost the same with the increase of vp and is very close to the cross sectional area of pipe mostly regardless of different structures and the maximum prediction error is 12 5 the length of the pool pipe system equals the pipe length plus the size of the cubic pool and the pipe length can be estimated through the pipe volume divided by a the pipe volume vc 1 or vc 2 can be obtained by subtracting the pool volume from the volume of the pool pipe system v 1 or v 2 calculated by summing discharge through mean transit time tm or peak time tp the storage zone cross sectional area as keeps almost constant and the main channel cross sectional area a changes little with the discharge in the asp of 20 cm when the discharge increases from 0 530 m3 h to 1 237 m3 h making it feasible to use the relationship established in this paper to estimate the conduit geometry under other flow conditions the dispersion coefficient d does not change almost with the increase of vp in sp but shows a clearly positive correlation with vp in asp there is no apparent relationship between the exchange coefficient α and vp for different pool sizes but α increases linearly with the number of pools the d and α are positively correlated with the discharge for the asp of 20 cm the relationship between d or α and vp relies on the pool type the pool distribution and the flow condition which is difficult to be used to estimate the conduit geometry in all the relationships between model parameters and the pool volume provide a potential use for identifying the geometry of the karst conduits based on the simulation of btcs sampled from the tracer tests nevetheless identification of the pool position is difficult using the model parameters due to the pool position has limited effect on the model parameters the feasibility of the relationships for estimating the conduit geometry should be analyzed and verified in a real well known karst system in the future so as to demonstrate more general use credit authorship contribution statement xiaoer zhao conceptualization methodology

4939,the tailing of breakthrough curves btcs commonly observed in the field is often associated with the existence of pools in karst conduits the transient storage model was always used to simulate the btc tailing caused by the storage zone i e pool however the relationship between parameters in this model and pool volume is not clear which is very useful for the understanding of the internal geometry of the conduit using this model or prediction of the contaminant transport in this paper we performed a series of indoor tracer experiments in a pool pipe system involving two different pool structures symmetrical pool sp and asymmetrical pool asp with different positions sizes and numbers to explore the relationship between model parameters and the pool volume several experiments were conducted in the asp of 20 cm with different discharges so as to investigate the effect of turbulent flow condition on model parameters the experimental results indicate that the duration time of the btc and the mean residence time of the solute increase linearly with the pool volume pool size or pool number for the model parameters the cross sectional area of the storage zone as or the calculated volume vs of the storage zone using as shows a good linear relationship with the pool volume vp as 0 0078vp 3e 06 vs 0 8195vp 0 0003 r 2 0 95 indicating a potential to use this parameter which is almost constant with the discharge to roughly estimate the pool volume the cross sectional area a of the main channel does not change with the pool volume and changes little with the discharge it has a close value to the actual cross sectional area the remaining parameters dispersion coefficient d and exchange coefficient α have strong connections with the pool type pool distribution or flow condition which can hardly be used to deduce the internal conduit structure directly the relationships between model parameters and the pool volume are helpful to use the model parameters to identify the conduit geometry roughly keywords transient storage model pool volume tracer experiments solute transport 1 introduction karst aquifers are an important water resource on a global scale since they provide drinking water supply to more than 25 of the world s population ford and williams 2007 most karst aquifers are seen as a two component system the conduit where the majority of transport occurs and the matrix where the majority of fluid and solute are stored ford and williams 2007 chang et al 2019 the conduits in karst aquifers which are the preferential internal drainage paths morales et al 2010 primarily cause the rapid spreading of contaminants and surface water that easily enter the subsurface through swallow holes and mix with groundwater making the aquifer vulnerable to contamination morales et al 2007 studying the solute transport in karst conduits is very significant for the prediction and prevention of groundwater pollution in karst regions the tracer test is a valuable tool goldscheider et al 2008 in karst aquifers to obtain a basic understanding of groundwater trajectories and solute transport processes furthermore the quantitative tracer tests can provide more detailed effective information regarding solute transport such as average velocity dispersion and retardation etc through quantitative analysis of the breakthrough curves btcs field 2002 and interpretation of the btcs based on numerical models hauns et al 2001 massei et al 2006 goldscheider 2008 a significant problem often encountered when evaluating tracer tests conducted in karst aquifers is the occurrence of multi peaked btcs goldscheider et al 2008 dewaide et al 2018 and btc tailing field and pinsky 2000 the multi peaked btcs are commonly attributed to the effect of multiple conduit structures field and leij 2012 dewaide et al 2018 tinet et al 2019 the tailing of btc is mostly associated with solute detention which can be created by the two processes the adsorption desorption process wu and hunkeler 2013 and the interaction between the main conduit and storage zones or dead zones bencala and walters 1983 hauns et al 2001 which is the main factor causing solute detention martin and mcgutchenon 1998 the adsorption desorption process owing to the sediments within karst conduits may be not significant mainly due to the conservative solutes are often used in field tracer tests hence possible sediments within conduits are not considered in this paper the storage zones refer to eddies or vortices in a conduit and matrix surrounding the conduit that are stagnant relative to the faster fluids near the center of the conduit runkel 1998 solutes reside in the storage zones temporarily before returning into the main conduit for the matrix with significant permeability the water and solute are exchanged between the conduits and matrix martin and dean 2001 raeisi et al 2007 ronayne 2013 due to the hydraulic pressure difference between them li et al 2008 frank et al 2019 and the possible matrix diffusion leading to the tailing of btc if the solutes forced into the matrix subsequently back again however this paper mainly focuses on solute transport in the turbulent conduit flow of highly karstified aquifers with limited conduit matrix exchange peterson and wicks 2005 field and pinsky 2000 the storage zones in karst conduits which occur due to eddies or vortices mainly result from the localized variations in conduit geometry pool solution pockets or ceiling pockets or the surface irregularities of conduits scallop deposited sediment cave breakdown etc field and pinsky 2000 hauns et al 2001 field 2002 ford and williams 2007 among these factors the pool is a common structure in the karst conduit to produce a pronounced btc tailing because of slow velocity eddies that form in it which has been highlighted by the previous studies hauns et al 2001 zhang and boufadel 2010 zhao et al 2017 hauns et al 2001 had used the computational flow dynamics cfd model to interpret the btc tailing caused by the flow reversal zone within pools zhang and boufadel 2010 found the pool would enhance longitudinal spreading and increase the residence time of the solute in the stream through the numerical experiments based on mike21 a software developed by dhi water and environment dhi water and environment 2003 zhao et al 2017 conducted several tracer experiments to investigate the effect of the pool within the conduit on the btc these studies mainly focused on the internal physical process of solute transport or the interpretation of the btc tailing caused by the pool however with the increasing application of numerical models to interpret or predict the btc there is a need to investigate the relationship between model parameters and the internal geometry of the conduit i e the pool volume so that we can deduce the conduit geometry from the calibrated parameters by the btc or confine the parameter uncertainty of the model if the internal geometry of the conduit is already known by far few studies concentrate on this topic zhao et al 2017 and zhao et al 2019 conducted a series of tracer experiments to give a preliminary result of qualitative relationships between model parameters and the number of pools within the conduit under different turbulent flow conditions however only one pool size was used in their experiments and the quantitative relationship between model parameters and the pool volume was not clear thus needing more additional work based on their studies in this paper we considered different pool volumes within the conduit by different pool sizes or number of pools to give a more detailed investigation of connections between model parameters and the pool volume in addition we also considered different positions of the pool in the conduit to evaluate the potential influence of the pool position on the btc or model parameters the classical one dimensional advection dispersion model is proved to be too simple to reproduce the pronounced tailing of the btc and extra processes causing the tailing should be considered in the model bencala and walters 1983 runkel 1998 field and pinsky 2000 hauns et al 2001 massei et al 2006 morales et al 2010 field and leij 2012 dewaide et al 2016 tinet et al 2019 sun et al 2020 the transient storage model was widely used to simulate the btcs in karst conduits for its ability to consider the solute exchange processes between the main conduit and the storage zones caused by the existing pool in the conduit dewaide et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 and this model was also widely used to simulate the solute transport in surface streams bencala and walters 1983 roberts et al 2007 jin et al 2009 rana et al 2017 jin et al 2009 observed that the cross sectional area of the storage zone in stream reaches increased with the number of beaver dams rana et al 2017 indicated that adding weirs significantly increased the main channel cross sectional area and storage zone cross sectional area but the exchange with storage zone decreased zhao et al 2019 used the transient storage model to simulate the btcs of the pool pipe system with different flow rates and indicated that the main channel cross sectional area and exchange coefficient generally increased and the storage zone cross sectional area showed a decreasing trend with flow rate yet to the best of our knowledge no studies so far have systematically related the model parameters in conduits to the pool volume owing to the pool geometry in the karst region is often unknown and uncontrollable however the relationship between the model parameters and the pool volume is key for identification of the conduit geometry in the karst region and prediction of solute transport in karst conduits this paper is organized as follows firstly detailed descriptions of the experimental setup the tracer experiments the analysis method of btcs and the transient storage model were introduced subsequently the variation of btcs was analyzed and the relationship between parameters in the transient storage model and the pool volume was explored and discussed finally the implications for identification of conduit geometry were analyzed and the errors of estimated geometrical parameters according to the relationship between model parameters and the pool volume were given the goals of this paper are i to investigate the effect of pool volume on experimental btcs under turbulent flow conditions ii to explore the relationship between model parameters and the pool volume iii to deduce the geometry of karst conduits using model parameters 2 methodology 2 1 experimental setup a similar experimental setup to zhao et al 2017 and zhao et al 2019 was used to investigate the effect of the pool volume on btcs this pool pipe system is composed of a supplying reservoir a long circular pvc polyvinyl chloride hose and cubic pools with different sizes a diagram of the principal components of the experimental system is shown in fig 1 the supplying reservoir receives the inflow water and drains the water to the pipe system while keeping a constant head through a float style filled valve when the reservoir was full the valve would terminate the water inflow the size of the reservoir is 40 cm 40 cm 60 cm the reservoir was placed on the roof with an elevation difference of 7 8 m between the reservoir outlet and the pipe outlet providing enough discharge into the pool pipe system the pipe on the ground was operated in a similar rectangular shape fig 2 because of the limited laboratory space based on previous studies zhao et al 2017 two types of cubic pools were designed with different positions of entry and exit the asymmetrical pool asp with a diagonally opposite entry exit and the symmetrical pool sp with a parallel opposite entry exit locating in the pool center fig 3 different pool sizes were designed for asp and sp by considering different side lengths fig 4 l 10 cm 13 cm 15 cm 18 cm 20 cm 23 cm and 25 cm for asp the distance between the entry center and exit center equals zero point six multiplied by the side length fig 3b for each pool there is a vent on the top to exhaust air bubbles to keep the pipe and pools filled with water before the tracer injection as shown in fig 1 the discharge in the pipe is changed by an controlling valve and measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter gfm82 series with the measurement range from 0 5 m3 h to 21 2 m3 h and a resolution of 1 0 to ensure the stability of the discharge measurements the flow meter was placed 4 m downstream from the controlling valve and 4 m upstream from the tracer injection point for a laboratory scale physical model to be representative of the real scale system the criteria of geometric and dynamic similarity need to be fulfilled chanson 1999 wu and hunkeler 2013 mohammadi et al 2020 a laboratory scale physical model is geometrically similar to the real scale system if the length ratio of λ lfs lls as a length scale factor is fixed for all length scales chanson 1999 to maintain the same shape mohammadi et al 2020 where lfs and lls are the lengths of real and laboratory scales respectively due to circular or elliptical cross sections are common for phreatic cave passage ford and williams 2007 goldscheider and drew 2007 a circular pipe is selected to be approximately representative of a karst conduit which has been frequently used to investigate solute transport in karst conduits field and leij 2012 zhao et al 2017 the length ratio can be calculated as λ lf l where l and lf are the lengths of the laboratory pipe system and the real karst conduit respectively the pool volume will be λ 3 multiplied by the volume of the cubic pool which is in the realistic range hauns et al 2001 for full filled flow in the completely pressurized conduits the dynamic similarity is achieved provided that the reynolds number is the same between the experimental pipe and the real karst conduit the velocity in the real conduit should be v λ assuming constant fluid kinematic viscosity between them if v is the average velocity in the experimental pipe the average velocity of 0 5 m s in the experiments corresponds to a field velocity which is in a realistic range ford and williams 2007 barbera et al 2018 if the ratio belongs to one order of magnitude when designing the laboratory scale physical model it is reasonable to neglect roughness and tortuosity of the real karst conduits field 2002 zhang et al 2019 because they cannot produce a pronounced tailing of btc that can be caused by the pools and is the main study focus of this paper hence the simplified pool pipe system is much simpler compared to the real karst conduits with complex internal structure including roughness tortuosity and sinuosity etc and then the similitudes cannot be completely fulfilled 2 2 tracer experiments the conservative solute of 100 g l nacl solution was used as the tracer in the experiments and the tap water was utilized as a background solution given its relatively stable electrical conductivity the conductivity of tap water was measured before and during each experiment continuously and was around 1000 50 μs cm normally based on long time monitoring it is impractical to use deionized water in the experiments for huge water demand before the tracer experiments the valve was adjusted to keep a discharge we need the tracer experiments were conducted with merely a discharge of 0 884 m3 h in all pool structures except the asp of 20 cm in which the experiments were performed with various discharges of 0 530 m3 h 0 707 m3 h 0 884 m3 h 1 060 m3 h and 1 237 m3 h respectively so as to investigate the effects of turbulent flow condition on solute transport parameters the experiments were conducted by xiaoer zhao and qi li in the laboratory of water environment simulation in qingdao university of technology in the experiments two different ways different pool sizes l fig 4 or different number of pools n with the same size fig 5 were considered to change the pool volume vp in the pipe in addition the pool can be located at different positions in karst conduits which may also have a potential influence on the btcs even though the pool volume was the same therefore the tracer experiments with the same pool volume but different positions l1 l4 in fig 6 were also conducted to investigate the possible effect of the pool position on btcs from l1 to l4 the distance between the pool and outlet increases gradually for all experiments the straight length of the pool pipe system l is 104 5 m for each tracer experiment the volume of 5 ml nacl solution was injected instantaneously and the tracer concentration was monitored at the outlet of the pool pipe system the tracer concentration was measured indirectly by an online electrical conductivity instrument mettler toledo usa with a resolution of 1 µs cm which was converted into the nacl concentration using the calibration curve established by different concentrations of nacl solution prepared with the tap water then the change of nacl concentration with time was plotted to obtain the btcs the recording interval δt was set to 1 s to validate the accuracy of the experimental data each tracer experiment was conducted three times to ensure its repeatability 2 3 analysis of breakthrough curves the tracer btcs were analyzed in this paper using a methodology similar to morales et al 2007 and barbera et al 2018 accordingly a set of temporal metrics were estimated table 1 and their statistical relationships with the pool volume were presented most parameters are calculated using the qtracer2 program field 2002 except for the transient storage index tsi and t50 cp as shown in table 1 tsi describes the persistence of tailing in the observed btcs and provides an indicator of transient storage schmadel et al 2016 t50 cp indicates transport of the main tracer mass through conduits which caused the maximum concentration variation in the btc mohammadi et al 2018 2 4 transient storage model the transient storage model tsm was used to simulate the experimental results the tsm divides the simulated zone into the main channel and the storage zone with the linear solute exchange between these two zones bencala and walters 1983 the main channel is defined as that portion of the pool pipe system where advection and dispersion are the dominant transport processe i e the pipe part the pool as the storage zone leads to the temporary detainment of solutes transient storage in the eddies within the pool that are stationary relative to the faster moving waters near the center of the channel runkel 1998 the transient storage is the only physical process affecting solute concentrations in the storage zone and the solute in the storage zone is assumed to distribute uniformly and instantanesously at each time step the implementation of the transient storage model is based on the otis software runkel 1998 the chemical reaction was not considered because the conservative tracer nacl was used in the experiments the equations of tsm used in this study are 1 c t q a c x 1 a x ad c x α c s c 2 d c s dt α a a s c c s where t is time t and x is distance l c and cs are solute concentrations m l3 in the main channel and the storage zone respectively a and as are cross sectional areas l2 of the main channel and the storage zone respectively q is the discharge l3 t d is the dispersion coefficient l2 t and α is the exchange coefficient t 1 the model structure and physical meanings of transport parameters are shown in fig 7 the fitting procedure is based on a nonlinear least square algorithms of starpac runkel 1998 four transport parameters needed to be calibrated a as d and α and the storage zone volume vs was calculated by multiplying as and l dewaide et al 2016 vs as l the transport parameters were first adjusted manually through the trial and error tests once the fitting between the simulated curve and the observed btc was graphically acceptable the optimization procedure was realized to search the optimal estimated parameters using the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse as the assessment criteria a step concentration profile was used as the upstream boundary because the tracer injection at ip was done within a short time the damköhler dai number was used to indicate the reliability of parameter identification wagner and harvey 1997 3 dai α 1 a a s l u where u is the average advective velocity u q a dai reflects the ratio of average advective transit time to the transient storage zone interaction timescale a small value of this index dai 1 indicates that the advective velocity is much larger than the exchange rate between the main channel and the storage zone and the parameters related to the storage zone cannot be inferred reliably conversely a high value of the index dai 1 means that the tracer mixes quickly in the stream and storage zone generating storage exchange that can hardly be distinguished from shear flow dispersion caused by velocity variations in the stream and thus resulting in parameter nonidentifiability kelleher et al 2013 consequently the parameter uncertainties are low when the dai value is on the order of 0 1 1 0 wagner and harvey 1997 the range of dai value from 0 6 to 60 which indicatied limited uncertainties was developed especially for instantaneous releases schmid 2004 and therefore applied to the experiments in this paper schmid et al 2010 3 results 3 1 experimental results 3 1 1 morphological analysis of btcs for each experiment the btcs of the three repeated experiments were almost the same most of the tracer recovery rates were higher than 90 showing a good mass balance tables s1 s3 the reynolds of all experiments was larger than 6000 indicating turbulent flow conditions these all demonstrated the reliability of the experimental results the btcs of all experiments are displayed in figs 8 11 and the characteristic parameters of btcs are summarized in tables s1 s3 fig 8 shows that the btcs exhibit limited variations when sp and asp were placed in different positions indicateing the relatively similar internal transport process if the system is seen as a whole from this aspect we can ignore the influence of the pool position on the model parameters as evident from fig 9 the measured btcs show the slope of rising limb decreases and the tailing increases obviously with the increase of pool size for both sp and asp the first arrival time of the tracer does not change as the pool size increases the peak concentration arrives at the same time for spbut arrives slightly later and later for asp with the increased pool size the peak concentration generally decreases with the increase of pool size although its decline is not distinct in some cases for sp comparing the btcs of asp and sp the morphology is significantly different there is a noticeable inflection point between the tail and the main part of btc for sp while the tails and the main part of btc connect smoothly for asp fig 10 shows the experimental btcs of different number of pools as the pools increase the slope of rising limb decreases and the btc becomes increasingly skewed to the right for both sp and asp the peak time increases for asp but keeps almost the same for sp with the increase of pools the peak concentration decreases for both pool types however the downward trend of cp is more significant in asp than in sp fig 11 illustrates the experimental btcs for the asp of 20 cm under different turbulent flow conditions showing that the slope of the rising limb increases slightly and the tailing decreases with the increase of discharge the first arrival time of tracer and the peak time arrive at the outlet of the pipe system gradually earlier and earlier with the discharge the magnitude of peak concentration is almost constant 3 1 2 variation of characteristic parameters fig 12 shows the trend of temporal metrics with an increasing pool volume vp associated with different pool sizes the temporal metrics except t50 cp in sp increases linearly with vp mostly r 2 0 98 t50 cp rises linearly in asp r 2 0 998 but it keeps almost constant in sp with an increasing vp fig 13 shows clearly linear relationships r 2 0 84 between most of the temporal metrics and the pool volume vp when vp increases with the number of pools except the transient storage index tsi in asp r 2 0 70 besides the exponential relationship exists between t50 cp and vp in sp as expected the temporal metrics of sp and asp differ from each other for all cases the duration time td and transient storage index tsi are higher in sp than in asp the mean residence time tm is slightly lower in sp than in asp sp has lower t50 cp compared with asp except when there are four pools in the pipe 3 2 simulation results as shown in supporting information tables s4 s6 all of the experimental btcs can be reproduced very well by the transient storage model with the nash coefficient larger than 0 99 most of the dai values are within the range from 0 6 to 60 with limited nonuniqueness problems schmid 2004 schmid et al 2010 an exception was the asp of 10 cm side length with a value of dai around 120 and the corresponding parameter set derived from this experiment was not used in the following analysis the variation relationships of model parameters with the increased pool volume caused by the changing size or number are displayed in figs 14 and 15 respectively the relationships are exhibited together in fig 16 in order to compare them effects of the flow condition on model parameters are displayed in fig 17 the fitting results of the relationships between model parameters and the pool volume are summarized in tables s7 3 2 1 relationships between model parameters and the pool size as seen in fig 14 the storage zone cross sectional area as and storage zone volume vs show good linear relationships with the pool volume vp r 2 0 998 the main channel cross sectional area a is also positively related to vp r 2 0 7 but with limited variations a ranges from 5 10e 4 to 5 17e 4 m2 in sp and from 5 17e 4 to 5 32e 4 m2 in asp basically the a can be seen as an unchanged parameter with the increase of pool size the dispersion coefficient d which ranges from 1 15e 2 to 3 96e 2 m2 s shows a clearly positive correlation with vp in asp r 2 0 986 while it keeps almost constant in sp with the value from 1 16e 2 to 1 56e 2 m2 s an apparent relationship between α and vp was not recognized for different pool types α changes slightly from 2 53e 3 to 4 66e 3 s 1 in sp and from 7 38e 3 to 8 86e 3 s 1 in asp the ratio of vs to vp decreases gradually from 1 18 to 0 84 in sp and from 0 92 to 0 79 in asp with the increased pool volume and most of the ratio is higher than 0 8 likewise the linear regression line of vs versus vp is close to the 1 1 line indicating that the storage zone volume obtained by the calibrated model is very close to the actual pool volume for both pool types 3 2 2 relationships between model parameters and the number of pools as shown in fig 15 the storage zone cross sectional area as and the storage zone volume vs show linear relationships with the pool volume vp for both sp and asp r 2 0 999 in which the exchange coefficient α also shows a linear correlation with vp r 2 0 985 the main channel cross sectional area a increases slightly from 5 20e 4 to 5 52e 4 m2 in asp and from 5 10e 4 to 5 12e 4 m2 in sp with the increased vp similar to the results for different pool sizes a can also be considered an unvaried parameter with the increase of vp the dispersion coefficient d with its value from 1 13e 2 to 1 22e 2 m2 s remains almost the same with the increased sps however it shows a positive correlation with vp r 2 0 794 and changes from 1 27e 2 to 2 12e 2 m2 s in asp the ratio of the storage zone volume vs to the pool volume vp increases from 0 92 to 1 0 in sp but decreases from 0 85 to 0 71 in asp gradually with the increased vp this may be because the main channel flow can transform into eddies in sp when water flows from one pool into the next but the eddies can transform into the main channel flow in asp the linear regression line of vs versus vp is identical to the 1 1 line in sp indicating the storage zone volume is the same as the actual pool volume in sp however the linear regression line of vs versus vp is obvious deviate from the 1 1 line in asp with the ratio of vs to vp ranging from 0 7 to 0 8 for more than one pool 3 2 3 relationships between model parameters and the pool volume as displayed in fig 16 the storage zone cross sectional area as both increases linearly with the pool volume vp for different pool sizes and numbers with the slope of the linear regression gently different thus a new regression of as as 0 0078vp 3e 06 the black line and vs vs 0 819vp 0 0003 the grey line versus vp was fitted using all the simulated data the grey line is close to the 1 1 line implying most of the storage zone volume is close to the actual pool volume the trend of the main channel cross sectional area a and dispersion coefficient d is similar between the two ways basically the a can be seen as an unchanged parameter with the increase of pool volume the d almost does not change in sp but increases with vp in asp the slope of the linear regression is larger in way 1 than in way 2 for asp the exchange coefficient α keeps almost the same in way 1 but increases linearly in way 2 with vp 3 2 4 effects of the turbulent flow condition on model parameters fig 17 displays the variation of model parameters in the asp of 20 cm with the increased discharge the dispersion coefficient and exchange coefficient both show clearly linear relationships with the discharge they increase significantly when the discharge rises from 0 530 m3 h to 1 237 m3 h the main channel cross sectional area also increases linearly but gently from 4 78e 4 m2 to 5 32e 4 m2 with the discharge changing merely 11 3 when the discharge rises to double more of the initial value on the contrary the storage zone cross sectional area remains almost constant although it seems to decrease with the discharge 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the pool volume on btcs in this study we investigated the effect of the pool volume on btcs by conducting tracer experiments in a pool pipe system with different pool positions pool sizes and pool numbers it was found that the btcs of the pipe with different pool positions keep almost invariable for two different pool types the btc tailing increases and the peak concentration decreases gradually with an increasing pool size or pool number which is consistent with previous studies zhao et al 2017 the decreasing trend of peak concentration is more significant in asp than in sp with an increasing pool size while the decreasing trend of peak concentration is more significant in sp than in asp with an increasing pool number the duration time the transient storage index the mean residence time and the t50 cp in asp show linear relationships with pool volume when the pool size increases the t50 cp keeps almost constant with an increasing pool volume in sp indicating that sp mainly influences the tails of btc rather than the transport of the main tracer mass the duration time the transient storage index in sp the mean residence time and the t50 cp in asp show clear positive correlations with pool volume associated with different pool numbers our experimental results compare well with the previous study jin et al 2009 4 2 relationships between model parameters and the pool volume the storage zone cross sectional area as increases linearly with the pool volume vp when the pool size or pool number increases owing to the increased storage zone volume vs within the pool the results are in agreement with an increase in immobile fluid regions due to the pool structures in karst conduits morales et al 2010 zhao et al 2017 and an increase in surface transient storage zones jin et al 2009 rana et al 2017 including side pools or back eddies along the stream channel in this paper the storage zones refer to eddies or recirculation zones rzs characterized by enclosed rotating flow regions developed in the pool with slow or stagnant flows hauns et al 2001 qian et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 the volume of eddies or rzs increases with the increase of pool volume leading to the increased storage zone volume vs the slope of the linear regression of as versus vp is slightly different fig 16 among different pool structures and which one should be used for prediction of the pool volume is unclear because the pool structure is often uncertain in the field therefore a new regression of as or vs versus vp as 0 0078vp 3e 06 vs 0 8195vp 0 0003 r 2 0 95 was obtained using all simulated data fig 16 the regression line of vs versus vp is close to the 1 1 line with the slope slightly lower than 1 implying most of the storage zone volume is close to the actual pool volume due to principal regions of the pools were identified as the storage zone in the model thus we can also use vs to deduce vp directly nevetheless the ratio of vs to vp is from 0 7 to 0 8 and lower than 1 for different number of asps meaning a large error for asp when using vs to deduce vp this may be due to a part of recirculation zones forming within the asp can move out the pool and into the main pipe fast and thus is deemed as the main channel flow in the model for the asp of 20 cm the as keeps almost unchanged with the discharge indicating the relationship of as with the pool volume may be the same among different discharges most of the main channel cross sectional area a vary limitedly with the changing of pool volume vp the pool pipe system includes a long pipe with a relatively high velocity and a pool with lower velocity and substantial storage the pipe occupies most of the experimental system and thus the pipe instead of the pool affect the main channel cross sectional area mainly the length of the pipe with the fixed cross sectional area keeps almost constant for different experiments as a result the main channel cross sectional area does not change with the pool volume and is close to the cross sectional area of the pipe 4 91e 4 m2 regardless of the pool structure the increase of a in the asp of 20 cm is little when the discharge increased from 0 530 m3 h to 1 237 m3 h its value is 4 78e 4 m2 and 5 09e 4 m2 respectively for the discharge of 0 530 m3 h and 0 707 m3 h implying the a will equal the cross sectional area of the pipe 4 91e 4 m2 when the discharge is between the two the dispersion coefficient d keeps almost unchanged in sp but increases linearly in asp when the pool volume vp increases with the pool size or the number of pools which can be explained by the following reasons the main channel refers to the central flow path through sp and is hardly impacted by the lateral flow reversals on both sides hauns et al 2001 qian et al 2012 thus the d almost does not change with the vp in sp in asp a large recirculation zone forms in the whole pool hauns et al 2001 where the main channel flow and the storage zone mixes intensely disturbing the main channel flow field obviously and increasing the dispersion therefore the increased recirculation zone size due to the increase of pool volume will increase the dispersion coefficient which is in line with the results provided by jin et al 2009 the relationship between d and vp is associated with not only the pool type but also the pool distribution because the d increases more obviously in asp when the pool volume increases with the pool size than with the pool number the relationship of d with vp also depends on the flow condition owing to it increases obviously with the discharge for the asp of 20 cm which is consistent with previous studies morales et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 the exchange coefficient α shows no apparent trend when the pool volume increases with the pool size it may be because the mixing intensity between the main channel flow and the storage zone does not change although the size of the recirculation zone increases with the pool size the flow velocity may be the main factor to affect the exchange intensity because the α in the asp of 20 cm increases linearly and clearly with the discharge the same as previous studies zhao et al 2017 2019 contrarily the α increases linearly with the number of pools therefore the relationship between α and vp depends on the pool distribution and the flow condition in addition α value is associated with pool type because higher α exists in asp than in sp causing shorter btc tails in asp mainly 4 3 implications for identification of conduit geometry the conduit network is the main flow path in the karst aquifer chang et al 2019 and the flow path diameter is vital for controlling transport in karst region thus estimates of diameters or other geometrical parameters provide critical information for water resource management in karst aquifers yet we often do not know the geometry of the conduit system because the underground conduit cannot be approached and investigated under most circumstances in this paper most of the model parameters show obvious correlations with the pool volume vp therefore the geometrical parameters of the conduit system can be deduced from the model parameters calibrated by the btcs the predicted parameters were subsequently compared to the actual values this comparison permitted a series of parameter errors to be derived with the error defined by δ p 100 p pre p act p act ppre predicted and pact actual parameter the strong linear regression relationship between as or vs and vp as 0 0078vp 3e 06 vs 0 8195vp 0 0003 r 2 0 95 was used for prediction of vp method 1 regardless of different structures the maximum error for the prediction of vp using this method is 20 6 table 2 in addition we can also estimate the pool volume to be the storage zone volume obtained by multiplying as with the conduit length l roughly method 2 because vs is close to vp in most cases most prediction errors for vp using this method are below 30 the prediction error using this method is larger for asp than for sp because the linear regression line between vs and vp is more deviate from the 1 1 line in asp than in sp this method should be applied when the relationship between as and vp is unknown and merely as or vs is known among the model parameters the main channel cross sectional area a is basically unvarying and close to the cross sectional area of the pipe thus we can obtain the average cross sectional area of the pipe ac from the calibrated a roughly with a maximum prediction error of 12 5 the volume of the pool pipe system v can be estimated by summing discharge through mean transit time t m field 2002 vojtechovska et al 2010 luhmann et al 2012 or peak time t p birk et al 2004 denoted as v 1 and v 2 subtracting the pool volume from the v 1 or v 2 gives the volume of the pipe vc 1 or vc 2 as summarized in table 3 subsequently the estimated length of the pipe lc 1 and lc 2 can be calculated by dividing the pipe volume vc 1 or vc 2 by the cross sectional area of the pipe finally the length of the pool pipe system equals the pipe length plus the size of the cubic pool l lc n l and the mean length is 103 2 m and 91 4 m respectively compared with l 2 l 1 is closer to the actual length of the pool pipe system 104 5 m suggesting the mean transit time seems to be more reasonable for quantitative identification of conduit geometry than the peak time which is consistent with the result obtained in vojtechovska et al 2010 the pool type can be estimated roughly by observing the length of btc tail and analyzing the value of exchange coefficient α normally the pool type is nearer to asp than to sp because the entry and exit are difficult to be positioned in one line within complex pool structure in karst region the pool distribution however is almost unknown making it difficult to determine the relationship between α or d and vp for using α and d to estimate the pool volume on the whole the relationships between model parameters and the pool volume help to identify the geometry of conduit in karst system nevetheless the identification of pool position may be impossible because the pool position has limited impact on the btcs and model parameters estimating the geometrical parameters under different turbulent flow conditions using the relationship obtained in this paper may bring about very limited error because the storage zone cross sectional area as keeps almost constant and the main channel cross sectional area a changes little with the discharge when the discharge increases more than twice from 0 530 m3 h to 1 237 m3 h the a should equal the cross sectional area of the pipe 4 91e 4 m2 when the discharge is between 0 530 m3 h and 0 707 m3 h hence the tracer tests should be performed in a lower discharge to estimate the average cross sectional area of the karst conduit using the calibrated a the obvious increase of the dispersion coefficient d and exchange coefficient α with the discharge would exert no effect on the identification of conduit geometry because the parameters were not used to deduce the internal conduit geometry directly the conduit matrix interaction which is limited and ignored in this research has a potential impact on model parameters the conduit matrix interaction would lead to the increase of as potentially because it increases the residence time of solute and significantly leads to the tailing of btc li et al 2008 and the matrix can been considered the storage zone therefore the slope of the linear regression between as and vp should be a little larger in actual karst conduit with limited conduit matrix interaction than that in this paper neglecting the conduit matrix interaction implying the estimated pool volume may be overestimated using the relationship in this paper although the water exchange between the conduit and matrix may cause the variation of discharge in the conduit raeisi et al 2007 frank et al 2019 it has little effect on the a because the flow condition has limited effect on the a as has been discussed in previous section contrarily the variation of discharge due to conduit matrix interaction could induce the remarkable change of d meanwhile the calibrated α value would become lower if conduit matrix interaction was considered because the intensity of conduit matrix exchange is lower than the exchange intensity between the pipe and pool however the change of the two parameters due to possible conduit matrix exchange has no influence on the identificantion of conduit geometry owing to the parameters are not used for estimation of the conduit geometry 5 conclusions we investigated the effect of the pool volume on btcs in karst conduits by performing instantaneous injection of conservative tracer in a pool pipe system with different pool positions pool sizes and number of pools in the laboratory experimental results indicate that the pool position has little effect on the btc the btc tailing increases and the peak concentration decreases gradually with the pool size or the number of pools the btc tailing decreases and the peak concentration keeps almost constant with the discharge for the asp of 20 cm most of the temporal metrics duration time transient storage index mean residence time and t50 cp increase linearly with pool volume when the pool volume increases with the pool size or number of pools the exception is that t50 cp in the symmetrical pool sp keeps almost the same with the increased pool size indicating sp mainly influences the tailings of btc rather than the transport process of the main tracer mass another exception is that t50 cp increases exponentially with the pool volume in sp when the pools increase the storage zone cross sectional area as increases linearly when the pool volume vp increases with the pool size or the number of pools due to the increased volume of eddies or recirculation zones within the pool the maximum error of vp prediction according to the relationship between as as 0 0078vp 3e 06 or vs vs 0 8195vp 0 0003 and vp is 20 6 also the vp can be forecasted using the storage zone volume because most of vs is close to vp the cross sectional area of the pipe can be roughly estimated by the main channel cross sectional area a because a keeps almost the same with the increase of vp and is very close to the cross sectional area of pipe mostly regardless of different structures and the maximum prediction error is 12 5 the length of the pool pipe system equals the pipe length plus the size of the cubic pool and the pipe length can be estimated through the pipe volume divided by a the pipe volume vc 1 or vc 2 can be obtained by subtracting the pool volume from the volume of the pool pipe system v 1 or v 2 calculated by summing discharge through mean transit time tm or peak time tp the storage zone cross sectional area as keeps almost constant and the main channel cross sectional area a changes little with the discharge in the asp of 20 cm when the discharge increases from 0 530 m3 h to 1 237 m3 h making it feasible to use the relationship established in this paper to estimate the conduit geometry under other flow conditions the dispersion coefficient d does not change almost with the increase of vp in sp but shows a clearly positive correlation with vp in asp there is no apparent relationship between the exchange coefficient α and vp for different pool sizes but α increases linearly with the number of pools the d and α are positively correlated with the discharge for the asp of 20 cm the relationship between d or α and vp relies on the pool type the pool distribution and the flow condition which is difficult to be used to estimate the conduit geometry in all the relationships between model parameters and the pool volume provide a potential use for identifying the geometry of the karst conduits based on the simulation of btcs sampled from the tracer tests nevetheless identification of the pool position is difficult using the model parameters due to the pool position has limited effect on the model parameters the feasibility of the relationships for estimating the conduit geometry should be analyzed and verified in a real well known karst system in the future so as to demonstrate more general use credit authorship contribution statement xiaoer zhao conceptualization methodology
