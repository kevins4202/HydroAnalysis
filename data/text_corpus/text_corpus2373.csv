11865,iraq is located in a water stressed area with little of its own water resources this means that groundwater is one of the main water resources for this region this true for other countries in the middle east the impact of global warming and climate change in the future through increases in temperature and fluctuations in rainfall will escalate water scarcity and the degradation of the quality of water across different water resources in the current study the impact of future global warming and climate change on groundwater natural recharge in an unconfined aquifer umm er radhuma in

sustainability rcp wetspass 1 introduction the shortage of fresh water in the middle east represents a real threat to economic growth and political stability currently freshwater consumption is considered as no longer limited to its current and future availability but dependent on the competitive needs of consumption both regionally and geographically this situation is exacerbated by previous research which indicates that the middle east region may experience more drought due to increases in temperature and a reduction rainfall al rijabo and salih 2013 zakaria et al 2013 azooz and talal 2015 hassan et al 2017 climate change will impact water resources through its direct impact on the amount of timing and intensity of precipitation global warming altering the hydrological cycle through evapotranspiration soil moisture and precipitation as temperatures rise precipitation in general will become unevenly distributed throughout the world different regions worldwide may experience substantial decreases in precipitation or significant changes in the duration of wet and dry seasons several studies have indicated that climate change is mainly responsible for degradation in the quality of groundwater and its availability through a decline in natural recharge and increasing demand on regional and local groundwater resources herrera pantoja and hiscock 2008 ipcc 2014

results to assess the impact of climate change and global warming at a local scale several downscaling methods have been used in the past to provide more accurate resolution climate information and thereby reduce bias wang et al 2012 khalili 2017 foley and kelman 2018 there are two main types of downscaling techniques dynamic and statistical schoof 2013 xue et al 2014 dynamic downscaling techniques require highly sophisticated complex computing tools which are not available in most countries this means that statistical downscaling methods are much more widely used li et al 2010 moghim

relationships gcm output information can be used as global level weather parameters predictors to downscale local climate parameters predictands by using local weather data a program suitable for statistical downscaling sdsm has been developed by wilby et al 2002 it was designed to generate and project future climatic parameter data and has been applied widely to predict climate change scenarios chu et al 2010 abbasnia et al 2016 hassan and hashim 2020 downscaling techniques are able to provide a solution to problems of inconsistent scales by obtaining regional climate information from global climate data because of the nature of the data in the current study wilby et al s statistical downscaling model sdsm will be applied natural groundwater recharge depends on climatic parameters ground levels the lithology of the geology of the aquifer and the range of land use in the region under study these parameters are directly related to precipitation and soil properties since precipitation is impacted by climate change because of temperature and evaporation there is the possibility for fluctuation in the natural recharge of groundwater because of differences in rainfall distribution and water policies of the countries upstream of the tigris and euphrates rivers drought is expected in the south and middle of iraq beg and al sulttani 2020 for the middle east projected models based on 20 years of historical data refer to an increase in annual temperatures of 2 c by 2040 this rising further to 4 c by the end of the 21st century this will occur in conjunction with a decline in rainfall of up to 20 ipcc 2014 however the range of regional changes due to climate change is as yet unclear these differing due to the coarse resolution of the grid and local topographic variations the water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere wetspass is a software of water budget spatial distribution in a steady state applied to simulate seasonal or annual means of evapotranspiration runoff and natural groundwater recharge the data regarding natural groundwater recharge produced by wetspass is input data for the modflow simulation program as a steady state or seasonal fluctuation of the groundwater model groundwater levels generated by modflow are then used as input data for wetspass to generate calibration recharge estimations this procedure continues until the required groundwater level observed is achieved a range of authors have used wetspass to assess the relationship between various hydrological operations and the recharge of groundwater based on the effect of climate change adem and batelaan 2006 nyenje and batelaan 2009 it has also been used many times with modflow to estimate and evaluate the natural recharge of groundwater regarded as a successful simulation model for application in this field armanuos et al 2016 kahsay et al 2018 hassan and khalaf 2020 iraq is considered one of the countries in the middle east most affected by global warming and climate change salman et al 2017 hassan 2021 the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events are increasing the increase in desertification and sandstorms noticeable the impact of regional climate change on temperature water demand and rainfall is more explicit consequently study into the spatial temporal parameters of local and regional climate change and its effect on adaptation has become of major importance regarding world emissions rankings iraq ranks 33 out of 220 countries and contributes nearly 0 63 of world greenhouse gas ghg emissions atlas 2016 adamo et al 2018 in terms of climate vulnerability iraq ranks 101 out of 182 countries in the nd gain index a ranking of one being the least vulnerable the general fluctuation of rainfall in iraq during recent years has led to the retreat of its main rivers and dam reservoirs and a decrease in groundwater more so in desert areas much research has been carried out to ascertain the recharge of groundwater in different areas within iraq jassas and merkel 2014 abbas et al 2016 jalut et al 2018 nile et al 2019 al sudani 2020 jirjees et al 2020 awadh et al 2021 hassan and hashim 2021 but the impact of climate change on the natural groundwater recharge has not yet been considered the main aim of the current study therefore is to assess the impact of climate change at a local level on the natural groundwater recharge in the unconfined aquifer umm al radhuma iraq through the application of climatic and hydrological assessment methods in the current study the effects of climate change on the natural recharge of groundwater were investigated by downscaling one gcm canesm2 using sdsm software under two main representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios changes in groundwater recharge were predicted for the period 2020 2099 by wetspass based on projected climate parameters 2 materials and methodology 2 1 area of study the study was carried out on the exposed surface of the umm er radhuma formation the main unconfined aquifer in southwest iraq the aquifer is located between 40 20 9 0 and 45 51 8 0 e longitude and 29 11 4 0 and 34 17 3 0 n latitude at a ground level which varies from 159 to 640 m a s l meter above sea level covering an area of 63000 km2 as shown in fig 1 the exposed surface of the formation constitutes the recharge area of the aquifer it has a 50 m thick saturated layer in the southwest near its boundary increasing to 210 m in the east close to the river khalaf and hassan 2016 precipitation is the most important source of groundwater recharge despite the dry desert climate in the region the low precipitation occurring here is described as heavy and intermittent and includes occasional flow events that may cause flooding in depressions and valleys the groundwater flows towards the northeast and east in the direction of the euphrates river the average monthly temperature in the region oscillates between 30 45 c in summer and 20 25 c in winter with average monthly rainfall ranging from zero in summer to 70 115 mm in winter october may 2 2 data used the evaluation of the effect of climate change on the natural recharge of groundwater was performed using hydrogeological models climate change projection data and groundwater modeling climate change projection data for two expected emission representative concentration pathway scenarios rcp4 5 medium emissions and rcp8 5 high emissions for the period 2020 to the end of the present century were used as input data in combination with other parameters for wetspass modeling fig 2 the wetspass software requires a set of geographic information system gis grid layers including topography ground slope the texture of the soil land use groundwater levels and climate parameters which include wind speed potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation a digital elevation model dem of the study area with a resolution of 30 m was downloaded from the u s geological survey website soil slope values were calculated from the topography map using an application provided with the gis software maps of soil types and land use fig 3 a and b were provided by the iraqi geological survey and the ministry of planning iraq respectively climate data precipitation wind speed and the average temperatures over the historical period 1975 2005 fig 3 c d and e were gathered from the iraqi meteorological organization and seismology these data were taken from seven meteorological stations from north to south namely rutba ramady kerbala nukhab samawh salman and zubair fig 1 in the current research the pennman monteinth equation was used to compute potential evapotranspiration data about the level of groundwater in 30 wells situated within the study region were obtained from the iraqi general authority of groundwater the kriging interpolation method was used to compute the spatial distribution of levels of groundwater over the study area fig 3 f gcm output the canadian earth system model canesm2 was used to generate predicted climate data across the study region based on the two future emission expected scenarios rcp4 5 medium and rcp8 5 high for the period 2020 to 2099 meteorological data for the period 1975 to 2005 were used to calibrated and validate the models the rcp scenarios were created by the climate community and used in the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 each pathway typifies a set of regional socioeconomic and economic assumptions that produce four stages of the impact of emissions rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 rcps represent a wide range of potential issues related to global warming and climate change including air pollutants greenhouse gases emissions and land used rcps are unique in different ways and contain many of the higher and lower greenhouse gas scenarios the second and medium emission scenario is rcp4 5 which represents an acceptable match with a global policy of minimum emissions of greenhouse gases while rcp8 5 is the higher stage emission expected scenario this representing no future climate strategies to decrease emissions rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 were chosen to provide a broad potential range of impacts 2 3 statistical downscaling model sdsm downscaling involves identifying statistical relationships between global level weather data predictors and local level climate data predictands sdsm depends on three kinds of information 1 observed information from regional or local weather stations 2 the reanalysis of weather information sets computed by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and 3 and data created from simulations according to future climatic status generated by the gcm model canesm2 normally gcm scenarios are of coarse resolution at the global level and therefore unsuitable for climate change effect studies based on detailed regional information 2 3 1 monitoring and screening one of the major challenges when downscaling gcm output data is the appropriate choice of predictors the nature and shape of the future data to be generated depends on this step the choice of suitable predictors varies and is dependent on different criteria i e geographical location this affected on the characteristics of the predictand and predictor anandhi et al 2009 in the current study predictors were chosen depending on the highest power of the relationship with the predictand this based on different statistical indexes such as p values scatter diagrams and correlation indexes all predictors having a p value of less than 0 05 were included table 1 listing the chosen predictor parameters 2 3 2 calibration and validation sdsms to calibrate the sdsms statistical methods are generated according to the regression function between the predictands and the chosen predictors climate parameter data such as average temperature precipitation and wind speed for each local meteorological station predictands and their ncep data predictors were used to calibrate and validate the downscaling models the observed data for the historical period 1975 to 2005 was split into two groups the data for 1975 to 1996 was used for the calibration models the remaining data for 1997 to 2005 used to validate the models different statistical indicators were used to investigate the performance of the simulation models through the calibration and validation procedures the statistical indices determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse were computed using the following equations 1 r m s e 1 n p i o i 2 n 2 r 2 1 n p i p o i o 1 n p i p 2 o i o 2 3 n s e 1 1 n o i p i 2 1 n o i p 2 where p i is the predicted climate parameter value p the average climate parameter predicted value o i the observed climate parameter value o the average observed climate parameter value and n the total data count 2 3 3 climate scenarios generation general circulation models gcms were created by applying different expected future emissions scenarios this was to compensate for variations in anthropogenic activity that could influence climate change the calibrated model was applied to both emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to create predicted weather parameter data this method was performed to assess the effect of climate change on climate parameters average temperature precipitation and wind speed over the study period by downscaling the rcp emission scenario predictors computed by canesm2 the downscaled climate change predictands for the period 2020 2099 were compared with the reference period 1975 2005 to compute expected alterations in climate parameters for each local meteorological station as per the two rcp emissions scenarios 2 4 the wetspass model wetspass was created by batelaan and de smedt 2001 vrije universiteit brussels belgium described as a temporal and spatial distribution water budget simulation model hydroclimate data and other data including average temperatures precipitation topography potential evapotranspiration soil type and land use were used as input for this model groundwater recharge infiltration rates soil moisture and runoff are the expected output of the wetspass program liu and de smedt 2004 in the current research groundwater natural recharge values were selected as the major output variables and were produced as ascii format files gis software was used to transform these to raster format files groundwater recharge computations were carried out on a raster grid scale of cell size 100m 100 m for each raster a water budget is computed via the summation of separate soil type values over various areas the value of natural groundwater recharge is computed as the residual of the water budget using the following formulas batelaan and de smedt 2007 4 r p s e t v i 5 e t v t v e s where r is the recharge quantity of groundwater p the amount of precipitation s the amount of surface runoff etv the real value of evapotranspiration i the proportion of interception tv the real value of transpiration and es the value of evaporation from bare soil calibration and validation processes were implemented to assess the performance of the wetspass simulation models the field data from the study area for the period 2008 2011 were used to calibrate and validate the model through a water budget analysis this previously carried out by al fatlawi 2012 the output values for groundwater recharge were calculated by wetspass and compared with the recharge obtained from the aquifer water budget analysis 3 results and discussion in the following sections the hydrological impacts and climate change scenarios are given 3 1 climate change parameters the climate change impact analysis compares future expected groundwater recharge with historical aquifer recharge data for the study area including changes to climate and precipitation under two rcp emission scenarios downscaling models were analyzed for present and future expected temperatures precipitation wind speed and evapotranspiration for the periods 1975 2005 and 2020 2099 for temperature and wind speed unconditional approaches were implemented in downscaling this method dependent on a direct relationship between predictands and predictors a conditional approach was implemented for precipitation the quantities based on days when it rains according to sdsm one of the most important steps is to choose suitable predictors for each downscaling predictand the analytical power of any climatic predictor variable changes both spatially and temporally using scatter plots p values and correlation values suitable downscaling climate predictors for each meteorological station were chosen and are explained in table 1 two predictors tempaf the average temperature at 2 m height and mslpaf average sea level pressure had the biggest effect on temperature and were used over all stations both predictors seem plausible as they are highly correlated with changes in temperature in the boundary layer according to the expression of the thermal advection romanowicz et al 2016 for precipitation the predictors p500eu shum and p5 uaf were the most influential across all stations these predictors are closely related to the occurrence of precipitation because their simultaneous fluctuation depends on the period when saturated water vapour is in the air these predictors were then used for the calibration of the sdsm 3 2 calibration and validation of sdsm for each climate parameter historical observed data 1975 2005 was used for the calibration 1975 1996 and validation 1997 2005 of sdsm the calibration data period represents 70 of the total observed data the remaining 30 of the observed data used to validate the results table 2 illustrates the results of the calibration and validation processes for the downscaling models it can be seen from table 2 that the statistical indices rmse r2 and nse for temperature were less than 3 49 c more than 0 87 and more than 0 83 respectively across all selected stations during the validation process for wind speed the downscaling model was also a good match to the observed data with values for rmse r2 and nse at 0 43 0 88 c 0 82 0 92 and 0 18 0 43 precipitation downscaling is considered more intricate than other climate variables because measurements of the daily amount of precipitation across different regions are comparatively weak predictors at a global level consequently and as expected the values of the statistical indicators were relatively less accurate for precipitation this result is consistent with what was indicated by many previous studies such as wilby et al 2002 schoof 2013 al mukhtar and qasim 2019 however due to the selection of suitable predictors and unconditional processes the results were of an acceptable level the values of the statistical indicators rmse r2 and nse ranged from 0 45 to 0 81 mm 0 62 0 83 and 0 65 0 87 respectively for the validation period as illustrated in table 2 according to these results the performance of the calibrated sdsm model was considered accurate for the entire data set and consequently can be used for future projections fig 4 a b and c detail comparisons between the observed data and sdsm results for annual average temperatures wind speed and precipitation for the validation period 1997 2005 over the local stations the three figures have error bars with a 95 confidence limit these error bars appear to overlap in most of the stations this indicating that there are no statistically significant differences between them for precipitation simulation models the highest percentage error can be observed at rutba station where the percentage error exceeds 5 in the other models the results of all stations were within a confidence level of 95 for temperature and wind speed it is clear from fig 4c that for all stations the sdsm results always underestimated observed annual precipitation during the validation period but within an acceptable range less than 5 while the other climate parameters temperature and wind speed the estimated values both over and underestimate the values for different meteorological stations these behaviors may be due to the different analysis conditions conditional and unconditional for the climate parameters of the sdsm in addition to the effect of the types of predictors selected 3 2 1 generation of climate parameters for each station the calibrated sdsm models were used to generate projected daily average temperatures wind speed and precipitation for the period 2020 2099 under emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 5 illustrates the projected changes in mean temperature for the baseline period 1975 2005 for each emission scenario the average changes expected by the 7 stations are roughly comparable each displaying a trend for a rise in temperature but with slightly higher increases in southern stations where the temperature is already relatively high changes in the average temperature range from 0 63 to 0 96 c based on rcp4 5 and 1 12 2 05 c based on rcp8 5 for the period 2020 2099 this is because of greenhouse gas emissions and other internal and external influences worldwide it is clear that the projected rate of increase will be greater underrcp8 5 as a result of the increase in the amount of expected emissions this increasing global warming this expected increase in temperature corresponds to those reported by the ipcc for this region as with temperature the comparison of wind speed between the projection period 2020 2099 and the baseline data 1975 2005 for both emission scenarios projected a reduction of between 0 216 and 0 027 m s across the study region fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the expected changes between the annual precipitation for the baseline observed period 1975 2005 and the projected values for the period 2020 2099 under both emission scenarios for all stations for both emission scenarios precipitation will decrease at all stations mean annual precipitation is expected to decrease by 9 2 8 55 mm and 14 1 13 11 mm for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios respectively up to 2099 interestingly precipitation intensity is projected to increase during some months the above values were computed by subtracting future precipitation values from baseline period values the southern regions of the study area which suffer from a relative rise in temperature at present are expected to suffer a greater decrease in precipitation by more than 40 compared to the northeastern region under both scenarios as shown in fig 6 as mentioned in temperature expected results it is not surprising that precipitation results of this study are in line with many previous simulating studies which expected decreasing and fluctuations in precipitation in the middle east region world bank climate change knowledge portal 2018 al mukhtar and qasim 2019 serbes et al 2019 3 3 groundwater modeling 3 3 1 calibration of wetspass model using wetspass the simulated groundwater recharge results were compared with computed values by applying the water budget formula approach for the period 2008 2011 the results from the validation process are given in fig 7 the comparative analysis and statistical indexes r2 0 851 and rmse 2 06 mm between simulated and observed groundwater recharge results have confirmed a satisfactory simulation model performance meaning it can be used to simulate groundwater recharge for the future study period 3 3 2 groundwater recharge estimations the calibrated wetspass simulated model was applied to model current and future groundwater recharge in the unconfined aquifer simulated changes in recharge of groundwater for the period 2020 2099 in comparison to the reference period 1975 2005 under both emission scenarios are presented in fig 8 groundwater recharge values are presented on a mean annual scale the mean estimate of annual groundwater recharge for the reference period ranges between 0 and 35 mm fig 8a which represents between 0 and 37 of the mean annual precipitation the results indicate that the recharge of groundwater is predicted to decrease by 13 6 and 21 2 for emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively fig 8b and c this will happen because of decreased precipitation and increased evapotranspiration in tandem with increasing temperatures groundwater recharge also decreases from northwest to southeast of the study area in both the present and future periods this is consistent with a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature in the southern regions relative to the northern regions of iraq as such climate components temperature precipitation and wind speed and groundwater recharge are found to be highly dependent on the geography of the study region and geology of the aquifer for all seven stations and under both expected emission scenarios almost all groundwater recharge indices showed incremental decreases with the relatively high rate of population growth and urbanization in iraq it can be concluded that more water scarcity is expected in the future especially towards the end of this century 4 conclusions the impacts of climate change are considerable on both surface and groundwater resources especially in arid and semi arid regions like the middle east nevertheless limited attention has been paid to the impact of global warming and climate change on groundwater resources for this reason the current study has focused on the impact of global warming and climate change on natural groundwater recharge in the unconfined aquifer located in iraq s western desert future climate parameters temperature precipitation and wind speed were predicted via the statistical downscaling of canesm2 under two future emission scenarios rcp4 5 middle and rcp8 5 high for the period 2020 2099 these projected climate parameters were submitted to the wetspass model to simulate natural groundwater recharge for the period 2020 2099 the results of the study indicate an increase in average temperatures and a decrease in annual precipitation for both selected emission scenarios at a local level the average temperature is expected to increase by 0 96 c based on rcp4 5 and 2 05 c for rcp8 5 while precipitation shows a 9 2 and 14 1 decrease under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios respectively consequently groundwater recharge will also be expected to reduce by 13 6 and 21 2 for scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively during the period 2020 2099 in comparison to the historical reference period 1975 2005 the outcomes of this research could help decisionmakers stakeholders and scientists make decisions about the management and planning of groundwater resources in iraq one of the main recommendations is to consider artificial recharge by treated water or by stormwater harvesting to increase the potential of aquifers and

sandstorms noticeable the impact of regional climate change on temperature water demand and rainfall is more explicit consequently study into the spatial temporal parameters of local and regional climate change and its effect on adaptation has become of major importance regarding world emissions rankings iraq ranks 33 out of 220 countries and contributes nearly 0 63 of world greenhouse gas ghg emissions atlas 2016 adamo et al 2018 in terms of climate vulnerability iraq ranks 101 out of 182 countries in the nd gain index a ranking of one being the least vulnerable the general fluctuation of rainfall in iraq during recent years has led to the retreat of its main rivers and dam reservoirs and a decrease in groundwater more so in desert areas much research has been carried out to ascertain the recharge of groundwater in different areas within iraq jassas and merkel 2014 abbas et al 2016 jalut et al 2018 nile et al 2019 al sudani 2020 jirjees et al 2020 awadh et al 2021 hassan and hashim 2021 but the impact of climate change on the natural groundwater recharge has not yet been considered the main aim of the current study therefore is to assess the impact of climate change at a local level on the natural groundwater recharge in the unconfined aquifer umm al radhuma iraq through the application of climatic and hydrological assessment methods in the current study the effects of climate change on the natural recharge of groundwater were investigated by downscaling one gcm canesm2 using sdsm software under two main representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios changes in groundwater recharge were predicted for the period 2020 2099 by wetspass based on projected climate parameters 2 materials and methodology 2 1 area of study the study was carried out on the exposed surface of the umm er radhuma formation the main unconfined aquifer in southwest iraq the aquifer is located between 40 20 9 0 and 45 51 8 0 e longitude and 29 11 4 0 and 34 17 3 0 n latitude at a ground level which varies from 159 to 640 m a s l meter above sea level covering an area of 63000 km2 as shown in fig 1 the exposed surface of the formation constitutes the recharge area of the aquifer it has a 50 m thick saturated layer in the southwest near its boundary increasing to 210 m in the east close to the river khalaf and hassan 2016 precipitation is the most important source of groundwater recharge despite the dry desert climate in the region the low precipitation occurring here is described as heavy and intermittent and includes occasional flow events that may cause flooding in depressions and valleys the groundwater flows towards the northeast and east in the direction of the euphrates river the average monthly temperature in the region oscillates between 30 45 c in summer and 20 25 c in winter with average monthly rainfall ranging from zero in summer to 70 115 mm in winter october may 2 2 data used the evaluation of the effect of climate change on the natural recharge of groundwater was performed using hydrogeological models climate change projection data and groundwater modeling climate change projection data for two expected emission representative concentration pathway scenarios rcp4 5 medium emissions and rcp8 5 high emissions for the period 2020 to the end of the present century were used as input data in combination with other parameters for wetspass modeling fig 2 the wetspass software requires a set of geographic information system gis grid layers including topography ground slope the texture of the soil land use groundwater levels and climate parameters which include wind speed potential evapotranspiration pet and precipitation a digital elevation model dem of the study area with a resolution of 30 m was downloaded from the u s geological survey website soil slope values were calculated from the topography map using an application provided with the gis software maps of soil types and land use fig 3 a and b were provided by the iraqi geological survey and the ministry of planning iraq respectively climate data precipitation wind speed and the average temperatures over the historical period 1975 2005 fig 3 c d and e were gathered from the iraqi meteorological organization and seismology these data were taken from seven meteorological stations from north to south namely rutba ramady kerbala nukhab samawh salman and zubair fig 1 in the current research the pennman monteinth equation was used to compute potential evapotranspiration data about the level of groundwater in 30 wells situated within the study region were obtained from the iraqi general authority of groundwater the kriging interpolation method was used to compute the spatial distribution of levels of groundwater over the study area fig 3 f gcm output the canadian earth system model canesm2 was used to generate predicted climate data across the study region based on the two future emission expected scenarios rcp4 5 medium and rcp8 5 high for the period 2020 to 2099 meteorological data for the period 1975 to 2005 were used to calibrated and validate the models the rcp scenarios were created by the climate community and used in the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 each pathway typifies a set of regional socioeconomic and economic assumptions that produce four stages of the impact of emissions rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 rcps represent a wide range of potential issues related to global warming and climate change including air pollutants greenhouse gases emissions and land used rcps are unique in different ways and contain many of the higher and lower greenhouse gas scenarios the second and medium emission scenario is rcp4 5 which represents an acceptable match with a global policy of minimum emissions of greenhouse gases while rcp8 5 is the higher stage emission expected scenario this representing no future climate strategies to decrease emissions rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 were chosen to provide a broad potential range of impacts 2 3 statistical downscaling model sdsm downscaling involves identifying statistical relationships between global level weather data predictors and local level climate data predictands sdsm depends on three kinds of information 1 observed information from regional or local weather stations 2 the reanalysis of weather information sets computed by the national centers for environmental prediction ncep and 3 and data created from simulations according to future climatic status generated by the gcm model canesm2 normally gcm scenarios are of coarse resolution at the global level and therefore unsuitable for climate change effect studies based on detailed regional information 2 3 1 monitoring and screening one of the major challenges when downscaling gcm output data is the appropriate choice of predictors the nature and shape of the future data to be generated depends on this step the choice of suitable predictors varies and is dependent on different criteria i e geographical location this affected on the characteristics of the predictand and predictor anandhi et al 2009 in the current study predictors were chosen depending on the highest power of the relationship with the predictand this based on different statistical indexes such as p values scatter diagrams and correlation indexes all predictors having a p value of less than 0 05 were included table 1 listing the chosen predictor parameters 2 3 2 calibration and validation sdsms to calibrate the sdsms statistical methods are generated according to the regression function between the predictands and the chosen predictors climate parameter data such as average temperature precipitation and wind speed for each local meteorological station predictands and their ncep data predictors were used to calibrate and validate the downscaling models the observed data for the historical period 1975 to 2005 was split into two groups the data for 1975 to 1996 was used for the calibration models the remaining data for 1997 to 2005 used to validate the models different statistical indicators were used to investigate the performance of the simulation models through the calibration and validation procedures the statistical indices determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse were computed using the following equations 1 r m s e 1 n p i o i 2 n 2 r 2 1 n p i p o i o 1 n p i p 2 o i o 2 3 n s e 1 1 n o i p i 2 1 n o i p 2 where p i is the predicted climate parameter value p the average climate parameter predicted value o i the observed climate parameter value o the average observed climate parameter value and n the total data count 2 3 3 climate scenarios generation general circulation models gcms were created by applying different expected future emissions scenarios this was to compensate for variations in anthropogenic activity that could influence climate change the calibrated model was applied to both emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 to create predicted weather parameter data this method was performed to assess the effect of climate change on climate parameters average temperature precipitation and wind speed over the study period by downscaling the rcp emission scenario predictors computed by canesm2 the downscaled climate change predictands for the period 2020 2099 were compared with the reference period 1975 2005 to compute expected alterations in climate parameters for each local meteorological station as per the two rcp emissions scenarios 2 4 the wetspass model wetspass was created by batelaan and de smedt 2001 vrije universiteit brussels belgium described as a temporal and spatial distribution water budget simulation model hydroclimate data and other data including average temperatures precipitation topography potential evapotranspiration soil type and land use were used as input for this model groundwater recharge infiltration rates soil moisture and runoff are the expected output of the wetspass program liu and de smedt 2004 in the current research groundwater natural recharge values were selected as the major output variables and were produced as ascii format files gis software was used to transform these to raster format files groundwater recharge computations were carried out on a raster grid scale of cell size 100m 100 m for each raster a water budget is computed via the summation of separate soil type values over various areas the value of natural groundwater recharge is computed as the residual of the water budget using the following formulas batelaan and de smedt 2007 4 r p s e t v i 5 e t v t v e s where r is the recharge quantity of groundwater p the amount of precipitation s the amount of surface runoff etv the real value of evapotranspiration i the proportion of interception tv the real value of transpiration and es the value of evaporation from bare soil calibration and validation processes were implemented to assess the performance of the wetspass simulation models the field data from the study area for the period 2008 2011 were used to calibrate and validate the model through a water budget analysis this previously carried out by al fatlawi 2012 the output values for groundwater recharge were calculated by wetspass and compared with the recharge obtained from the aquifer water budget analysis 3 results and discussion in the following sections the hydrological impacts and climate change scenarios are given 3 1 climate change parameters the climate change impact analysis compares future expected groundwater recharge with historical aquifer recharge data for the study area including changes to climate and precipitation under two rcp emission scenarios downscaling models were analyzed for present and future expected temperatures precipitation wind speed and evapotranspiration for the periods 1975 2005 and 2020 2099 for temperature and wind speed unconditional approaches were implemented in downscaling this method dependent on a direct relationship between predictands and predictors a conditional approach was implemented for precipitation the quantities based on days when it rains according to sdsm one of the most important steps is to choose suitable predictors for each downscaling predictand the analytical power of any climatic predictor variable changes both spatially and temporally using scatter plots p values and correlation values suitable downscaling climate predictors for each meteorological station were chosen and are explained in table 1 two predictors tempaf the average temperature at 2 m height and mslpaf average sea level pressure had the biggest effect on temperature and were used over all stations both predictors seem plausible as they are highly correlated with changes in temperature in the boundary layer according to the expression of the thermal advection romanowicz et al 2016 for precipitation the predictors p500eu shum and p5 uaf were the most influential across all stations these predictors are closely related to the occurrence of precipitation because their simultaneous fluctuation depends on the period when saturated water vapour is in the air these predictors were then used for the calibration of the sdsm 3 2 calibration and validation of sdsm for each climate parameter historical observed data 1975 2005 was used for the calibration 1975 1996 and validation 1997 2005 of sdsm the calibration data period represents 70 of the total observed data the remaining 30 of the observed data used to validate the results table 2 illustrates the results of the calibration and validation processes for the downscaling models it can be seen from table 2 that the statistical indices rmse r2 and nse for temperature were less than 3 49 c more than 0 87 and more than 0 83 respectively across all selected stations during the validation process for wind speed the downscaling model was also a good match to the observed data with values for rmse r2 and nse at 0 43 0 88 c 0 82 0 92 and 0 18 0 43 precipitation downscaling is considered more intricate than other climate variables because measurements of the daily amount of precipitation across different regions are comparatively weak predictors at a global level consequently and as expected the values of the statistical indicators were relatively less accurate for precipitation this result is consistent with what was indicated by many previous studies such as wilby et al 2002 schoof 2013 al mukhtar and qasim 2019 however due to the selection of suitable predictors and unconditional processes the results were of an acceptable level the values of the statistical indicators rmse r2 and nse ranged from 0 45 to 0 81 mm 0 62 0 83 and 0 65 0 87 respectively for the validation period as illustrated in table 2 according to these results the performance of the calibrated sdsm model was considered accurate for the entire data set and consequently can be used for future projections fig 4 a b and c detail comparisons between the observed data and sdsm results for annual average temperatures wind speed and precipitation for the validation period 1997 2005 over the local stations the three figures have error bars with a 95 confidence limit these error bars appear to overlap in most of the stations this indicating that there are no statistically significant differences between them for precipitation simulation models the highest percentage error can be observed at rutba station where the percentage error exceeds 5 in the other models the results of all stations were within a confidence level of 95 for temperature and wind speed it is clear from fig 4c that for all stations the sdsm results always underestimated observed annual precipitation during the validation period but within an acceptable range less than 5 while the other climate parameters temperature and wind speed the estimated values both over and underestimate the values for different meteorological stations these behaviors may be due to the different analysis conditions conditional and unconditional for the climate parameters of the sdsm in addition to the effect of the types of predictors selected 3 2 1 generation of climate parameters for each station the calibrated sdsm models were used to generate projected daily average temperatures wind speed and precipitation for the period 2020 2099 under emission scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 fig 5 illustrates the projected changes in mean temperature for the baseline period 1975 2005 for each emission scenario the average changes expected by the 7 stations are roughly comparable each displaying a trend for a rise in temperature but with slightly higher increases in southern stations where the temperature is already relatively high changes in the average temperature range from 0 63 to 0 96 c based on rcp4 5 and 1 12 2 05 c based on rcp8 5 for the period 2020 2099 this is because of greenhouse gas emissions and other internal and external influences worldwide it is clear that the projected rate of increase will be greater underrcp8 5 as a result of the increase in the amount of expected emissions this increasing global warming this expected increase in temperature corresponds to those reported by the ipcc for this region as with temperature the comparison of wind speed between the projection period 2020 2099 and the baseline data 1975 2005 for both emission scenarios projected a reduction of between 0 216 and 0 027 m s across the study region fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the expected changes between the annual precipitation for the baseline observed period 1975 2005 and the projected values for the period 2020 2099 under both emission scenarios for all stations for both emission scenarios precipitation will decrease at all stations mean annual precipitation is expected to decrease by 9 2 8 55 mm and 14 1 13 11 mm for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios respectively up to 2099 interestingly precipitation intensity is projected to increase during some months the above values were computed by subtracting future precipitation values from baseline period values the southern regions of the study area which suffer from a relative rise in temperature at present are expected to suffer a greater decrease in precipitation by more than 40 compared to the northeastern region under both scenarios as shown in fig 6 as mentioned in temperature expected results it is not surprising that precipitation results of this study are in line with many previous simulating studies which expected decreasing and fluctuations in precipitation in the middle east region world bank climate change knowledge portal 2018 al mukhtar and qasim 2019 serbes et al 2019 3 3 groundwater modeling 3 3 1 calibration of wetspass model using wetspass the simulated groundwater recharge results were compared with computed values by applying the water budget formula approach for the period 2008 2011 the results from the validation process are given in fig 7 the comparative analysis and statistical indexes r2 0 851 and rmse 2 06 mm between simulated and observed groundwater recharge results have confirmed a satisfactory simulation model performance meaning it can be used to simulate groundwater recharge for the future study period 3 3 2 groundwater recharge estimations the calibrated wetspass simulated model was applied to model current and future groundwater recharge in the unconfined aquifer simulated changes in recharge of groundwater for the period 2020 2099 in comparison to the reference period 1975 2005 under both emission scenarios are presented in fig 8 groundwater recharge values are presented on a mean annual scale the mean estimate of annual groundwater recharge for the reference period ranges between 0 and 35 mm fig 8a which represents between 0 and 37 of the mean annual precipitation the results indicate that the recharge of groundwater is predicted to decrease by 13 6 and 21 2 for emission scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively fig 8b and c this will happen because of decreased precipitation and increased evapotranspiration in tandem with increasing temperatures groundwater recharge also decreases from northwest to southeast of the study area in both the present and future periods this is consistent with a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature in the southern regions relative to the northern regions of iraq as such climate components temperature precipitation and wind speed and groundwater recharge are found to be highly dependent on the geography of the study region and geology of the aquifer for all seven stations and under both expected emission scenarios almost all groundwater recharge indices showed incremental decreases with the relatively high rate of population growth and urbanization in iraq it can be concluded that more water scarcity is expected in the future especially towards the end of this century 4 conclusions the impacts of climate change are considerable on both surface and groundwater resources especially in arid and semi arid regions like the middle east nevertheless limited attention has been paid to the impact of global warming and climate change on groundwater resources for this reason the current study has focused on the impact of global warming and climate change on natural groundwater recharge in the unconfined aquifer located in iraq s western desert future climate parameters temperature precipitation and wind speed were predicted via the statistical downscaling of canesm2 under two future emission scenarios rcp4 5 middle and rcp8 5 high for the period 2020 2099 these projected climate parameters were submitted to the wetspass model to simulate natural groundwater recharge for the period 2020 2099 the results of the study indicate an increase in average temperatures and a decrease in annual precipitation for both selected emission scenarios at a local level the average temperature is expected to increase by 0 96 c based on rcp4 5 and 2 05 c for rcp8 5 while precipitation shows a 9 2 and 14 1 decrease under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 emission scenarios respectively consequently groundwater recharge will also be expected to reduce by 13 6 and 21 2 for scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 respectively during the period 2020 2099 in comparison to the historical reference period 1975 2005 the outcomes of this research could help decisionmakers stakeholders and scientists make decisions about the management and planning of groundwater resources in iraq one of the main recommendations is to consider artificial recharge by treated water or by stormwater harvesting to increase the potential of aquifers and

sample locations were investigated along the river in the kumasi environment ranging from upstream to downstream of the river s flow the sampling points were duase sepetimpom susanso and atonsu the water was collected in 500 ml pre sterilized polyethylene bottles repeatedly washed with water from each of the four sampling sites water samples were also taken in the sisa river for the measurement of microorganism indicators bacteriological samples were placed in sterile 500 ml vials in this study the total bacterial load in the drinking water was determined by counting the number of fecal and total coliform bacteria as well as the number of escherichia coli e coli to evaluate the degree of water pollution from fecal matter who 2017 all sample bottles intended to measure microorganisms were clearly labeled with site number time and date of collection and then immediately placed in a lightproof insulated box with an ice pack to ensure fast cooling the microbial analysis was done within 6 h after sampling the membrane filter method was also used for microbiological analysis of the sampled water the heavy metal analysis water samples were acidified with 1 ml of hno3 to a ph of 2 0 water samples were acidified to reduce metal precipitation and adsorption on container surfaces and inhibit microbiological activity apha 2005 all samples were clearly labeled and kept in an ice chest at 4 c before being brought to the department of chemistry knust for analysis using a portable multimeter ph temperature total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec and salinity were measured in situ during sample collection to obtain a stable reading the cell end of the multimeter was dipped into a sample of the water and allow to stand for at least 60 s to minimize cross contamination among samples the probe cell end was washed with deionized water after each measurement before measuring the water samples the ph meter was calibrated using buffer solutions of 4 7 and 10 titration was used to assess the total hardness alkalinity calcium ca2 chloride cl and magnesium mg2 ions in river water samples the palintest interface photometer 7500 was used to measure color fluoride f and nitrite no2 ions the palintest turbidimeter was used to measure total suspended solids tss and turbidity 10 ml of each sample was placed in the turbidimeter s cuvette the cuvette was properly cleaned and inserted into the meter the meter was operated to read the turbidity and the total suspended solids one after the other the accuracy and precision of the analysis were verified by performing duplicate analyses on each sample and recalibration of the instrument every 10 samples all of the samples had a relative standard deviation rsd of less than 10 the mixture was heated on a hot plate before being filtered into a volumetric flask using whatman filter paper the palintest interface photometer 7500 was used to measure the amounts of iron fe chromium cr manganese mn zinc zn and copper cu the sample was put into a test tube and a palintest reagent tablet of each of the heavy metals was used to prepare the sample for determination the tablets were dropped one by one into the sample and allowed to dissolve before transferring the fresh solution into the photometer s cell it was well shaken the photometer was calibrated to measure the concentration of the heavy metal under investigation the instrument was calibrated following the manufacturer s instructions and was set to maximum sensitivity according to the instruction manual quality control was maintained in all trace metals and the process accuracy was better than 95 in the confidence interval 2 3 microbiological analysis 2 3 1 total and fecal coliforms microbial analyses of water samples were carried out following standard procedures described for the multiple tube fermentation mtf technique to inoculate identify isolate and quantify the microorganisms in water samples apha 2005 the most probable number mpn of microorganisms was calculated using the mtf method other studies have used this method in their research amisah and nuamah 2014 ekopai et al 2017 the most probable number mpn technique was used to determine the total and fecal coliforms in the samples four serial dilutions ranging from 10 1 to 10 20 were prepared by picking 1 ml of the sample into sterile distilled water each dilution was inoculated in 1 ml aliquots into 5 ml of macconkey broth and incubated for 18 24 h at 35 c for total coliforms and 44 c for fecal coliforms total and fecal coliforms were detected in tubes that changed color from purple to yellow after 24 h 2 3 2 escherichia coli a drop was transferred from each of the positive tubes found and incubated at 44 c for 24 h in a 5 ml test tube containing trypton water after that a drop of kovacs reagent was introduced to the tube of trypton water all tubes showing a red ring color development after a gentle agitation denoted indole presence and were recorded as presumptive for thermotolerant coliforms e coli the most probable number tables were used to determine e coli counts per 100 ml 2 4 water quality index the water quality index wqi is a parameter for assessing water pollution caused by human activities muyen et al 2016 the weighted arithmetic wqi wqia technique was used to evaluate the appropriateness of river water samples in the study area this method classified water quality based on purity grade by assessing the most computed water quality indicators the relative weight w i was determined usingeq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i based on the risk to human health each element was assigned a weightage ranging from 1 to 5 table 1 şener et al 2017 elements posing the least and greatest danger were assigned the maximum values of 1 and 5 respectively wqi for drinking water quality status is calculated as follows 1 wqi i 0 n w i x m i s i x 100 where n ci and si represent the total number of a selected parameter evaluated in the research the concentration of the studied ith heavy metal and the drinking water standard in mg l as defined by who who 2017 in general the water quality index is divided into five 5 categories excellent water 50 good water 50 100 poor water 100 200 very poor water 200 300 and water unfit for consumption 300 sahu and sikdar 2008 2 5 pollution assessment indices hmpi hmei and c d were utilized to assess overall water quality in relation to the selected heavy metals 2 5 1 heavy metal pollution index water quality was also assessed based on the presence of heavy metals in the water samples tested the methodology for the hmpi can be found elsewhere kone et al 2019 giri and singh 2014 similar to the wqi the weighted arithmetic value of hmpi was used in the analysis presented giri and singh 2014 hmpi was inversely proportional to the suggested standard of the resultant heavy metal horton 1965 the hmpi was evaluated following eqn 2 mohan et al 1996 2 hmpi i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where w i is the unit weighting of the ith heavy metal q i is the sub index for the ith heavy metal and n is the number of analyzed heavy metals fe cu zn cr and mn q i was calculated using eqn 3 mohan et al 1996 3 q i i 1 n m i i i s i i i x 100 where s i and i i are the who who 2017 standards and ideal concentrations for drinking water water quality is classified as low hpi 100 threshold risk hpi 100 and high hpi 100 depending on the hpi saha and paul 2019 2 5 2 heavy metal evaluation index both the hmpi and hmei provide information about the overall surface water quality regarding heavy metals concentration hmei was calculated according to eqn 4 edet and offiong 2002 4 hmei i 1 n m i mac i where mac i is the monitored value and maximum permissible concentration of the ith heavy metal classifications of surface water quality based upon hmei are 10 for low 10 20 for moderate and 20 for high pollution 2 5 3 degree of contamination cd shows the cumulative harmful effect of heavy metals on surface water and determined as backman et al 1998 5 c d i 1 n c f i m i m a c i 1 where cf i is the contamination factor for the ith heavy metal c d is as 1 1 3 and 3 for low moderate and high pollution of heavy metals in water bodies backman et al 1998 2 5 4 heavy metal toxicity load hmtl hmtl is calculated by multiplying hazard intensity with the corresponding levels of heavy metals as follows 6 hmtl i 1 n m i x h i s i where his i is the hazard intensity score of the ith heavy metal adopted from the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr atsdr 2019 2 6 health risk assessment health risk assessment estimates the probability of any given magnitude of adverse health effects within a specific period bortey sam et al 2015 this assessment was expressed by carcinogenic or non carcinogenic risk based on quantifying the level for heavy metal exposure herein the exposure route of heavy metals is expected to be direct ingestion with surface water intake liu et al 2011 the chronic daily intake cdi via ingestion pathway was adapted from the united state environment protection agency as follows usepa 2004 7 cdi cw x ir x ef x ed bw x at where at average time 3650 days for children and 25 550 days for adult bw bodyweight 15 kg for child and 70 kg for adult ed exposure duration 10 years for children and 70 years for adult ef exposure frequency 365 days year ir ingestion rate 1 l day for children and 2 2 l day for adult and cw concentration of trace metal in water μg l usepa 2004 to assess the potential non carcinogenic risk hazard quotient hq was also calculated usepa 2004 if hq value exceeds 1 or less than 1 it is regarded as an undesirable or acceptable risk of non carcinogenic adverse effects on human health usepa 2004 the hq was evaluated following eq 8 8 hq cdi rfd here rfd is the oral reference dose the oral rfd mg kg day values for cu fe zn mn and cr are 0 04 0 7 0 3 0 14 and 1 5 respectively wongsasuluk et al 2014 usepa iris 2011 2 6 1 hazard index hi assessment to evaluate the overall potential for non carcinogenic adverse effects posed by more than one heavy metal hi which is the sum of all calculated hqs for each chemical was calculated usepa 2004 9 hi hq1 hq2 hqn if hi 1 no non carcinogenic risks occur at the sampling site hi 1 indicates non carcinogenic health risks usepa 2004 2 6 2 cancer risk cr the likelihood of cr associated with water ingestion was calculated by using eq 10 cr cdi x sf here cr is documented as carcinogens for humans iarc 2012 the oral sfs for cr is 0 5 mg kg day zhang et al 2015 2 7 data analysis data were analyzed with ibm statistical package for social science version 20 means and standard deviations for each parameter were calculated to establish a relationship between variables categorize key factors and classify the sources accountable for surface water quality multivariate statistical approaches such as pca were utilized multivariate data analysis explores the relationship between measurement and a sample of individuals objects or things 3 results and discussions 3 1 physicochemical and heavy metals parameters the interpretation of chemical and physical parameters was based on who drinking water standards who 2017 table 2 summarizes the observed physicochemical and heavy metals parameters of surface water from the sisa river as well as the standard acceptable limits the results reveal that most parameters have a wide range of standard deviations showing that a variety of activities impacts surface water quality the temperature ranges between 31 02 and 35 50 c the present study generally agrees with those reported in groundwater in a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana opoku et al 2020 and the netravati river basin india sudhakaran et al 2020 however it was high than the values recorded in welkom and virginia free state province south africa belle et al 2021 generally ph indicates the strength of the water to react with the alkaline or acidic material in the water bodies islam et al 2017 all the surface water samples were alkaline based on the ph value ranging between 7 15 and 8 25 with an average value of 7 59 these were within the permissible limit set by who 6 5 8 5 the water ph correlates with the hardness and alkalinity in the aquatic environment which gives information on the survival of non living and living systems panda et al 2018 the value of surface water ph does not have a direct human health effect however groundwater in the acidic medium ph 6 could increase the dissolution and leaching of heavy metals where a higher ph is likely to enhance the precipitation of calcite minerals ansari et al 2015 studies conducted by zakaria et al 2021 in groundwater quality in the anayari catchment howladar et al 2021 in surma river bangladesh and singh et al 2020a b in river water quality in lucknow environs uttar pradesh india also recorded alkaline ph however al mamun et al 2019 in the piyain river from jaflong sylhet and rezaei et al 2020 in the dalgan basin iran have reported acidic ph water hardness is primarily caused by the presence of cations such as magnesium and calcium and anions including sulfate chloride and bicarbonate in the water resources ravikumar et al 2010 the total hardness values were from 108 00 18 to 116 00 31 mg l total hardness of water is generally classified as soft 0 and 60 mg l moderately hard 61 120 mg l hard 121 180 mg l and very hard more than 180 mg l mcgowan 2000 based on this classification all the surface waters in the study area were categorized as hard the maximum th levels obtained in the present study reveal that the water samples were lower than those reported by zakaria et al 2021 172 55 and 139 21 mg l for bore hole and hand dug well respectively opoku et al 2020 in groundwater from a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana 328 mg l and singh et al 2020a b in river water quality in lucknow environs uttar pradesh india ec is regarded as one of the most significant factors for classifying the quality of drinking water the determination of ec in water bodies reveals their capacity to conduct an electric current and is related to the quantity of ionized compounds in the water bodies radojevic et al 1999 the ec varied from 284 to 530 μs cm with a mean value of 388 25 μs cm being within the who acceptable limit who 2017 despite this variation ec levels remain low indicating that mineralization is poor in the study area as a result the river water was less ionized and had a lower ionic concentration meride and ayenew 2016 as a result a lower ec value implies a low concentration of dissolved ions in water bodies such as organic matter and inorganic salt radojevic et al 1999 the findings in this study were higher than earlier studies done by howladar et al 2021 in the surma river bangladesh and al mamun et al 2019 in the piyain river sand jaflong sylhet the ec value in this study however was lower than that reported by opoku et al 2020 in groundwater from a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana sunkari et al 2019 in groundwater quality in the ga west municipality ghana sudhakaran et al 2020 in the netravati river basin india and mukate et al 2018 in the chincholi industrial area the total dissolved solids tds concentration is the sum of anions negatively charged and cations positively charged in water bodies tds levels ranging from 202 to 370 mg l were under the who recommended limit of 500 mg l todd and mays 2004 classify groundwater as extremely fresh 0 250 mg l fresh 250 1000 mg l brackish 1000 10 000 mg l and salty 10 000 100 000 mg l because the tds levels were less than 1000 mg l all the surface water samples were extremely freshwater a study done by zakaria et al 2021 indicated that tds levels were comparable to those recorded in this study however the levels found in this study were greater than those found in a study conducted by howladar et al 2021 in the surma river in bangladesh however studies in groundwater from a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana opoku et al 2020 ga west municipality ghana sunkari et al 2019 river water quality in lucknow environs uttar pradesh india singh et al 2020a b netravati river basin india sudhakaran et al 2020 and chincholi industrial area of solapur maharashtra india mukate et al 2018 recorded higher tds than the current study generally chloride is regarded as an index of water pollution where a higher concentration gives a salty taste to water chloride concentrations range from 21 00 2 0 to 55 00 9 50 mg l the concentrations of cl in all the surface water samples were within the who acceptable limit of 250 mg l cl occurrence in river water could result from anthropogenic activities such as the leaching of chloride from topsoil during irrigation over pumping groundwater and applying chemical and manure fertilizers zakaria et al 2021 chloride levels from this study were higher than early studies conducted by howladar et al 2021 in surma river bangladesh and rezaei et al 2020 in the dalgan basin iran however the maximum level was lower than those reported in groundwater from a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana opoku et al 2020 ga west municipality ghana sunkari et al 2019 turbidity levels in river water samples varied from 27 00 8 0 to 57 40 10 ntu turbidity levels at all locations exceed the allowable limit of 5 ntu who 2017 the turbidity values from this research were lower than those from earlier investigations in the surma river bangladesh done by howladar et al 2021 turbidity levels were lower in the netravati river basin in india sudhakaran et al 2020 and welkom and virginia in the free state province of south africa belle et al 2021 than in the current study alkalinity is a measure of buffering capacity of water and its ability to withstand ph changes al mamun et al 2019 total alkalinity was lower in the range of 118 00 56 228 00 63 mg l as caco3 than that reported by al mamun et al 2019 in piyain river sand from jaflong sylhet rezaei et al 2020 in the dalgan basin iran and singh et al 2020a b in river water quality in lucknow environs uttar pradesh india to protect aquatic life the buffering capacity should be at least 20 mg l al mamun et al 2019 the water samples from susanso and atonsu were above the who recommended level of 200 mg l the average no2 concentration varied between 0 001 0 00 and 0 12 0 02 mg l these results were below the who recommended level of 3 mg l as a result the presence of considerable no2 suggests pollution from sewage seepage and oxygen deficiency aghzar et al 2002 however our findings indicated that no2 concentrations were low in all the water samples tested as a result we could determine that the examined river water had not been contaminated by seepage water furthermore no2 values were lower than those reported by sudhakaran et al 2020 in the netravati river basin india fluoride is one of the necessary micronutrients that negatively or positively influence human health when consumed through drinking water and other dietary sources kimambo et al 2019 other positive metal ions na and ca are attracted to the highly electronegative f ion and even at low concentrations 0 5 mg l f bonds with ca in teeth and produces dental caries keshavarz et al 2015 f consumption from surface water has both harmful and beneficial consequences for human health fluorosis is caused by higher levels of f 1 5 mg l in children and levels of f more than 4 10 mg l may contribute to the development of skeletal and dental fluorosis queste et al 2001 fluoride in low doses affects tooth hygiene saleem et al 2016 f levels in river water samples ranged from 0 00 to 0 74 0 06 mg l all the samples had f concentrations lower than the acceptable level for drinking water who 2017 weathering and dissolution of f containing minerals are the most common causes of f in water bodies mukherjee and singh 2018 according to raju et al 2009 alkaline waters tend to solubilize f minerals the f concentrations from this study were lower than the study conducted by zakaria et al 2021 higher f concentrations were found in the peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana opoku et al 2020 ga west municipality sunkari et al 2019 dalgan basin iran rezaei et al 2020 and drinking water sources in the jirapa and kassena nankana municipalities of ghana dongzagla et al 2019 calcium was the most abundant cation in the study area with concentrations ranging from 78 00 19 and 86 00 19 mg l these high values of ca2 concentrations are caused by intensive agricultural activities pollution from surface seepage waters and the geology of the study area the presence of ca2 in the soil might be attributable to caso4 and caco3 minerals anhydrite gypsum dolomite and calcite zakaria et al 2021 mg2 concentrations vary from 24 00 0 15 to 36 00 0 09 mg l magnesium may also be found in water because of fertilizer application studies done by zakaria et al 2021 in groundwater in the anayari watershed and al mamun et al 2019 in piyain river sand from jaflong sylhet revealed lower concentrations of ca2 and mg2 than the present study however the maximum ca2 and mg2 levels in the current study were lower than those reported by sunkari et al 2019 in groundwater quality from the ga west municipality in ghana rezaei et al 2020 in the dalgan basin in iran and belle et al 2021 in welkom and virginia in the free state province of south africa table 2 shows the results of the analysis of various trace metals found in surface water samples box plots were used to depict the overall response pattern for a group of samples they provide a useful way to visualize the range and other characteristics of a large group s responses outliers maximum whisker upper quartiles 75 median 50 quartiles 25 whisker lower and lowest are described from top to bottom for each heavy metal studied in the box whisker plot fig 2 although the concentrations of all the metals examined varied no correlation was found between them fig 3 heavy metals were also examined to determine their suitability for drinking table 2 summarizes the findings fe values were the highest of any heavy metal in very high quantities iron is essential for human wellbeing it deteriorates linen and has an impact on the organoleptic characteristics of water resources the concentrations of fe and cr in the surface water varied from 2 00 0 00 to 3 00 0 05 mg l and 0 05 0 00 to 0 10 0 01 mg l respectively with a mean of 2 53 and 0 07 mg l all the samples exceeded the who permissible level consumers could have visual difficulties resulting from fe in water bodies mondal et al 2010 a high fe level can lead to hemochromatosis a severe illness that can damage body organs who 2017 other symptoms such as joint pain weight loss and fatigue may arise due to high fe levels in drinking water ahmed et al 2019 boateng et al 2015 howladar et al 2021 and al mamun et al 2019 reported lower fe and cr levels in the surma and piyain rivers respectively compared with this study fe concentrations were higher in uttar pradesh india than in the current study singh et al 2020a b cu concentrations varied from 0 30 0 01 to 1 60 0 001 mg l with a mean value of 1 08 mg l mn levels in the surface water varied from 0 04 0 001 to 0 07 0 001 mg l with a mean value of 0 05 mg l zn concentrations ranged from 0 05 0 005 to 0 45 0 01 mg l with a mean value of 0 19 mg l a high mn content in drinking water for an extended period may result in neurological problems who 2017 furthermore high amounts of zn consumption via the drinking channel might cause stomach cramps vomiting or nausea a high zn intake for a few months may also induce anemia a decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and pancreatic damage who 2017 fortunately mn cu and zn concentrations in surface water were within the who maximum allowable limit cu zn and cr levels were greater than previous studies by opoku et al 2020 in groundwater from a peri urban village in atonsu kumasi ghana microbial analysis values obtained at duase sepe susanso and atonsu were within the range of 9 15 1016 to 4 15 1021 for total coliform 4 1 108 to 2 35 1011 for fecal coliform and 1 5 106 to 2 1 109 respectively with atonsu recording the highest value for total coliform fecal coliform and e coli followed by susanso with sepe recording the lowest microbial level table 3 the rise in microbiological levels was associated to the relocation of the waste dump closer to the river for any water to be deemed safe for human consumption the fecal and total coliform counts must be zero who 2017 based on this all the recorded water samples were greater than the suggested limit for drinking which was a major issue because the water could be used for drinking water polluted with total and fecal coliform can cause diarrhea headaches and nausea qadir et al 2008 other investigations found e coli levels in more than half of the sampling locations while fecal coliform bacterial counts in water samples were all non compliant with who drinking water quality guidelines belle et al 2021 3 2 correlation analysis a correlation coefficient is a typical tool for determining and measuring the connection between two variables it is a simple statistical technique for demonstrating the degree to which one variable is dependent on another pearson correlation was used to identify the factors that contribute to the dispersion and transportation of pollutants in water bodies chen et al 2012 and the interrelationship between the influencing water quality variables to determine the most likely common sources 1 and 1 values respectively represent strong and positive connections a value of 0 indicates that there is no linear connection between the variables a significant positive correlation between parameters suggests similar behavior mutual dependence or common source makokha et al 2016 the absence of significant correlations among ec mg2 and ca2 table 4 indicates that both cations did not contribute to water mineralization in the study area varol 2020 ph and tds have a significant positive correlation with ec tds alkalinity and t coli turbidity also has a strong relation with no2 ph was influenced by ca2 ions rao 1982 the strong correlations between cl and mg2 were related to soluble salts varol and şen 2009 ca2 vs no2 hardness vs cl mg2 vs cl and mg2 vs alkalinity on the other hand showed a strong negative significant correlation t coli was also strongly associated with ph tds ec alkalinity and mg2 showing the influence of anthropogenic process varol 2020 because there is a substantial connection between zn and cr it is possible that cr came from natural and human sources there was no association between ec and heavy metals indicating that physicochemical processes such as ion exchange and oxidation reduction did not occur in the analyzed surface water bodies srivastava and ramanathan 2008 3 3 pollution source and factors controlling surface water quality pca was utilized to explain the observed relationship between cluster variables as reflected by patterns of variation and covariance between variables and correlations between measurements factor loadings are divided into three categories strong 0 75 moderate 0 50 0 75 and weak 0 50 liu et al 2003 pca was conducted on surface water quality data using varimax rotation with kaiser normalization which reduced the number of variables to a smaller set of scores called components while retaining most of the main data the sum of variance of the component coefficients was maximized using varimax rotation which better explains the possible sources that influence water systems islam et al 2017 three independent factors components were identified based on eigenvalues greater than one accounting for 98 86 of the total variance the screen plot was used to determine the number of pcs retained fig 2 table 5 shows the computed factor loadings percentage of variation and cumulative percentage explained by each factor component negative or positive loading indicates that the surface water sample is either essentially unaffected or affected by the presence of extracted loadings respectively bhuiyan et al 2016 more than 57 818 of the total variation were explained by the first principal component pc1 ph temperature salinity tds ec ca2 cl f alkalinity mn total coliform fecal coliform and e coli were positively loaded contaminants such as household wastewater transferred from the surface and subsurface strata to surface water resources resulted in high tds and cl loadings due to its poor solubility the f seems to be non reactive in surface water with a ph of 7 0 and is absorbed in exchangeable materials or clay however in this study the hydroxyl group substitutes the exchangeable f as kaolinite clay minerals due to the alkaline ph molekoa et al 2019 ec and tds were related to discharge from urban areas including surface run off causing erosion of road margins sewage contamination industrial wastes and soil erosion have all been linked to high cl levels mg no2 total hardness and turbidity all showed significant negative loading pc1 also has moderate negative loading for tss this component is a non point source of pollution associated with organic pollutants precipitation run off and agricultural operations it also indicates the substantial effect of anthropogenic activity mainly industrial and domestic waste in the study area howladar et al 2017 the second principal component pc2 accounting for 21 892 of the total variance was loaded with tss hardness cr zn and cu human induced geogenic processes such as agrochemicals fertilizers and industrial wastes were attributed to high zn loading barzegar et al 2019 phosphate containing fertilizers wood production fuel combustion domestic wastewater and waste dumps are all sources of cu wagh et al 2018 tannery effluent electroplating paper printing pottery units paints pigments residential waste traffic and intrusive rock weathering may all be sources of cr wagh et al 2018 pc2 pollution in this study might be attributable to a combination of natural and human activities the third principal component pc3 explained 19 150 of the total variance and was influenced by color mn fe cu and fecal coliform all of which were found in substantial levels in the samples iron which is abundant crustal was geogenic in nature ahmed et al 2019 agricultural practices fertilizers sewage and animal waste disposal were all sources of mn ramesh and elango 2012 the bacterial activity was also responsible for the levels of mn and fe in the samples naujokas et al 2013 finally pc3 revealed leaching of anthropogenic materials from the soil horizon into the aquifer bhuiyan et al 2016 to summarize the pollution of the sisa river was mostly influenced by urban planning decisions and social norms including waste disposal practices and hygiene practices 3 4 water quality index because it integrates many distinct surface water quality parameters into a single value the wqi is a helpful tool for monitoring and managing surface water resources the water quality index wqi is a tool for determining how human activities affect water quality water is regarded to be of high quality if the wqi is less than 50 a water quality index of 50 100 indicates excellent water whereas a score of 100 200 indicates inadequate water quality when the index falls between 200 and 300 the water is considered poor quality and should not be consumed the wqi in the study area ranged from 97 95 to 137 22 with samples from duase sepe and atonsu having low quality table 6 this suggests that sewage entering the aquifer and agricultural operations along the sisa river contributed to the low water quality bodrud doza et al 2016 furthermore the pace at which water flows is another factor that influences water contamination hamrick and mills 2000 susanso on the other hand falls under the category of high quality drinking water drinking groundwater in shiraz was found to have a low water quality of 28 6 badeenezhad et al 2020 higher than the values recorded in this study furthermore in central bangladesh around 48 33 and 3 33 of the samples showed low and extremely poor water quality types respectively bodrud doza et al 2016 iron concentrations had the greatest impact on the wqi followed by ph cr ca2 mg2 ec and tds 3 5 pollution assessment using heavy metal pollution indices toxic heavy metal such asas was found in bdl has no impact on the overall water quality however the surface water samples were marginally polluted by heavy metals according to hmpi findings in table 7 and maybe unfit for drinking and domestic use due to sewage discharge run off from municipal and construction waste the sample locations had hmpi 100 cleaning utensils clothes and other household habits also contribute to increased pollution in water bodies as a result of run off from discarded trash residential sewage air precipitation of aerosols and industrial operations the cumulative impact of heavy metals on overall water quality was alarming however hpi values below the critical index value have been reported in the upper gangetic basin of india ranging from 6 to 91 by kumar et al 2019 ugljesnica river serbia 67 487 and 80 676 in spring and autumn seasons respectively by milivojevic et al 2016 tirupati town india mean hpi value of 3 5243 by mohan et al 1996 and groundwater of the west bokaro coalfield 3 32 by tiwari et al 2016 the hmei value was determined to be 16 09 indicating that heavy metal contamination in the study region is moderate however when compared to bodrud doza et al 2016 categorization of cd levels the cd value was 3 indicating significant heavy metal contamination of the surface water samples tested table 8 all the hmtl values below the permissible limit of 5888 527 mg l saha and paul 2019 the greatest hmtl value was found in cu while the lowest was found in mn 3 6 human health risk assessment hq and hi calculations considering the oral pathway for adults and children are given in table 10 the non carcinogenic risk was evaluated for both adults and children via ingestion except for cu at duase and atonsu water samples both hq and hi were lower than the acceptable limit hq 1 for adults table 9 showing non carcinogenic effects to adults the hq and hi values for cu at duase sepe and atonsu had lower values 1 indicating a worry for a non carcinogenic health risk to the exposed population through ingestion by children in this study the cancer risk in children in this study was greater than the tolerable cancer limit for the investigated heavy metal in all water samples indicating a possible carcinogenic risk however the cancer risk in adults was lower than the permissible level in duase and atonsu indicating a potential cancer risk children on the other hand were shown to have a greater cancer risk than adults 4 conclusion in most ghanaian villages surface and groundwater are the primary sources of drinking water the quality of surface water in the sisa river was studied to assess the health risks due to ingestion among children and adults to evaluate the water quality multivariate statistical methods pearson correlation and pca were used and a water quality index which is critical for determining the suitability of surface water for domestic and drinking uses the quality of surface water for drinking purposes was assessed using who standards and the wqi surface water quality has deteriorated somewhat with alkaline ph and high turbidity and alkalinity color microbiological fe and cr levels above who acceptable limits to explore the relationship between contaminants and determine their possible sources multivariate statistical analysis was utilized mixed natural processes i e high evaporation climatic conditions water rock interaction and anthropogenic activities i e agricultural activities surface run off from precipitation dissolution processes and organic pollution sources play a significant role in surface water quality the wqi results reveal poor water quality in surface water samples from duase sepe and atonsu with cr and fe as the most prevalent parameters the carcinogenic risk falls under the very high 10 4 category furthermore through cu consumption the cumulative risk of non carcinogenic pollutants was alarming and close to the usepa limit hi 1 in children at duase

11866,surface water quality deterioration is one of the primary issues of the twenty first century due to the high demand for drinking and irrigation purposes in most communities the purpose of this study was to investigate the suitability of the sisa river in kumasi metropolis as well as the critical factors affecting its water quality and human health risk among children and adults the findings indicated that the surface water was alkaline and in some samples turbidity alkalinity color microbial fe and cr concentrations exceeded the standard permissible limits of who water from individual sampling sites contained escherichia coli total and fecal coliform counts there was no strong significant correlation among the levels of the heavy metals suggesting their lack of control in their distribution source and transport pathway principal component analysis pca revealed three factors that account for about 98 86 of the total variance in the surface water quality data set moreover pca findings revealed that geogenic and anthropogenic sources were responsible for variations in physicochemical and microbiological parameters of the study area fe and cr were found to have high toxic levels among the heavy metals analyzed the heavy metal assessment index indicated moderate to high hazards cu had a hazard index greater than one at duase and atonsu indicating a possible non carcinogenic risk the overall carcinogenic risk values were greater than 10 6 indicating the possibility of cancer water quality index values ranging from 97 95 to 137 22 percent showed that about 75 of the samples were of poor quality based on these results we recommended proper water management strategies and policies should be implemented as soon as possible to manage and protect the water

5 billion people by 2025 ibn ali et al 2020 according to 2016 estimates almost nine out of 10 ghanaians have access to improved drinking water sources with approximately 68 having only basic water services who 2017 over 80 of rural areas in ghana whose water schemes are either inaccessible non functional or only partially functioning would have to rely on unsafe surface water sources such as rainfall dams and rivers for drinkable water anim gyampo et al 2012 thus most ghanaians who do not have access to safe drinking water live in small towns and rural regions manu 2015 moreover agriculture illegal mining industrial waste discharge and household disposals all contribute to surface water contamination in ghana ampomah 2017 a detailed and systematic water quality study of the sisa river is still lacking there has been no attempt to assess the quality of sisa river and interpret the results using multivariate statistical approaches the main objectives of the current study were to investigate 1 heavy metal physicochemical and microbial counts in sisa river 2 water quality for drinking purposes using wqi and hpi 3 potential sources of pollution using multivariate analyses and 4 degree of health risks potential for surface water contaminants through ingestion exposure pathway the study estimated the following null hypothesis based on the objectives 1 there is no significant difference between heavy metals in the study area 2 there are several sources of pollutant variables that affect the sisa river quality 3 most of the water quality was of poor water quality based on the wqi method and 4 there is a significant difference in the microbiological water quality the findings of this study have provided an in depth information perspective of the present condition of sisa river quality which will be useful for policymakers in implementing appropriate policies and preventative actions to control surface water quality and sustainability 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area kumasi is the capital of the ashanti region and home to one of the largest markets in west africa kumasi is in the south east ecological zone of ghana a moist semi deciduous zone at about 853 ft above sea level kumasi is about 170 miles north of accra the capital city of ghana kumasi is the second largest and fastest growing city of ghana with an estimated population of 3 490 030 world urbanization prospects 2021 and a population growth rate of 4 24 percent from 2020 the city is situated between longitudes 1 30 and 1 35 and latitudes 6 35 and 6 40 with an elevation ranging from 250 to 300 m above sea level and an area of approximately 254 km2 the relative central location of kumasi with more densely populated portions makes it an important hub in ghana kumasi shares boundaries to the north by kwabre east district the south by bosomtwe district the east by ejisu juaben municipality and the west by atwima district the kumasi metropolis is situated between 250 and 300 m above sea level on the plateau of the south west physical area the average temperature in the metropolis ranges from 21 5 c minimum to 30 7 c maximum the humidity level is typically high with an average of 84 16 during the day and 60 at night the pra basin contains the metropolis dickson and benneh 1998 the santana wiwi aboabo subin and daban streams are part of a reasonably dense network that drains from north to south dickson and benneh 1998 these streams have dendritic patterns and originate in the flat bottomed basins of the owabi sokoban oda and sisa rivers dickson and benneh 1998 many small streams including ada mnono kamafo and aynasu act as tributaries to the owabi river which meets other urban tributaries near atafoa the daban and subin rivers are tributaries of the sisa river which flows into oda about 9 km south of kumasi and drains northwest into the owabi dam catchment region and hence into the ofin river cornish et al 1999 the sisa oda catchment area begins at the kwame nkrumah university of science and technology knust campus and extends southerly until merging with oda fig 1 depicts the study area birimian rocks are commonly foliated and tangled and significant water will percolate through joints fractures or other sections where they outcrop or lie near the surface kesse 1985 this implies that the granite rocks discovered with the birimian rocks are not inherently permeable but have secondary permeability kesse 1985 2 2 sampling and chemical procedure thirty river water samples were collected from various locations in kumasi ghana four sample locations were investigated along the river in the kumasi environment ranging from upstream to downstream of the river s flow the sampling points were duase sepetimpom susanso and atonsu the water was collected in 500 ml pre sterilized polyethylene bottles repeatedly washed with water from each of the four sampling sites water samples were also taken in the sisa river for the measurement of microorganism indicators bacteriological samples were placed in sterile 500 ml vials in this study the total bacterial load in the drinking water was determined by counting the number of fecal and total coliform bacteria as well as the number of escherichia coli e coli to evaluate the degree of water pollution from fecal matter who 2017 all sample bottles intended to measure microorganisms were clearly labeled with site number time and date of collection and then immediately placed in a lightproof insulated box with an ice pack to ensure fast cooling the microbial analysis was done within 6 h after sampling the membrane filter method was also used for microbiological analysis of the sampled water the heavy metal analysis water samples were acidified with 1 ml of hno3 to a ph of 2 0 water samples were acidified to reduce metal precipitation and adsorption on container surfaces and inhibit microbiological activity apha 2005 all samples were clearly labeled and kept in an ice chest at 4 c before being brought to the department of chemistry knust for analysis using a portable multimeter ph temperature total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec and salinity were measured in situ during sample collection to obtain a stable reading the cell end of the multimeter was dipped into a sample of the water and allow to stand for at least 60 s to minimize cross contamination among samples the probe cell end was washed with deionized water after each measurement before measuring the water samples the ph meter was calibrated using buffer solutions of 4 7 and 10 titration was used to assess the total hardness alkalinity calcium ca2 chloride cl and magnesium mg2 ions in river water samples the palintest interface photometer 7500 was used to measure color fluoride f and nitrite no2 ions the palintest turbidimeter was used to measure total suspended solids tss and turbidity 10 ml of each sample was placed in the turbidimeter s cuvette the cuvette was properly cleaned and inserted into the meter the meter was operated to read the turbidity and the total suspended solids one after the other the accuracy and precision of the analysis were verified by performing duplicate analyses on each sample and recalibration of the instrument every 10 samples all of the samples had a relative standard deviation rsd of less than 10 the mixture was heated on a hot plate before being filtered into a volumetric flask using whatman filter paper the palintest interface photometer 7500 was used to measure the amounts of iron fe chromium cr manganese mn zinc zn and copper cu the sample was put into a test tube and a palintest reagent tablet of each of the heavy metals was used to prepare the sample for determination the tablets were dropped one by one into the sample and allowed to dissolve before transferring the fresh solution into the photometer s cell it was well shaken the photometer was calibrated to measure the concentration of the heavy metal under investigation the instrument was calibrated following the manufacturer s instructions and was set to maximum sensitivity according to the instruction manual quality control was maintained in all trace metals and the process accuracy was better than 95 in the confidence interval 2 3 microbiological analysis 2 3 1 total and fecal coliforms microbial analyses of water samples were carried out following standard procedures described for the multiple tube fermentation mtf technique to inoculate identify isolate and quantify the microorganisms in water samples apha 2005 the most probable number mpn of microorganisms was calculated using the mtf method other studies have used this method in their research amisah and nuamah 2014 ekopai et al 2017 the most probable number mpn technique was used to determine the total and fecal coliforms in the samples four serial dilutions ranging from 10 1 to 10 20 were prepared by picking 1 ml of the sample into sterile distilled water each dilution was inoculated in 1 ml aliquots into 5 ml of macconkey broth and incubated for 18 24 h at 35 c for total coliforms and 44 c for fecal coliforms total and fecal coliforms were detected in tubes that changed color from purple to yellow after 24 h 2 3 2 escherichia coli a drop was transferred from each of the positive tubes found and incubated at 44 c for 24 h in a 5 ml test tube containing trypton water after that a drop of kovacs reagent was introduced to the tube of trypton water all tubes showing a red ring color development after a gentle agitation denoted indole presence and were recorded as presumptive for thermotolerant coliforms e coli the most probable number tables were used to determine e coli counts per 100 ml 2 4 water quality index the water quality index wqi is a parameter for assessing water pollution caused by human activities muyen et al 2016 the weighted arithmetic wqi wqia technique was used to evaluate the appropriateness of river water samples in the study area this method classified water quality based on purity grade by assessing the most computed water quality indicators the relative weight w i was determined usingeq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i based on the risk to human health each element was assigned a weightage ranging from 1 to 5 table 1 şener et al 2017 elements posing the least and greatest danger were assigned the maximum values of 1 and 5 respectively wqi for drinking water quality status is calculated as follows 1 wqi i 0 n w i x m i s i x 100 where n ci and si represent the total number of a selected parameter evaluated in the research the concentration of the studied ith heavy metal and the drinking water standard in mg l as defined by who who 2017 in general the water quality index is divided into five 5 categories excellent water 50 good water 50 100 poor water 100 200 very poor water 200 300 and water unfit for consumption 300 sahu and sikdar 2008 2 5 pollution assessment indices hmpi hmei and c d were utilized to assess overall water quality in relation to the selected heavy metals 2 5 1 heavy metal pollution index water quality was also assessed based on the presence of heavy metals in the water samples tested the methodology for the hmpi can be found elsewhere kone et al 2019 giri and singh 2014 similar to the wqi the weighted arithmetic value of hmpi was used in the analysis presented giri and singh 2014 hmpi was inversely proportional to the suggested standard of the resultant heavy metal horton 1965 the hmpi was evaluated following eqn 2 mohan et al 1996 2 hmpi i 1 n w i q i i 1 n w i where w i is the unit weighting of the ith heavy metal q i is the sub index for the ith heavy metal and n is the number of analyzed heavy metals fe cu zn cr and mn q i was calculated using eqn 3 mohan et al 1996 3 q i i 1 n m i i i s i i i x 100 where s i and i i are the who who 2017 standards and ideal concentrations for drinking water water quality is classified as low hpi 100 threshold risk hpi 100 and high hpi 100 depending on the hpi saha and paul 2019 2 5 2 heavy metal evaluation index both the hmpi and hmei provide information about the overall surface water quality regarding heavy metals concentration hmei was calculated according to eqn 4 edet and offiong 2002 4 hmei i 1 n m i mac i where mac i is the monitored value and maximum permissible concentration of the ith heavy metal classifications of surface water quality based upon hmei are 10 for low 10 20 for moderate and 20 for high pollution 2 5 3 degree of contamination cd shows the cumulative harmful effect of heavy metals on surface water and determined as backman et al 1998 5 c d i 1 n c f i m i m a c i 1 where cf i is the contamination factor for the ith heavy metal c d is as 1 1 3 and 3 for low moderate and high pollution of heavy metals in water bodies backman et al 1998 2 5 4 heavy metal toxicity load hmtl hmtl is calculated by multiplying hazard intensity with the corresponding levels of heavy metals as follows 6 hmtl i 1 n m i x h i s i where his i is the hazard intensity score of the ith heavy metal adopted from the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr atsdr 2019 2 6 health risk assessment health risk assessment estimates the probability of any given magnitude of adverse health effects within a specific period bortey sam et al 2015 this assessment was expressed by carcinogenic or non carcinogenic risk based on quantifying the level for heavy metal exposure herein the exposure route of heavy metals is expected to be direct ingestion with surface water intake liu et al 2011 the chronic daily intake cdi via ingestion pathway was adapted from the united state environment protection agency as follows usepa 2004 7 cdi cw x ir x ef x ed bw x at where at average time 3650 days for children and 25 550 days for adult bw bodyweight 15 kg for child and 70 kg for adult ed exposure duration 10 years for children and 70 years for adult ef exposure frequency 365 days year ir ingestion rate 1 l day for children and 2 2 l day for adult and cw concentration of trace metal in water μg l usepa 2004 to assess the potential non carcinogenic risk hazard quotient hq was also calculated usepa 2004 if hq value exceeds 1 or less than 1 it is regarded as an undesirable or acceptable risk of non carcinogenic adverse effects on human health usepa 2004 the hq was evaluated following eq 8 8 hq cdi rfd here rfd is the oral reference dose the oral rfd mg kg day values for cu fe zn mn and cr are 0 04 0 7 0 3 0 14 and 1 5 respectively wongsasuluk et al 2014 usepa iris 2011 2 6 1 hazard index hi assessment to evaluate the overall potential for non carcinogenic adverse effects posed by more than one heavy metal hi which is the sum of all calculated hqs for each chemical was calculated usepa 2004 9 hi hq1 hq2 hqn if hi 1 no non carcinogenic risks occur at the sampling site hi 1 indicates non carcinogenic health risks usepa 2004 2 6 2 cancer risk cr the likelihood of cr associated with water ingestion was calculated by using eq 10 cr cdi x sf here cr is documented as carcinogens for humans iarc 2012 the oral sfs for cr is 0 5 mg kg day zhang et al 2015 2 7 data analysis data were analyzed with ibm statistical package for social science version 20 means and standard deviations for each parameter were calculated to establish a relationship between variables categorize key factors and classify the sources accountable for surface water quality multivariate statistical approaches such as pca were utilized multivariate data analysis explores the relationship between measurement and a sample of individuals objects or things 3 results and discussions 3 1 physicochemical and heavy metals parameters the interpretation of chemical and physical parameters was based on who drinking water standards who 2017 table 2 summarizes the observed physicochemical and heavy metals parameters of surface water from the sisa river as well as the standard acceptable limits the results reveal that most parameters have a wide range of standard deviations showing that a variety of activities impacts surface water quality the temperature ranges between 31 02 and 35 50 c the present study generally agrees with those reported in groundwater in a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana opoku et al 2020 and the netravati river basin india sudhakaran et al 2020 however it was high than the values recorded in welkom and virginia free state province south africa belle et al 2021 generally ph indicates the strength of the water to react with the alkaline or acidic material in the water bodies islam et al 2017 all the surface water samples were alkaline based on the ph value ranging between 7 15 and 8 25 with an average value of 7 59 these were within the permissible limit set by who 6 5 8 5 the water ph correlates with the hardness and alkalinity in the aquatic environment which gives information on the survival of non living and living systems panda et al 2018 the value of surface water ph does not have a direct human health effect however groundwater in the acidic medium ph 6 could increase the dissolution and leaching of heavy metals where a higher ph is likely to enhance the precipitation of calcite minerals ansari et al 2015 studies conducted by zakaria et al 2021 in groundwater quality in the anayari catchment howladar et al 2021 in surma river bangladesh and singh et al 2020a b in river water quality in lucknow environs uttar pradesh india also recorded alkaline ph however al mamun et al 2019 in the piyain river from jaflong sylhet and rezaei et al 2020 in the dalgan basin iran have reported acidic ph water hardness is primarily caused by the presence of cations such as magnesium and calcium and anions including sulfate chloride and bicarbonate in the water resources ravikumar et al 2010 the total hardness values were from 108 00 18 to 116 00 31 mg l total hardness of water is generally classified as soft 0 and 60 mg l moderately hard 61 120 mg l hard 121 180 mg l and very hard more than 180 mg l mcgowan 2000 based on this classification all the surface waters in the study area were categorized as hard the maximum th levels obtained in the present study reveal that the water samples were lower than those reported by zakaria et al 2021 172 55 and 139 21 mg l for bore hole and hand dug well respectively opoku et al 2020 in groundwater from a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana 328 mg l and singh et al 2020a b in river water quality in lucknow environs uttar pradesh india ec is regarded as one of the most significant factors for classifying the quality of drinking water the determination of ec in water bodies reveals their capacity to conduct an electric current and is related to the quantity of ionized compounds in the water bodies radojevic et al 1999 the ec varied from 284 to 530 μs cm with a mean value of 388 25 μs cm being within the who acceptable limit who 2017 despite this variation ec levels remain low indicating that mineralization is poor in the study area as a result the river water was less ionized and had a lower ionic concentration meride and ayenew 2016 as a result a lower ec value implies a low concentration of dissolved ions in water bodies such as organic matter and inorganic salt radojevic et al 1999 the findings in this study were higher than earlier studies done by howladar et al 2021 in the surma river bangladesh and al mamun et al 2019 in the piyain river sand jaflong sylhet the ec value in this study however was lower than that reported by opoku et al 2020 in groundwater from a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana sunkari et al 2019 in groundwater quality in the ga west municipality ghana sudhakaran et al 2020 in the netravati river basin india and mukate et al 2018 in the chincholi industrial area the total dissolved solids tds concentration is the sum of anions negatively charged and cations positively charged in water bodies tds levels ranging from 202 to 370 mg l were under the who recommended limit of 500 mg l todd and mays 2004 classify groundwater as extremely fresh 0 250 mg l fresh 250 1000 mg l brackish 1000 10 000 mg l and salty 10 000 100 000 mg l because the tds levels were less than 1000 mg l all the surface water samples were extremely freshwater a study done by zakaria et al 2021 indicated that tds levels were comparable to those recorded in this study however the levels found in this study were greater than those found in a study conducted by howladar et al 2021 in the surma river in bangladesh however studies in groundwater from a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana opoku et al 2020 ga west municipality ghana sunkari et al 2019 river water quality in lucknow environs uttar pradesh india singh et al 2020a b netravati river basin india sudhakaran et al 2020 and chincholi industrial area of solapur maharashtra india mukate et al 2018 recorded higher tds than the current study generally chloride is regarded as an index of water pollution where a higher concentration gives a salty taste to water chloride concentrations range from 21 00 2 0 to 55 00 9 50 mg l the concentrations of cl in all the surface water samples were within the who acceptable limit of 250 mg l cl occurrence in river water could result from anthropogenic activities such as the leaching of chloride from topsoil during irrigation over pumping groundwater and applying chemical and manure fertilizers zakaria et al 2021 chloride levels from this study were higher than early studies conducted by howladar et al 2021 in surma river bangladesh and rezaei et al 2020 in the dalgan basin iran however the maximum level was lower than those reported in groundwater from a peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana opoku et al 2020 ga west municipality ghana sunkari et al 2019 turbidity levels in river water samples varied from 27 00 8 0 to 57 40 10 ntu turbidity levels at all locations exceed the allowable limit of 5 ntu who 2017 the turbidity values from this research were lower than those from earlier investigations in the surma river bangladesh done by howladar et al 2021 turbidity levels were lower in the netravati river basin in india sudhakaran et al 2020 and welkom and virginia in the free state province of south africa belle et al 2021 than in the current study alkalinity is a measure of buffering capacity of water and its ability to withstand ph changes al mamun et al 2019 total alkalinity was lower in the range of 118 00 56 228 00 63 mg l as caco3 than that reported by al mamun et al 2019 in piyain river sand from jaflong sylhet rezaei et al 2020 in the dalgan basin iran and singh et al 2020a b in river water quality in lucknow environs uttar pradesh india to protect aquatic life the buffering capacity should be at least 20 mg l al mamun et al 2019 the water samples from susanso and atonsu were above the who recommended level of 200 mg l the average no2 concentration varied between 0 001 0 00 and 0 12 0 02 mg l these results were below the who recommended level of 3 mg l as a result the presence of considerable no2 suggests pollution from sewage seepage and oxygen deficiency aghzar et al 2002 however our findings indicated that no2 concentrations were low in all the water samples tested as a result we could determine that the examined river water had not been contaminated by seepage water furthermore no2 values were lower than those reported by sudhakaran et al 2020 in the netravati river basin india fluoride is one of the necessary micronutrients that negatively or positively influence human health when consumed through drinking water and other dietary sources kimambo et al 2019 other positive metal ions na and ca are attracted to the highly electronegative f ion and even at low concentrations 0 5 mg l f bonds with ca in teeth and produces dental caries keshavarz et al 2015 f consumption from surface water has both harmful and beneficial consequences for human health fluorosis is caused by higher levels of f 1 5 mg l in children and levels of f more than 4 10 mg l may contribute to the development of skeletal and dental fluorosis queste et al 2001 fluoride in low doses affects tooth hygiene saleem et al 2016 f levels in river water samples ranged from 0 00 to 0 74 0 06 mg l all the samples had f concentrations lower than the acceptable level for drinking water who 2017 weathering and dissolution of f containing minerals are the most common causes of f in water bodies mukherjee and singh 2018 according to raju et al 2009 alkaline waters tend to solubilize f minerals the f concentrations from this study were lower than the study conducted by zakaria et al 2021 higher f concentrations were found in the peri urban settlement of atonsu kumasi ghana opoku et al 2020 ga west municipality sunkari et al 2019 dalgan basin iran rezaei et al 2020 and drinking water sources in the jirapa and kassena nankana municipalities of ghana dongzagla et al 2019 calcium was the most abundant cation in the study area with concentrations ranging from 78 00 19 and 86 00 19 mg l these high values of ca2 concentrations are caused by intensive agricultural activities pollution from surface seepage waters and the geology of the study area the presence of ca2 in the soil might be attributable to caso4 and caco3 minerals anhydrite gypsum dolomite and calcite zakaria et al 2021 mg2 concentrations vary from 24 00 0 15 to 36 00 0 09 mg l magnesium may also be found in water because of fertilizer application studies done by zakaria et al 2021 in groundwater in the anayari watershed and al mamun et al 2019 in piyain river sand from jaflong sylhet revealed lower concentrations of ca2 and mg2 than the present study however the maximum ca2 and mg2 levels in the current study were lower than those reported by sunkari et al 2019 in groundwater quality from the ga west municipality in ghana rezaei et al 2020 in the dalgan basin in iran and belle et al 2021 in welkom and virginia in the free state province of south africa table 2 shows the results of the analysis of various trace metals found in surface water samples box plots were used to depict the overall response pattern for a group of samples they provide a useful way to visualize the range and other characteristics of a large group s responses outliers maximum whisker upper quartiles 75 median 50 quartiles 25 whisker lower and lowest are described from top to bottom for each heavy metal studied in the box whisker plot fig 2 although the concentrations of all the metals examined varied no correlation was found between them fig 3 heavy metals were also examined to determine their suitability for drinking table 2 summarizes the findings fe values were the highest of any heavy metal in very high quantities iron is essential for human wellbeing it deteriorates linen and has an impact on the organoleptic characteristics of water resources the concentrations of fe and cr in the surface water varied from 2 00 0 00 to 3 00 0 05 mg l and 0 05 0 00 to 0 10 0 01 mg l respectively with a mean of 2 53 and 0 07 mg l all the samples exceeded the who permissible level consumers could have visual difficulties resulting from fe in water bodies mondal et al 2010 a high fe level can lead to hemochromatosis a severe illness that can damage body organs who 2017 other symptoms such as joint pain weight loss and fatigue may arise due to high fe levels in drinking water ahmed et al 2019 boateng et al 2015 howladar et al 2021 and al mamun et al 2019 reported lower fe and cr levels in the surma and piyain rivers respectively compared with this study fe concentrations were higher in uttar pradesh india than in the current study singh et al 2020a b cu concentrations varied from 0 30 0 01 to 1 60 0 001 mg l with a mean value of 1 08 mg l mn levels in the surface water varied from 0 04 0 001 to 0 07 0 001 mg l with a mean value of 0 05 mg l zn concentrations ranged from 0 05 0 005 to 0 45 0 01 mg l with a mean value of 0 19 mg l a high mn content in drinking water for an extended period may result in neurological problems who 2017 furthermore high amounts of zn consumption via the drinking channel might cause stomach cramps vomiting or nausea a high zn intake for a few months may also induce anemia a decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and pancreatic damage who 2017 fortunately mn cu and zn concentrations in surface water were within the who maximum allowable limit cu zn and cr levels were greater than previous studies by opoku et al 2020 in groundwater from a peri urban village in atonsu kumasi ghana microbial analysis values obtained at duase sepe susanso and atonsu were within the range of 9 15 1016 to 4 15 1021 for total coliform 4 1 108 to 2 35 1011 for fecal coliform and 1 5 106 to 2 1 109 respectively with atonsu recording the highest value for total coliform fecal coliform and e coli followed by susanso with sepe recording the lowest microbial level table 3 the rise in microbiological levels was associated to the relocation of the waste dump closer to the river for any water to be deemed safe for human consumption the fecal and total coliform counts must be zero who 2017 based on this all the recorded water samples were greater than the suggested limit for drinking which was a major issue because the water could be used for drinking water polluted with total and fecal coliform can cause diarrhea headaches and nausea qadir et al 2008 other investigations found e coli levels in more than half of the sampling locations while fecal coliform bacterial counts in water samples were all non compliant with who drinking water quality guidelines belle et al 2021 3 2 correlation analysis a correlation coefficient is a typical tool for determining and measuring the connection between two variables it is a simple statistical technique for demonstrating the degree to which one variable is dependent on another pearson correlation was used to identify the factors that contribute to the dispersion and transportation of pollutants in water bodies chen et al 2012 and the interrelationship between the influencing water quality variables to determine the most likely common sources 1 and 1 values respectively represent strong and positive connections a value of 0 indicates that there is no linear connection between the variables a significant positive correlation between parameters suggests similar behavior mutual dependence or common source makokha et al 2016 the absence of significant correlations among ec mg2 and ca2 table 4 indicates that both cations did not contribute to water mineralization in the study area varol 2020 ph and tds have a significant positive correlation with ec tds alkalinity and t coli turbidity also has a strong relation with no2 ph was influenced by ca2 ions rao 1982 the strong correlations between cl and mg2 were related to soluble salts varol and şen 2009 ca2 vs no2 hardness vs cl mg2 vs cl and mg2 vs alkalinity on the other hand showed a strong negative significant correlation t coli was also strongly associated with ph tds ec alkalinity and mg2 showing the influence of anthropogenic process varol 2020 because there is a substantial connection between zn and cr it is possible that cr came from natural and human sources there was no association between ec and heavy metals indicating that physicochemical processes such as ion exchange and oxidation reduction did not occur in the analyzed surface water bodies srivastava and ramanathan 2008 3 3 pollution source and factors controlling surface water quality pca was utilized to explain the observed relationship between cluster variables as reflected by patterns of variation and covariance between variables and correlations between measurements factor loadings are divided into three categories strong 0 75 moderate 0 50 0 75 and weak 0 50 liu et al 2003 pca was conducted on surface water quality data using varimax rotation with kaiser normalization which reduced the number of variables to a smaller set of scores called components while retaining most of the main data the sum of variance of the component coefficients was maximized using varimax rotation which better explains the possible sources that influence water systems islam et al 2017 three independent factors components were identified based on eigenvalues greater than one accounting for 98 86 of the total variance the screen plot was used to determine the number of pcs retained fig 2 table 5 shows the computed factor loadings percentage of variation and cumulative percentage explained by each factor component negative or positive loading indicates that the surface water sample is either essentially unaffected or affected by the presence of extracted loadings respectively bhuiyan et al 2016 more than 57 818 of the total variation were explained by the first principal component pc1 ph temperature salinity tds ec ca2 cl f alkalinity mn total coliform fecal coliform and e coli were positively loaded contaminants such as household wastewater transferred from the surface and subsurface strata to surface water resources resulted in high tds and cl loadings due to its poor solubility the f seems to be non reactive in surface water with a ph of 7 0 and is absorbed in exchangeable materials or clay however in this study the hydroxyl group substitutes the exchangeable f as kaolinite clay minerals due to the alkaline ph molekoa et al 2019 ec and tds were related to discharge from urban areas including surface run off causing erosion of road margins sewage contamination industrial wastes and soil erosion have all been linked to high cl levels mg no2 total hardness and turbidity all showed significant negative loading pc1 also has moderate negative loading for tss this component is a non point source of pollution associated with organic pollutants precipitation run off and agricultural operations it also indicates the substantial effect of anthropogenic activity mainly industrial and domestic waste in the study area howladar et al 2017 the second principal component pc2 accounting for 21 892 of the total variance was loaded with tss hardness cr zn and cu human induced geogenic processes such as agrochemicals fertilizers and industrial wastes were attributed to high zn loading barzegar et al 2019 phosphate containing fertilizers wood production fuel combustion domestic wastewater and waste dumps are all sources of cu wagh et al 2018 tannery effluent electroplating paper printing pottery units paints pigments residential waste traffic and intrusive rock weathering may all be sources of cr wagh et al 2018 pc2 pollution in this study might be attributable to a combination of natural and human activities the third principal component pc3 explained 19 150 of the total variance and was influenced by color mn fe cu and fecal coliform all of which were found in substantial levels in the samples iron which is abundant crustal was geogenic in nature ahmed et al 2019 agricultural practices fertilizers sewage and animal waste disposal were all sources of mn ramesh and elango 2012 the bacterial activity was also responsible for the levels of mn and fe in the samples naujokas et al 2013 finally pc3 revealed leaching of anthropogenic materials from the soil horizon into the aquifer bhuiyan et al 2016 to summarize the pollution of the sisa river was mostly influenced by urban planning decisions and social norms including waste disposal practices and hygiene practices 3 4 water quality index because it integrates many distinct surface water quality parameters into a single value the wqi is a helpful tool for monitoring and managing surface water resources the water quality index wqi is a tool for determining how human activities affect water quality water is regarded to be of high quality if the wqi is less than 50 a water quality index of 50 100 indicates excellent water whereas a score of 100 200 indicates inadequate water quality when the index falls between 200 and 300 the water is considered poor quality and should not be consumed the wqi in the study area ranged from 97 95 to 137 22 with samples from duase sepe and atonsu having low quality table 6 this suggests that sewage entering the aquifer and agricultural operations along the sisa river contributed to the low water quality bodrud doza et al 2016 furthermore the pace at which water flows is another factor that influences water contamination hamrick and mills 2000 susanso on the other hand falls under the category of high quality drinking water drinking groundwater in shiraz was found to have a low water quality of 28 6 badeenezhad et al 2020 higher than the values recorded in this study furthermore in central bangladesh around 48 33 and 3 33 of the samples showed low and extremely poor water quality types respectively bodrud doza et al 2016 iron concentrations had the greatest impact on the wqi followed by ph cr ca2 mg2 ec and tds 3 5 pollution assessment using heavy metal pollution indices toxic heavy metal such asas was found in bdl has no impact on the overall water quality however the surface water samples were marginally polluted by heavy metals according to hmpi findings in table 7 and maybe unfit for drinking and domestic use due to sewage discharge run off from municipal and construction waste the sample locations had hmpi 100 cleaning utensils clothes and other household habits also contribute to increased pollution in water bodies as a result of run off from discarded trash residential sewage air precipitation of aerosols and industrial operations the cumulative impact of heavy metals on overall water quality was alarming however hpi values below the critical index value have been reported in the upper gangetic basin of india ranging from 6 to 91 by kumar et al 2019 ugljesnica river serbia 67 487 and 80 676 in spring and autumn seasons respectively by milivojevic et al 2016 tirupati town india mean hpi value of 3 5243 by mohan et al 1996 and groundwater of the west bokaro coalfield 3 32 by tiwari et al 2016 the hmei value was determined to be 16 09 indicating that heavy metal contamination in the study region is moderate however when compared to bodrud doza et al 2016 categorization of cd levels the cd value was 3 indicating significant heavy metal contamination of the surface water samples tested table 8 all the hmtl values below the permissible limit of 5888 527 mg l saha and paul 2019 the greatest hmtl value was found in cu while the lowest was found in mn 3 6 human health risk assessment hq and hi calculations considering the oral pathway for adults and children are given in table 10 the non carcinogenic risk was evaluated for both adults and children via ingestion except for cu at duase and atonsu water samples both hq and hi were lower than the acceptable limit hq 1 for adults table 9 showing non carcinogenic effects to adults the hq and hi values for cu at duase sepe and atonsu had lower values 1 indicating a worry for a non carcinogenic health risk to the exposed population through ingestion by children in this study the cancer risk in children in this study was greater than the tolerable cancer limit for the investigated heavy metal in all water samples indicating a possible carcinogenic risk however the cancer risk in adults was lower than the permissible level in duase and atonsu indicating a potential cancer risk children on the other hand were shown to have a greater cancer risk than adults 4 conclusion in most ghanaian villages surface and groundwater are the primary sources of drinking water the quality of surface water in the sisa river was studied to assess the health risks due to ingestion among children and adults to evaluate the water quality multivariate statistical methods pearson correlation and pca were used and a water quality index which is critical for determining the suitability of surface water for domestic and drinking uses the quality of surface water for drinking purposes was assessed using who standards and the wqi surface water quality has deteriorated somewhat with alkaline ph and high turbidity and alkalinity color microbiological fe and cr levels above who acceptable limits to explore the relationship between contaminants and determine their possible sources multivariate statistical analysis was utilized mixed natural processes i e high evaporation climatic conditions water rock interaction and anthropogenic activities i e agricultural activities surface run off from precipitation dissolution processes and organic pollution sources play a significant role in surface water quality the wqi results reveal poor water quality in surface water samples from duase sepe and atonsu with cr and fe as the most prevalent parameters the carcinogenic risk falls under the very high 10 4 category furthermore through cu consumption the cumulative risk of non carcinogenic pollutants was alarming and close to the usepa limit hi 1 in children at duase sepe and atonsu based on the low water quality non carcinogenic and carcinogenic hazards posed to residents in the sisa river basin appropriate legislative actions for water quality sustainability are

isotherms models and pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion elovich kinetics models consecutively however present polyaniline grafted biochar adsorbent is well fitted with pseudo second order model having the r2 value 0 995 in agreement with the isoelectric point at 5 8 maximum cr vi adsorption on panidsc perceived at ph range of 4 5 the thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process of adsorption is spontaneous and endothermic in nature δh 25 084 kj mol 1 furthermore the efficient regeneration up to 5 successive cycles makes the low cost bio adsorbent a promising one for field applications study graphical abstract image 1 keywords date seed char polyaniline date seed char cr vi adsorption kinetic study isotherm study 1 introduction on demand heavy metal usage due to rapid industrialization by mankind alarmed serious threat to ecosystem massive utilization of heavy metals induces serious health issues like genotoxicity cancer and mutagenic condition and much hazardous impact on environment among the various metal ions pb cd cr as the cr vi frequently used in metal dye tanning industries wood endurance nutrition once released to aquatic systems and soil has proven to be one of the most harmful and toxic heavy metal gogoi et al 2018 mostly chromium exists as cr vi and cr iii out of the two cr iii can be removed as a hydroxide precipitate xia et al 2020 whereas cr vi is extremely harmful because of its insolubility fluidity and small size khalaf et al 2019 liu et al 2016 even who has set the maximum permissible limit of cr vi in aquatic system is 0 05 mg l kaur et al 2015 beyond which chromium causes several health problems such as anemia liver damage lung cancers various kidney disorders etc therefore stepping towards the remediation of cr vi from aqueous systems has been a global challenge an array of techniques has been put forward like photocatalytic reduction zhao et al 2018 solvent extraction membrane filtration sandoval olvera et al 2019 ion exchange and reduction precipitation ye et al 2019 chemical precipitation electrochemical reduction zuo et al 2020 mechanical metal activation ren et al 2020 adsorption kar and equeenuddin 2019 had been developed for removal of cr vi out of these adsorption is the most popular method owing cost effectiveness easy handling and higher efficacy sahu et al 2021a 2021b till date many facile adsorbents such as cerium grafted zsm 5 min et al 2020 carbon nanotubes khajeh et al 2013 zeolite yang et al 2019 han et al 2019 activated carbon and mesoporous biochar yang et al 2020 had been reported for cr vi and as v removal unfortunately many are still associated with challenges like unsustainability low yield expensive etc emphasizing on sustainability scientists are looking for renewable bio based adsorbent for cr vi removal nowadays plants extract derived biochar a stable carbon rich charred by product fabricated by the thermal degradation of biomass when it is pyrolysed under nil low oxygen condition at different temperature received a significant attention restoring low cost pollution free quality and favorable physiochemical properties additionally even after thermal degradation it possesses hydroxyl carbonyl carboxyl and phenolic binding groups which further can tag additional functionality to increase the efficiency sahu et al 2020 various agricultural biomasses like rice husk pillai et al 2020 peanut shell ahmadi kasani et al 2020 animal manure and plant residue sarfaraz et al 2020 fruit residue silva et al 2018 sewage sludge fan et al 2020 sawdust ghanim et al 2020 sugarcane bagasse tang et al 2020 have already been reported for production of biochar and its sorption ability being curious we have noticed that date phoenix dactylifera a popular fruit in dry climate region seed carrying 80 of the fruit weight is disposed unutilized every year due to lack of proper processing nehdi et al 2010 from environmental management point of view its high time to reuse the waste produced in our day to day life date seed char dsc can be produced from date seed by the pyrolysis processes which can be used as a low cost adsorbent bouchelta et al 2012 the physiochemical and thermochemical characterization of date seed was well discussed earlier el abbari et al 2019 the effects of parameters such as time and temperature were studied for yield of carbon from date seed ahmed 2016 effectiveness of date seed biochar was examined for remediation of pb2 cu2 and ni2 mahdi et al 2019 removal of organic dyes chowdhury et al 2019 removal of nacl from saline water were reported hai et al 2019 date pit biomass is used as green carbon catalyst for butylation of phenol jamil et al 2017 adsorption of cefixime was studied by activated carbon of date press cake hasanzadeh et al 2020 still literature related to polymerization of date fruit waste is scanty this field might be explored more and can be applied for removal of cr iv under such circumstances where the date seed which is disposed unutilized every year the present paper summarizes the utilization of date seed as a novel bio adsorbent with higher removal capacity and cost effectiveness therefore in this present paper we have utilized date seed as a novel bio adsorbent with higher removal capacity and cost effectiveness high temperature based thermal decomposition of date seed yielded novel biochar carrying hydroxyl and phenolic group on surface further the surface of biochar is grafted with cationic polymer polyaniline via electrostatic interaction the synthesized materials were characterized by different instrumental techniques moreover this panidsc adsorbent is challenged against co existing cationic and anionic pollutants including cr vi adsorption experiments were thoroughly investigated by optimizing various adsorption parameters like adsorbent dosage time of contact ph temperature and stirring rates the result indicated that panidsc could be an efficient adsorbent for cr vi removal and can be further utilized in water remediation application 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials analytical grade chemicals and reagents were used without any purification aniline c6h7n potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 ammonium persulfate nh4 2s2o8 aps and 1 5 diphenylcarbazide dpc were procured from hi media chemicals hydrochloric acid hcl acetone ch3coch3 sodium hydroxide pellet naoh ethanol c2h5oh sulfuric acid h2so4 were procured from loba chemicals the 1000 ppm cr vi stock solution was prepared by diluting 2 8 g of k2cr2o7 in 1 l of deionized water and subsequently diluted to obtain the required chromium concentrations 2 2 synthesis of dsc and panidsc the date seeds were collected from the fruit vendor of the local rourkela market the seeds were soaked in tap water and washed thrice with boiling water to remove date flesh and pigment residue it was then dried at 70 c for 48 h the seeds were ground with the help of a blender the powdered date seed was introduced into a tubular furnace under nitrogen flow thermal decomposition of powdered seed was done having n2 flow rate of 25 ml per minute and an increasing temperature rate of 50 c per min 100 g of dry date seed powder was placed in a ceramic dish the pyrolysis temperature was maintained at 450 c for 2 h then the furnace was cooled naturally till room temperature is attained the date seed biochar was collected and retained for further modification and analysis which is termed as date seed biochar dsc the liquid products comprising oil tar and gas products were disposed of for the synthesis of polyaniline modified date seed biochar panidsc dsc is polymerized with aniline through the following route 9 g of dsc was dispersed in 150 ml of 1 m hcl through ultra sonication for 30 min to reduce the accumulation of particles to the above dispersion of dsc aniline 3 ml was added dropwise and again sonicated for 20 min aps solution 9 12 g aps in 100 ml of water was added dropwise to the dispersion of aniline and dsc with continuous stirring for 10 h a dark green dispersion thus developed was filtered through vacuum filtration and washed with hcl and water to remove unreacted aniline the resultant product was oven dried at 70 c for 24 h and termed as polyaniline date seed biochar panidsc sahu et al 2019 the formation of panidsc and the removal process of cr vi is schematically represented in scheme 1 a series of panidsc were synthesized by varying the ratios of aniline dsc among which the material synthesized with 1 3 ratio was selected based on the cr vi removal efficiency shown in table 1 2 3 instrumentation the morphological analysis of the synthesized materials was done by using a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem nova nano sem 450 the elemental mapping compositions were obtained by edx analyzer oxford inca the powder xrd technique was used to identify the crystallinity using a monochromatized cu k source on the x ray diffractometer rigaku ultima iv using a cu kα radiation source the functional group identification was carried out by ftir perkinelmer 1000 usa spectrophotometer using kbr pellet in the range 400 4000 cm 1 the raman graph was obtained by labram 010 laser raman spectrometer in the 500 to 2500 cm 1 range the thermogravimetric analysis tga was done by netzsch sta 449c germany the surface area was measured by quantachrome iq model asiqm0000 4 barett joymer halenda method was used to calculate the pore size distribution and pore volume the zeta potentials values were measured by zeta sizer malvern uk uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu was used to determine the concentration of cr vi through dpc method 2 4 adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the removal of cr vi by panidsc the effect of important parameters like adsorbent dose the concentration of chromate solution ph temperature time of contact and stirring rate was varied to interpret the nature of adsorption the cr vi adsorbed panidsc is termed as panidsc cr at first 0 05 g of panidsc was taken in 100 ml 10 mg l cr vi solution at normal ph and room temperature it was then put in an orbital shaker at a speed of 200 rpm after the process of adsorption is over the resultant solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for a time period of 10 min the resultant concentration of cr vi in the filtrate and standard solutions were determined by dpc method using 1 5 diphenylcarbazide by a uv vis spectrophotometer at 540 nm wavelength the calibration curve was done by doing serial dilution for a higher concentration of cr vi every experiment was repeated thrice under similar conditions at room temperature and the average value was considered as the final result for reproducibility the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe removal percentage of cr vi were calculated by the following equations sahoo and hota 2019 1 q e c 0 c e w v 2 r c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 ce are the initial and equilibrium cr vi concentrations in mg l w is the mass of the panidsc adsorbent in g and v is the volume of chromium solution in l 2 5 desorption and regeneration after adsorption of cr vi the desorption experiment was performed using naoh ch3cooh water and nh4oh to each of these solutions panidsc cr previously adsorbed washed and dried was added the solutions were kept on stirring for 24 h then after filtration regeneration efficiency of panidsc was studied by the following equation 3 efficiency uptake in the second run uptake in the first run 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochar 3 1 1 fesem analysis the morphology of native dsc panidsc panidsc after adsorption cr vi is analyzed by fesem and are presented in fig 1 a c from fig 1a it was clear that the pores of dsc were well developed on the external surface and uniformly distributed numerous circular pores can be seen developed on the surfaces of dsc fig 1b revealed the sponge like morphology due to the successful polymerization of aniline on the dsc surface the polyaniline chains were uniformly distributed all over the surface of dsc in fig 1c it can also be clearly seen that the cr aggregations were embedded within the polyaniline layers to further confirm the elemental composition were analyzed using edx spectra revealing the presence of c o n k cr shown in table 2 the elemental mapping exhibited signals for c o n k cr with different weight percentages in fig 1 which is another supporting result representing the adsorption of cr vi on panidsc 3 1 2 raman analysis the ordered structures and presence of aromatic carbon in dsc panidsc panidsc cr is confirmed by the raman spectrograph shown in fig 2 a c with proper peak fitting dsc in fig 2a exhibits 2 main bands of non graphitic carbon the d band at 1326 cm 1 and the g band at 1563 cm 1 the d band corresponds to disordered graphite lattice and g band to ideal graphite lattice the presence of d and g bands revealed that sp2 bonded carbon is there in dsc hossain et al 2018 the analysis of new intense bands in panidsc spectra in fig 2 b is as follows band at 1579 cm 1 is due to the quinoid c c stretching vibration in the polymer chain the intense band at 1460 cm 1 is due to the benzenoid c c ring stretching vibration the 1336 cm 1 band is attributed to c n stretching vibration modes that are characteristic peaks of polyaniline the band at 1159 cm 1 is because of c h out of plane bending vibrations in the aromatic ring the other two peaks are one at 603 cm 1 is because of benzene ring deformation in polyaniline other at 518 cm 1 is due to cross linking between polyaniline chains the bands at 830 cm 1 775 cm 1 are due to in plane and the band at 418 cm 1 is due to out of plane vibrations of the ring of the protonated form of pani rohom et al 2014 shakoor et al 2011 in panidsc 1312 cm 1 the position of the d band as compared to dsc 1326 cm 1 is shifted to lower frequencies red shift that maybe because of the electron pairs of the n atoms of pani which resonate with the adjacent benzene dsc hsiao et al 2010 in fig 2 a the ratio of id ig was calculated to be 0 78 for dsc and in fig 2 c id ig ratio was 0 93 for panidsc cr the analysis of intensity ratio before and after adsorption confirmed the incorporation of polyaniline and interaction of chromium on dsc surface 3 1 3 thermogravimetric analysis thermogravimetric analysis was performed to interpret the thermal stability weight loss behavior of the prepared dsc and panidsc biomaterial under nitrogen atmosphere from 30 c up to 800 c that are graphically presented in fig 3 a it can be interpreted from the plot that there are 2 stages of weight loss at two different temperature regions for both biomaterials initially the surface moisture of material was disappeared up to the temperature of 110 c due to the evaporation of water adsorbed to the surface of dsc and panidsc which involve vander walls force of attraction within molecules there was a negligible weight loss or almost there is stability in weight up to 320 c and 325 c which is evidence that prepared materials have thermal stability below 320 c in both the cases of dsc and panidsc the first major weight loss occurring at 320 c 650 c in the case of dsc and 325 c 608 c in panidsc it is due to breaking down of cellulose lignin content in both the cases and additional thermo oxidative degradation of polyaniline chain in the latter case bardalai et al 2019 the mass losses at around 616 c and 595 c are comparatively low due to the breaking down of c h and c c bonds during pyrolysis siddiqui et al 2019 3 1 4 fourier transform infrared analysis to examine the presence of surface functional groups and bonding properties of all biomaterials dsc panidsc panidsc cr ftir analysis was carried out and the spectra are represented in fig 3b the broad peak around 3440 3450 cm 1 indicates the o h stretching band formed due to dehydration of cellulose during pyrolysis the peak around 2930 cm 1 c h stretching of aliphatic compounds is in good accordance with the c h sharp bending vibration bands at 1388 cm 1 ertaş and hakki alma 2010 x huang et al 2015 a band at 1630 1650 cm 1 can be attributed to cc ring stretching due to aromatic carbon bardalai et al 2019 again broad band at around 1625 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of o h bond the band positioned at 1047 cm 1 is due to c o bending vibration in c oh group which indicates the presence of c oh sites for all the materials after the attachment of polyaniline a band at 1288 cm 1 and 1125 cm 1 in the case of panidsc panidsc cr is the characteristic band of c n stretching vibration c h in plane deformation which is not seen in the case of dsc which signifies the formation of panidsc tanzifi et al 2017 the ir spectra of panidsc cr showed minute shifting of oh band and decreased intensity for all the other bands concerning panidsc and appearance of 2 new peaks from which it may be concluded that there is intercalation of cr vi in panidsc 3 1 5 zeta potential analysis in the adsorption experiments to determine the effect of surface charge of adsorbent zeta potential studies have been carried out for panidsc the phiep isoelectric point value at different ph values are given in fig 3c it was clear from the above figure that the zeta potential value of panidsc was 5 8 below 5 8 ph as the surface of the adsorbent is positively charged there is a favorable interaction between negatively charged chromium ions 3 1 6 xrd analysis xrd analysis was studied to ascertain the crystal structure of the dsc panidsc panidsc cr fig 3d presents the xrd pattern of these materials from 10 to 60 2 theta values range xrd pattern of dsc revealed the fact that dsc is amorphous in nature with characteristic peaks at 2θ 28 2 with d spacing 3 15 nm and 2θ 40 4 having 2 22 nm d spacing value yuan et al 2020 in panidsc panidsc cr two characteristic standard peaks remain the same with two extra peaks with 2θ 20 5 and 25 6 with d spacing value 3 5 nm in a later case that clearly indicates the parallel and perpendicular periodicity of pani intercalated in the surface of dsc mostafaei and zolriasatein 2012 the broad peak conferred the low crystallinity nature of all materials after chromium adsorption in the case of panidsc cr three peaks were observed at 2θ 25 28 2 40 4 having d spacing values 3 55 3 15 2 22 nm respectively with an increased intensity that indicates the there is no phase change even after adsorption 3 1 7 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm analysis fig 4 a represents the nitrogen gas sorption isotherm and fig 4b speaks for the pore size distribution curve of the dsc and panidsc n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 196 c degassing temperature 150 c time 6h of both dsc and panidsc showed a type iv isotherm with a large hysteresis loop with p p0 greater than 0 5 the result suggests the uptake of adsorbate causing multilayer adsorption near completion of the first monolayer due to compact nature of date seed the specific surface area of dsc was found to be 60 36 m2 g 1 whereas surface area of panidsc increased to 76 60 m2 g 1 providing more active site post modification the bjh pore diameter pore volume in dsc and panidsc were found to be 3 335 nm 0 05 cm3 g 1 and 3 735 nm 0 25 cm3 g 1 presented in table 3 simultaneous appearance of broad pore size around 7 nm and 10 nm is aroused due to interparticle gap interestingly all pore size lies strictly in mesoporous range 2 50 nm according to iupac classification confirmed the distinct mesoporous nature of sample the comparative higher surface area with more binding sites and appropriate pore diameter supported panidsc for better adsorption of cr vi ion adhikari et al 2017 4 adsorption experiment 4 1 analysis process for cr vi adsorption the adsorption experiments of cr vi were conducted by taking a fixed amount of panidsc in 100 ml of 10 ppm of cr vi the solutions of chromium were stirred in an orbital shaker at 200 rotations per min at room temperature taking different parameters into consideration like adsorbent dose initial concentration of chromium ph temperature time and stirring rate the mechanism of adsorption was studied 4 1 1 effect of ph to study the variation of ph onto adsorption of chromium different ph solutions from 2 to 12 were made keeping other parameters the same fig 5 a represents the effect of ph for chromium adsorption by panidsc it is obvious from this figure that from ph 2 to 5 the adsorption capacity slightly increased 93 and beyond ph 5 slightly decreased up to ph 6 90 but there is a sharp decrease in removal percentage above ph 6 and the trend of decrease continues up to ph 12 25 the reason for such a phenomenon can be explained as follows at lower ph 2 6 due to the availability of h ions protonation of amine occurs nh2 h nh3 on the surface of panidsc chromium mainly exists as hcro4 and cr2o7 2 in solution at lower ph so there is a strong electrostatic interaction between the oppositely charged protonated panidsc surface and chromium species at ph range 4 to 6 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 forms h2cro4 and h2cro7 species due to reaction with h ions as these are neutral species the adsorption capacity decreases at higher ph in 6 12 range there is the availability of oh ions so deprotonation of amine occurs and the amine group is in the form of nh2 oh nh2 oh here there is repulsion between the negative ions thus we get a decrease in adsorption capacity at higher ph values the optimum value of ph for panidsc is at around ph 5 thus chosen as the equilibrium ph for all adsorption tests lan et al 2014 lyu et al 2017 singh et al 2017 4 1 2 effect of adsorbent dosage to investigate the effect of panidsc doses on chromium adsorption varied adsorbent dosages from 50 mg to 200 mg were taken at ph 5 the result was presented in fig 5b the removal percentage of cr vi increases with an increase in panidsc dose up to 150 mg the result can be justified as there is an increase in adsorbent dose number of active sites increases thus the removal efficiency of cr vi also increases wu et al 2014 beyond 150 mg of adsorbent dose there is no increase in adsorption efficiency because of lack of cr vi ions concentration to be absorbed in all the binding sites of panidsc indicating the equilibrium has been reached at 150 mg for panidsc thus 150 mg was chosen as the optimum adsorbent dosage for rest all adsorption experiments huang et al 2015 4 1 3 effect of initial chromate concentration to study the effect of initial chromate ion concentration on adsorption efficiency of panidsc experiments were performed by varying chromate solution concentration from 2 to 100 mg l keeping other components constant it is observed from fig 5c that with an increase in cr vi ion concentration the adsorption capacity decreases linearly for 10 mg l to 40 mg l of cr vi ions in solutions this phenomenon is obvious for a particular dose of panidsc as the active adsorbing sites are constant with respect to the constant increase in cr vi ions available adsorbing sites are decreasing for adsorption decreasing the percentage of removal of chromium therefore 10 mg l concentration of cr vi ion is optimized and maintained for all batch experiments 4 1 4 effect of temperature to explore the behaviour of temperature on removal percentage of cr vi by synthesized adsorbent panidsc adsorption experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 30 80 c the results obtained are presented in fig 5d a maximum removal percentage of 92 89 was obtained at 70 c the adsorption equilibrium was attained at 50 with a removal capacity of 91 89 for cr vi 4 1 5 effect of contact time to design a kinetics model another important parameter contact time was studied in batch adsorption experiments by the varying time of adsorption from 15 to 150 min and results are given in fig 5e during the first 30 min 64 adsorption occurred and increases up to 92 36 removal at 80 min beyond which equilibrium of the adsorption process was obtained 4 1 6 effect of stirring rate to investigate the effect of stirring rate in cr vi adsorption process stirring rate from 50 400 rpm were varied while other parameters were kept constant the result in fig 5f reflects that with an increase in stirring rate the adsorption capacity increases up to 200 rpm agitation speed beyond that it became constant it gives a clear inference that the randomness of chromate ions panidsc molecules in solution increases with an increase in stirring rate resulting in quick adsorption further increase in stirring speed has no effect on adsorption percentage this is because all the active sites are occupied earlier and that creates only steric hindrance between the molecules 4 2 adsorption isotherm study to interpret the mutual effect of adsorbate in solid and liquid phases with adsorbent at equilibrium adsorption isotherm studies were performed fig 6 a e langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich and redlich peterson models shows the fitting of experimental data into isotherm models langmuir model describes the equilibrium between adsorbent and adsorbate for monolayer adsorption and the freundlich model tells about non ideal adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces the experimental data fit more with the langmuir model than the freundlich model by comparing the r2 values different parameters for different models are represented in table 4 the higher value of r2 0 99 langmuir affinity constant kl 0 57 l mg and adsorption capacity qm 27 3 mg g indicates the isotherm is more consistent with the langmuir model the adsorption is monolayer with uniformly distributed binding sites on adsorbent al ghouti and da ana 2020 the degree of heterogeneity denoted by n is calculated to be 2 38 in the freundlich model signifies the chemical interaction between panidsc and cr vi to explain the adsorption mechanism in a more prominent manner experimental data were fitted with temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models the temkin model assumes the heat of adsorption is inversely related to coverage of the adsorbent surface the equilibrium binding constant at is calculated to be 7 48 l mg the heat of sorption b is 5 06 j mol which indicates the process of adsorption follows both physical and chemical processes in the d r model the mechanism of adsorption follows pore filling it assumes adsorption is multilayer involving vanderwaal s force of interaction and applicable to the physical adsorption process the adsorption energy e is 0 73 kj mol which is less than 8 kj mol clearly determines the process is dominated by physisorption the redlich peterson r p isotherm is a three parameter empirical adsorption model that incorporates elements from both the langmuir and freundlich isotherms it is evident that the r p isotherm was more accurate than the langmuir and freundlich isotherms as it contains three unknown parameters in this study the higher r2 value of 0 98 in case of r p isotherm clearly depicts its better suitability with the adsorption process the value of isotherm parameters kr β and ar from the r p models are calculated as 15 0 904 and 0 414 respectively 4 3 kinetics study to get an idea about the mechanisms involved in the adsorption process and rate of adsorption three well known kinetic models were adopted the experimental data were fitted into the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso intra particle diffusion ipd and elovich model the results of adsorption kinetics studies were represented in fig 7 a d the different kinetic parameters are listed in table 5 a deviation can be marked from linear fitting with r2 value 0 921 and qe value 12 58 mg g for pfo the data fitted more with the pso model having the r2 value 0 995 the actual qe from the experiment was 6 17 mg g which is almost the same fits well as the theoretical qe 6 96 mg g that signifies the adsorption kinetics fits with the pso model su et al 2018 further the data were fitted with the ipd model to know whether the mechanism of adsorption is surface area particle size dependent or not the plots of qt versus t1 2 are having an intercept of 2 59 which means c values were not equal to zero again fig 7c shows roughly two phases of adsorption the first linear phase represents the mass transfer on active sites present in the outer surface of panidsc the second linear graph interprets the adsorption due to intraparticle diffusion on the inner pores of panidsc this demonstrates the adsorption of cr vi passes both through mass transfer and intra particle diffusion mechanism chen et al 2017 then the elovich model was applied which helps to predict the mass and surface diffusion activation and the nature of adsorption on the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent whether chemisorption or not the parameters value α and β from the elovich models are calculated as 1 41 and 0 786 respectively 4 4 thermodynamic parameters the effect of temperature in the range of 30 80 c was studied to observe the removal efficiency of cr vi by panidsc gibbs free energy δg in kj mol 1 k 1 entropy δs in kj k 1 mol 1 and enthalpy δh in kj mol 1 were calculated by using the van t hoff equation as follows 4 δ g r t ln k c 5 k c c 1 c 2 6 δg δh tδs 7 ln k c δs r δh r t where kc is the ratio of chromium concentration on the panidsc surface at equilibrium c1 to the remaining chromium concentration in solution c2 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the temperature in kelvin fig 8 represents the plot of log kc versus 1 t the different thermodynamic parameters thus calculated from the equation were tabulated in table 6 the positive enthalpy δh 25 084 kj mol 1 shows the endothermic nature of adsorption that means a large amount of heat was required to transfer the cr vi ions onto panidsc surface the positive value of δs 0 095 kj k 1 mol 1 indicates the increase in randomness of the solid liquid system at different temperatures we got different negative values of δg reveals the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption process again it can be noted that δg increases with an increase in temperature which suggests that the adsorption process is favorable even at high temperature chen et al 2017 4 5 desorption and regeneration studies one of the significant aspects of the adsorption experiment is its regeneration and reuse studies to reuse the synthetic adsorbent material many times which makes our adsorption process economical the desorption of adsorbed cr vi was carried out for 5 cycles to check the ability of panidsc to be regenerated and reused at first the batch desorption experiments were performed randomly with a weak acid acetic acid a neutral medium water a weak base ammonium hydroxide and a strong base sodium hydroxide each of 1m solutions as active agents out of which water does not affect desorption acetic acid has the minimum effect and maximum desorption took place in 1m naoh then varying concentration of naoh 0 02 1 5 m was used for desorption experiments where 1m naoh solution was found best with 94 desorption of chromium the nature of desorption can be due to the flowing facts from ftir data and zeta potential analysis phzpc 5 8 for panidsc its clear the surface of adsorbent is positively charged hence treatment with weak acid the hydronium ion may tend to oxidize amines to less ionisable imine has limited impact on adsorbent for the process of desorption further cr vi was attached as hcro4 or cr2o7 2 on amine sites in panidsc hydroxides having a higher affinity for positive ions may replace hcro4 from pani sites when naoh and nh4oh were employed for desorption naoh being the stronger base responsible for higher desorption of chromate ions as compared to nh4oh after the process of desorption the remaining incomplete desorption may be due to the possibility of chemical bond formation between the cr vi ions and the nitrogen atoms of polyaniline kumar et al 2008 mdlalose et al 2018 after 5 cycles of adsorption desorption experiments panidsc shows a significant decrease 76 of chromium uptake shown in fig 9 thus panidsc is relatively stable with reusability potential up to 5 cycles 4 6 possible mechanism of adsorption from the obtained experimental observations and their computed models the adsorption mechanism for chromium is suggested as follows the maximum adsorption of chromium onto panidsc surface occurs at acidic ph where the amine group exists in its protonated form the main forms cr vi that exists in solution produced from k2cr2o7 are cr2o7 2 and hcro4 which binds with the protonated amine group present in the surface of panidsc which can be represented in chemical reactions as below long et al 2021 the overall adsorption mechanism was proposed in scheme

cr vi ions during adsorption n h 2 c r o 4 2 n h 2 c r o 4 2 5 conclusion the present article explores the successful polyaniline modification in date seed biochar with its various physical and chemical properties the systematically investigated experimental data and findings gives a distinct pathway for cr vi adsorption with its plausible adsoption mechanism date seed which is considered as a waste was taken as raw material and pyrolysed to get char the date seed biochar was chemically modified with polyaniline by polymerization method to get polyaniline date seed biochar a low cost amine functionalized char adsorbent was thus synthesized and adsorption experiments were carried out for cr vi in aqueous media the morphological study reveals the highly porous nature of the adsorbent with uniform distribution of the polyaniline chain in the surface ftir spectra indicate the presence of nitrogen containing functional groups in panidsc and intercalation of cr vi in panidsc cr by strong chemical interaction the raman spectra specified the d and g bands in dsc and the appearance of several intense peaks in later cases confirms the incorporation of pani into dsc the maximum removal efficiency was found at ph 5 the mathematical models further confirm the chemical adsorption of cr vi by panidsc kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption process follows the pseudo second order kinetic model langmuir adsorption isotherm was best fitted with the experimental data as compared to freundlich model with a higher r2 value the negative value of δg and positive values of δh and δs revealed that the process of adsorption is feasible endothermic and spontaneous in nature with cr vi removal efficiency of 92 8 in 80 min by panidsc can reduce the level of cr vi to the safe level in water we propose a scalable synthesis of novel pani modified biomaterial which is highly efficient can be reused many times that has the potential to act as a promising adsorbent for cr

surface modulation thermal stability up to 650 c of material is demonstrated even after polyaniline grafting conducting batch experiments the influence of adsorbent dose ph time initial concentration temperature and stirring rate on removal of cr vi is investigated experimental findings from adsorption kinetics and isotherms are fitted to langmuir temkin dubinin radushkevich redlich peterson isotherms models and pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion elovich kinetics models consecutively however present polyaniline grafted biochar adsorbent is well fitted with pseudo second order model having the r2 value 0 995 in agreement with the isoelectric point at 5 8 maximum cr vi adsorption on panidsc perceived at ph range of 4 5 the thermodynamic parameters indicated that the process of adsorption is spontaneous and endothermic in nature δh 25 084 kj mol 1 furthermore the efficient regeneration up to 5 successive cycles makes the low cost bio adsorbent a promising one for field applications study graphical abstract image 1 keywords date seed char polyaniline date seed char cr vi adsorption kinetic study isotherm study 1 introduction on demand heavy metal usage due to rapid industrialization by mankind alarmed serious threat to ecosystem massive utilization of heavy metals induces serious health issues like genotoxicity cancer and mutagenic condition and much hazardous impact on environment among the various metal ions pb cd cr as the cr vi frequently used in metal dye tanning industries wood endurance nutrition once released to aquatic systems and soil has proven to be one of the most harmful and toxic heavy metal gogoi et al 2018 mostly chromium exists as cr vi and cr iii out of the two cr iii can be removed as a hydroxide precipitate xia et al 2020 whereas cr vi is extremely harmful because of its insolubility fluidity and small size khalaf et al 2019 liu et al 2016 even who has set the maximum permissible limit of cr vi in aquatic system is 0 05 mg l kaur et al 2015 beyond which chromium causes several health problems such as anemia liver damage lung cancers various kidney disorders etc therefore stepping towards the remediation of cr vi from aqueous systems has been a global challenge an array of techniques has been put forward like photocatalytic reduction zhao et al 2018 solvent extraction membrane filtration sandoval olvera et al 2019 ion exchange and reduction precipitation ye et al 2019 chemical precipitation electrochemical reduction zuo et al 2020 mechanical metal activation ren et al 2020 adsorption kar and equeenuddin 2019 had been developed for removal of cr vi out of these adsorption is the most popular method owing cost effectiveness easy handling and higher efficacy sahu et al 2021a 2021b till date many facile adsorbents such as cerium grafted zsm 5 min et al 2020 carbon nanotubes khajeh et al 2013 zeolite yang et al 2019 han et al 2019 activated carbon and mesoporous biochar yang et al 2020 had been reported for cr vi and as v removal unfortunately many are still associated with challenges like unsustainability low yield expensive etc emphasizing on sustainability scientists are looking for renewable bio based adsorbent for cr vi removal nowadays plants extract derived biochar a stable carbon rich charred by product fabricated by the thermal degradation of

sludge fan et al 2020 sawdust ghanim et al 2020 sugarcane bagasse tang et al 2020 have already been reported for production of biochar and its sorption ability being curious we have noticed that date phoenix dactylifera a popular fruit in dry climate region seed carrying 80 of the fruit weight is disposed unutilized every year due to lack of proper processing nehdi et al 2010 from environmental

adsorbent bouchelta et al 2012 the physiochemical and thermochemical characterization of date seed was well discussed earlier el abbari et al 2019 the effects of parameters such as time and temperature were studied for yield of carbon from date seed ahmed 2016 effectiveness of date seed biochar was examined for remediation of pb2 cu2 and ni2 mahdi et al 2019 removal of organic dyes chowdhury et al 2019 removal of nacl from saline water were reported hai et al 2019 date pit biomass is used as green carbon catalyst for butylation of phenol jamil et al 2017 adsorption of cefixime was studied by activated carbon of date press cake hasanzadeh et al 2020 still literature related to polymerization of date fruit waste is scanty this field might be explored more and can be applied for removal of cr iv under such circumstances where the date seed which is disposed unutilized every year the present paper summarizes the utilization of date seed as a novel bio adsorbent with higher removal capacity and cost effectiveness therefore in this present paper we have utilized date seed as a novel bio adsorbent with higher removal capacity and cost effectiveness high temperature based thermal decomposition of date seed yielded novel biochar carrying hydroxyl and phenolic group on surface further the surface of biochar is grafted with cationic polymer polyaniline via electrostatic interaction the synthesized materials were characterized by different instrumental techniques moreover this panidsc adsorbent is challenged against co existing cationic and anionic pollutants including cr vi adsorption experiments were thoroughly investigated by optimizing various adsorption parameters like adsorbent dosage time of contact ph temperature and stirring rates the result indicated that panidsc could be an efficient adsorbent for cr vi removal and can be further utilized in water remediation application 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials analytical grade chemicals

the local rourkela market the seeds were soaked in tap water and washed thrice with boiling water to remove date flesh and pigment residue it was then dried at 70 c for 48 h the seeds were ground with the help of a blender the powdered date seed was introduced into a tubular furnace under nitrogen flow thermal decomposition of powdered seed was done having n2 flow rate of 25 ml per minute and an increasing temperature rate of 50 c per min 100 g of dry date seed powder was placed in a ceramic dish the pyrolysis temperature was maintained at 450 c for 2 h then the furnace was cooled naturally till room temperature is attained the date seed biochar was collected and retained for further modification and analysis which is termed as date seed biochar dsc the liquid products comprising oil tar and gas products were disposed of for the synthesis of polyaniline modified date seed biochar panidsc dsc is polymerized with aniline through the following route 9 g of dsc was dispersed in 150 ml of 1 m hcl through ultra sonication for 30 min to reduce the accumulation of particles to the above dispersion of dsc aniline 3 ml was added dropwise and again sonicated for 20 min aps solution 9 12 g aps in 100 ml of water was added dropwise to the dispersion of aniline and dsc with continuous stirring for 10 h a dark green dispersion thus developed was filtered through vacuum filtration and washed with hcl and water to remove unreacted aniline the resultant product was oven dried at 70 c for 24 h and termed as polyaniline date seed biochar panidsc sahu et al 2019 the formation of panidsc and the removal process of cr vi is schematically represented in scheme 1 a series of panidsc were synthesized by varying the ratios of aniline dsc among which the material synthesized with 1 3 ratio

microscope fesem nova nano sem 450 the elemental mapping compositions were obtained by edx analyzer oxford inca the powder xrd technique was used to identify the crystallinity using a monochromatized cu k source on the x ray diffractometer rigaku ultima iv using a cu kα radiation source the functional group identification was carried out by ftir perkinelmer 1000 usa spectrophotometer using kbr pellet in the range 400 4000 cm 1 the raman graph was obtained by labram 010 laser raman spectrometer in the 500 to 2500 cm 1 range the thermogravimetric analysis tga was done by netzsch sta 449c germany the surface area was measured by quantachrome iq model asiqm0000 4 barett joymer halenda method was used to calculate the pore size distribution and pore volume the zeta potentials values were measured by zeta sizer malvern uk uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu was used to determine the concentration of cr vi through dpc method 2 4 adsorption experiments batch adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the removal of cr vi by panidsc the effect of important parameters like adsorbent dose the concentration of chromate solution ph temperature time of contact and stirring rate was varied to interpret the nature of adsorption the cr vi adsorbed panidsc is termed as panidsc cr at first 0 05 g of panidsc was taken in 100 ml 10 mg l cr vi solution at normal ph and room temperature it was then put in an orbital shaker at a speed of 200 rpm after the process of adsorption is over the resultant solution was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for a time period of 10 min the resultant concentration of cr vi in the filtrate and standard solutions were determined by dpc method using 1 5 diphenylcarbazide by a uv vis spectrophotometer at 540 nm wavelength the calibration curve was done by doing serial dilution for a higher concentration of cr vi every experiment was repeated thrice under similar conditions at room temperature and the average value was considered as the final result for reproducibility the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe removal percentage of cr vi were calculated by the following equations sahoo and hota 2019 1 q e c 0 c e w v 2 r c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 ce are the initial and equilibrium cr vi concentrations in mg l w is the mass of the panidsc adsorbent in g and v is the volume of chromium solution in l 2 5 desorption and regeneration after adsorption of cr vi the desorption experiment was performed using naoh ch3cooh water and nh4oh to each of these solutions panidsc cr previously adsorbed washed and dried was added the solutions were kept on stirring for 24 h then after filtration regeneration efficiency of panidsc was studied by the following equation 3 efficiency uptake in the second run uptake in the first run 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochar 3 1 1 fesem analysis the morphology of native dsc panidsc panidsc after adsorption cr vi is analyzed by fesem and are presented in fig 1 a c from fig 1a it was clear that the pores of dsc were well developed on the external surface and uniformly distributed numerous circular pores can be seen developed on the surfaces of dsc fig 1b revealed the sponge like morphology due to the successful polymerization of aniline on the dsc surface the polyaniline chains were uniformly distributed all over the surface of dsc in fig 1c it can also be clearly seen that the cr aggregations were embedded within the polyaniline layers to further confirm the elemental composition were analyzed using edx spectra revealing the presence of c o n k cr shown in table 2 the elemental mapping exhibited signals for c o n k cr with different weight percentages in fig 1 which is another supporting result representing the adsorption of cr vi on panidsc 3 1 2 raman analysis the ordered structures and presence of aromatic carbon in dsc panidsc panidsc cr is confirmed by the raman spectrograph shown in fig 2 a c with proper peak fitting dsc in fig 2a exhibits 2 main bands of non graphitic carbon the d band at 1326 cm 1 and the g band at 1563 cm 1 the d band corresponds to disordered graphite lattice and g band to ideal graphite lattice the presence of d and g bands revealed that sp2 bonded carbon is there in dsc hossain et al 2018 the analysis of new intense bands in panidsc spectra in fig 2 b is as follows band at 1579 cm 1 is due to the quinoid c c stretching vibration in the polymer chain the intense band at 1460 cm 1 is due to the benzenoid c c ring stretching vibration the 1336 cm 1 band is attributed to c n stretching vibration modes that are characteristic peaks of polyaniline the band at 1159 cm 1 is because of c h out of plane bending vibrations in the aromatic ring the other two peaks are one at 603 cm 1 is because of benzene ring deformation in polyaniline other at 518 cm 1 is due to cross linking between polyaniline chains the bands at 830 cm 1 775 cm 1 are due to in plane and the band at 418 cm 1 is due to out of plane vibrations of the ring of the protonated form of pani rohom et al 2014 shakoor et al 2011 in panidsc 1312 cm 1 the position of the d band as compared to dsc 1326 cm 1 is shifted to lower frequencies red shift that maybe because of the electron pairs of the n atoms of pani which resonate with the adjacent benzene dsc hsiao et al 2010 in fig 2 a the ratio of id ig was calculated to be 0 78 for dsc and in fig 2 c id ig ratio was 0 93 for panidsc cr the analysis of intensity ratio before and after adsorption confirmed the incorporation of polyaniline and interaction of chromium on dsc surface 3 1 3 thermogravimetric analysis thermogravimetric analysis was performed to interpret the thermal stability weight loss behavior of the prepared dsc and panidsc biomaterial under nitrogen atmosphere from 30 c up to 800 c that are graphically presented in fig 3 a it can be interpreted from the plot that there are 2 stages of weight loss at two different temperature regions for both biomaterials initially the surface moisture of material was disappeared up to the temperature of 110 c due to the evaporation of water adsorbed to the surface of dsc and panidsc which involve vander walls force of attraction within molecules there was a negligible weight loss or almost there is stability in weight up to 320 c and 325 c which is evidence that prepared materials have thermal stability below 320 c in both the cases of dsc and panidsc the first major weight loss occurring at 320 c 650 c in the case of dsc and 325 c 608 c in panidsc it is due to breaking down of cellulose lignin content in both the cases and additional thermo oxidative degradation of polyaniline chain in the latter case bardalai et al 2019 the mass losses at around 616 c and 595 c are comparatively low due to the breaking down of c h and c c bonds during pyrolysis siddiqui et al 2019 3 1 4 fourier transform infrared analysis to examine the presence of surface functional groups and bonding properties of all biomaterials dsc panidsc panidsc cr ftir analysis was carried out and the spectra are represented in fig 3b the broad peak around 3440 3450 cm 1 indicates the o h stretching band formed due to dehydration of cellulose during pyrolysis the peak around 2930 cm 1 c h stretching of aliphatic compounds is in good accordance with the c h sharp bending vibration bands at 1388 cm 1 ertaş and hakki alma 2010 x huang et al 2015 a band at 1630 1650 cm 1 can be attributed to cc ring stretching due to aromatic carbon bardalai et al 2019 again broad band at around 1625 cm 1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of o h bond the band positioned at 1047 cm 1 is due to c o bending vibration in c oh group which indicates the presence of c oh sites for all the materials after the attachment of polyaniline a band at 1288 cm 1 and 1125 cm 1 in the case of panidsc panidsc cr is the characteristic band of c n stretching vibration c h in plane deformation which is not seen in the case of dsc which signifies the formation of panidsc tanzifi et al 2017 the ir spectra of panidsc cr showed minute shifting of oh band and decreased intensity for all the other bands concerning panidsc and appearance of 2 new peaks from which it may be concluded that there is intercalation of cr vi in panidsc 3 1 5 zeta potential analysis in the adsorption experiments to determine the effect of surface charge of adsorbent zeta potential studies have been carried out for panidsc the phiep isoelectric point value at different ph values are given in fig 3c it was clear from the above figure that the zeta potential value of panidsc was 5 8 below 5 8 ph as the surface of the adsorbent is positively charged there is a favorable interaction between negatively charged chromium ions 3 1 6 xrd analysis xrd analysis was studied to ascertain the crystal structure of the dsc panidsc panidsc cr fig 3d presents the xrd pattern of these materials from 10 to 60 2 theta values range xrd pattern of dsc revealed the fact that dsc is amorphous in nature with characteristic peaks at 2θ 28 2 with d spacing 3 15 nm and 2θ 40 4 having 2 22 nm d spacing value yuan et al 2020 in panidsc panidsc cr two characteristic standard peaks remain the same with two extra peaks with 2θ 20 5 and 25 6 with d spacing value 3 5 nm in a later case that clearly indicates the parallel and perpendicular periodicity of pani intercalated in the surface of dsc mostafaei and zolriasatein 2012 the broad peak conferred the low crystallinity nature of all materials after chromium adsorption in the case of panidsc cr three peaks were observed at 2θ 25 28 2 40 4 having d spacing values 3 55 3 15 2 22 nm respectively with an increased intensity that indicates the there is no phase change even after adsorption 3 1 7 n2 adsorption desorption isotherm analysis fig 4 a represents the nitrogen gas sorption isotherm and fig 4b speaks for the pore size distribution curve of the dsc and panidsc n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 196 c degassing temperature 150 c time 6h of both dsc and panidsc showed a type iv isotherm with a large hysteresis loop with p p0 greater than 0 5 the result suggests the uptake of adsorbate causing multilayer adsorption near completion of the first monolayer due to compact nature of date seed the specific surface area of dsc was found to be 60 36 m2 g 1 whereas surface area of panidsc increased to 76 60 m2 g 1 providing more active site post modification the bjh pore diameter pore volume in dsc and panidsc were found to be 3 335 nm 0 05 cm3 g 1 and 3 735 nm 0 25 cm3 g 1 presented in table 3 simultaneous appearance of broad pore size around 7 nm and 10 nm is aroused due to interparticle gap interestingly all pore size lies strictly in mesoporous range 2 50 nm according to iupac classification confirmed the distinct mesoporous nature of sample the comparative higher surface area with more binding sites and appropriate pore diameter supported panidsc for better adsorption of cr vi ion adhikari et al 2017 4 adsorption experiment 4 1 analysis process for cr vi adsorption the adsorption experiments of cr vi were conducted by taking a fixed amount of panidsc in 100 ml of 10 ppm of cr vi the solutions of chromium were stirred in an orbital shaker at 200 rotations per min at room temperature taking different parameters into consideration like adsorbent dose initial concentration of chromium ph temperature time and stirring rate the mechanism of adsorption was studied 4 1 1 effect of ph to study the variation of ph onto adsorption of chromium different ph solutions from 2 to 12 were made keeping other parameters the same fig 5 a represents the effect of ph for chromium adsorption by panidsc it is obvious from this figure that from ph 2 to 5 the adsorption capacity slightly increased 93 and beyond ph 5 slightly decreased up to ph 6 90 but there is a sharp decrease in removal percentage above ph 6 and the trend of decrease continues up to ph 12 25 the reason for such a phenomenon can be explained as follows at lower ph 2 6 due to the availability of h ions protonation of amine occurs nh2 h nh3 on the surface of panidsc chromium mainly exists as hcro4 and cr2o7 2 in solution at lower ph so there is a strong electrostatic interaction between the oppositely charged protonated panidsc surface and chromium species at ph range 4 to 6 hcro4 and cr2o7 2 forms h2cro4 and h2cro7 species due to reaction with h ions as these are neutral species the adsorption capacity decreases at higher ph in 6 12 range there is the availability of oh ions so deprotonation of amine occurs and the amine group is in the form of nh2 oh nh2 oh here there is repulsion between the negative ions thus we get a decrease in adsorption capacity at higher ph values the optimum value of ph for panidsc is at around ph 5 thus chosen as the equilibrium ph for all adsorption tests lan et al 2014 lyu et al 2017 singh et al 2017 4 1 2 effect of adsorbent dosage to investigate the effect of panidsc doses on chromium adsorption varied adsorbent dosages from 50 mg to 200 mg were taken at ph 5 the result was presented in fig 5b the removal percentage of cr vi increases with an increase in panidsc dose up to 150 mg the result can be justified as there is an increase in adsorbent dose number of active sites increases thus the removal efficiency of cr vi also increases wu et al 2014 beyond 150 mg of adsorbent dose there is no increase in adsorption efficiency because of lack of cr vi ions concentration to be absorbed in all the binding sites of panidsc indicating the equilibrium has been reached at 150 mg for panidsc thus 150 mg was chosen as the optimum adsorbent dosage for rest all adsorption experiments huang et al 2015 4 1 3 effect of initial chromate concentration to study the effect of initial chromate ion concentration on adsorption efficiency of panidsc experiments were performed by varying chromate solution concentration from 2 to 100 mg l keeping other components constant it is observed from fig 5c that with an increase in cr vi ion concentration the adsorption capacity decreases linearly for 10 mg l to 40 mg l of cr vi ions in solutions this phenomenon is obvious for a particular dose of panidsc as the active adsorbing sites are constant with respect to the constant increase in cr vi ions available adsorbing sites are decreasing for adsorption decreasing the percentage of removal of chromium therefore 10 mg l concentration of cr vi ion is optimized and maintained for all batch experiments 4 1 4 effect of temperature to explore the behaviour of temperature on removal percentage of cr vi by synthesized adsorbent panidsc adsorption experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 30 80 c the results obtained are presented in fig 5d a maximum removal percentage of 92 89 was obtained at 70 c the adsorption equilibrium was attained at 50 with a removal capacity of 91 89 for cr vi 4 1 5 effect of contact time to design a kinetics model another important parameter contact time was studied in batch adsorption experiments by the varying time of adsorption from 15 to 150 min and results are given in fig 5e during the first 30 min 64 adsorption occurred and increases up to 92 36 removal at 80 min beyond which equilibrium of the adsorption process was obtained 4 1 6 effect of stirring rate to investigate the effect of stirring rate in cr vi adsorption process stirring rate from 50 400 rpm were varied while other parameters were kept constant the result in fig 5f reflects that with an increase in stirring rate the adsorption capacity increases up to 200 rpm agitation speed beyond that it became constant it gives a clear inference that the randomness of chromate ions panidsc molecules in solution increases with an increase in stirring rate resulting in quick adsorption further increase in stirring speed has no effect on adsorption percentage this is because all the active sites are occupied earlier and that creates only steric hindrance between the molecules 4 2 adsorption isotherm study to interpret the mutual effect of adsorbate in solid and liquid phases with adsorbent at equilibrium adsorption isotherm studies were performed fig 6 a e langmuir freundlich temkin dubinin radushkevich and redlich peterson models shows the fitting of experimental data into isotherm models langmuir model describes the equilibrium between adsorbent and adsorbate for monolayer adsorption and the freundlich model tells about non ideal adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces the experimental data fit more with the langmuir model than the freundlich model by comparing the r2 values different parameters for different models are represented in table 4 the higher value of r2 0 99 langmuir affinity constant kl 0 57 l mg and adsorption capacity qm 27 3 mg g indicates the isotherm is more consistent with the langmuir model the adsorption is monolayer with uniformly distributed binding sites on adsorbent al ghouti and da ana 2020 the degree of heterogeneity denoted by n is calculated to be 2 38 in the freundlich model signifies the chemical interaction between panidsc and cr vi to explain the adsorption mechanism in a more prominent manner experimental data were fitted with temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models the temkin model assumes the heat of adsorption is inversely related to coverage of the adsorbent surface the equilibrium binding constant at is calculated to be 7 48 l mg the heat of sorption b is 5 06 j mol which indicates the process of adsorption follows both physical and chemical processes in the d r model the mechanism of adsorption follows pore filling it assumes adsorption is multilayer involving vanderwaal s force of interaction and applicable to the physical adsorption process the adsorption energy e is 0 73 kj mol which is less than 8 kj mol clearly determines the process is dominated by physisorption the redlich peterson r p isotherm is a three parameter empirical adsorption model that incorporates elements from both the langmuir and freundlich isotherms it is evident that the r p isotherm was more accurate than the langmuir and freundlich isotherms as it contains three unknown parameters in this study the higher r2 value of 0 98 in case of r p isotherm clearly depicts its better suitability with the adsorption process the value of isotherm parameters kr β and ar from the r p models are calculated as 15 0 904 and 0 414 respectively 4 3 kinetics study to get an idea about the mechanisms involved in the adsorption process and rate of adsorption three well known kinetic models were adopted the experimental data were fitted into the pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso intra particle diffusion ipd and elovich model the results of adsorption kinetics studies were represented in fig 7 a d the different kinetic parameters are listed in table 5 a deviation can be marked from linear fitting with r2 value 0 921 and qe value 12 58 mg g for pfo the data fitted more with the pso model having the r2 value 0 995 the actual qe from the experiment was 6 17 mg g which is almost the same fits well as the theoretical qe 6 96 mg g that signifies the adsorption kinetics fits with the pso model su et al 2018 further the data were fitted with the ipd model to know whether the mechanism of adsorption is surface area particle size dependent or not the plots of qt versus t1 2 are having an intercept of 2 59 which means c values were not equal to zero again fig 7c shows roughly two phases of adsorption the first linear phase represents the mass transfer on active sites present in the outer surface of panidsc the second linear graph interprets the adsorption due to intraparticle diffusion on the inner pores of panidsc this demonstrates the adsorption of cr vi passes both through mass transfer and intra particle diffusion mechanism chen et al 2017 then the elovich model was applied which helps to predict the mass and surface diffusion activation and the nature of adsorption on the heterogeneous surface of the adsorbent whether chemisorption or not the parameters value α and β from the elovich models are calculated as 1 41 and 0 786 respectively 4 4 thermodynamic parameters the effect of temperature in the range of 30 80 c was studied to observe the removal efficiency of cr vi by panidsc gibbs free energy δg in kj mol 1 k 1 entropy δs in kj k 1 mol 1 and enthalpy δh in kj mol 1 were calculated by using the van t hoff equation as follows 4 δ g r t ln k c 5 k c c 1 c 2 6 δg δh tδs 7 ln k c δs r δh r t where kc is the ratio of chromium concentration on the panidsc surface at equilibrium c1 to the remaining chromium concentration in solution c2 r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the temperature in kelvin fig 8 represents the plot of log kc versus 1 t the different thermodynamic parameters thus calculated from the equation were tabulated in table 6 the positive enthalpy δh 25 084 kj mol 1 shows the endothermic nature of adsorption that means a large amount of heat was required to transfer the cr vi ions onto panidsc surface the positive value of δs 0 095 kj k 1 mol 1 indicates the increase in randomness of the solid liquid system at different temperatures we got different negative values of δg reveals the spontaneity and feasibility of the adsorption process again it can be noted that δg increases with an increase in temperature which suggests that the adsorption process is favorable even at high temperature chen et al 2017 4 5 desorption and regeneration studies one of the significant aspects of the adsorption experiment is its regeneration and reuse studies to reuse the synthetic adsorbent material many times which makes our adsorption process economical the desorption of adsorbed cr vi was carried out for 5 cycles to check the ability of panidsc to be regenerated and reused at first the batch desorption experiments were performed randomly with a weak acid acetic acid a neutral medium water a weak base ammonium hydroxide and a strong base sodium hydroxide each of 1m solutions as active agents out of which water does not affect desorption acetic acid has the minimum effect and maximum desorption took place in 1m naoh then varying concentration of naoh 0 02 1 5 m was used for desorption experiments where 1m naoh solution was found best with 94 desorption of chromium the nature of desorption can be due to the flowing facts from ftir data and zeta potential analysis phzpc 5 8 for panidsc its clear the surface of adsorbent is positively charged hence treatment with weak acid the hydronium ion may tend to oxidize amines to less ionisable imine has limited impact on adsorbent for the process of desorption further cr vi was attached as hcro4 or cr2o7 2 on amine sites in panidsc hydroxides having a higher affinity for positive ions may replace hcro4 from pani sites when naoh and nh4oh were employed for desorption naoh being the stronger base responsible for higher desorption of chromate ions as compared to nh4oh after the process of desorption the remaining incomplete desorption may be due to the possibility of chemical bond formation between the cr vi ions and the nitrogen atoms of polyaniline kumar et al 2008 mdlalose et al 2018 after 5 cycles of adsorption desorption experiments panidsc shows a significant decrease 76 of chromium uptake shown in fig 9 thus panidsc is relatively stable with reusability potential up to 5 cycles 4 6 possible mechanism of adsorption from the obtained experimental observations and their computed models the adsorption mechanism for chromium is suggested as follows the maximum adsorption of chromium onto panidsc surface occurs at acidic ph where the amine group exists in its protonated form the main forms cr vi that exists in solution produced from k2cr2o7 are cr2o7 2 and hcro4 which binds with the protonated amine group present in the surface of panidsc which can be represented in chemical reactions as below long et al 2021 the overall adsorption mechanism was proposed in scheme 2 2 h c r o 4 c r 2 o 7 2 h 2 o n h 3 h c r o 4 n h 3 h c r o 4 n h 3 c r 2 o 7 2 n h 3 c r o 7 2 in neutral ph the amino functional group in adsorbent were bonded by coordination n cr bonds with the cr vi ions during adsorption n h 2 c r o 4 2 n h 2 c r o 4 2 5 conclusion the present article explores the successful polyaniline modification in date seed biochar with its various physical and chemical properties the systematically investigated experimental data and findings gives a distinct pathway for cr vi adsorption with its plausible adsoption mechanism date seed which is considered as a waste was taken as raw material and pyrolysed to get char the date seed biochar was chemically modified with polyaniline by polymerization method to get polyaniline date seed biochar a low cost amine functionalized char adsorbent was thus synthesized and adsorption experiments were carried out for cr vi in aqueous media the morphological study reveals the highly porous nature of the adsorbent with uniform distribution of the polyaniline chain in the surface ftir spectra indicate the presence of nitrogen containing functional groups in panidsc and intercalation of cr vi in panidsc cr by strong chemical interaction the raman spectra specified the d and g bands in dsc and the appearance of several intense peaks in later cases confirms the incorporation of pani into dsc the maximum removal efficiency was found at ph 5 the mathematical models further confirm the chemical adsorption of cr vi by panidsc kinetic studies revealed that the adsorption process follows the pseudo second order kinetic model langmuir adsorption isotherm was best fitted with the experimental data as compared to freundlich model with a higher r2 value the negative value of δg and positive values of δh and δs revealed that the process of adsorption is feasible endothermic and spontaneous in nature with cr vi removal efficiency of 92 8 in 80 min by panidsc can reduce the level of cr vi to the safe level in water we propose a scalable synthesis of novel pani modified biomaterial which is highly efficient can be reused many times that has the potential to act as a promising adsorbent for cr

11868,geochemical parameters chloride and bromide were used as tracers to demarcate the extent of saline water intrusion in the northern part of tamilnadu coastal aquifer which served as a hub for major pumping well fields for supply of drinking water to chennai city 158 groundwater samples were collected during pre post monsoon period to analyse the hydrochemical variations across this temporal stretch and two major water types were interpreted from the analytical data during pre monsoon period na cl is dominant followed by na hco3 type and during post monsoon the groundwater in the central and eastern part shift towards na hco3 type from na cl type bromide is absent in the freshwater samples while the mixed water samples have varying bromide concentrations in the study area br concentration in groundwater ranged from 0 to 22 1 mg l while the seawater sample had br concentration of 63 mg l the cl br ratios of groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 01 to 188 while that of the seawater figured at 288 the groundwater of the eastern and north eastern portion of the study area has cl br ratio between 75 and 188 and this value has a similar signature to that of seawater the continental part of the study area has cl br ratio less than 50 which corresponds to that of the intermittent zone between the seawater and rainwater spatial distribution of cl br ratio and their variation across distance from the coast indicate the remnants of seawater in the aquifer material upto 19 20 km inland and the ratio tends to decrease beyond 20 km distance the study explores the applicability of the cl br ratios for defining the extent and movement of he freshwater saline water interface in a coastal region which can be used by the water managers administrators and planners for effective management and protection of available groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromide chloride bromide ratio seawater intrusion coastal aquifer minjur region 1 introduction groundwater has been the most significant source of fresh water in regions with limited surface water resources and is widely used for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes in most parts of the globe ever increasing demand for groundwater due to growing population has unleashed many unscientific and unplanned techniques to exploit these hidden resources declining groundwater levels desaturation of aquifers and deterioration in groundwater quality are the resultant manifestations which have been reported all over the world harman et al 1996 pulido 2004 katz et al 2011 the scenario is totally different if the land mass is bounded by a coast a contributing factor towards seawater intrusion which is detrimental to the already vulnerable aquifer relentless groundwater withdrawal leads to lowering of groundwater head thereby inducing the denser saline water to intrude immediately into the freshwater aquifers to maintain the hydrodynamic balance of the region senthilkumar et al 2018 saline water intrusion not only deteriorates the groundwater quality but also disrupts the ecological processes moore 1999 katz et al 2011 therefore a comprehensive perception of the hydrodynamics and geochemical elements of the region is important for the effective management of the available resources in the coastal aquifer systems many techniques have been deployed by researchers to map the invasive freshwater salinewater interface through geophysical geochemical and hydrogeological process the use of bromide and chloride bromide cl br ratio have been gaining importance in the recent years because it gives a clear panacea for identifying the sources of pollution and for solving untraceable questions in the hydrogeology davis et al 1998 katz et al 2011 mcauthur et al 2012 one such attempt has been carried out in the northern part of tamilnadu minjur region which had a battery of well fields that were pumping groundwater relentlessly to supply the drinking water needs to the ever expanding chennai city undp 1980 heavy groundwater withdrawal had led to seawater intrusion in this region as documented through a host of research works sathish and elango 2016 cgwb 2012 senthilkumar et al 2018 meyer et al 2019 costall et al 2020 even though few research studies have attempted to decipher the extent of intrusion through geophysical geochemical and hydrogeological windows this study focuses on the application of br and cl br ratio as an indicator and tracer for delineating the freshwater saline water interface the key derivative of this exercise being the effective management of coastal aquifer system 2 study area the area identified for study lies in the northern part of the tamilnadu state between north latitudes 13 05 35

hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical survey was carried out reconnaissance well inventory survey was conducted in 267 wells wherein groundwater level in situ electrical conductivity and ph were

monsoon period may june 2017 and during post monsoon period january february 2018 from both open and shallow tubewells in addition rainwater and seawater samples were collected during the monsoon

the study area groundwater samples were collected in 1 l sterilized polyethylene bottles all the sampling bottles were soaked with 1 1 hno3 washed using soap and were rinsed 2 to 3 times using double distilled water during the sampling sampling bottles were thoroughly washed and rinsed two to three times using the groundwater to be sampled groundwater samples from tubewells were collected at least after 10 15 min of pumping of the groundwater electrical conductivity ec in μs cm temperature c and ph of groundwater samples were measured insitu in the field using digital portable meters eutech ec tester instrument the groundwater samples collected were filtered using millipore 0 45 μm filter paper and acidified using hno3 subsequently were analysed for concentrations of major cations namely calcium magnesium sodium potassium and for major anions such as carbonate bicarbonate chloride nitrate and sulphate the analytical procedures used were followed as per apha 2005 the methods adopted for analyses are titrimetric method for ca2 and mg2 flame photometric method for na and k titration method using 0 01n h2so4 for hco3 and co3 titration method using 0 05n agno3 for cl and spectro photometeric method for so4 respectively bromide and fluoride concentration in groundwater was also analysed using ion selective electrodes orion bromide electrode 9635bnwp validation of the analytical procedures was achieved by running the blanks and standards to check the reliability of the methods adopted ion balance error was calculated after completion of the analysis of major ions in general ion balance error of the groundwater samples was within 7 the analyses were performed immediately after the collection of groundwater samples at the hydrogeochemistry lab of the central ground water board secr chennai the cation chloride ratio and continentality index were the additional variables quantified to decipher the hydrogeochemical complexity of the groundwater in the study area the cation chloride ratio ccr reflects the sensitivity of the major cation concentration to changes in the chloride concentration and can be calculated by the equation ccr index ca mg cl na k cl where the ion concentration is represented in meq l continentality index was another supplementary tool employed to measure the impact of the local climate on the land mass as opposed to the sea ocean the continentality index k is calculated using the equation given below conrad 1946 later modified by davis et al 2004 k 1 7 a sin ϕ 20 4 where k is the continentality index in percentage and ranges from 0 to 100 a is the average annual range of temperature in c at a given place and ϕ is the geographical latitude constants have been added to the index formula so that locations in the equator can also be used 5 results and discussion 5 1 hydrogeochemistry the ph of groundwater samples vary from 7 1 to 8 3 with a mean value of 8 0 and these ph values in the study area is considered as neutral the order of dominance of the cations and anion can be summarized as na mg ca k and cl hco3 so4 co3 respectively the descriptive statistics of the physicochemical parameters of groundwater samples of the study area is tabulated in table 1 sodium is the major and dominant cation and its concentration in the groundwater of the study area ranges from 23 to 1214 mg l table 1 calcium ranges from 24 to

bromide fig 5 indicates that the higher concentration is observed in the eastern part of the study area majority of the groundwater samples with high bromide concentration are endemic to the eastern part and is observed within a perimeter of 18 19 km inland based on the spatial distribution of the bromide concentration and it is inferred that the seawater has inundated an area of 92 km2 of land bromide concentration gradually decreases and is recorded very low concentration beyond 20 km from the coast fig 6 5 5 systematics of cl br ratio with cl in groundwater in natural waters chloride and bromide ions are ubiquitous solutes with chloride being the major component and bromide being the minor component chloride concentration of the study area ranges from 53 to 1304 mg l while the

ranges from 0 01 to 188 with an average ratio of 81 87 thirty three groundwater samples have cl br ratio greater than 100 during the pre monsoon period out of these twenty seven samples pertain to locations within 20 km from the coast during the post monsoon period the cl br ratio ranges from 0 01 to 171 with a mean ratio of 72 85 in the present study the cl br ratio was used as a tracer because the physical properties occurring like evaporation dissolution and mixing can change the absolute concentration of the groundwater but they do not alter the cl br ratio of saline waters as they are always present in the mass ratio this defining property of cl br ratios was used as the reference to demarcate the extent of the inland shift of the saline water freshwater interface to identify the sources and areas of high concentration the behavior of the cl br ratio to various environments has been studied by few researchers davis et al 1998 2003 fabryka martin et al 1991 through their studies wherein 4 to 5 fields were demarcated such as fresh groundwater groundwater mixed with seawater seawater groundwater mixed with septic tank and sewerage effluent based on the values of cl br against cl concentration the effect of diluted groundwater in unmineralised fields were studied by davis et al 1998 2003 fabryka martin et al 1991 and it was observed that the infiltrating freshwater though leads to an increase in cl concentration yet the cl br ratio remains unchanged groundwater mixed with water leaked from the septic tank has high cl br vengosh and pankratov 1998 while organic leachates have cl br ratio 200 groundwater mixed with leachates from animal dung has the cl br ratios between 35 and 167 hudak 2003 nissenbaum and magaritz 1991 reported cl br values as

ii table salt and iii urine from west bengal state of india bromide concentration in seawater ranges from 51 to 71 mg l katz et al 2011 vengosh and pankratov 1998 the cl br ratio in seawater ranges between 288 and 292 and cl concentration ranges between 19000 and 20000 mg l morris and riley 1996 mccaffrey et al 1987 in the study area the analysis of the seawater sample of bay of bengal showed a bromide concentration of 63 mg l with chloride concentration of 18150 mg l and cl br ratio of 288 the rainwater of the study area has bromide concentration of 0 3 mg l with chloride concentration of 4 5 mg l and cl br ratio of 15 1 the cl br ratio of the groundwater samples of the study area during pre post monsoon ranges from 0 01 to 188 and 0 01 to 171 respectively both rainwater and seawater data were used as indicators for start and end products and samples cl br ratios were plotted against the cl concentration fig 7 all the groundwater samples in the study area have characteristics inherent to that of the mixing zone and relatable to seawater ratio further insights of the data plot exhibit a few samples showing low cl br ratio against high cl concentration with the remaining samples reflecting high cl br ratio against lower cl concentration inferences have also been drawn on the variation of cl br ratio of the groundwater samples observed across the distance from the coast to the inland aided through a graphical representation fig 8 of cl br ratio with distance from the coast interpretation of the graph reveals the occurrence of high concentration of cl br ratio from 100 to 188 pre monsoon and 100 to 171 post monsoon in groundwater samples within 10 km distance from the coast the cl br ratio of most the samples within the distance of 20 km range from 75 to 188 which clearly indicates the presence of seawater in the water bearing formations of the study area meanwhile the cl br ratio of the samples beyond the distance of 20 km from the coast exhibits a totally different signature and are less than 75 further it is inferred that the continental part of the region has cl br ratio less than 50 mg l from the plots of cl br ratio against distance fig 8 it is evident that seawater has invaded the aquifers upto 20 km inland during premonsoon also a receding influence observed during the postmonsoon with the intrusion limited to 19 kms inland this finding validates a previous study wherein senthilkumar et al 2018 have reported seawater intrusion in the study area to an extent of 17 18 km inland during the pre monsoon period of 2013 14 based on hydrogeological investigations high withdrawal rate of groundwater in the central and eastern parts of the study area for agricultural industrial and drinking water supply are the main cause for lowering the groundwater head and inviting the intrusion of denser saline water into the freshwater aquifer the continentality index for the sampling locations were also calculated with stipulated limits of 0 for marine environment and 100 for continental environment graphical representation of cl br ratio against continentality index fig 9 shows that high cl br ratios plot along the 40 to 50 range of continentality index and samples with low cl br ratio plot in the 60 to 70 zone of the continentality index fields of high cl br ratio in the plot thus equates to a marine environment which further corroborates the statement of sea water intrusion in the study area cl br ratios are low within the continental interiors proportionate to the distance away from the coast 6 conclusion analysis of the 158 groundwater samples from 79 representative stations collected during pre monsoon and post monsoon revealed that nacl and na hco3 were the major facies exhibiting a spatial trend with significant population of the facies in the eastern north eastern parts of the study area migration of water from na cl to na hco3 type were also observed in many locations from pre to post monsoon period bromide concentrations along with distinctive cl br ratios pertaining to the groundwater samples in the area helped to assign quality standards that would further establish the freshwater saline water interface in the northern tamilnadu coastal aquifer bromide concentration in the study area ranges from below detection limit to 22 1 mg l while the seawater had 63 mg l of bromide concentration the cl br ratio in the groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 01 to 188 pre monsoon and 0 01 to 171 post monsoon while for the seawater it was 288 the samples located in the eastern and north eastern portion of the study area had cl br ratio between 75 and 188 and this ratio corresponds to that of the seawater the cl br ratio clearly demarcates the saline water intruded regions and the remnants of the seawater are still present in the aquifer material upto 20 km inland cl br ratio with distance from the coast plot also confirms that 19 20 km inland has been intruded and the ratio tends to decrease beyond 20 km distance the study provides baseline information on the north tamilnadu coastal aquifer and stresses that bromide parameter should be analysed for all samples in the coastal regions this study also emphasis that cl br ratio along with an integrated approach involving scientific investigation can be used a general panacea for identifying the sources

11868,geochemical parameters chloride and bromide were used as tracers to demarcate the extent of saline water intrusion in the northern part of tamilnadu coastal aquifer which served as a hub for major pumping well fields for supply of drinking water to chennai city 158 groundwater samples were collected during pre post monsoon period to analyse the hydrochemical variations across this temporal stretch and two major water types were interpreted from the analytical data during pre monsoon period na cl is dominant followed by na hco3 type and during post monsoon the groundwater in the central and eastern part shift towards na hco3 type from na cl type bromide is absent in the freshwater samples while the mixed water samples have varying bromide concentrations in the study area br concentration in groundwater ranged from 0 to 22 1 mg l while the seawater sample had br concentration of 63 mg l the cl br ratios of groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 01 to 188 while that of the seawater figured at 288 the groundwater of the eastern and north eastern portion of the study area has cl br ratio between 75 and 188 and this value has a similar signature to that of seawater the continental part of the study area has cl br ratio less than 50 which corresponds to that of the intermittent zone between the seawater and rainwater spatial distribution of cl br ratio and their variation across distance from the coast indicate the remnants of seawater in the aquifer material upto 19 20 km inland and the ratio tends to decrease beyond 20 km distance the study explores the applicability of the cl br ratios for defining the extent and movement of he freshwater saline water interface in a coastal region which can be used by the water managers administrators and planners for effective management and protection of available groundwater resources graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromide chloride bromide ratio seawater intrusion coastal aquifer minjur region 1 introduction groundwater has been the most significant source of fresh water in regions with limited surface water resources and is widely used for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes in most parts of the globe ever increasing demand for groundwater due to growing population has unleashed many unscientific and unplanned techniques to exploit these hidden resources declining groundwater levels desaturation of aquifers and deterioration in groundwater quality are the resultant manifestations which have been reported all over the world harman et al 1996 pulido 2004 katz et al 2011 the scenario is totally different if the land mass is bounded by a coast a contributing factor towards seawater intrusion which is detrimental to the already vulnerable aquifer relentless groundwater withdrawal leads to lowering of groundwater head thereby inducing the denser saline water to intrude immediately into the freshwater aquifers to maintain the hydrodynamic balance of the region senthilkumar et al 2018 saline water intrusion not only deteriorates the groundwater quality but also disrupts the ecological processes moore 1999 katz et al 2011 therefore a comprehensive perception of the hydrodynamics and geochemical elements of the region is important for the effective management of the available resources in the coastal aquifer systems many techniques have been deployed by researchers to map the invasive freshwater salinewater interface through geophysical geochemical and hydrogeological process the use of bromide and chloride bromide cl br ratio have been gaining importance in the recent years because it gives a clear panacea for identifying the sources of pollution and for solving untraceable questions in the hydrogeology davis et al 1998 katz et al 2011 mcauthur et al 2012 one such attempt has been carried out in the northern part of tamilnadu minjur region which had a battery of well fields that were pumping groundwater relentlessly to supply the drinking water needs to the ever expanding chennai city undp 1980 heavy groundwater withdrawal had led to seawater intrusion in this region as documented through a host of research works sathish and elango 2016 cgwb 2012 senthilkumar et al 2018 meyer et al 2019 costall et al 2020 even though few research studies have attempted to decipher the extent of intrusion through geophysical geochemical and hydrogeological windows this study focuses on the application of br and cl br ratio as an indicator and tracer for delineating the freshwater saline water interface the key derivative of this exercise being the effective management of coastal aquifer system 2 study area the area identified for study lies in the northern part of the tamilnadu state between north latitudes 13 05 35

coast to the inland aided through a graphical representation fig 8 of cl br ratio with distance from the coast interpretation of the graph reveals the occurrence of high concentration of cl br ratio from 100 to 188 pre monsoon and 100 to 171 post monsoon in groundwater samples within 10 km distance from the coast the cl br ratio of most the samples within the distance of 20 km range from 75 to 188 which clearly indicates the presence of seawater in the water bearing formations of the study area meanwhile the cl br ratio of the samples beyond the distance of 20 km from the coast exhibits a totally different signature and are less than 75 further it is inferred that the continental part of the region has cl br ratio less than 50 mg l from the plots of cl br ratio against distance fig 8 it is evident that seawater has invaded the aquifers upto 20 km inland during premonsoon also a receding influence observed during the postmonsoon with the intrusion limited to 19 kms inland this finding validates a previous study wherein senthilkumar et al 2018 have reported seawater intrusion in the study area to an extent of 17 18 km inland during the pre monsoon period of 2013 14 based on hydrogeological investigations high withdrawal rate of groundwater in the central and eastern parts of the study area for agricultural industrial and drinking water supply are the main cause for lowering the groundwater head and inviting the intrusion of denser saline water into the freshwater aquifer the continentality index for the sampling locations were also calculated with stipulated limits of 0 for marine environment and 100 for continental environment graphical representation of cl br ratio against continentality index fig 9 shows that high cl br ratios plot along the 40 to 50 range of continentality index and samples with low cl br ratio plot in the 60 to 70 zone of the continentality index fields of high cl br ratio in the plot thus equates to a marine environment which further corroborates the statement of sea water intrusion in the study area cl br ratios are low within the continental interiors proportionate to the distance away from the coast 6 conclusion analysis of the 158 groundwater samples from 79 representative stations collected during pre monsoon and post monsoon revealed that nacl and na hco3 were the major facies exhibiting a spatial trend with significant population of the facies in the eastern north eastern parts of the study area migration of water from na cl to na hco3 type were also observed in many locations from pre to post monsoon period bromide concentrations along with distinctive cl br ratios pertaining to the groundwater samples in the area helped to assign quality standards that would further establish the freshwater saline water interface in the northern tamilnadu coastal aquifer bromide concentration in the study area ranges from below detection limit to 22 1 mg l while the seawater had 63 mg l of bromide concentration the cl br ratio in the groundwater of the study area ranged from 0 01 to 188 pre monsoon and 0 01 to 171 post monsoon while for the seawater it was 288 the samples located in the eastern and north eastern portion of the study area had cl br ratio between 75 and 188 and this ratio corresponds to that of the seawater the cl br ratio clearly demarcates the saline water intruded regions and the remnants of the seawater are still present in the aquifer material upto 20 km inland cl br ratio with distance from the coast plot also confirms that 19 20 km inland has been intruded and the ratio tends to decrease beyond 20 km distance the study provides baseline information on the north tamilnadu coastal aquifer and stresses that bromide parameter should be analysed for all samples in the coastal regions this study also emphasis that cl br ratio along with an integrated approach involving scientific investigation can be used a general panacea for identifying the sources of pollution and for solving untraceable questions in the hydrogeology declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

system gis software and a decision making method were applied as the first step the limitations that affect the establishment of the subsurface dam were identified using eliminating criteria by the boolean logic regarding the second step the most appropriate axis was determined for subsurface dam construction in each of the limits the analytical hierarchy process ahp was applied according to the evaluation criteria in this study the aim of using ahp was to weigh and prioritize the criteria of the groundwater dam for recognizing appropriate sites among various places and regarding the subsurface dam construction ahp was conducted using a hierarchy process for finding the most suitable sites in the third stage of the decision making method finally among the ten appropriate sites

establishment graphical abstract image 1 keywords subsurface dam hybrid decision making method geographic information system analytical hierarchy process edas topsis1 1 introduction globally water shortage is considered as a future issue danilenko et al 2010 thus regarding the speedy progress of agriculture and industry and population growth finding new water resources or exploring more operative techniques for water management is a vital and crucial issue in this regard groundwater can be a useful solution even though it needs comprehensive management approaches in hydro drought regions using an appropriate water management system is vital for local governments because of the low level of annual rainfall shahraki 2019 the exploitation of water focused on groundwater resources which lack in stability in semi arid and arid areas of expanding deserts ouerdachi et al 2012 furthermore it is less probable that the sustainable use of groundwater resources could be sustained mahmoud and alazba 2014 currently the structures of subsurface dams are suitably featured regarding both efficacy and implication cavalicanti and de resende 2001 nilsson 1988 the subsurface dam approach is a simple and operational way for collecting and storing water in semi arid and arid areas as well due to the increasing need for water in the semi arid areas proper conservation and the use of groundwater resources is essential it is important to use water storage methods by controlling groundwater in these areas in the areas which have suitable conditions the construction of underground dams can be one of the desirable options by applying this method the river underside flows have been diked by a dam that comprises a limited groundwater substrate in an alluvial fountain of river bed nilsson 1988 some areas including kajbid balaqly watershed in garmeh city have the potential of constructing these underground structures the reasons for choosing kajbid balaqly watershed for identification of subsurface dams are water shortage in low water seasons the existence of ranchers and farmers in need of water reducing the cost of water supply in low water seasons in the present study the key criteria of evaluation i e water reservoir axis and socio economic conditions were considered in the highest range meanwhile incidental criteria and placing indicators were in the other categories of ahp thus suitable sites were prioritized for subsurface dam establishment based on mcdm ahp is among the most perfectly designed techniques ahp classifies the pre selection of suitable sites along with subsurface dams in dry regions this procedure includes various choices in terms of the decision making process and can analyze the sensitivity of criteria and sub criteria raju et al 2006 regarding the wide usability of decision making methods various approaches are used to rank the most appropriate places for subsurface dams especially either developed or developing however in the present study the method of ahp was used because of the high accuracy along with the simplification of analysis it could also be blended into local experts ideas remarkably in the study of natural resources using local experts ideas is one of the most important factors the reason is that they always fill the questionnaires with the most valid scores and have adequate data on the elimination of cumbrous resources based on scientific information and environmental circumstances the experts who had been selected were native natural resource staffs from the garmeh city with sufficient information about the identification of subsurface dam and full information about the study area additionally considering the ranking of subsurface dams and appropriate locations weights were differently assigned according to the various criteria archwichai et al 2005 2 literature review over the past few years researchers have been trying to develop decision making methods whereby they can cope with more complex decisions requirements that precisely revealed further efforts in this area motivate researchers to build upon their previously acknowledged decision making knowledge

rezaei et al 2018 a hybrid mcdm method was also properly emphasized by kharazi et al 2019 and dortaj et al 2020 for site selection in a semi arid area of iran raju et al 2006 the results of relative studies showed that using decision support systems has played a main role in determining the appropriate areas for the construction of subsurface dams and hierarchical analysis method is an appropriate tool for arranging criteria and sub criteria in the decision making structure also in this research this technique was applied to rank suitable sites the target area in the present study is a part of north khorasan province which has a semi arid climate moreover most of its watercourses are floodwater where appropriate dam establishment can solve the problem of a proper solution to underside flow collection and reservoir all over the areas properly indigenous people ranchers and farmers in this watershed benefit the most from the construction of the subsurface dams in study area regarding the subsurface dam establishment various assessments could be employed for identifying suitable sites and places in this regard the analytical hierarchy process ahp was indicated as the most proper technique for the evaluation and analysis of locative and non locative mcdm forzieri et al 2008 since ahp has applicable mathematical properties it has been widely used by lots of researchers and the required input data could be easily determined by this method rajesh and malliga 2013 using this technique the interrelations between weights criteria alternatives and goals are presented in a

keshavarzghorabaee et al 2015 based on mcdm the edas approach determines the optimal solution based on the maximum distance from the negative ideal along with the minimum solution by employing the positive ideal nonetheless the best alternative in the method of edas appears to be considering the distance from average solution av the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis is a common and simple method for prioritization it selects alternatives based on the farthest distance from the negative ideal choice and the shortest distance from the positive ideal choice at the same time hwang and masud 2012 the decision expert dex approach was employed by using a leading computer program tool named dexi bohanec et al 2008 the method of dex has progressively become a promising model in the natural resource sustainability analysis the reason is that this method can solve complex decision problems requiring large models and induction of some alternatives

to choose a subsurface water drainage structure which controls and stores the water flow in arid regions was reviewed as a next step some criteria affecting the decision making procedure were considered regarding identifying the most appropriate sites at the third step ahp was used to rank ten various places regarding different aspects such as social technical environmental and economic issues regarding the fourth step cross comparison was drawn by using dex edas and topsis among the appropriate sites the software packages employed in this study include gis version 10 8 dexi version 5 04 and expert choice version 11 0 to combine and prioritize necessary information respectively the algorithms of topsis and edas methods were calculated using microsoft excel version 2019 finally among the ten appropriate sites a mutual comparison was drawn by using decision expert dex evaluation based on distance from average solution edas and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis 3 2 1 ahp method after ranking the areas properly in descending order mcdm then chooses the most precedent and best choice according to ahp and geographic information system gis decision making principles utilized in this study are the most know features of the mcdm saaty 1994 according to the first dissociation principle the complex problem was consequently categorized into subdivisions regarding the stated criteria solving the structure as well as the problem of decision making tree shaping in this order according to the 2nd principle the criteria were mutually compared and weighed saaty 1980 table 1 shows the compared criteria calculated by saaty 1980 2000 in this step the priority of choices is sorted out according to the criteria kheirkhahzarkesh 2008 the development of the comparison matrix in the main stage is belonged to each component of the hierarchy process estimating incompatibility rate ir of decision making in each of the hierarchical weight comparing categories the vector method is generally used to deliver weights of parameters derived from a mutually comparing matrix in the above mentioned technique calculation of weights w is assigned to the course of these steps the calculation of the mutual comparison matrix matrix a is determined according to the assignment of matrix a λ i in which λ is a particular amount to matrix a next the determinant of matrix a λ i is calculated and equated to 0 to deliver the quantity of λmax that is named the maximal value of λ and this value is numbered in equation a λmaxi w 0 so that it calculates w from the equation ishizaka and labib 2009 ying et al 2007 regarding the weight calculation saaty 1994 proved a theory that makes it easier therefore a reverse and positive matrix that resembles a mutual comparing matrix vector is obtained from equation 1 1 w lim k e a k e t e a k et 1 1 1 1 and et is the transposed matrix of matrix e incompatibility indicator of i i should be first calculated via equation 2 so that it provides total ir 2 i i λ m a x n n 1 in this equation n is either the dimensions of matrix a or the number of criteria also λ m a x is determined as the specific maximal value of lambda ir is reached via equation 3 ishizaka and labib 2009 malczewski 2006 marinoni 2004 saaty 2000 3 i r i i i i r in this equation i i r is a random indicator that is dependent on comprehension see table 2 malczewski 2006 if equation 3 is 1 ir will thus have a desirable incompatibility rate in comparison to the mutual comparisons otherwise this rate will show an inconsistent judgment ishizaka and labib 2009 malczewski 2006 marinoni 2004 saaty 2000 3 2 2 dexi method the dex technique was first introduced by a research team directed by bohanec bratko and rajkovic according to a simple principle dex decomposes a decision problem into less complicated and smaller sub problems using a hierarchy of attributes bohanec et al 2013 dexi software is a decision support system based on the feature of the dex method bergez 2013 bohanec et al 2013 craheix et al 2015 it employs qualitative variables rather than quantitative ones as well as decision rules instead of numerical functions to aggregate attributes bohanec et al 2017 dexi also considers the hierarchy of the derived indicators in this model the probable qualitative indicators are identified by their scales names and descriptions these discrete values are presented in words instead of numbers such as low medium and high furthermore a series of quantitative values can be associated with some qualitative modes basic indicators are made by the model s inputs pelzer et al 2012 3 2 3 topsis technique in topsis n indices assess m options and problems are able to be set as a geometric system which resulted by m points in an n dimensional space the topsis procedure is as follows step 0 determining the decision matrix 4 x x 11 x 1 n x m 1 x m n where x shows the decision matrix and x i j indicates the numerical value from the i t h option with the j t h index in this matrix the indices with positive and negative desirables are the profit and cost indices respectively step 1 normalization 5 v v 11 v 1 n v m 1 v m n 6 v i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 where v i j and v in the respective order indicate the normalized matrix s entries and the normal matrix step 2 weighing the normalized matrix as normalized matrix v is of dimension m n weighing is done via a diagonal matrix n n with the criteria weight w i s is determined from the previous step as the key diagonal entries of the matrix next the weighed normal matrix is obtained by multiplying the normal matrix by the diagonal weight matrix 7 w v w 1 0 0 w n w 11 w 1 n w n 1 w n n step 3 determining the solutions of the negative and positive ideals 8 j is for profit index j j 1 2 n 9 j is for cost index j j 1 2 n 10 a max i w i j j ε j min i w i j j ε j i 1 2 m i a 1 a 2 a j a n 11 a min i w i j j ε j max i w i j j ε j i 1 2 m a 1 a 2 a j a n step 4 determining the distances in this step by using the euclidean method the distance between n dimensional points can be obtained from positive and negative ideal options 12 s i j 1 n w i j a j 2 i 1 2 3 m 13 s i j 1 n w i j a j 2 i 1 2 3 m step 5 calculating the relative proximity to the ideal solution 14 c i s i s i s i i 1 2 3 m 0 c i 1 where w and w i j respectively indicate the normal weighted matrix and its entries a indicates the positive ideal option and a j is the j t h entry of a vector a shows the negative ideal option and a j is the j th entry of a vector s i is the i th option distance from the positive ideal option s i is the i th option distance from the negative ideal option c i is the relative proximity of the i t h option to the ideal solution therefore if the i t h option is equal to a then c i will be equal to 1 and if the i t h option is equal to a then c i will be equal to 0 this means that the smaller the distance between the option and the ideal the greater the relative proximity azimifard et al 2018 3 2 4 edas technique as mentioned earlier edas i e a new and practical method based on mcdm was first designed by an iranian researcher keshavarz ghorabaee keshavarzghorabaee et al 2015 two measures i e negative distance from average nda and positive distance from average pda are presented in the edas method nda based on lower values and pda based on

discussion dsss applied in recognizing appropriate locations for subsurface dam construction use ahp and compare dex edas and topsis in the final stage the mentioned methods are based on decision making techniques in this regard comparing the results of various methods can present the most appropriate places for the subsurface dam construction among the other locations included in the procedure the following describes the procedure in four steps step 1 limit s identification is able to construct possible subsurface dams and remove inappropriate regions by boolean logic regarding step 1 limitations possibly capable of subsurface dam construction were recognized through the elimination criteria significantly the criteria recognized through a group of infinitely existing locations eliminate the inappropriate sites and put forth those of possibly valued in step 1 step 2 regarding the limits appropriate axis identification is able to construct possible subsurface dams groundwater step 3 the assessment and prioritization of axes regarding subsurface dam construction were made using ahp kheirkhahzarkesh 2008 step 4 a comparison was drawn through edas topsis and dex methods to indicate how differently the ten sites were prioritized in our case all methods led to a slightly similar ranking as the best achieved location was prioritized first in all of them innovatively the present paper adds the dex technique at this step to improve the efficiency of recognizing proper sites for subsurface dams 4 1 boolean logic method the key eliminating criteria such as earthquake zone qanat range slope well and spring do not usually enjoy capsule in their herbaceous textures in recognizing the most appropriate locations numerous factors including the tank and flooring stones pace of flowing water and stone units of transiting groundwater routs affect hydro chemical characteristics of karst and alluvial aquifers or the impacts of stone formations on the quality of groundwater resources regarding the impacts of stone formations on the quality of water resources some pieces of information were presented in support of a water organization in north khorasan province especially considered for a semi descriptive study and added as a new effective feature in stage 1 for the finding of appropriate locations subsequently inappropriate regions regarding the impacts of stone formations on the quality of groundwater resources were scored 1 and other regions were assigned 0 in the decision making procedure at the first step the limits capable of potential subsurface dam construction were assigned by using the eliminating criteria regarding the numerous criteria which may not have established inappropriate regions were removed and also potential regions were given stated criteria were presented and transmitted to parallel environments based on information layers parallel layers were formed with a pixel size of 10 m using these criteria in agreement with boolean logic pixel perfect and zero pixels further they are inappropriate for subsurface dam establishment being factor 1 these locations were visually analyzed by converting them from raster to vector files by using gis as well as setting it on google earth additionally the polygons spotted out of reach and inopportunely by gis were removed subsequently the remaining polygons were recognized as the most appropriate locations in the first stage of the decision making procedure fig 3 4 2 recognition of appropriate axes regarding step 2 in the decision making procedure the most appropriate river floodway was determined for subsurface dam construction in each of the limits the shorter length of the axis leads to faster and lesser operation and construction additionally the most appropriate axes were short length axes with a large expansion of fountain on them kheirkhahzarkesh 2008 furthermore they have straits characteristics in a low width axis and highly expanded surface as the most suitable types of them to choose the tank surface indicator was obtained by multiplying water length and width of the river saved at the axis this length is conversely related to the slope of the river and directly proportional to the alluvium gaining from equation 24 24 l b 1 a l the length of the tank m b the alluvium thickness m a the slope of the river to complete the data set of the above equation the slope of the river was first assessed through the canal via the regional slope map aappropriate sites used at stage 2 in the identification of the appropriate sites of the kajbid balaqly watershed are shown in fig 4 4 3 axes ranking through ahp regarding step 3 in the region the average statistical information was obtained and applied to the expert choice software version 11 in this stage appropriate locations for subsurface dam construction regarding the second stage were ranked using ahp according to the indicator proportionality in the present study the four main criteria i e axis water reservoir and socio economic factors were at the top of the row while other indicators and criteria were at the bottom of the row relevantly water as one of the main criteria was categorized into the criteria of quantity and quality weighing water subdivisions are shown in table 3 the quantity plan was based on information prepared by the soil conservation service of the usa and the local water organization of north khorasan province it gained the run off amount driven from the rainfall and almost the run off mass of underside flows for each region spreading 100 km2 the information about water as a quantity criterion was prepared by a water organization in north khorasan province it was categorized into three grades using wilcox s method table 4 presents the inclusive weighing fountain subdivisions table 5 includes weighing subdivisions of dam construction and table 6 contains weighing subdivisions of socio economic factors as can be seen in the process of decision making in each plan the average assessment presented as data was applied to the expert choice and each main criterion was determined with a final value given experts idea to weigh indicators subdivisions and criteria 4 4 prioritization of the appropriate locations by comparing dex edas and topsis methods in the present paper the best locations among other appropriate locations were determined through edas topsis and dex methods for ranking goals in the final stage of the decision making accordingly drawing a comparison between edas topsis and dex leads to the alternatives that can be an ideal solution for water shortage and problems in kajbid balaqly watershed while in most recent studies five scenarios have been applied in the final stage in the first scenario all criteria had the same ranking and we applied the absolute priority to the main criterion in other scenarios furthermore other values and criteria were equal for example in scenario 2 water as one of the main criteria was given 9 and the other main criteria were assigned 1 consistent with the mutual comparing table of saaty consequently the fountain criteria axis and socio economic issues in the third fourth and fifth scenarios had absolute priorities respectively while in this paper instead of using static scenarios the results of three methods i e edas topsis and dex was compared for identifying the most appropriate locations in the final stage of the decision making instead of using static scenarios this paper compares the results of three methods e g edas topsis and dex to identify the most appropriate locations for the construction of an underground dam in the final stage of decision making in this stage the ahp prioritized 10 axes were categorized into 7 alternatives and the initial numbers were normalized subsequently the most appropriate locations attained from the methods outcomes i e dex edas and topsis were achieved regarding the 7 experts ideas as to predetermined numbers in the questionnaire therefore we placed the alternative weights in appropriate positions in gis considering the weight data for the final map of appropriate locations in dam construction the pictures of the axes were demonstrated in fig 5 then the comparison of dex edas and topsis presented that the new model demonstrated stable and reliable results indicating more details on the uncertainty of authorities the rankings and determined ranking numbers are as follows 1 the values of edas c 0 747 a 0 691 g 0 522 d 0 431 j 0 408 i 0 354 h 0 342 b 0 305 f 0 294 e 0

numerically ranked locations axis e was selected in all three methods as a location with quantitative value for the construction of a subsurface dam thus the construction of a dam in this region is less recommended than in other areas a and c axes obtained scores between 1 and 2 among 10 axes additionally these two axes can be suggested as the best ones approved by all groups concerning the locations of subsurface dam establishment 5 conclusion groundwater is considered a vital resource both in iran and worldwide groundwater reduction defined as a long term decline of water levels caused by a low average of rainfall high rate of evaporation and rainfall inconsistency are critical problems related to groundwater use thus accessing the water resources during the year needs proper administration chiefly when surface water resources are found at the most appropriate locations suggested by gis software regarding the existing stream and climatic conditions in the area of study subsurface dam construction highly affects both the balancing act and revising performance in groundwater removal applying new approaches instead of time consuming and traditional ones can accurately help save cost and time for subsurface dam location finding because of the formation of a subsurface dam reservoir between alluvial sediment pores it is difficult to get the reservoir volume and depth of alluvium which is considered as limitation of the study that was solved to some extent using gis software considering the outcomes of topsis ahp edas and dex this study indicates the better application of the decision making technique in determining the most appropriate sites for subsurface dams in the watershed area of kajbid balaqly actually in this study the comparison drawn to make differences indicates approximately the same ranks moreover the criteria and the approaches used in the study could be used in potential future works as a preliminary planning step for more detailed

operative techniques for water management is a vital and crucial issue in this regard groundwater can be a useful solution even though it needs comprehensive management approaches in hydro drought regions using an appropriate water management system is vital for local governments because of the low level of annual rainfall shahraki 2019 the exploitation of water focused on groundwater resources which lack in stability in semi arid and arid areas of expanding deserts ouerdachi et al 2012 furthermore it is less probable that the sustainable use of groundwater resources could be sustained mahmoud and alazba 2014 currently the structures of subsurface dams are suitably featured regarding both efficacy and implication cavalicanti and de resende 2001 nilsson 1988 the subsurface dam approach is a simple and operational way for collecting and storing water in semi arid and arid areas as well due to the increasing need for water in the semi arid areas proper conservation and the use of groundwater resources is essential it is important to use water storage methods by controlling groundwater in these areas in the areas which have suitable conditions the construction of underground dams can be one of the desirable options by applying this method the river underside flows have been diked by a dam that comprises a limited groundwater substrate in an alluvial fountain of river bed nilsson 1988 some areas including kajbid balaqly watershed in garmeh city have the potential of constructing these underground structures the reasons for choosing kajbid balaqly watershed for identification of subsurface dams are water shortage in low water seasons the existence of ranchers and farmers in need of water reducing the cost of water supply in low water seasons in the present study the key criteria of evaluation i e water reservoir axis and socio economic conditions were considered in the highest range meanwhile incidental criteria and placing indicators were in the other categories of ahp thus suitable sites were prioritized for subsurface dam establishment based on mcdm ahp is among the most perfectly designed techniques ahp classifies the pre selection of suitable sites along with subsurface dams in dry regions this procedure includes various choices in terms of the decision making process and can analyze the sensitivity of criteria and sub criteria raju et al 2006 regarding the wide usability of decision making methods various approaches are used to rank the most appropriate places for subsurface dams especially either developed or developing however in the present study the method of ahp was used because of the high accuracy along with the simplification of analysis it could also be blended into local experts ideas remarkably in the study of natural resources using local experts ideas is one of the most important factors the reason is that they always fill the questionnaires with the most valid scores and have adequate data on the elimination of cumbrous resources based on scientific information and environmental circumstances the experts who had been selected were native natural resource staffs from the garmeh city with sufficient information about the identification of subsurface dam and full information about the study area additionally considering the ranking of subsurface dams and appropriate locations weights were differently assigned according to the various criteria archwichai et al 2005 2 literature review over the past few years researchers have been trying to develop decision making methods whereby they can cope with more complex decisions requirements that precisely revealed further efforts in this area motivate researchers to build upon their previously acknowledged decision making knowledge and invent new algorithms for realizing the logical manner of the variable interconnections numerous methods have been designed developed and integrated into this field of research which merge various decision making approaches to establish a unique technique kahraman et al 2017 concerning the establishment and development of subsurface dams identifying appropriate sites is the most significant issue different aspects of sustainable water management were analyzed using multi criteria decision making mcdm analysis sheikhipour et al 2018 in addition different studies have been carried out regarding site selection they used various approaches such as the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp tavakoli et al 2018 boolean and fuzzy logic jamali et al 2013 evaluation based on distance from average solution edas fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution ftopsis kharazi et al 2019 and elimination and choice translating reality electre danilenko et al 2010 erbas et al 2018 utilized a gis based fuzzy multi criteria decision analysis for the optimal location of electric vehicle charging stations erbas et al 2018 and asante et al 2020 used multimoora edas for examination of the hurdles to renewable energy adoption asante et al 2020 in iran the dexi decision support system dss was used by rezai et al for the sustainability assessment of potato fields rezaei et al 2018 a hybrid mcdm method was also properly emphasized by kharazi et al 2019 and dortaj et al 2020 for site selection in a semi arid area of iran raju et al 2006 the results of relative studies showed that using decision support systems has played a main role in determining the appropriate areas for the construction of subsurface dams and hierarchical analysis method is an appropriate tool for arranging criteria and sub criteria in the decision making structure also in this research this technique was applied to rank suitable sites the target area in the present study is a part of north khorasan province which has a semi arid climate moreover most of its watercourses are floodwater where appropriate dam establishment can solve the problem of a proper solution to underside flow collection and reservoir all over the areas properly indigenous people ranchers and farmers in this watershed benefit the most from the construction of the subsurface dams in study area regarding the subsurface dam establishment various assessments could be employed for identifying suitable sites and places in this regard the analytical hierarchy process ahp was indicated as the most proper technique for the evaluation and analysis of locative and non locative mcdm forzieri et al 2008 since ahp has applicable mathematical properties it has been widely used by lots of researchers and the required input data could be easily determined by this method rajesh and malliga 2013 using this technique the interrelations between weights criteria alternatives and goals are presented in a hierarchy structure and assessed based on their importance jagtap and bewoor 2017 receiving a vast amount of data in a decision making support system results in delivering lots of solutions mainly designed to overcome the current problems klosterman 1997 the decision making process can be affected by personal judgments and preferences in this regard model aggregation can be eased by a hierarchy structure in various layers forman and peniwati 1998 accordingly ahp is extensively applied for decision making on the basis of the various ideas of several groups of decision makers managers owners ecologists stakeholders and the public can have definite or similar aims singh and nachtnebel 2016 the edas method was first designed by an iranian researcher keshavarz ghorabaee 2015 keshavarzghorabaee et al 2015 based on mcdm the edas approach determines the optimal solution based on the maximum distance from the negative ideal along with the minimum solution by employing the positive ideal nonetheless the best alternative in the method of edas appears to be considering the distance from average solution av the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis is a common and simple method for prioritization it selects alternatives based on the farthest distance from the negative ideal choice and the shortest distance from the positive ideal choice at the same time hwang and masud 2012 the decision expert dex approach was employed by using a leading computer program tool named dexi bohanec et al 2008 the method of dex has progressively become a promising model in the natural resource sustainability analysis the reason is that this method can solve complex decision problems requiring large models and induction of some alternatives gendron et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 čmaksimović et al 2017 trdin and bohanec 2017 3 methods 3 1 study area the intended area is located in north khorasan province iran it borders on a 16 806 ha region with the coordinates of 56 11 36 to 56 25 26 northern width and 37 10 36 to 37 17 32 eastern lengths concerning station climates based on demarten and emberger s study the intended region has a dry cold climate fig 1 further numerous syllabic flows exist all over the side hills of the region regarding climatic conditions establishing a subsurface dam in this location can ease the aridity problem the most important data of this paper are associated with geology topography and qanat and groundwater resources 3 2 determining the evaluation criteria in the present study as the first step the need to choose a subsurface water drainage structure which controls and stores the water flow in arid regions was reviewed as a next step some criteria affecting the decision making procedure were considered regarding identifying the most appropriate sites at the third step ahp was used to rank ten various places regarding different aspects such as social technical environmental and economic issues regarding the fourth step cross comparison was drawn by using dex edas and topsis among the appropriate sites the software packages employed in this study include gis version 10 8 dexi version 5 04 and expert choice version 11 0 to combine and prioritize necessary information respectively the algorithms of topsis and edas methods were calculated using microsoft excel version 2019 finally among the ten appropriate sites a mutual comparison was drawn by using decision expert dex evaluation based on distance from average solution edas and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis 3 2 1 ahp method after ranking the areas properly in descending order mcdm then chooses the most precedent and best choice according to ahp and geographic information system gis decision making principles utilized in this study are the most know features of the mcdm saaty 1994 according to the first dissociation principle the complex problem was consequently categorized into subdivisions regarding the stated criteria solving the structure as well as the problem of decision making tree shaping in this order according to the 2nd principle the criteria were mutually compared and weighed saaty 1980 table 1 shows the compared criteria calculated by saaty 1980 2000 in this step the priority of choices is sorted out according to the criteria kheirkhahzarkesh 2008 the development of the comparison matrix in the main stage is belonged to each component of the hierarchy process estimating incompatibility rate ir of decision making in each of the hierarchical weight comparing categories the vector method is generally used to deliver weights of parameters derived from a mutually comparing matrix in the above mentioned technique calculation of weights w is assigned to the course of these steps the calculation of the mutual comparison matrix matrix a is determined according to the assignment of matrix a λ i in which λ is a particular amount to matrix a next the determinant of matrix a λ i is calculated and equated to 0 to deliver the quantity of λmax that is named the maximal value of λ and this value is numbered in equation a λmaxi w 0 so that it calculates w from the equation ishizaka and labib 2009 ying et al 2007 regarding the weight calculation saaty 1994 proved a theory that makes it easier therefore a reverse and positive matrix that resembles a mutual comparing matrix vector is obtained from equation 1 1 w lim k e a k e t e a k et 1 1 1 1 and et is the transposed matrix of matrix e incompatibility indicator of i i should be first calculated via equation 2 so that it provides total ir 2 i i λ m a x n n 1 in this equation n is either the dimensions of matrix a or the number of criteria also λ m a x is determined as the specific maximal value of lambda ir is reached via equation 3 ishizaka and labib 2009 malczewski 2006 marinoni 2004 saaty 2000 3 i r i i i i r in this equation i i r is a random indicator that is dependent on comprehension see table 2 malczewski 2006 if equation 3 is 1 ir will thus have a desirable incompatibility rate in comparison to the mutual comparisons otherwise this rate will show an inconsistent judgment ishizaka and labib 2009 malczewski 2006 marinoni 2004 saaty 2000 3 2 2 dexi method the dex technique was first introduced by a research team directed by bohanec bratko and rajkovic according to a simple principle dex decomposes a decision problem into less complicated and smaller sub problems using a hierarchy of attributes bohanec et al 2013 dexi software is a decision support system based on the feature of the dex method bergez 2013 bohanec et al 2013 craheix et al 2015 it employs qualitative variables rather than quantitative ones as well as decision rules instead of numerical functions to aggregate attributes bohanec et al 2017 dexi also considers the hierarchy of the derived indicators in this model the probable qualitative indicators are identified by their scales names and descriptions these discrete values are presented in words instead of numbers such as low medium and high furthermore a series of quantitative values can be associated with some qualitative modes basic indicators are made by the model s inputs pelzer et al 2012 3 2 3 topsis technique in topsis n indices assess m options and problems are able to be set as a geometric system which resulted by m points in an n dimensional space the topsis procedure is as follows step 0 determining the decision matrix 4 x x 11 x 1 n x m 1 x m n where x shows the decision matrix and x i j indicates the numerical value from the i t h option with the j t h index in this matrix the indices with positive and negative desirables are the profit and cost indices respectively step 1 normalization 5 v v 11 v 1 n v m 1 v m n 6 v i j x i j i 1 m x i j 2 where v i j and v in the respective order indicate the normalized matrix s entries and the normal matrix step 2 weighing the normalized matrix as normalized matrix v is of dimension m n weighing is done via a diagonal matrix n n with the criteria weight w i s is determined from the previous step as the key diagonal entries of the matrix next the weighed normal matrix is obtained by multiplying the normal matrix by the diagonal weight matrix 7 w v w 1 0 0 w n w 11 w 1 n w n 1 w n n step 3 determining the solutions of the negative and positive ideals 8 j is for profit index j j 1 2 n 9 j is for cost index j j 1 2 n 10 a max i w i j j ε j min i w i j j ε j i 1 2 m i a 1 a 2 a j a n 11 a min i w i j j ε j max i w i j j ε j i 1 2 m a 1 a 2 a j a n step 4 determining the distances in this step by using the euclidean method the distance between n dimensional points can be obtained from positive and negative ideal options 12 s i j 1 n w i j a j 2 i 1 2 3 m 13 s i j 1 n w i j a j 2 i 1 2 3 m step 5 calculating the relative proximity to the ideal solution 14 c i s i s i s i i 1 2 3 m 0 c i 1 where w and w i j respectively indicate the normal weighted matrix and its entries a indicates the positive ideal option and a j is the j t h entry of a vector a shows the negative ideal option and a j is the j th entry of a vector s i is the i th option distance from the positive ideal option s i is the i th option distance from the negative ideal option c i is the relative proximity of the i t h option to the ideal solution therefore if the i t h option is equal to a then c i will be equal to 1 and if the i t h option is equal to a then c i will be equal to 0 this means that the smaller the distance between the option and the ideal the greater the relative proximity azimifard et al 2018 3 2 4 edas technique as mentioned earlier edas i e a new and practical method based on mcdm was first designed by an iranian researcher keshavarz ghorabaee keshavarzghorabaee et al 2015 two measures i e negative distance from average nda and positive distance from average pda are presented in the edas method nda based on lower values and pda based on higher values can present the optimal solution outperforming the average solution the edas method steps are as follows step 0 choosing the most appropriate attribute describing decision alternatives

the weight of criterion j t h step 2 based on the characteristics of edas and regarding all criteria the average solution must be obtained as follows 16 av j i 1 n x i j n step 3 the matrices of nda

discussion dsss applied in recognizing appropriate locations for subsurface dam construction use ahp and compare dex edas and topsis in the final stage the mentioned methods are based on decision making techniques in this regard comparing the results of various methods can present the most appropriate places for the subsurface dam construction among the other locations included in the procedure the following describes the procedure in four steps step 1 limit s identification is able to construct possible subsurface dams and remove inappropriate regions by boolean logic regarding step 1 limitations possibly capable of subsurface dam construction were recognized through the elimination criteria significantly the criteria recognized through a group of infinitely existing locations eliminate the inappropriate sites and put forth those of possibly valued in step 1 step 2 regarding the limits appropriate axis identification is able to construct possible subsurface dams groundwater step 3 the assessment and prioritization of axes regarding subsurface dam construction were made using ahp kheirkhahzarkesh 2008 step 4 a comparison was drawn through edas topsis and dex methods to indicate how differently the ten sites were prioritized in our case all methods led to a slightly similar ranking as the best achieved location was prioritized first in all of them innovatively the present paper adds the dex technique at this step to improve the efficiency of recognizing proper sites for subsurface dams 4 1 boolean logic method the key eliminating criteria such as earthquake zone qanat range slope well and spring do not usually enjoy capsule in their herbaceous textures in recognizing the most appropriate locations numerous factors including the tank and flooring stones pace of flowing water and stone units of transiting groundwater routs affect hydro chemical characteristics of karst and alluvial aquifers or the impacts of stone formations on the quality of groundwater resources regarding the impacts of stone formations on the quality of water resources some pieces of information were presented in support of a water organization in north khorasan province especially considered for a semi descriptive study and added as a new effective feature in stage 1 for the finding of appropriate locations subsequently inappropriate regions regarding the impacts of stone formations on the quality of groundwater resources were scored 1 and other regions were assigned 0 in the decision making procedure at the first step the limits capable of potential subsurface dam construction were assigned by using the eliminating criteria regarding the numerous criteria which may not have established inappropriate regions were removed and also potential regions were given stated criteria were presented and transmitted to parallel environments based on information layers parallel layers were formed with a pixel size of 10 m using these criteria in agreement with boolean logic pixel perfect and zero pixels further they are inappropriate for subsurface dam establishment being factor 1 these locations were visually analyzed by converting them from raster to vector files by using gis as well as setting it on google earth additionally the polygons spotted out of reach and inopportunely by gis were removed subsequently the remaining polygons were recognized as the most appropriate locations in the first stage of the decision making procedure fig 3 4 2 recognition of appropriate axes regarding step 2 in the decision making procedure the most appropriate river floodway was determined for subsurface dam construction in each of the limits the shorter length of the axis leads to faster and lesser operation and construction additionally the most appropriate axes were short length axes with a large expansion of fountain on them kheirkhahzarkesh 2008 furthermore they have straits characteristics in a low width axis and highly expanded surface as the most suitable types of them to choose the tank surface indicator was obtained by multiplying water length and width of the river saved at the axis this length is conversely related to the slope of the river and directly proportional to the alluvium gaining from equation 24 24 l b 1 a l the length of the tank m b the alluvium thickness m a the slope of the river to complete the data set of the above equation the slope of the river was first assessed through the canal via the regional slope map aappropriate sites used at stage 2 in the identification of the appropriate sites of the kajbid balaqly watershed are shown in fig 4 4 3 axes ranking through ahp regarding step 3 in the region the average statistical information was obtained and applied to the expert choice software version 11 in this stage appropriate locations for subsurface dam construction regarding the second stage were ranked using ahp according to the indicator proportionality in the present study the four main criteria i e axis water reservoir and socio economic factors were at the top of the row while other indicators and criteria were at the bottom of the row relevantly water as one of the main criteria was categorized into the criteria of quantity and quality weighing water subdivisions are shown in table 3 the quantity plan was based on information prepared by the soil conservation service of the usa and the local water organization of north khorasan province it gained the run off amount driven from the rainfall and almost the run off mass of underside flows for each region spreading 100 km2 the information about water as a quantity criterion was prepared by a water organization in north khorasan province it was categorized into three grades using wilcox s method table 4 presents the inclusive weighing fountain subdivisions table 5 includes weighing subdivisions of dam construction and table 6 contains weighing subdivisions of socio economic factors as can be seen in the process of decision making in each plan the average assessment presented as data was applied to the expert choice and each main criterion was determined with a final value given experts idea to weigh indicators subdivisions and criteria 4 4 prioritization of the appropriate locations by comparing dex edas and topsis methods in the present paper the best locations among other appropriate locations were determined through edas topsis and dex methods for ranking goals in the final stage of the decision making accordingly drawing a comparison between edas topsis and dex leads to the alternatives that can be an ideal solution for water shortage and problems in kajbid balaqly watershed while in most recent studies five scenarios have been applied in the final stage in the first scenario all criteria had the same ranking and we applied the absolute priority to the main criterion in other scenarios furthermore other values and criteria were equal for example in scenario 2 water as one of the main criteria was given 9 and the other main criteria were assigned 1 consistent with the mutual comparing table of saaty consequently the fountain criteria axis and socio economic issues in the third fourth and fifth scenarios had absolute priorities respectively while in this paper instead of using static scenarios the results of three methods i e edas topsis and dex was compared for identifying the most appropriate locations in the final stage of the decision making instead of using static scenarios this paper compares the results of three methods e g edas topsis and dex to identify the most appropriate locations for the construction of an underground dam in the final stage of decision making in this stage the ahp prioritized 10 axes were categorized into 7 alternatives and the initial numbers were normalized subsequently the most appropriate locations attained from the methods outcomes i e dex edas and topsis were achieved regarding the 7 experts ideas as to predetermined numbers in the questionnaire therefore we placed the alternative weights in appropriate positions in gis considering the weight data for the final map of appropriate locations in dam construction the pictures of the axes were demonstrated in fig 5 then the comparison of dex edas and topsis presented that the new model demonstrated stable and reliable results indicating more details on the uncertainty of authorities the rankings and determined ranking numbers are as follows 1 the values of edas c 0 747 a 0 691 g 0 522 d 0 431 j 0 408 i 0 354 h 0 342 b 0 305 f 0 294 e 0 231 2 topsis values a 0 574 c 0 483 d 0 443 g 0 439 b 0 429 h 0 416 i 0 320 f 0 311 e 0 298 j 0 264 3 dexi values a high c high d high g high j medium i medium h medium f low e low j low based on the numerically ranked locations axis e was selected in all three methods as a location with quantitative value for the construction of a subsurface dam thus the construction of a dam in this region is less recommended than in other areas a and c axes obtained scores between 1 and 2 among 10 axes additionally these two axes can be suggested as the best ones approved by all groups concerning the locations of subsurface dam establishment 5 conclusion groundwater is considered a vital resource both in iran and worldwide groundwater reduction defined as a long term decline of water levels caused by a low average of rainfall high rate of evaporation and rainfall inconsistency are critical problems related to groundwater use thus accessing the water resources during the year needs proper administration chiefly when surface water resources are found at the most appropriate locations suggested by gis software regarding the existing stream and climatic conditions in the area of study subsurface dam construction highly affects both the balancing act and revising performance in groundwater removal applying new approaches instead of time consuming and traditional ones can accurately help save cost and time for subsurface dam location finding because of the formation of a subsurface dam reservoir between alluvial sediment pores it is difficult to get the reservoir volume and depth of alluvium which is considered as limitation of the study that was solved to some extent using gis software considering the outcomes of topsis ahp edas and dex this study indicates the better application of the decision making technique in determining the most appropriate sites for subsurface dams in the watershed area of kajbid balaqly actually in this study the comparison drawn to make differences indicates approximately the same ranks moreover the criteria and the approaches used in the study could be used in potential future works as a preliminary planning step for more detailed studies in the construction of subsurface dams in the hydro drought region around the world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
