3600,actual evapotranspiration et a has significantly increased under recent climate and vegetation changes discriminating the primary driver of et a variation would improve our knowledge of the interaction between regional hydrological and ecological systems in this study a reliable et a dataset was obtained by validating three et a products from different sources with in situ observations we modified the elasticity coefficient method using partial correlation and compared it with the traditional regression based method in estimating et a variation in northwest china nwc on the basis of the magnitude and the sensitivity of et a variation results revealed that annual et a significantly increased 2 32 mm yr p 0 05 in nwc over 1982 2015 with over 75 of the vegetated area showing an increasing trend robust in capturing spatial variation patterns in et a the partial correlation coefficient based elasticity method was able to explain 83 of the annual variation in et a precipitation temperature and ndvi were the most important factors controlling the increase in annual et a from 1982 to 2015 regionally precipitation was the dominant factor and contributed 73 to the variation of annual et a in the vegetated nwc however the contribution rates of precipitation varied across the different land cover types and ranged from 31 in irrigated cropland to 81 in the steppe potential uncertainty in the attribution of causative factors could arise in selecting the separation method and potential driving factors establishing a reliable relationship between et a and potential driving factors should be confirmed with observations the present study s results can guide sustainable water resources management and ecological restoration in water limited regions keywords climate change vegetation dynamics actual evapotranspiration separation attribution northwest china 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration et a is a vital component of regional water and energy cycles douville et al 2013 jung et al 2010 eta closely links a series of land surface processes with ecosystem functions liu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 and can reflect complex interactions between climate vegetation soil and terrain wang et al 2014 studies of regional et a provide the basis for evaluating regional water resources guiding agricultural irrigation and performing ecological restoration however climate change has disturbed the state of regional water and energy cycles zhang et al 2015 and greatly altered various eco hydrological processes for example changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation directly alter the magnitude and spatial temporal distribution of runoff teuling et al 2019 likewise variation in radiation and temperature acting on the underlying soil surface leads to changes in land surface et a li et al 2013 tian et al 2013 this in turn alters soil moisture and the growth of vegetation zhou et al 2019 thereby altering the structure and function of regional ecosystems and their attending hydrological processes given the frequent lack of a reliable et a dataset the extent to which changes in climate and vegetation contribute to variation in et a is still unclear however to achieve rational science based allocation and management of water resources one must fully understand the mechanisms of et a variation under environmental change and separating the impacts of various climate and vegetation factors on et a variation can not only improve our knowledge of a regional water budget but also enhance our understanding of interactions between hydrology and ecosystem functions zhang et al 2020 several studies have investigated the impacts of changes in climate and vegetation on variation in et a bai et al 2019 lei et al 2018 ma et al 2019b ning et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 physically or statistically based methods can be employed to discriminate the impact of climate and vegetation factors on et a variation characterized by complicated model structures requiring a wide range of parameter measures estimates and relying heavily on embedded hypotheses and model structures physically based methods are designed to consider interactions between the atmosphere vegetation and soil bai et al 2019 the individual impact of each driving factor can be estimated by using de trended time series to force the physically based model the difference of et a forced by de trended and original time series of the given factor was regarded as the contribution of the given factor however many relevant parameters are not available in data scarce regions such as nwc or suffer from great uncertainty due to limited observations statistically based elasticity ning et al 2020 variance analysis wu et al 2020 and regression methods xie et al 2020 are simple and effective in attributing variations in et a to climate or vegetation variables li et al 2021c liu et al 2020b zhang et al 2018 potential driving factors are assumed to be independent from one another and the sum of individual contributions needs to concur with the observed variation in et a zhang et al 2020 compared the results of physically and statistically based methods of attributing variation in et a and found them to be consistent for physically based methods the driving factors are determinate however this is not the case for statistically based methods when using a statistically based method questions remain as to how to select the full complement of driving factors influencing et a and avoiding collinearity among these factors to address these issues some researchers have built empirical models to select potential driving factors and to test their ability to explain et a pei et al 2017 xie et al 2020 yu et al 2020 for example the budyko hypothesis has been widely used to explore the relationship of et a with water supply precipitation p atmospheric water demand potential evapotranspiration et p and underlying surface properties e g vegetation li et al 2021b wang et al 2018 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 regression methods have been applied to the selection of explanatory variables and to avoid collinearity among variables for example pei et al 2017 used a generalized linear model glm to investigate the contribution of climate change and vegetation growth to seasonal et a changes in the yellow river basin xie et al 2020 applied a multiple linear regression method to explore the impact of climate change elevated atmospheric co2 and human activities on et a variation in china s three north region yu et al 2020 developed a stepwise regression equation to detect the effects of climate variability and landscape pattern change on et a dynamics for a grassland situated in xilingol china in our study we adopted a partial correlation coefficient instead of a correlation coefficient to calculate an elasticity coefficient in order to overcome the collinearity issue among driving factors featuring a mountain basin system northwest china is a typical water limited region yang et al 2020a where ecosystems are very fragile and extremely sensitive to climate change while persistent attempts have been made to investigate the causes of et a variation in nwc qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2020 xu et al 2020 the potential driving mechanisms remain unclear due to the lack of reliable et a datasets and complicated interactions among climate ecosystem and topography this limits our understanding of local eco hydrology and thus hampers the development of effective ecological restoration practices under climate change accordingly the objectives of this study were to i obtain a reliable et a dataset by validating et a values drawn from remote sensing sources with site observations i e ground truth ii detect inter annual variations of et a climate variables and vegetation indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi iii compare variations in et a estimated by elasticity coefficient based and regression based methods and iv explore the contribution of climate and vegetation changes to variation in et a the results of this study can guide future sustainable water resources management and ecological restoration in water limited regions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area spanning 2 23 106 km2 lat 73 48 106 95 e long 34 44 47 93 n northwest china nwc accounts for almost one quarter of china s land area shi et al 2007 its complex topography of intertwined mountains oases and deserts is structured with elevations ranging from 155 m to 7464 m yang et al 2020a under continental arid climatic conditions dominated by northern hemisphere westerlies feng et al 2019 the region s mean annual precipitation generally ranges between 100 and 200 mm yr 1 but can be as low as 50 mm yr 1 in the tarim and qaidam basins and exceed 600 mm yr 1 in the tianshan and qilian mountains yin et al 2019 temperatures in the region can exceed 40 c in summer and drop below 30 c in winter as a typical arid area with a clear mismatch between large water demand and limited water supply the nwc region houses very fragile ecosystems as precipitation is extremely scarce in the plain irrigation is normally the only water source for oasis agro ecosystems accordingly nwc is amongst those regions most sensitive to current climate change yang et al 2020a the dominant landscape is desert which accounts for 47 of the study area followed by steppe 19 and meadow 18 mainly situated in oases where crops are sustained by irrigation cropland only accounts for 6 of the study area fig 1

multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa and the current reanalysis of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim the ndvi3g data was obtained from the global inventory modelling and mapping studies gimms dataset at nasa gsfc https glam1 gsfc nasa gov pinzon and tucker 2014 extending from 1981 to 2015 the ndvi3g dataset is a high quality and improved 8 km

drawn from the global ndvi3g dataset and its annual average was calculated from the original semi monthly values using a nearest neighbour resampling method these datasets offered at different spatial resolutions between 1982 and 2015 were all interpolated to 0 1 to maintain spatial consistency 2 3 variation estimation trends in et a ndvi and climate variables were estimated using the sen slope method sen 1968 differing slightly from the slope obtained by simple linear regression the sen slope method is a non parametric method and can provide a more reliable slope of tendency the statistical significance p 0 05 of the sen slope trend was assessed using the non parametric rank based mann kendall m k statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 this distribution free statistic test depends on observation ranks rather than numerical values ghosh 2018 hamed 2008 2 4 regression based method for attributing variation in et a the et a was assumed to be a function of climate variables and ndvi with its expression quantified through multiple linear regression we considered temperature t precipitation p downward solar radiation sr wind speed ws and specific humidity sh as independent climatic variables the regression model could accordingly be expressed as xie et al 2020 1 et a a 1 p a 2 t a 3 s r a 4 w s a 5 s h a 6 n d v i b where a is the partial regression coefficient of the independent variables which is calculated through a least square estimation xie et al 2020 and b is a residual term the first derivative of eq 1 with respect to time t can be expressed as 2 d et a dt a 1 dp dt a 2 dt dt a 3 dsr dt a 4 dws dt a 5 dsh dt a 6 dndvi dt db dt it represents the actual contributions of climate and vegetation changes to et a variation trend this can be more simply expressed as 3 d et a dt c p c t c s r c w s c s h c n d v i where c p c t c s r c w s c s h and c n d v i represent the contribution of precipitation p temperature t downward solar radiation sr wind speed ws specific humidity sh and ndvi to et a variation respectively in order to easily compare the relative importance of the contributions of different driving factors we employed the relative contribution r i of different driving factors i to variation in et a it is expressed as wang et al 2020 4 r i c i c p c t c s r c w s c s h c n d v i 100 where r i is the relative contribution of factor i to variation in et a and c i is the actual contribution of factor i to variation in et a and i represents the driving factor in this study such as p t sr ws sh and ndvi 2 5 elastic based method for attributing et a variation elastic based method can be used to attribute the contribution of different driving factors to et a variation wang et al 2020 for a function y f x whose deterministic expression is unknown x represents a vector with n variables its first order partial differential equation can accordingly be expressed as li et al 2021c 5 dy y x i d x i i 1 2 n dividing both sides by the mean value of y in eq 5 it can be expressed as 6 dy y y x i d x i y multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the mean value of x i and rearranging in eq 6 we can obtain the form of the elasticity coefficient method which can be expressed as wang et al 2020 7 dy y y x i x i y d x i x i defining the elasticity coefficient ε is expressed as 8 ε i y x i x i y therefore combining the elasticity coefficient ε and dividing both sides by dt eq 7 can be further simplified as 9 dy dt ε i d x i x i y dt eq 9 is the elasticity based equation for estimating the contribution of driving factor x i to the variation of y considering the driving factors and target variable in this study the contributions of climate and vegetation variables to the variation in et a can then be expressed as wang et al 2020 10 d et a dt ε p dp p ε t dt t ε sr dsr sr ε ws dws ws ε sh dsh sh ε ndvi dndvi ndvi eta dt comparing eq 10 with the regression method eq 2 in the form of the contribution estimation for the same driving factor the partial regression coefficient a in eq 2 can then be theoretically expressed as 11 a i ε i eta x i where x i represents the mean of driving factor such as p t sr ws sh and ndvi in an analogous approach to calculating an estimator of streamflow s climatic elasticity ε i can also be regarded as the linear regression coefficient between x i x i and e t a eta using the least squares estimator the elasticity coefficient can be estimated as follows zheng et al 2009 12 ε x e t a x eta x i x e t a eta x i x 2 ρ x e t a c eta c x where x represents the mean of climate variables and ndvi ρ x e t a is the correlation coefficient between x and eta and c eta and c x are the coefficients of variation of et a and x respectively more detailed description regarding the derivation of the elasticity coefficient can be found in the study of zheng et al 2009 as the collinearity and interactions between different independent variables cannot be ignored xie et al 2020 we adopted the partial correlation coefficient instead of ρ x e t a and expressed it as 13 ρ x e t a y ρ x e t a ρ x y ρ y e t a 1 ρ x y 2 1 ρ y e t a 2 where ρ x e t a y is the first order partial correlation coefficient between x and et a in considering the effect of variable y ρ x e t a and ρ y e t a are the correlation coefficients between eta and x and y respectively and ρ x y is the correlation coefficient between x and y 3 results 3 1 validation of different et a products to obtain a reliable et a dataset three et a products glass gleam and cr were validated and compared by extracting the annual et a data from pixels overlapped with eddy covariance on site i e point to pixel the observed annual et a data was aggregated by daily values fig 2 table 2 all three products datasets underestimated observed et a values means µ and standard deviations σ for the glass derived et a values more closely matched observed et a values than those derived by the cr and gleam products the three et a products σ increased as the spatial resolution increased fig 2a moreover we compared the correlation between each products et a values with observed et a values fig 2b notably the sub unity regression slope 0 43 p 0 05 between gleam derived and observed et a might reflect gleam s coarse spatial resolution 0 25 as the coarser the grid data the greater the underestimation of et a bai and liu 2018 yang et al 2021 accordingly the reliability of gleam derived et a values was questionable the points of the cr derived vs observed et a scatter plot were mostly clustered around a 1 1 line and showed a regression slope of 0 61 further indicating a closer match of the cr derived dataset to observed values than the gleam dataset the glass derived et a values for the region showed a high positive correlation to the observed et a with a regression slope of 0 74 the glass derived et a products explained almost 89 of the variation in the observed data the largest among the three datasets and indicated greater reliability of the glass derived dataset compared to the gleam and cr derived datasets accordingly glass derived et a data were selected for further analysis section 3 2 3 4 3 2 variation of et a ndvi and climatic variables the spatial distribution of the mean annual glass derived et a its coefficient of variation cv σ μ temporal trends in annual et a over the period of 1982 to 2015 and the statistical significance of these trends are presented in fig 3 trend statistics for different land cover types are listed in table 3 the mean of annual et a values the associated cv and the magnitude of trends in its variation showed a strong spatial heterogeneity mean annual et a varied spatially from 67to 665 mm in the vegetated areas of the nwc fig 3a with high values occurring mainly in the mountainous regions but also in oasis regions where et a values were greatly affected by irrigation low mean annual et a values occurred predominantly in the desert areas e g tarim basin junggar basin and badain jaran desert the cv of annual et a values ranged between 0 02 and 0 57 and showed an inverse spatial pattern compared to the annual mean et a year to year trends in et a varied from 3 6 to 14 0 mm yr 1 fig 3c and its spatial pattern was consistent to the land cover types with roughly three quarters of the vegetated area showing a significant increase p 0 05 the variation trends of annual et a among all land cover types increased significantly and the proportion of the land cover areas showing a significant increased trend was above 67 increased variation in mean annual et a occurred in 96 of cropland table 3 overall the trend in annual et a from 1982 to 2015 in nwc increased by 2 32 mm yr 1 with the zone of significant variation accounting for 75 of the total vegetated area the distribution of trends in annual mean temperature precipitation solar radiation specific humidity wind speed and ndvi from 1982 to 2015 are presented in fig 4 the trend in mean annual temperature varied spatially ranging between 0 17 and 0 19 c yr 1 fig 4a almost 70 of the vegetated area showed a significant increase in temperature the trend in annual precipitation also varied spatially ranging between 3 08 and 20 30 mm yr 1 fig 4b with the zone of significant increase occupying roughly 65 of the vegetated area the trend in solar radiation i e downward short radiation varied from 0 79 to 1 43 w m 2 yr 1 with areas showing a significant decrease or increase covering 23 and 15 of the vegetated area respectively the trend in specific humidity ranged between 0 06 and 0 06 g kg yr 1 with the zone of significant increase occupying 41 of the vegetated area the trend in wind speed varied from 0 11 to 0 14 m s 1 yr 1 with the zone of significant decrease occupying 29 of the vegetated area and the zone of significant increase occupying 30 the trend in ndvi varied from 0 28 to 0 57 century 1 with a zone of significant decrease occurring in 43 of the vegetated area fig 5 and table 4 with the exception of solar radiation all of the variables investigated showed increasing trends table 4 temperature and precipitation presented increasing trends across all land cover types with the strongest and weakest positive trends for temperature occurring in the bdf 0 067 c yr 1 and sav zones 0 027 c yr 1 respectively table 5 in the case of precipitation the strongest and weakest positive trends occurred in the enf zone 5 06 mm yr 1 and shrub 1 177 mm yr 1 zones solar radiation showed a decreasing trend for meadow steppe cropland and enf but an increasing trend for sav shrub desert and bdf specific humidity showed an increasing trend for all land cover types except shrub and bdf with the strongest increasing trend occurring in the enf zone 0 014 g kg 1 yr 1 wind speed showed an increasing trend for steppe sav shrub and desert zones but a decreasing trend for meadow bdf cropland and enf finally ndvi increased for all land cover types except meadow 0 002 century 1 3 3 comparison of the separation methods in assessing the reliability of the elasticity coefficient ec based method we compared variations in annual et a estimated by the multiple linear regression method and the ec method to those obtained using either the correlation coefficient or the partial correlation coefficient fig 6 the assessment of the simulated variation in annual et a by multiple linear regression and correlation coefficient were obviously biased showing a large underestimation of high values as evidenced by a regression slope of 0 71 for the re method and a large overestimation of high values as evidenced by a regression slope of 1 32 for the ec method while a similar but lesser deviation still occurred in the estimation using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method the deviation was comparatively slight with a rational regression slope of 0 91 fig 6c the simulated variations of annual et a using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method could explain 83 of variation of annual et a trends p 0 01 the highest of all the three methods fig 6 this indicated that et a variation estimated using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method were more reliable than those obtained with re and ec methods we also compared the mean of the simulated et a trends using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method for the eight land cover types with the observed values derived by the sen slope method fig 7 the performance of the partial correlation coefficient based ec method showed very satisfactory results with a regression slope of 0 97 and explained 98 of the variation of observed et a trends therefore the partial correlation coefficient based ec method captured the variation of the annual et a trend and its output was used for attributing the contribution of climate and vegetation to this variation 3 4 contribution of climate and vegetation changes to variations in et a the actual contribution of climate and vegetation changes to the variation in et a estimated using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method are illustrated in fig 8 the contribution of temperature was between 2 8and 4 0 mm yr 1 µ 0 26 mm yr 1 fig 9 with areas of positive contribution mainly located in the eastern qilian mountains the oases of the tarim basin and south of the altai mountains negative contributions were mainly located in the mid east portions of the junggar basin and western qilian mountains as well as in the south of the qaidam basin the actual contribution of precipitation change varied from 1 5 to 5 25 mm yr 1 µ 1 59 mm yr 1 with positive contributions mainly located in the north jungger basin tianshan mountains and kunlun mountains the southern altai mountains and the western qilian mountains whereas the negative contributions were mainly located in the west and south of the tianshan mountains the south of qaidam basin and oases areas the contribution of solar radiation change varied from 2 43to 2 00 mm yr 1 µ 0 01 mm yr 1 with positive contributions in the tarim basin the western tianshan and southern qilian mountains and negative contributions located in the eastern tianshan mountains the northern qilian mountains and the western junggar basin the contribution of the specific humidity change ranged between 1 65 and 2 0 mm yr 1 µ 0 05 mm yr 1 with positive contributions occurring in the junggar basin the tianshan mountains and the alpine region of the western tarim basin the contribution of wind speed change varied between 3 8 and 3 0 mm yr 1 µ 0 04 mm yr 1 with positive contributions located mainly in the junggar basin the southern altai mountains the eastern tianshan mountains the western qilian mountains and the northern tarim basin the negative contribution was mainly located in the western tarim basin the central tianshan mountains as well as the western portion of the junggar basin and qilian mountains the contribution of ndvi change varied from 2 39 to 5 0 mm yr 1 µ 0 34 mm yr 1 with its positive contribution located in the qilian mountains the southern junggar basin and the oases areas the contribution of different driving factors to the variation in et a was the integrated reflection of their changes in magnitude and the et a s sensitivity to them yang et al 2021 the area with large contributions of a given factor to et a was the area where the given factor showed large variation in magnitude as well as high sensitivity of et a for example the positive contribution of precipitation temperature and ndvi to et a were mainly located in the area where the variation of precipitation temperature and ndvi were significantly increased such as in qilian and tianshan mountains junggar basin and the oases in tarim basin these findings were consistent with the study of li et al 2021b where most of their positive contribution areas overlapping with our study however due to the relatively higher spatial resolution in our study the spatial heterogeneity of the contribution of different driving factors was more obvious fig 10 shows the relative contribution of climate and vegetation changes to variation in et a for different land cover types the contributions of precipitation and ndvi to the variation in et a were positive for all land cover types precipitation was the dominant causative factor of variation in et a for all land cover types specific humidity contributed positively to variation of et a for steppe sav bdf cropland and enf and negatively for shrub meadow and desert solar radiation contributed positively to variation of et a for dbf cropland and enf and negatively for meadow steppe shrub and desert temperature contributed positively to variation of et a for all land cover types except for steppe and wind speed contributed positively for all land cover types except for meadow regionally precipitation was the dominant factor and contributed 1 59 mm yr 1 of et a variation in nwc fig 9 followed by ndvi and temperature the contributions of solar radiation wind speed and specific humidity to the variation of et a were limited across the entire nwc precipitation was the dominant factor 73 contributing to the increase in et a followed by ndvi and temperature at 16 and 12 respectively each contribution rate of the other three factors was 5 precipitation contributed to an increase in et a for cropland bdf shrub enf meadow desert sav and steppe with relative contributions of 31 48 52 59 71 71 76 and 81 respectively the dominant role of precipitation on et a variation for the whole region and different vegetation types fig 10 further indicates that water availability is the main stress for vegetation growth in the nwc and for cropland an ecosystem highly influenced by human activity the effects of precipitation 31 are comparable to that of temperature 28 which may be because irrigation greatly alleviates the water stress on crop growth in the region it is interesting that precipitation has lower effects 60 on deep rooted vegetation types e g bdf shrub and enf than other types which may be related to the high drought tolerance i e low sensitivity ability of these types and for the two types of grassland temperature had higher effects on et a variation of meadow 9 than that of steppe 1 which may be caused by the higher drought tolerance and higher sensitivity to heat stress of meadow as it is mainly distributed in areas with a high elevation i e lower air temperature and more precipitation i e high water availability in summary these different contribution rates also reflect the different sensitivity of vegetation response to environmental stress e g water stress and heat stress to some extent 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on variation in et a et a is regulated by several climate factors including temperature precipitation solar radiation atmospheric humidity and wind speed temperature wind speed and humidity determine the atmospheric water demand yang et al 2021 with solar radiation being the main energy supply and precipitation the main water input for the terrestrial hydrological cycle wang et al 2020 wind speed plays a significant role in variations in et a by affecting the evaporative demand mcvicar et al 2012 an increase in wind speed can accelerate the diffusion of water molecules through turbulence leading to a further increase in evaporative demand humidity is a reflection of the atmospheric moisture condition li et al 2021a in the present study specific humidity presented a positive contribution to et a variation in the nwc previous studies also noted the important effect of humidity on et a using the indicators of relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit vpd wu et al 2019 discovered vpd played a dominant role in controlling ecosystem et a in cold and water limited regions by affecting plant stomatal activity and canopy photosynthetic rates they reported the variation in et a to be more sensitive to vpd than to soil water availability or precipitation yu et al 2020 found relative humidity to have a significant influence on variation in et a with increases in relative humidity leading to increasing trends in et a in arid and semiarid regions chen et al 2014 also reported that et a estimations were significantly correlated with relative humidity although vpd is synergistically affected by temperature and humidity increasing vpd would lead to an increase in et a li et al 2021b while according to the calculation of vpd increasing the specific humidity does not necessarily lead to a decrease in vpd and further leads to decreasing in et a because saturated water pressure is largely impacted by temperature if the variation in temperature is larger than that of specific humidity the et a would still increase differences in model dominated variables resulted in significant differences in the variation of annual et a chen et al 2014 in the present study solar radiation humidity and wind speed showed weak correlations with et a r 2 0 1 fig 11 while strong correlations existed between et a and precipitation temperature and ndvi from 1982 to 2015 water and energy are the most important factors driving et a variation teuling et al 2019 xu et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 our results revealed that the change in annual precipitation is the climatic factor that contributed the most to variation in et a in nwc i e variation in et a in nwc was largely sensitive to precipitation this may reflect the fact that the change in this factor was significant and hence sufficient to cause a change in et a although precipitation does not directly affect et a but rather regulates et a through soil moisture wang et al 2020 at an annual scale the dynamics of soil moisture were not obvious while the water supply from the atmosphere directly impacted the variation of annual et a 4 2 impact of vegetation dynamics on variations in et a transpiration from vegetation is the main component of et a and tends to be much greater than evaporation from the soil surface zhang et al 2020 especially in arid and semi arid regions such as the nwc different characteristics of vegetation e g leaf area index lai root depth and coverage physiology e g stomatal aperture and type e g percent forest or herbaceous can affect transpiration and thus regional et a sun et al 2020 vegetation responds or adapts to heat and water availability xu et al 2019 in addition vegetation dynamics affect et a through its regulatory effects on surface roughness albedo and interception of rain pei et al 2017 the results of this study showed that an increase in vegetative growth had induced a limited contribution to variation in et a 16 in nwc this concurred with xie et al 2020 and jin et al 2017 who found vegetation greening as indicated by lai contributed 10 of the increase in et a in water limited regions however the impact of vegetation dynamics on et a varies with climatic conditions e g climate type and seasonality ma et al 2019b marques et al 2020 yu et al 2020 as low water availability and high water stress are almost universal during the growth of vegetation in arid and semiarid regions an increase in vegetation dynamic parameters may to some extent indicate greater available water supply arising from an increase in precipitation in such conditions if vegetation can absorb more water from the soil and intercept more precipitation through its canopy it will directly increase et a yang et al 2020b yang et al 2017 on the other hand an increase in vegetation dynamics can lead to an increase in the proportion of transpiration in et a zhang et al 2020 an increase in vegetation dynamics induces a reallocation of available water between canopy and soil and while more water is consumed by transpiration less water is consumed by soil evaporation 4 3 limitations and uncertainties the glass derived et a cmfd climate and ndvi datasets were employed to attribute variation of et a in nwc using regression and elasticity methods however there are some limitations and uncertainties that should be considered for future research firstly the poor reliability of et a products impedes the accurate estimation of temporal variation in et a in this study we compared different et a products to site based eddy covariance observations and identified a reliable et a dataset fig 2 table 2 unfortunately the observation period was short and the number of observation stations were limited and unevenly distributed so the spatial and temporal reliability of the selected data must be further assessed in the future with more observations chen et al 2014 compared 8 et a models including 5 empirical and 3 process based models and found that each of the 8 models only explained 61 80 of et a variability in china and adjacent regions the lack of a full explanation of et a variability highlights the fact that current et a models require further improvement and validation accurate estimation of et a is fundamental to the investigation of the effect of climate change and vegetation dynamics on the hydrological cycle secondly the estimations of et a by the different models disagree significantly shedding uncertainty on the various governing equations scientific hypotheses model structures and forcing data adopted in these models chen et al 2014 ma et al 2019a as divergent variation in et a was found for different et a estimations fig 2 it is reasonable that the discrimination of its causative factors would also be inconsistent and uncertain in the present study based on the validation results of et a we only addressed the impact of climate change and vegetation dynamics on et a variation to quantify the uncertainty the comparison between separate results of different et a datasets may need further study in addition the contributions of different driving factors reflect their change in magnitude and the et a s sensitivity to them the sensitivity to and magnitude of variation of driving factors may be different for various sources of data which may introduce uncertainty into the separation results finally the discrimination methods and selected impact factors are also sources of uncertainty we compared the results of the regression and elasticity methods by validating the sum of the individual contributions with the variation of et a detected by the sen slope method some uncertainties still existed especially among the pixels with non significant variation in et a differences in results from the two separation methods that used the same data are clear fig 6 the direct use of the differential equation or elasticity method without considering the dependency among potential driving factors and their integrated impact on et a can lead to significant uncertainties in separation results as we can see in fig 6 the variations of et a simulated by the regression method were underestimated while the variations of et a simulated by the elasticity method were overestimated compared with the observed variation it means the contributions of each factor to the variation in et a may overlap or some contributions may be missing therefore in order to overcome the dependency among driving factors we used the partial correlation coefficient to replace the correlation coefficient in estimating the elasticity coefficient the results show that the explanation improved r2 0 83 with the slope equal to 0 91 fig 6c by using the partial correlation coefficient the limitation of dependency and collinearity among driving factors can be addressed 5 conclusions in this study a reliable et a dataset was validated and compared with et a products from different sources then compared to on site observations an elasticity coefficient method and a regression based method served to detect the contribution of climate change and vegetation dynamics to the variation of et a from 1982 to 2015 in northwest china nwc the major findings of this study were i the nwc regional trend in mean annual et a from 1982 to 2015 was 2 32 mm yr 1 with the zone of significant variation occupying 75 of the vegetated area ii the partial correlation coefficient based regression ec method which explained 83 of the variation of annual et a detected by the sen slope method was more robust in capturing the spatial variation of et a than the correlation coefficient based ec method and multiple regression method iii the change in precipitation contributed 73 of the variation in et a followed by the effects of ndvi change 16 and temperature 12 the contribution to variation in et a from the other three factors was 5 the contribution rates of precipitation were different in different land cover types with the contribution in cropland the smallest and steppe the largest this study determined that the contributions of different driving factors to variation of et a were related to both the factor s change in magnitude and the et a s sensitivity to the factors due to the uncertainty of et a variation attributing causative factors depends on the selection of separation methods potential driving factors as well as the reliability of et a values future improvement is warranted in establishing a reliable relationship between et a and potential driving factors and validating the consistency of results derived from different et a products credit authorship

3600,actual evapotranspiration et a has significantly increased under recent climate and vegetation changes discriminating the primary driver of et a variation would improve our knowledge of the interaction between regional hydrological and ecological systems in this study a reliable et a dataset was obtained by validating three et a products from different sources with in situ observations we modified the elasticity coefficient method using partial correlation and compared it with the traditional regression based method in estimating et a variation in northwest china nwc on the basis of the magnitude and the sensitivity of et a variation results revealed that annual et a significantly increased 2 32 mm yr p 0 05 in nwc over 1982 2015 with over 75 of the vegetated area showing an increasing trend robust in capturing spatial variation patterns in et a the partial correlation coefficient based elasticity method was able to explain 83 of the annual variation in et a precipitation temperature and ndvi were the most important factors controlling the increase in annual et a from 1982 to 2015 regionally precipitation was the dominant factor and contributed 73 to the variation of annual et a in the vegetated nwc however the contribution rates of precipitation varied across the different land cover types and ranged from 31 in irrigated cropland to 81 in the steppe potential uncertainty in the attribution of causative factors could arise in selecting the separation method and potential driving factors establishing a reliable relationship between et a and potential driving factors should be confirmed with observations the present study s results can guide sustainable water resources management and ecological restoration in water limited regions keywords climate change vegetation dynamics actual evapotranspiration separation attribution northwest china 1 introduction actual evapotranspiration et a is a vital component of regional water and energy cycles douville et al 2013 jung et al 2010 eta closely links a series of land surface processes with ecosystem functions liu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 and can reflect complex interactions between climate vegetation soil and terrain wang et al 2014 studies of regional et a provide the basis for evaluating regional water resources guiding agricultural irrigation and performing ecological restoration however climate change has disturbed the state of regional water and energy cycles zhang et al 2015 and greatly altered various eco hydrological processes for example changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation directly alter the magnitude and spatial temporal distribution of runoff teuling et al 2019 likewise variation in radiation and temperature acting on the underlying soil surface leads to changes in land surface et a li et al 2013 tian et al 2013 this in turn alters soil moisture and the growth of vegetation zhou et al 2019 thereby altering the structure and function of regional ecosystems and their attending hydrological processes given the frequent lack of a reliable et a dataset the extent to which changes in climate and vegetation contribute to variation in et a is still unclear however to achieve rational science based allocation and management of water resources one must fully understand the mechanisms of et a variation under environmental change and separating the impacts of various climate and vegetation factors on et a variation can not only improve our knowledge of a regional water budget but also enhance our understanding of interactions between hydrology and ecosystem functions zhang et al 2020 several studies have investigated the impacts of changes in climate and vegetation on variation in et a bai et al 2019 lei et al 2018 ma et al 2019b ning et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2015 physically or statistically based methods can be employed to discriminate the impact of climate and vegetation factors on et a variation characterized by complicated model structures requiring a wide range of parameter measures estimates and relying heavily on embedded hypotheses and model structures physically based methods are designed to consider interactions between the atmosphere vegetation and soil bai et al 2019 the individual impact of each driving factor can be estimated by using de trended time series to force the physically based model the difference of et a forced by de trended and original time series of the given factor was regarded as the contribution of the given factor however many relevant parameters are not available in data scarce regions such as nwc or suffer from great uncertainty due to limited observations statistically based elasticity ning et al 2020 variance analysis wu et al 2020 and regression methods xie et al 2020 are simple and effective in attributing variations in et a to climate or vegetation variables li et al 2021c liu et al 2020b zhang et al 2018 potential driving factors are assumed to be independent from one another and the sum of individual contributions needs to concur with the observed variation in et a zhang et al 2020 compared the results of physically and statistically based methods of attributing variation in et a and found them to be consistent for physically based methods the driving factors are determinate however this is not the case for statistically based methods when using a statistically based method questions remain as to how to select the full complement of driving factors influencing et a and avoiding collinearity among these factors to address these issues some researchers have built empirical models to select potential driving factors and to test their ability to explain et a pei et al 2017 xie et al 2020 yu et al 2020 for example the budyko hypothesis has been widely used to explore the relationship of et a with water supply precipitation p atmospheric water demand potential evapotranspiration et p and underlying surface properties e g vegetation li et al 2021b wang et al 2018 wu et al 2020 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 regression methods have been applied to the selection of explanatory variables and to avoid collinearity among variables for example pei et al 2017 used a generalized linear model glm to investigate the contribution of climate change and vegetation growth to seasonal et a changes in the yellow river basin xie et al 2020 applied a multiple linear regression method to explore the impact of climate change elevated atmospheric co2 and human activities on et a variation in china s three north region yu et al 2020 developed a stepwise regression equation to detect the effects of climate variability and landscape pattern change on et a dynamics for a grassland situated in xilingol china in our study we adopted a partial correlation coefficient instead of a correlation coefficient to calculate an elasticity coefficient in order to overcome the collinearity issue among driving factors featuring a mountain basin system northwest china is a typical water limited region yang et al 2020a where ecosystems are very fragile and extremely sensitive to climate change while persistent attempts have been made to investigate the causes of et a variation in nwc qiu et al 2017 sun et al 2020 xu et al 2020 the potential driving mechanisms remain unclear due to the lack of reliable et a datasets and complicated interactions among climate ecosystem and topography this limits our understanding of local eco hydrology and thus hampers the development of effective ecological restoration practices under climate change accordingly the objectives of this study were to i obtain a reliable et a dataset by validating et a values drawn from remote sensing sources with site observations i e ground truth ii detect inter annual variations of et a climate variables and vegetation indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi iii compare variations in et a estimated by elasticity coefficient based and regression based methods and iv explore the contribution of climate and vegetation changes to variation in et a the results of this study can guide future sustainable water resources management and ecological restoration in water limited regions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area spanning 2 23 106 km2 lat 73 48 106 95 e long 34 44 47 93 n northwest china nwc accounts for almost one quarter of china s land area shi et al 2007 its complex topography of intertwined mountains oases and deserts is structured with elevations ranging from 155 m to 7464 m yang et al 2020a under continental arid climatic conditions dominated by northern hemisphere westerlies feng et al 2019 the region s mean annual precipitation generally ranges between 100 and 200 mm yr 1 but can be as low as 50 mm yr 1 in the tarim and qaidam basins and exceed 600 mm yr 1 in the tianshan and qilian mountains yin et al 2019 temperatures in the region can exceed 40 c in summer and drop below 30 c in winter as a typical arid area with a clear mismatch between large water demand and limited water supply the nwc region houses very fragile ecosystems as precipitation is extremely scarce in the plain irrigation is normally the only water source for oasis agro ecosystems accordingly nwc is amongst those regions most sensitive to current climate change yang et al 2020a the dominant landscape is desert which accounts for 47 of the study area followed by steppe 19 and meadow 18 mainly situated in oases where crops are sustained by irrigation cropland only accounts for 6 of the study area fig 1

multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa and the current reanalysis of the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf era interim the ndvi3g data was obtained from the global

drawn from the global ndvi3g dataset and its annual average was calculated from the original semi monthly values using a nearest neighbour resampling method these datasets offered at different spatial resolutions between 1982 and 2015 were all interpolated to 0 1 to maintain spatial consistency 2 3 variation estimation trends in et a ndvi and climate variables were estimated using the sen slope method sen 1968 differing slightly from the slope obtained by simple linear regression the sen slope method is a non parametric method and can provide a more reliable slope of tendency the statistical significance p 0 05 of the sen slope trend was assessed using the non parametric rank based mann kendall m k statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 this distribution free statistic test depends on observation ranks rather than numerical values ghosh 2018 hamed 2008 2 4 regression based method for attributing variation in et a the et a was assumed to be a function of climate variables and ndvi with its expression quantified through multiple linear regression we considered temperature t precipitation p downward solar radiation sr wind speed ws and specific humidity sh as independent climatic variables the regression model could accordingly be expressed as xie et al 2020 1 et a a 1 p a 2 t a 3 s r a 4 w s a 5 s h a 6 n d v i b where a is the partial regression coefficient of the independent variables which is calculated through a least square estimation xie et al 2020 and b is a residual term the first derivative of eq 1 with respect to time t can be expressed as 2 d et a dt a 1 dp dt a 2 dt dt a 3 dsr dt a 4 dws dt a 5 dsh dt a 6 dndvi dt db dt it represents the actual contributions of climate and vegetation changes to et a variation trend this can be more simply expressed as 3 d et a dt c p c t c s r c w s c s h c n d v i where c p c t c s r c w s c s h and c n d v i represent the contribution of precipitation p temperature t downward solar radiation sr wind speed ws specific humidity sh and ndvi to et a variation respectively in order to easily compare the relative importance of the contributions of different driving factors we employed the relative contribution r i of different driving factors i to variation in et a it is expressed as wang et al 2020 4 r i c i c p c t c s r c w s c s h c n d v i 100 where r i is the relative contribution of factor i to variation in et a and c i is the actual contribution of factor i to variation in et a and i represents the driving factor in this study such as p t sr ws sh and ndvi 2 5 elastic based method for attributing et a variation elastic based method can be used to attribute the contribution of different driving factors to et a variation wang et al 2020 for a function y f x whose deterministic expression is unknown x represents a vector with n variables its first order partial differential equation can accordingly be expressed as li et al 2021c 5 dy y x i d x i i 1 2 n dividing both sides by the mean value of y in eq 5 it can be expressed as 6 dy y y x i d x i y multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the mean value of x i and rearranging in eq 6 we can obtain the form of the elasticity coefficient method which can be expressed as wang et al 2020 7 dy y y x i x i y d x i x i defining the elasticity coefficient ε is expressed as 8 ε i y x i x i y therefore combining the elasticity coefficient ε and dividing both sides by dt eq 7 can be further simplified as 9 dy dt ε i d x i x i y dt eq 9 is the elasticity based equation for estimating the contribution of driving factor x i to the variation of y considering the driving factors and target variable in this study the contributions of climate and vegetation variables to the variation in et a can then be expressed as wang et al 2020 10 d et a dt ε p dp p ε t dt t ε sr dsr sr ε ws dws ws ε sh dsh sh ε ndvi dndvi ndvi eta dt comparing eq 10 with the regression method eq 2 in the form of the contribution estimation for the same driving factor the partial regression coefficient a in eq 2 can then be theoretically expressed as 11 a i ε i eta x i where x i represents the mean of driving factor such as p t sr ws sh and ndvi in an analogous approach to calculating an estimator of streamflow s climatic elasticity ε i can also be regarded as the linear regression coefficient between x i x i and e t a eta using the least squares estimator the elasticity coefficient can be estimated as follows zheng et al 2009 12 ε x e t a x eta x i x e t a eta x i x 2 ρ x e t a c eta c x where x represents the mean of climate variables and ndvi ρ x e t a is the correlation coefficient between x and eta and c eta and c x are the coefficients of variation of et a and x respectively more detailed description regarding the derivation of the elasticity coefficient can be found in the study of zheng et al 2009 as the collinearity and interactions between different independent variables cannot be ignored xie et al 2020 we adopted the partial correlation coefficient instead of ρ x e t a and expressed it as 13 ρ x e t a y ρ x e t a ρ x y ρ y e t a 1 ρ x y 2 1 ρ y e t a 2 where ρ x e t a y is the first order partial correlation coefficient between x and et a in considering the effect of variable y ρ x e t a and ρ y e t a are the correlation coefficients between eta and x and y respectively and ρ x y is the correlation coefficient between x and y 3 results 3 1 validation of different et a products to obtain a reliable et a dataset three et a products glass gleam and cr were validated and compared by extracting the annual et a data from pixels overlapped with eddy covariance on site i e point to pixel the observed annual et a data was aggregated by daily values fig 2 table 2 all three products datasets underestimated observed et a values means µ and standard deviations σ for the glass derived et a values more closely matched observed et a values than those derived by the cr and gleam products the three et a products σ increased as the spatial resolution increased fig 2a moreover we compared the correlation between each products et a values with observed et a values fig 2b notably the sub unity regression slope 0 43 p 0 05 between gleam derived and observed et a might reflect gleam s coarse spatial resolution 0 25 as the coarser the grid data the greater the underestimation of et a bai and liu 2018 yang et al 2021 accordingly the reliability of gleam derived et a values was questionable the points of the cr derived vs observed et a scatter plot were mostly clustered around a 1 1 line and showed a regression slope of 0 61 further indicating a closer match of the cr derived dataset to observed values than the gleam dataset the glass derived et a values for the region showed a high positive correlation to the observed et a with a regression slope of 0 74 the glass derived et a products explained almost 89 of the variation in the observed data the largest among the three datasets and indicated greater reliability of the glass derived dataset compared to the gleam and cr derived datasets accordingly glass derived et a data were selected for further analysis section 3 2 3 4 3 2 variation of et a ndvi and climatic variables the spatial distribution of the mean annual glass derived et a its coefficient of variation cv σ μ temporal trends in annual et a over the period of 1982 to 2015 and the statistical significance of these trends are presented in fig 3 trend statistics for different land cover types are listed in table 3 the mean of annual et a values the associated cv and the magnitude of trends in its variation showed a strong spatial heterogeneity mean annual et a varied spatially from 67to 665 mm in the vegetated areas of the nwc fig 3a with high values occurring mainly in the mountainous regions but also in oasis regions where et a values were greatly affected by irrigation low mean annual et a values occurred predominantly in the desert areas e g tarim basin junggar basin and badain jaran desert the cv of annual et a values ranged between 0 02 and 0 57 and showed an inverse spatial pattern compared to the annual mean et a year to year trends in et a varied from 3 6 to 14 0 mm yr 1 fig 3c and its spatial pattern was consistent to the land cover types with roughly three quarters of the vegetated area showing a significant increase p 0 05 the variation trends of annual et a among all land cover types increased significantly and the proportion of the land cover areas showing a significant increased trend was above 67 increased variation in mean annual et a occurred in 96 of cropland table 3 overall the trend in annual et a from 1982 to 2015 in nwc increased by 2 32 mm yr 1 with the zone of significant variation accounting for 75 of the total vegetated area the distribution of trends in annual mean temperature precipitation solar radiation specific humidity wind speed and ndvi from 1982 to 2015 are presented in fig 4 the trend in mean annual temperature varied spatially ranging between 0 17 and 0 19 c yr 1 fig 4a almost 70 of the vegetated area showed a significant increase in temperature the trend in annual precipitation also varied spatially ranging between 3 08 and 20 30 mm yr 1 fig 4b with the zone of significant increase occupying roughly 65 of the vegetated area the trend in solar radiation i e downward short radiation varied from 0 79 to 1 43 w m 2 yr 1 with areas showing a significant decrease or increase covering 23 and 15 of the vegetated area respectively the trend in specific humidity ranged between 0 06 and 0 06 g kg yr 1 with the zone of significant increase occupying 41 of the vegetated area the trend in wind speed varied from 0 11 to 0 14 m s 1 yr 1 with the zone of significant decrease occupying 29 of the vegetated area and the zone of significant increase occupying 30 the trend in ndvi varied from 0 28 to 0 57 century 1 with a zone of significant decrease occurring in 43 of the vegetated area fig 5 and table 4 with the exception of solar radiation all of the variables investigated showed increasing trends table 4 temperature and precipitation presented increasing trends across all land cover types with the strongest and weakest positive trends for temperature occurring in the bdf 0 067 c yr 1 and sav zones 0 027 c yr 1 respectively table 5 in the case of precipitation the strongest and weakest positive trends occurred in the enf zone 5 06 mm yr 1 and shrub 1 177 mm yr 1 zones solar radiation showed a decreasing trend for meadow steppe cropland and enf but an increasing trend for sav shrub desert and bdf specific humidity showed an increasing trend for all land cover types except shrub and bdf with the strongest increasing trend occurring in the enf zone 0 014 g kg 1 yr 1 wind speed showed an increasing trend for steppe sav shrub and desert zones but a decreasing trend for meadow bdf cropland and enf finally ndvi increased for all land cover types except meadow 0 002 century 1 3 3 comparison of the separation methods in assessing the reliability of the elasticity coefficient ec based method we compared variations in annual et a estimated by the multiple linear regression method and the ec method to those obtained using either the correlation coefficient or the partial correlation coefficient fig 6 the assessment of the simulated variation in annual et a by multiple linear regression and correlation coefficient were obviously biased showing a large underestimation of high values as evidenced by a regression slope of 0 71 for the re method and a large overestimation of high values as evidenced by a regression slope of 1 32 for the ec method while a similar but lesser deviation still occurred in the estimation using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method the deviation was comparatively slight with a rational regression slope of 0 91 fig 6c the simulated variations of annual et a using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method could explain 83 of variation of annual et a trends p 0 01 the highest of all the three methods fig 6 this indicated that et a variation estimated using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method were more reliable than those obtained with re and ec methods we also compared the mean of the simulated et a trends using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method for the eight land cover types with the observed values derived by the sen slope method fig 7 the performance of the partial correlation coefficient based ec method showed very satisfactory results with a regression slope of 0 97 and explained 98 of the variation of observed et a trends therefore the partial correlation coefficient based ec method captured the variation of the annual et a trend and its output was used for attributing the contribution of climate and vegetation to this variation 3 4 contribution of climate and vegetation changes to variations in et a the actual contribution of climate and vegetation changes to the variation in et a estimated using the partial correlation coefficient based ec method are illustrated in fig 8 the contribution of temperature was between 2 8and 4 0 mm yr 1 µ 0 26 mm yr 1 fig 9 with areas of positive contribution mainly located in the eastern qilian mountains the oases of the tarim basin and south of the altai mountains negative contributions were mainly located in the mid east portions of the junggar basin and western qilian mountains as well as in the south of the qaidam basin the actual contribution of precipitation change varied from 1 5 to 5 25 mm yr 1 µ 1 59 mm yr 1 with positive contributions mainly located in the north jungger basin tianshan mountains and kunlun mountains the southern altai mountains and the western qilian mountains whereas the negative contributions were mainly located in the west and south of the tianshan mountains the south of qaidam basin and oases areas the contribution of solar radiation change varied from 2 43to 2 00 mm yr 1 µ 0 01 mm yr 1 with positive contributions in the tarim basin the western tianshan and southern qilian mountains and negative contributions located in the eastern tianshan mountains the northern qilian mountains and the western junggar basin the contribution of the specific humidity change ranged between 1 65 and 2 0 mm yr 1 µ 0 05 mm yr 1 with positive contributions occurring in the junggar basin the tianshan mountains and the alpine region of the western tarim basin the contribution of wind speed change varied between 3 8 and 3 0 mm yr 1 µ 0 04 mm yr 1 with positive contributions located mainly in the junggar basin the southern altai mountains the eastern tianshan mountains the western qilian mountains and the northern tarim basin the negative contribution was mainly located in the western tarim basin the central tianshan mountains as well as the western portion of the junggar basin and qilian mountains the contribution of ndvi change varied from 2 39 to 5 0 mm yr 1 µ 0 34 mm yr 1 with its positive contribution located in the qilian mountains the southern junggar basin and the oases areas the contribution of different driving factors to the variation in et a was the integrated reflection of their changes in magnitude and the et a s sensitivity to them yang et al 2021 the area with large contributions of a given factor to et a was the area where the given factor showed large variation in magnitude as well as high sensitivity of et a for example the positive contribution of precipitation temperature and ndvi to et a were mainly located in the area where the variation of precipitation temperature and ndvi were significantly increased such as in qilian and tianshan mountains junggar basin and the oases in tarim basin these findings were consistent with the study of li et al 2021b where most of their positive contribution areas overlapping with our study however due to the relatively higher spatial resolution in our study the spatial heterogeneity of the contribution of different driving factors was more obvious fig 10 shows the relative contribution of climate and vegetation changes to variation in et a for different land cover types the contributions of precipitation and ndvi to the variation in et a were positive for all land cover types precipitation was the dominant causative factor of variation in et a for all land cover types specific humidity contributed positively to variation of et a for steppe sav bdf cropland and enf and negatively for shrub meadow and desert solar radiation contributed positively to variation of et a for dbf cropland and enf and negatively for meadow steppe shrub and desert temperature contributed positively to variation of et a for all land cover types except for steppe and wind speed contributed positively for all land cover types except for meadow regionally precipitation was the dominant factor and contributed 1 59 mm yr 1 of et a variation in nwc fig 9 followed by ndvi and temperature the contributions of solar radiation wind speed and specific humidity to the variation of et a were limited across the entire nwc precipitation was the dominant factor 73 contributing to the increase in et a followed by ndvi and temperature at 16 and 12 respectively each contribution rate of the other three factors was 5 precipitation contributed to an increase in et a for cropland bdf shrub enf meadow desert sav and steppe with relative contributions of 31 48 52 59 71 71 76 and 81 respectively the dominant role of precipitation on et a variation for the whole region and different vegetation types fig 10 further indicates that water availability is the main stress for vegetation growth in the nwc and for cropland an ecosystem highly influenced by human activity the effects of precipitation 31 are comparable to that of temperature 28 which may be because irrigation greatly alleviates the water stress on crop growth in the region it is interesting that precipitation has lower effects 60 on deep rooted vegetation types e g bdf shrub and enf than other types which may be related to the high drought tolerance i e low sensitivity ability of these types and for the two types of grassland temperature had higher effects on et a variation of meadow 9 than that of steppe 1 which may be caused by the higher drought tolerance and higher sensitivity to heat stress of meadow as it is mainly distributed in areas with a high elevation i e lower air temperature and more precipitation i e high water availability in summary these different contribution rates also reflect the different sensitivity of vegetation response to environmental stress e g water stress and heat stress to some extent 4 discussion 4 1 impact of climate change on variation in et a et a is regulated by several climate factors including temperature precipitation solar radiation atmospheric humidity and wind speed temperature wind speed and humidity determine the atmospheric water demand yang et al 2021 with solar radiation being the main energy supply and precipitation the main water input for the terrestrial hydrological cycle wang et al 2020 wind speed plays a significant role in variations in et a by affecting the evaporative demand mcvicar et al 2012 an increase in wind speed can accelerate the diffusion of water molecules through turbulence leading to a further increase in evaporative demand humidity is a reflection of the atmospheric moisture condition li et al 2021a in the present study specific humidity presented a positive contribution to et a variation in the nwc previous studies also noted the important effect of humidity on et a using the indicators of relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit vpd wu et al 2019 discovered vpd played a dominant role in controlling ecosystem et a in cold and water limited regions by affecting plant stomatal activity and canopy photosynthetic rates they reported the variation in et a to be more sensitive to vpd than to soil water availability or precipitation yu et al 2020 found relative humidity to have a significant influence on variation in et a with increases in relative humidity leading to increasing trends in et a in arid and semiarid regions chen et al 2014 also reported that et a estimations were significantly correlated with relative humidity although vpd is synergistically affected by temperature and humidity increasing vpd would lead to an increase in et a li et al 2021b while according to the calculation of vpd increasing the specific humidity does not necessarily lead to a decrease in vpd and further leads to decreasing in et a because saturated water pressure is largely impacted by temperature if the variation in temperature is larger than that of specific humidity the et a would still increase differences in model dominated variables resulted in significant differences in the variation of annual et a chen et al 2014 in the present study solar radiation humidity and wind speed showed weak correlations with et a r 2 0 1 fig 11 while strong correlations existed between et a and precipitation temperature and ndvi from 1982 to 2015 water and energy are the most important factors driving et a variation teuling et al 2019 xu et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 our results revealed that the change in annual precipitation is the climatic factor that contributed the most to variation in et a in nwc i e variation in et a in nwc was largely sensitive to precipitation this may reflect the fact that the change in this factor was significant and hence sufficient to cause a change in et a although precipitation does not directly affect et a but rather regulates et a through soil moisture wang et al 2020 at an annual scale the dynamics of soil moisture were not obvious while the water supply from the atmosphere directly impacted the variation of annual et a 4 2 impact of vegetation dynamics on variations in et a transpiration from vegetation is the main component of et a and tends to be much greater than evaporation from the soil surface zhang et al 2020 especially in arid and semi arid regions such as the nwc different characteristics of vegetation e g leaf area index lai root depth and coverage physiology e g stomatal aperture and type e g percent forest or herbaceous can affect transpiration and thus regional et a sun et al 2020 vegetation responds or adapts to heat and water availability xu et al 2019 in addition vegetation dynamics affect et a through its regulatory effects on surface roughness albedo and interception of rain pei et al 2017 the results of this study showed that an increase in vegetative growth had induced a limited contribution to variation in et a 16 in nwc this concurred with xie et al 2020 and jin et al 2017 who found vegetation greening as indicated by lai contributed 10 of the increase in et a in water limited regions however the impact of vegetation dynamics on et a varies with climatic conditions e g climate type and seasonality ma et al 2019b marques et al 2020 yu et al 2020 as low water availability and high water stress are almost universal during the growth of vegetation in arid and semiarid regions an increase in vegetation dynamic parameters may to some extent indicate greater available water supply arising from an increase in precipitation in such conditions if vegetation can absorb more water from the soil and intercept more precipitation through its canopy it will directly increase et a yang et al 2020b yang et al 2017 on the other hand an increase in vegetation dynamics can lead to an increase in the proportion of transpiration in et a zhang et al 2020 an increase in vegetation dynamics induces a reallocation of available water between canopy and soil and while more water is consumed by transpiration less water is consumed by soil evaporation 4 3 limitations and uncertainties the glass derived et a cmfd climate and ndvi datasets were employed to attribute variation of et a in nwc using regression and elasticity methods however there are some limitations and uncertainties that should be considered for future research firstly the poor reliability of et a products impedes the accurate estimation of temporal variation in et a in this study we compared different et a products to site based eddy covariance observations and identified a reliable et a dataset fig 2 table 2 unfortunately the observation period was short and the number of observation stations were limited and unevenly distributed so the spatial and temporal reliability of the selected data must be further assessed in the future with more observations chen et al 2014 compared 8 et a models including 5 empirical and 3 process based models and found that each of the 8 models only explained 61 80 of et a variability in china and adjacent regions the lack of a full explanation of et a variability highlights the fact that current et a models require further improvement and validation accurate estimation of et a is fundamental to the investigation of the effect of climate change and vegetation dynamics on the hydrological cycle secondly the estimations of et a by the different models disagree significantly shedding uncertainty on the various governing equations scientific hypotheses model structures and forcing data adopted in these models chen et al 2014 ma et al 2019a as divergent variation in et a was found for different et a estimations fig 2 it is reasonable that the discrimination of its causative factors would also be inconsistent and uncertain in the present study based on the validation results of et a we only addressed the impact of climate change and vegetation dynamics on et a variation to quantify the uncertainty the comparison between separate results of different et a datasets may need further study in addition the contributions of different driving factors reflect their change in magnitude and the et a s sensitivity to them the sensitivity to and magnitude of variation of driving factors may be different for various sources of data which may introduce uncertainty into the separation results finally the discrimination methods and selected impact factors are also sources of uncertainty we compared the results of the regression and elasticity methods by validating the sum of the individual contributions with the variation of et a detected by the sen slope method some uncertainties still existed especially among the pixels with non significant variation in et a differences in results from the two separation methods that used the same data are clear fig 6 the direct use of the differential equation or elasticity method without considering the dependency among potential driving factors and their integrated impact on et a can lead to significant uncertainties in separation results as we can see in fig 6 the variations of et a simulated by the regression method were underestimated while the variations of et a simulated by the elasticity method were overestimated compared with the observed variation it means the contributions of each factor to the variation in et a may overlap or some contributions may be missing therefore in order to overcome the dependency among driving factors we used the partial correlation coefficient to replace the correlation coefficient in estimating the elasticity coefficient the results show that the explanation improved r2 0 83 with the slope equal to 0 91 fig 6c by using the partial correlation coefficient the limitation of dependency and collinearity among driving factors can be addressed 5 conclusions in this study a reliable et a dataset was validated and compared with et a products from different sources then compared to on site observations an elasticity coefficient method and a regression based method served to detect the contribution of climate change and vegetation dynamics to the variation of et a from 1982 to 2015 in northwest china nwc the major findings of this study were i the nwc regional trend in mean annual et a from 1982 to 2015 was 2 32 mm yr 1 with the zone of significant variation occupying 75 of the vegetated area ii the partial correlation coefficient based regression ec method which explained 83 of the variation of annual et a detected by the sen slope method was more robust in capturing the spatial variation of et a than the correlation coefficient based ec method and multiple regression method iii the change in precipitation contributed 73 of the variation in et a followed by the effects of ndvi change 16 and temperature 12 the contribution to variation in et a from the other three factors was 5 the contribution rates of precipitation were different in different land cover types with the contribution in cropland the smallest and steppe the largest this study determined that the contributions of different driving factors to variation of et a were related to both the factor s change in magnitude and the et a s sensitivity to the factors due to the uncertainty of et a variation attributing causative factors depends on the selection of separation methods potential driving factors as well as the reliability of et a values future improvement is warranted in establishing a reliable relationship between et a and potential driving factors and validating the consistency of results derived from different et a products credit authorship

3601,the estimation of actual evapotranspiration is a difficult issue in hydrological research particularly in the scarcely observed region deep learning dl has been increasingly used in the field of hydrology in recent years in this study we investigated the ability of dl on actual evapotranspiration estimation using three sets of controlled experiments at a typical region with scarce observations the qinghai tibetan plateau the results suggest that the dl model can utilize a few key types of observation data to simulate actual evapotranspiration and more in situ observation data types did not significantly improve the accuracy of dl simulations a multi source dl model established by integrating data from distantly distributed stations showed a better performance than the model built separately using data at individual sites moreover further analysis of climate pattern and input data correlation was conducted for the similarity of stations for multi source learning of the dl model using inputs in the lead time period can improve the simulation of daily et by dl compared with traditional process based physical methods the dl model is more flexible to simulate actual evapotranspiration in areas with insufficient observed data such as the qinghai tibetan plateau the results of this study highlight the potential power of dl model to improve the actual evapotranspiration estimation in the scarcely observed region keywords evapotranspiration deep learning the qinghai tibetan plateau multi source learning scarcely observed region 1 introduction evapotranspiration et in this paper it refers to the actual evaporation comprising vegetation transpiration intercepted water evaporation and soil evaporation is the major water flux from the earth to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 and is also quite difficult to estimate due to the complex interactions of the land plant atmosphere system xu and singh 2005 it is important to investigate the changes in evapotranspiration for their significant relevance to climate change brutsaert and parlange 1998 however reliable in situ observations such as the eddy covariance observed et baldocchi et al 2010 are still quite limited in many regions and till now it is still very difficult to continuously observe the evapotranspiration rates at the catchment scale samain et al 2012 the development of process based physical theories for et estimation such as the complementary principle bouchet 1963 han and tian 2020 zhang and brutsaert 2021 based on the principle of hydrothermal equilibrium contributes to et estimation at the regional scale the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 based on the aerodynamic thermodynamic and semi empirical formula is useful for estimating et at the point scale however they still need to empirically estimate some parameters such as the surface resistance which is a great challenge particularly in the regions with poor in situ observations at large spatial scales advances in satellite remote sensing have provided a possible way to estimate et samain et al 2012 famiglietti et al 2015 hu and jia 2015 li et al 2019a yuan et al 2021 the land surface model ek et al 2003 dai et al 2003 is another method to estimate et at the catchment scale however these two indirect methods require data from in situ observations for model calibration and validation long and singh 2013 zhao et al 2019a and they need various types of input data such as meteorological variables and vegetation parameters which restrict their applications in poorly gauged regions in recent years in addition to deepening the understanding of the hydrological process the hydrology community is poised to fully explore the power in the vast amount of data using machine learning ml in various fields of hydrology tao et al 2016 yang et al 2017a kratzert et al 2018 2019 shen et al 2021 ml provides a new method for hydrological simulation and prediction deep learning dl is an ml approach that consists of a collection of advanced artificial neural network ann research which has gained great momentum since 2012 and has proved to be more effective than other ml methods lecun et al 2015 shen 2018 for example precipitation has been extracted from satellite cloud images by the stacked denoising auto encoder sdae with 4 layers and 1000 hidden nodes tao et al 2016 the long short term memory networks lstm models were successfully used to predict the streamflow for hundreds of basins over the united states kratzert et al 2018 2019 it also ignited a surge in dl applications for modeling the other components of the hydrologic cycle such as the vadose zone hydrology bandai and ghezzehei 2021 soil moisture fang et al 2019 and water management by reservoirs zhang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in the field of potential evapotranspiration which is the key ingredient for running hydrological models bai et al 2016 some studies used ml to simulate the pan evaporation epan kişi 2006 2013 wang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 majhi et al 2020 yaseen et al 2020 for example five different neuro fuzzy nf models were developed to improve the accuracy of daily epan estimation by comprising the daily climatic variables kişi 2006 for the estimation of et and vegetation transpiration some studies compared the merits and demerits of different ml models chen et al 2020 and some studies focused on upscaling the observed et by eddy covariance to large scales using ml jung et al 2011 tramontana et al 2016 li et al 2018 these studies mainly estimated et using non deep learning methods such as the regression method tree based method or artificial neural network etc so far the studies on dl models for estimating et is still insufficient bennett and nijssen 2021 moreover the cross station applications of ml have not yet been demonstrated for estimating et and the structure of the ml models used in the previous study did not consider the time series of the input data the meteorological data and et observations in a sample set of their studies were all from the same day or month the lstm model one of the widely used dl models whose advantage is to learn long term dependencies between the provided input and output of the network has been applied to simulate the streamflow soil moisture and other links of the hydrological cycle kratzert et al 2018 2019 fang et al 2020b and has rarely been studied in et estimation compared with other terrestrial regions in the world due to its steep topography complex landforms harsh and uninhabitable climate and in situ observation records on the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp are very scarce therefore estimating or understanding the change in et in the qtp is a great challenge since 1970 some in situ meteorological observations have been carried out tao et al 1986 wang 1999 ma et al 2006 which have greatly promoted the study of land atmosphere exchange and et on the qtp however long term field observations with fine time resolution are still quite limited in the qtp to overcome the lack of quantity and quality of observational data ma et al 2020 developed an hourly observation dataset from 2005 to 2016 including meteorological data and flux data observed using the eddy covariance method at six stations although the observations contain detailed hourly data the data integrity of each station in the observation of the latent heat flux linked to et ranges from 45 to 73 on an annual average other observational meteorological data in the same period also has large numbers of missing data which limits the application of traditional methods of et estimation based on thermodynamics and aerodynamics therefore a more efficient method to estimate et in poorly observed regions such as the qtp requires to be studied from the above this paper aims to investigate the ability of dl for estimating et in the qtp using lstm we attempt to address the following three questions 1 whether the selection of observed data types affects the accuracy of simulating et using dl 2 could cross stations learning be applied at distant stations and how this multi source learning affects the simulation of et by dl models 3 whether the time series of input data can improve the simulation of et using the dl models especially in the context of multi source learning in this study we find that radiation flux and soil water content are key types of input for the dl model and the multi source learning can improve the et simulation by dl inputs from the previous days can be used to increase the accuracy of daily et estimation by dl 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area data from an integrated land atmosphere interaction observation network of six field stations are used in this study fig 1 it includes the muztagh ata westerly observation and research station chinese academy of sciences ma cas the ngari desert observation and research station cas nad the bj site of nagqu station of plateau climate and environment cas npce bj hereinafter abbreviates to bj in the central qtp the nam co monitoring and research station for multisphere interactions cas nam the qomolangma atmospheric and environmental observation and research station cas qo and the southeast tibet observation and research station for the alpine environment cas se the detailed location the description of the vegetation types and the mean annual precipitation of these stations are shown in fig 1 and table 1 zhang 2007 yang and he 2019 he et al 2020 a detailed description can be found in ma et al 2020 here we briefly described these six stations the ma site has the highest elevation among the six stations and the climate at this station is influenced by the westerly wind all year round sparse and short grass scatters around the station and the soil type at this station is predominately sandy soil the ground at the bj station is covered by meadow and the height of the grasses is up to 5 cm the soil at this station is predominately sandy silt loam the nad station is located at the convergence zone of the indian monsoon and westerly wind where these two atmospheric circulation systems interact intensively there are very short grasses 1 2 cm on the sandy soil and gravel surface at this station the nam station is located near the bank of lake nam co the soil type at this station is predominantly sandy silt loam and the land cover is alpine steppe the climate at this station is greatly influenced by the local mesoscale system the qo station is located at the bottom of the lower rongbuk valley to the north of mt everest there is sparse and short vegetation on the sand and gravel surface the se station is located in a mountain valley close to the forested southeastern qtp the climate of this station is influenced by the south asian monsoon the land ground at this station is covered by dense vegetation however this station has the most missing observations among the six stations 2 2 data used variations and characteristics of the monthly observation variables at six stations are shown in fig 2 the raw data observed at the six stations are hourly resolution the daily data was obtained by the raw data and was used as input data of the lstm model the radiative fluxes data in the input of the model contain downward shortwave radiation rsd upward shortwave radiation rsu downward longwave radiation rld upward longwave radiation rlu data we do not use net radiation as model input mainly considering that upward long and short wave radiation can also reflect the land surface condition of the site such as vegetation type vegetation cover etc which have a great influence on the et estimation other meteorological elements of the input data include wind speed ws wind direction wd air temperature ta and relative humidity rh the height of the data measurement is slightly different at different stations but it is all within the range of 1 2 m above ground level soil data of the input is soil water content swc observed at the depth of 20 cm in the experiment the air temperature was used instead of soil temperature as input because they have a high correlation and there was a large amount of missing data for soil temperature daily et was obtained by the latent heat flux le data obtained from the eddy covariance observations there are some missing data at each observation station due to natural and equipment reasons for data continuity continuous records for more than 1 month and data integrity containing at least 10 data attributes the continuous available data period for the 6 stations was compiled and are shown in table s1 in the supplementary material further descriptions of data continuity and integrity are shown in table s2 2 3 the lstm model lstm is an improvement of the traditional rnn recurrent neural network model hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lstm solves the problem of gradient disappearance in rnn in long sequence input learning bengio et al 1994 fig 3 a shows the process of learning to update the model state parameters in a one layer lstm architecture for a sample with time series of length s and data characteristics c fig 3 b shows the flow chart of lstm cell data operation at time t 2 3 1 a detailed description of the lstm model similar to the traditional rnn lstm has a hidden state ht in addition lstm has a cell state ct to store information and three gates ft it ot which control the information flow hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 a diagram for the calculation of the six state variables in the lstm model is shown in fig 4 the first gate fig 4 a is the forget gate 1 f t σ w f x t r f h t 1 b f where ft is a resulting vector with values ranging from 0 to 1 σ is the logistic sigmoid function and wf rf and bf are three sets of learning parameters of the forget gate in the first time step the first hidden state h is initialized by a vector of zeros with a user defined length before computing the second gate cell candidate gt fig 4 b is used to represent a potential update vector for the cell state 2 g t tanh w g x t r g h t 1 b g where gt is a vector with values in the range 1 1 tanh is the hyperbolic tangent and wg rg and bg are another set of learning parameters the second gate fig 4 c is the input gate it 3 i t σ w i x t r i h t 1 b i where it is a vector with values in the range 0 1 and wi ri and bi are a set of learning parameters input gate it is defined as the amount of information used to update the cell state in gt combining the results of equations 1 3 the cell state ct fig 4 d is updated by the following equation 4 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where ʘ denotes element wise multiplication ft ʘ ct 1 can be interpreted as information stored in ct 1 which will be forgotten and it ʘ gt denotes new information stored in gt that will be added to the cell state the cell state is initialized by a vector of zeros in the first time step the last gate fig 4 e is the output gate ot 5 o t σ w o x t r o h t 1 b o where wo ro and bo are a set of learning parameters output gate controls the information of ct that flows into the new hidden state fig 4 f ht 6 h t tanh c t o t to compute the final simulated et the output from the last lstm layer at the last time step hn is used as input into a dense layer figure s1 in the supplementary material 7 y w d h n b d where y is the simulated et by lstm hn is the output of the last lstm layer at the last time step wd and bd are the weight matrix of the dense layer and the bias term respectively the lstm was run using the matlab r2020b version the deep learning toolbox lstm layer 2 3 2 parameter calibration of the lstm model and data set firstly we need to delineate a test set which is unreachable by the model during training and in this study we set it as 20 of the total sample size yang et al 2017a 2017b all diagrams which compare the simulated et with observed et and diagrams of values of the statistical metrics in this paper are based on the test set fig 5 secondly the remaining 80 samples are used to train lstm to calibrate the parameters and validate the model the flowchart for partitioning the dataset training model and evaluating the simulated et in a designed experiment is shown in fig 5 there are two groups of parameters of the lstm namely the learning parameters and the hyperparameters the learning parameters can be updated during the training process automatically and the hyperparameters of the model cannot be updated while model training in many cases these hyperparameters need to be changed by the user to achieve optimal performance on a given dataset which is called model tuning in this study in each experiment the hyperparameters are manually calibrated by several trials in different trials the model is trained using a different set of hyperparameters the learning parameters including two groups of weights wf wi wg wo and rf ri rg ro and one group of biases bf bi bg bo are updated depending on a given loss function of an iteration step these parameters are optimized to minimize the root mean square error rmse of simulated et for efficient learning all input variables as well as the output data are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation lecun et al 2012 because we are more interested in the generalization ability of the model we need to delineate a portion of the validation samples not involved in training to evaluate the accuracy of the training model at each training session a single training session may cause overfitting due to the sample distribution therefore we use k fold cross validation yang et al 2017a 2017b the k fold cross validation divides the training sample into k random portions and one portion is selected as the validation set for each training session and the remaining k 1 portions are used as the training set therefore there are k times of training and corresponding k lstm models are obtained because too large values of k increase the training time and reduce the efficiency we set k to be 10 in this study the mean rmse of k validations is set as a criterion for evaluating the model performance fig 5 in different trials the optimal hyperparameters are determined by trial and error with the mean rmse fig 5 yang et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2018 the description of the hyperparameters in this study is shown in table 2 among these hyperparameters the number of lstm layers hidden units per layer and the number of maximum iterations are the major parameters zhang et al 2018 generally more layers and hidden units per layer lead to a better learning ability of the lstm model however too many layers and hidden units result in over fit in the training set and poor performance in the validation set also excessive training time in the calibration we found that when the number of hidden layers was 1 the model performance was poor due to insufficient learning ability when the number of layers was set to 2 the learning capacity was enhanced and the model showed good performance with the number of layers larger than 2 the improvement in learning ability was not significant and even decreased over fitting and the training time increased significantly this is consistent with many previous studies in which lstm usually had 2 hidden layers involving time series issues lecun et al 2015 kratzert et al 2018 2019 similarly we found that when the number of hidden layers was 2 and the number of hidden cells was greater than 100 the model improvement ceased and over fit occurred therefore we finally concluded that the number of hidden layers of 2 and the number of hidden cells of 100 were most suitable for the lstm zhang et al 2018 found that the number of maximum iterations more significantly improved the lstm than the number of hidden nodes we set minibatchsize to get appropriate iterations in this study table 2 furthermore in each of the training sessions in this study the decreasing trend of the loss function started to level off at around 25 epochs therefore we set the learningratedropfactor to reduce the initial learning rate after 25 epochs table 2 finally we use the test data to evaluate the ability of the lstm model for simulating et fig 5 in this study we more focused on the impact of the data on the lstm rather than the uncertainties of the architecture of the lstm more suggestions for model parameterization can be found in zhang et al 2018 systematic uncertainty analysis of the different hyperparameters was not done and is one of our future works 2 4 evaluation metrics for the evaluation of the model performance three commonly used statistical indicators kişi 2013 despotovic et al 2015 lu et al 2018 root mean square error rmse eq 8 coefficient of determination r2 eq 9 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse eq 10 were used 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i s y i o 2 9 r 2 i 1 n y i s y i s y i o y i o 2 i 1 n y i s y i s 2 i 1 n y i o y i o 2 10 nse 1 i 1 n y i o y i s 2 i 1 n y i o y i o 2 where yi s yi o y i s y i o and n are simulated et observed et mean of simulated et mean of observed et and sample size respectively rmse reflects the magnitude of the difference between the simulated and measured values r2 reflects the degree of fit between simulated and measured values nse reflects the accuracy of the variation of simulated and measured values in general the smaller the rmse the closer r2 and nse are to 1 the better the performance of the model lu et al 2018 considering dl may have the phenomenon of overfitting in addition to the above three quantitative indicators the graphs comparing the simulated values with the measured values were also used to evaluate the model performance 2 5 experiment design 2 5 1 experiment a data selection effect the simulation of et and epan using ml have poor performance with excessively few types of input data as reported in previous studies kişi 2006 in this study we designed experiment a and built a separate lstm model at each site in this experiment to evaluate the effect of input data selection for dl model performance we found that the four radiation variables rsd rsu rld and rlu had a high correlation with observed et and these four radiation variables have not been separated as inputs to the dl model in previous studies therefore the lstm model only using these four radiation fluxes as inputs was used in the first scenario a1 in experiment a as the base model in scenarios a2 a5 relative humidity air temperature soil moisture wind speed and radiation flux were modeled together in turn for training validation and test in the last scenario a6 we used all the above mentioned types of observations as input 80 of all data at each site was used for the model training set and the remaining 20 was used for the model test set fig 5 the set of hyperparameters is shown in table 2 2 5 2 experiment b data fusion effect the six stations are geographically dispersed on the qtp how well the data from the six sites were fused to develop a unified model to improve the model performance was the initial idea for designing this experiment in this experiment 80 of the total data observed at each site was drawn and merged to form a training set and the model was tested separately at each site using the remaining 20 of the data at each site the input data types for the model are the same as that in experiment a with a total of six scenarios the set of hyperparameters is shown in table 2 2 5 3 experiment c lead time effect the local meteorological variables related to et such as precipitation and water vapor content at the current day may be influenced by the meteorological variables in previous days through land atmosphere interactions which have been reported globally including the qtp chen et al 2019 gao et al 2020 li et al 2019b the time scale of such interactions has large spatial variations on the other hand compared to experiment b of multi source learning considering input from previous days is also a way to increase the amount of data for model training therefore the relationship between et in the current day and the meteorological variables in previous days in dl modeling needs to be investigated however the influence of sequence input on simulated et has not been considered in ml in previous studies experiment c is designed to study the lead time effect by lstm lstm can make the input data time continuous by changing the hyperparameter sequence length of the model it is called sequence length in matlab s lstm version or called time steps in other programming languages for the first two experiments we set the sequence length to be 1 figure s1 a in experiment c we set five gradients for the sequence length namely 1 2 7 14 30 in this experiment all kinds of continuously observed data were used as input variables for the model i e four types of radiation data wind speed air temperature relative humidity and soil water content for a successive sample set of length when the sequence length is t we composed one training sample of observed et of the current day with the input data of the current day and previous t 1 days figure s1 this will make et of the first t 1 days for one successive sample set at each site was not involved in the simulation only the observed et from the seventh day can be used figure s1 b when the sequence length increased the number of samples in the corresponding training and test sets decreased qo has a continuous observation record of 47 days which is the shortest continuous observation period in the dataset therefore the upper limit of the sequence length was set to one month to ensure the availability of data other criteria of the model data set remained the same as that in experiment b the set of hyperparameters is shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 sensitivity to types of input data experiment a is designed to test the selection for the types of input data for simulating et using the lstm model fig 6 and fig 7 show a comparison of the simulated and observed et for 4 sites in the test set at the bj site in experiment a the simulated et in scenarios a1 a2 a3 and a5 does not show large differences and it exhibits relatively flat fluctuations fig 6 a however the results in scenarios a4 and a6 which included the soil water content in the model input were significantly different from the other four scenarios in scenarios a4 and a6 the simulated et showed larger variations than that in the other scenarios and the simulated peaks were more close to the observations indicating a better agreement at the ma site the simulated et in scenarios a4 and a6 were also different from that in a1 a2 a3 and a5 fig 6 b compared with other scenarios the overestimation of et was reduced in a4 and a6 therefore these two sites have larger nse r2 and lower rmse in a4 and a6 than the other scenarios except a2 at the bj station table 3 and fig 8 qo and nam are two typical stations of the remaining four sites in experiment a compared with the base model in scenario a1 the performance of the model in other scenarios did not show significant differences fig 7 it also showed limited differences in rmse nse and r2 among the results in different scenarios table 3 a comparison of the simulated et and observations for the remaining two stations can be found in the supplementary materials and the results were consistent with that at qo and nam figure s2 previous work has demonstrated the key role of swc in estimating et using ml jung et al 2010 zhao et al 2019b the swc observed at the same depth of 20 cm was selected in experiment a for all the stations the varying sensitivity of the results to swc at different sites may be also related to the variability of swc at different depths fig 9 compares the variations of swc at different depths at five sites the se station was not shown due to abundant missing data of swc the vegetation cover of bj and nam is alpine meadow and alpine steppe respectively which have the largest vegetation cover among the five sites at the nam site swc at the 20 cm depth did not fluctuate as much as that at the 0 cm depth the sensitivity analysis to swc depth will be further discussed in section 4 1 it should be noted that the results in scenarios a2 and a4 were similar at the bj and qo sites as shown in table 3 or fig 8 these results imply that the variation in swc can be reflected by rh which was consistent with the relationship described by the complementary principle the bj qo and ma stations showed the best performance when running the model with all possible types of model inputs in a6 based on the rmse nse and r2 values shown in table 3 this finding is consistent with the conclusions in previous studies that the ml model works better with more input data types for simulating epan kişi 2006 2013 wang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 however the differences between a1 a4 and a6 were not significant these findings suggest that in areas where observations are scarce such as the qtp a few missing data types have little impact on the accuracy of dl however some methods based on physical processes cannot be applied with missing data types mital et al 2020 developed a new sequential imputation algorithm based on a random forest technique for interpolating the missing values in daily precipitation records they emphasized that for reliable imputation including a few strongly correlated variables in the input was more effective than including a large number of weakly correlated variables those data types such as ws and ta are crucial in the physical process based models but for ml they are redundant when there are enough similar inputs however the selection of key input data types cannot be independent from the understanding of the physical processes for example the simulation of bj and ma stations was strongly influenced by swc indicating that water stress has a non negligible effect on et 3 2 multi source learning and generalization ability of lstm experiment b was a study on the generalization ability of the lstm model to simulate et fig 10 and fig 11 show the simulated and observed et in the test set in four typical scenarios in experiment b the results of experiment a were also added for comparison in the figure the results in scenarios b2 b3 and b5 were quite similar therefore only the results of scenario b2 are shown in fig 10 the results of scenarios b3 and b5 can be found in figure s3 in the supplementary material the results in experiment a suggest a significant enhancement of model performance at the bj station when swc was added into the input so the results of scenario b4 are typically shown in fig 11 a in scenarios b1 b2 b3 and b5 the simulated et of the lstm model by fusing training of six sites has a greater range of variation at each site than the lstm model trained using data at a single site in experiment a in these four scenarios in experiment b except for the nad and se station the results of the model at the bj qo ma and nam station more closely matched the observations compared with the models with the same input in experiment a fig 8 shows the comparison of rmse and nse between experiment a and b the values of r2 can be found in figure s4 the bj ma and qo stations had lower rmse larger nse and r2 in experiment b than experiment a in almost all scenarios these three sites are far away from each other and are covered by different land covers data is the only tutor for dl shen et al 2018 with one data source it is hard for dl to break out of itself multi source learning for dl can be considered as multiple tutors to help dl to improve its performance compared to the stations with good spatial coverage on the plains the stations on the qtp are usually far apart the good performance for multi source learning at the bj ma and qo stations also provide a potential opportunity of applying the fusing training dl model at these sites to upscale simulating et on the qtp using remote sensing products however the values of the statistical metrics at the nad se and nam stations suggest that the simulated et showed worse performance in experiment b than experiment a this result may be caused by the different climate patterns at these stations and it implies that there are some limitations on the generalization ability of the lstm the effect of differences in the climate characteristics between sites on the generalization ability of the lstm model is further discussed in section 4 2 3 3 the effect of lead time of the input data on the et simulation the input data in both experiments a and b did not consider the time series of input data figs 12 and 13 showed the results in the test set at 4 typical stations in experiment c the simulated et did not differ much from c1 to c5 at the bj site fig 12 a at the nad site in scenario c1 with the sequence length equal to 1 the simulated et showed the largest fluctuations with the greatest number of peaks and the peaks were reduced in scenario c2 as the sequence length increased the underestimation of observed large et was enhanced fig 12 b although the decrease in the number of peaks as the increase in sequence length was also illustrated at the qo and nam site fig 13 the simulated et is not as unsatisfactory as that at the nad site the reduction of simulated peaks as sequence length increased was also found at the ma and se sites shown in figure s5 fig 14 displays the variation of the values of the three statistical metrics as the sequence length increased except for the nad site all the other five stations showed a decreasing trend in rmse and an increasing trend in nse and r2 as the sequence length increased when the sequence length was less than 7 this result implies that consideration of meteorological inputs within a one week lead time period is useful for improving the et estimation by dl from the perspective of data considering input from the lead time period is also a way to increase the amount of input data this means we use multiple input data to simulate one day s et dl can learn more information from more input data however fig 14 also shows that the rmse nse and r2 at the bj qo and ma sites did not show significant changes as sequence length increased this is because that the climate at these stations was mainly influenced by large scale atmosphere circulations and water vapor transport from oceans therefore there was a weak strength of land atmosphere interactions at these stations gao et al 2020 this leads to a weak relationship between meteorological variables in previous days and the et on the current day in contrast the nam site is located near a lake the lake leads to a strong strength of local land atmosphere interactions and a long period of local water recycling this causes a significant relationship between the meteorological variables in the lead time period and the et at the current day similar reasons may also explain the results at the se site shown in fig 14 the se site is located in a mountain valley close to the forested southeastern qtp where complex local topography and large vegetation coverage may also lead to strong local land atmosphere interactions therefore the simulated et can be improved at the nam and se sites as sequence length increases however the nad site showed the opposite performance the reason for this is further explained and discussed in section 4 2 in previous studies of using ml to model epan and et researchers disregarded the time series of the model input data so they composed a training sample including the daily or monthly et and input and broke up the composing sample for training the lstm model can consider the consecutive time series of the model input data in simulation which differs from the ml models used in previous studies compared to multi source learning considering input in a lead time period is also a way to increase the amount of input data to improve the performance in the data poor region 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of soil moisture observation depth on et simulation the gradient of the depth for observed swc varied among different sites fig 9 the depth of 20 cm is the depth at which continuous observations of swc are recorded for all six sites in this study we found that swc had a noticeable effect on the estimation of et at the bj and ma stations we further compared the swc of different depths at other typical stations except for the se which does not have swc observations above 20 cm and the results are displayed in table 4 the sensitivity analysis of swc observation depth is based on the model in scenario a4 at the bj site which was sensitive to the input of swc results of model input of observed swc at the depth of 4 cm were added as a comparison with the original results of scenario a4 fig 15 a the lstm model overestimated et in spring circled by an ellipse both for the results of model input of swc at 4 cm and 20 cm depth the results of model input of swc at 4 cm depth had a more evident overestimation of et than that of swc at 20 cm depth in spring where they differed most clearly however the rmse r2 and nse had similar values for the input with swc at these two different depths table 4 the qo site is selected as the typical station where land type is alpine desert for sensitivity analysis although apparent discrepancy didn t exist in the comparison of model input of swc at 0 cm 10 cm and 20 cm depth for estimating et in fig 15 b employing swc observed at a shallow depth as input led to a lower rmse and larger nse than that at 20 cm depth table 4 and table 3 this result indicates that including swc at the shallow depth improved the et estimation at the qo site the nam site is selected as another typical station where land cover is alpine steppe including swc at 0 cm depth in the input the simulated et was closer to the observations although observed et was still overestimated the improvement in the values of the statistical metrics also demonstrates the improved model performance table 4 the height of the grass at the nam site is shorter than that at the bj site and the root depth is relatively shallow therefore the swc at 0 cm had a larger effect on transpiration than swc at 20 cm this result implies that the root depth of grass may influence the selection of swc observation depth this also interprets why the dl model performs well in experiment a2 at this site which can also be interpreted by the complementary principle 4 2 the impact of different climatology on multi source learning the elevated topography of the qtp not only acts as a barrier to the midlatitude westerlies but also strengthens the indian monsoon through its dynamical and thermal impacts thus contributing to large scale atmospheric circulation bothe et al 2011 the eastern of the qtp is also influenced by the east asian monsoon yao et al 2013 based on the observed annual mean wind fields yao et al 2013 ma is influenced by the westerlies wind all year round the bj and qo sites are influenced by the westerlies in winter and the indian monsoon in summer therefore there were stable climate patterns at these sites in contrast the nad site is located at the convergence zone of the indian monsoon and westerly wind where these two atmospheric circulations interact intensively the nad site was selected as an excellent location for the study of westerly monsoon interactions on the desert landscape ma et al 2020 this implies that et at nad was influenced by the climate interacted by the dry westerlies and humid indian monsoon which was an unstable pattern this can be demonstrated in experiment c that when considering the meteorological input during one week or one month leading time the simulated et became worse this finding implies that there was a complex relationship between meteorological input and et within a week or a month which was not captured by the training of data under stable climate patterns at other stations this also explains the poor model performance at nad in multi source learning the climate at the se site is influenced by both the east asian monsoon and the indian monsoon also resulting in poor performance in multi source learning at this station due to the unstable pattern the nam site is located on the banks of lake nam co with the nyainqentanglha mountain behind the lake has a significant influence on the climate at this site and it plays a certain role in regulating variations in air temperature and precipitation ma et al 2020 our results found that et at the nam site was sensitive to humidity and temperature input in experiment a fig 8 these results imply that the influence of lakes on the local microclimate had an evident effect on et therefore the application of multi source learning by dl should also consider the physical processes such as the climate pattern local landscapes which helps us improve the selection of sites to upscaling et simulation by dl 4 3 determination of similarity in et characteristics of sites recent studies have involved fusing multiple sites to simulate et by ml fang et al 2020a applied the support vector regression svr method to develop an et dataset for the cropland in the north china plain ncp by integrating eight flux sites all sites had similar climatic conditions land surface types and human disturbances pang et al 2021 also applied svr to simulate et over the temperate semi arid grassland of china tsgc with 13 flux towers they built two separate sets of svr models on the steppe and sandy grassland respectively the six sites used for the multi source model in this study are distinct in terms of elevation climatic zone air temperature et values and subsurface conditions the reasonability for qualitatively judging the similarity of individual sites by these metrics seems inadequate for ml or dl that are only sensitive to the input and output data and do not take physical factors into account we did a correlation analysis between each variable at the six sites fig 16 the matrix of correlation coefficients for the four radiative variables and ws ta rh and swc is framed in red in fig 16 in general the correlations between the four radiative variables and the other input variables at the six sites showed similar results at nad there was a positive correlation between ws and radiation and this is different from the results at the other five sites which showed a negative correlation between radiation and ws this result may also explain that nad is interacted by the westerlies and indian monsoon which led to the worst results in simulated et by multi source learning the correlations between the four radiative variables upper left area of the subplot and the remaining four variables lower right area of the subplot show almost identical results across the six sites we can surmise that if the correlation between the input variables is the same across sites sites in a stable climate regime then the sites can be considered to be similar for ml or dl multi source learning allows the model to learn a wider range of similar data and more training reduces the errors for model simulation 4 4 comparison with previous studies on et estimation using ml and the advantages of dl for estimating et some previous studies have focused on using ml to estimate epan kişi 2006 2013 wang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 majhi et al 2020 yaseen et al 2020 however epan doesn t represent et and converting epan to et is still a tricky issue han and tian 2020 thus it is necessary to estimate et directly using ml some previous studies estimated et using the nondeep learning method jung et al 2011 tramontana et al 2016 li et al 2018 chen et al 2020 simulated et and vegetation transpiration in vegetable farmland in southern china in the growing seasons using svr they emphasized that air temperature and solar radiation were essential inputs for ml models this finding is different from the results of this study which suggests that air temperature is not necessary if radiation has been included in model inputs this difference may be because that the air temperature and radiation have similar patterns of fluctuation and are highly correlated see fig 16 chen et al 2020 mainly focused on the transpiration estimation in the growing season and we estimated the et for the whole year including the warm season with vegetation existence and cold season with complex land atmosphere interactions due to snow cover or frozen soil zhao et al 2019b considered the vegetation factor likewise and found that vegetation height and soil moisture were the main regulators of et and surface resistance at the sites in this study it was extremely difficult to obtain detailed observations on the vegetation on the other hand including the upward long and short wave radiation in the model input in this study indirectly reflect the effect of vegetation on et training and validating the growing season data and simulating et separately in cold and warm seasons on the qtp is a future work in this study we investigated some features for dl which are not analyzed in the previous ml studies for et estimation we have indicated that the time series of model input may influence the et estimation using dl and this was not considered in the previous studies in this study we found that multi source learning may improve the model performance of dl for et estimation this means that for et estimation at an individual site the data at other sites which have stable climate and locate far away from it are probably also beneficial for dl developing a single dl model by pooled data from multi sites is better than building a model separately using limited data at each site appropriate consideration of the time series of the input data for multi source training could also improve the simulation this implies that the dl has a great power of transfer learning this finding is quite different from the traditional physical based hydrological or land surface models which usually perform best by calibration separately at individual sites or regions this is also different from that of some previous studies for et estimation using ml for example lu et al 2018 suggested only a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations was recommended for cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy for estimating daily epan however it is consistent with the findings of a preprint by fang et al 2021 for estimating soil moisture and streamflow in the usa using dl process based physical models commonly require an extensive array of ground level parameter estimation and model calibration to attain model certainty this study highlights that the dl model is a fast and low cost method to simulate et simulating et overall qtp using dl and comparison with the physically modeled or remote sensing et product for example the monthly et during 2001 2018 estimated by han et al 2021 is another future work 5 conclusion this study explores the ability of deep learning to simulate et in areas where observed data are scarce using six stations on the qinghai tibetan plateau as an example the characteristics of the lstm model to simulate et was investigated using three sets of experiments the following conclusions summarize the characteristics of the lstm model for simulating et based on our results which reflect the advantages of deep learning over the physical process based methods in areas where observed data are scarce 1 the lstm model showed the best performance with all available types of data as inputs suggesting that it is better to provide comprehensive types of data for dl when there is enough data when using the four radiative fluxes as input adding some extra types of data from existing observations does not significantly change the results except for soil water content this suggests that in the data poor region the lstm model just needs key input data when simulating et while process based physical methods often cannot be applied without one or two data types which is the aspect where deep learning may superior to process based physical methods for et estimation 2 data from distant stations on the qtp are fused to build an lstm model further demonstrating the ability of deep learning to generalize in simulating et more importantly this multi source learning model performs significantly better than the models built separately using an increased variety of input data at some individual sites where the climate is stable and similar process based physical methods often require a unique set of parameters for different regions whereas deep learning can be used to obtain a common set of parameters for different regions through multi source learning this also brings the potential opportunity of applying the multi source learning model in conjunction with remote sensing products to upscale simulating et by dl on the qtp 3 in the precedent applications using machine learning to simulate et the time series of the input data is not considered in this study this is considered in the deep learning simulation of et this aspect is considered by appropriately changing the value of the sequence length the results suggest that the lstm model simulations can be improved by setting the appropriate sequence length this is also a way to increase the amount of training for dl in data poor regions the above findings demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of deep learning for estimating et in areas where observed data are scarce such as the qtp in future work it requires exploring the impact of adding distinctive input data types such as snow cover on the simulation of et in winter it still needs to be investigated whether the conclusions obtained from experiments on small scale sites in this study can be applied to the estimation of et on large scales by the lstm model credit authorship

3601,the estimation of actual evapotranspiration is a difficult issue in hydrological research particularly in the scarcely observed region deep learning dl has been increasingly used in the field of hydrology in recent years in this study we investigated the ability of dl on actual evapotranspiration estimation using three sets of controlled experiments at a typical region with scarce observations the qinghai tibetan plateau the results suggest that the dl model can utilize a few key types of observation data to simulate actual evapotranspiration and more in situ observation data types did not significantly improve the accuracy of dl simulations a multi source dl model established by integrating data from distantly distributed stations showed a better performance than the model built separately using data at individual sites moreover further analysis of climate pattern and input data correlation was conducted for the similarity of stations for multi source learning of the dl model using inputs in the lead time period can improve the simulation of daily et by dl compared with traditional process based physical methods the dl model is more flexible to simulate actual evapotranspiration in areas with insufficient observed data such as the qinghai tibetan plateau the results of this study highlight the potential power of dl model to improve the actual evapotranspiration estimation in the scarcely observed region keywords evapotranspiration deep learning the qinghai tibetan plateau multi source learning scarcely observed region 1 introduction evapotranspiration et in this paper it refers to the actual evaporation comprising vegetation transpiration intercepted water evaporation and soil evaporation is the major water flux from the earth to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 and is also quite difficult to estimate due to the complex interactions of the land plant atmosphere system xu and singh 2005 it is important to investigate the changes in evapotranspiration for their significant relevance to climate change brutsaert and parlange 1998 however reliable in situ observations such as the eddy covariance observed et baldocchi et al 2010 are still quite limited in many regions and till now it is still very difficult to continuously observe the evapotranspiration rates at the catchment scale samain et al 2012 the development of process based physical theories for et estimation such as the complementary principle bouchet 1963 han and tian 2020 zhang and brutsaert 2021 based on the principle of hydrothermal equilibrium contributes to et estimation at the regional scale the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 based on the aerodynamic thermodynamic and semi empirical formula is useful for estimating et at the point scale however they still need to empirically estimate some parameters such as the surface resistance which is a great challenge particularly in the regions with poor in situ observations at large spatial scales advances in satellite remote sensing have provided a possible way to estimate et samain et al 2012 famiglietti et al 2015 hu and jia 2015 li et al 2019a yuan et al 2021 the land surface model ek et al 2003 dai et al 2003 is another method to estimate et at the catchment scale however these two indirect methods require data from in situ observations for model calibration and validation long and singh 2013 zhao et al 2019a and they need various types of input data such as meteorological variables and vegetation parameters which restrict their applications in poorly gauged regions in recent years in addition to deepening the understanding of the hydrological process the hydrology community is poised to fully explore the power in the vast amount of data using machine learning ml in various fields of hydrology tao et al 2016 yang et al 2017a kratzert et al 2018 2019 shen et al 2021 ml provides a new method for hydrological simulation and prediction deep learning dl is an ml approach that consists of a collection of advanced artificial neural network ann research which has gained great momentum since 2012 and has proved to be more effective than other ml methods lecun et al 2015 shen 2018 for example precipitation has been extracted from satellite cloud images by the stacked denoising auto encoder sdae with 4 layers and 1000 hidden nodes tao et al 2016 the long short term memory networks lstm models were successfully used to predict the streamflow for hundreds of basins over the united states kratzert et al 2018 2019 it also ignited a surge in dl applications for modeling the other components of the hydrologic cycle such as the vadose zone hydrology bandai and ghezzehei 2021 soil moisture fang et al 2019 and water management by reservoirs zhang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 in the field of potential evapotranspiration which is the key ingredient for running hydrological models bai et al 2016 some studies used ml to simulate the pan evaporation epan kişi 2006 2013 wang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 majhi et al 2020 yaseen et al 2020 for example five different neuro fuzzy nf models were developed to improve the accuracy of daily epan estimation by comprising the daily climatic variables kişi 2006 for the estimation of et and vegetation transpiration some studies compared the merits and demerits of different ml models chen et al 2020 and some studies focused on upscaling the observed et by eddy covariance to large scales using ml jung et al 2011 tramontana et al 2016 li et al 2018 these studies mainly estimated et using non deep learning methods such as the regression method tree based method or artificial neural network etc so far the studies on dl models for estimating et is still insufficient bennett and nijssen 2021 moreover the cross station applications of ml have not yet been demonstrated for estimating et and the structure of the ml models used in the previous study did not consider the time series of the input data the meteorological data and et observations in a sample set of their studies were all from the same day or month the lstm model one of the widely used dl models whose advantage is to learn long term dependencies between the provided input and output of the network has been applied to simulate the streamflow soil moisture and other links of the hydrological cycle kratzert et al 2018 2019 fang et al 2020b and has rarely been studied in et estimation compared with other terrestrial regions in the world due to its steep topography complex landforms harsh and uninhabitable climate and in situ observation records on the qinghai tibetan plateau qtp are very scarce therefore estimating or understanding the change in et in the qtp is a great challenge since 1970 some in situ meteorological observations have been carried out tao et al 1986 wang 1999 ma et al 2006 which have greatly promoted the study of land atmosphere exchange and et on the qtp however long term field observations with fine time resolution are still quite limited in the qtp to overcome the lack of quantity and quality of observational data ma et al 2020 developed an hourly observation dataset from 2005 to 2016 including meteorological data and flux data observed using the eddy covariance method at six stations although the observations contain detailed hourly data the data integrity of each station in the observation of the latent heat flux linked to et ranges from 45 to 73 on an annual average other observational meteorological data in the same period also has large numbers of missing data which limits the application of traditional methods of et estimation based on thermodynamics and aerodynamics therefore a more efficient method to estimate et in poorly observed regions such as the qtp requires to be studied from the above this paper aims to investigate the ability of dl for estimating et in the qtp using lstm we attempt to address the following three questions 1 whether the selection of observed data types affects the accuracy of simulating et using dl 2 could cross stations learning be applied at distant stations and how this multi source learning affects the simulation of et by dl models 3 whether the time series of input data can improve the simulation of et using the dl models especially in the context of multi source learning in this study we find that radiation flux and soil water content are key types of input for the dl model and the multi source learning can improve the et simulation by dl inputs from the previous days can be used to increase the accuracy of daily et estimation by dl 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area data from an integrated land atmosphere interaction observation network of six field stations are used in this study fig 1 it includes the muztagh ata westerly observation and research station chinese academy of sciences ma cas the ngari desert observation and research station cas nad the bj site of nagqu station of plateau climate and environment cas npce bj hereinafter abbreviates to bj in the central qtp the nam co monitoring and research station for multisphere interactions cas nam the qomolangma atmospheric and environmental observation and research station cas qo and the southeast tibet observation and research station for the alpine environment cas se the detailed location the description of the vegetation types and the mean annual precipitation of these stations are shown in fig 1 and table 1 zhang 2007 yang and he 2019 he et al 2020 a detailed description can be found in ma et al 2020 here we briefly described these six stations the ma site has the highest elevation among the six stations and the climate at this station is influenced by the westerly wind all year round sparse and short grass scatters around the station and the soil type at this station is predominately sandy soil the ground at the bj station is covered by meadow and the height of the grasses is up to 5 cm the soil at this station is predominately sandy silt loam the nad station is located at the convergence zone of the indian monsoon and westerly wind where these two atmospheric circulation systems interact intensively there are very short grasses 1 2 cm on the sandy soil and gravel surface at this station the nam station is located near the bank of lake nam co the soil type at this station is predominantly sandy silt loam and the land cover is alpine steppe the climate at this station is greatly influenced by the local mesoscale system the qo station is located at the bottom of the lower rongbuk valley to the north of mt everest there is sparse and short vegetation on the sand and gravel surface the se station is located in a mountain valley close to the forested southeastern qtp the climate of this station is influenced by the south asian monsoon the land ground at this station is covered by dense vegetation however this station has the most missing observations among the six stations 2 2 data used variations and characteristics of the monthly observation variables at six stations are shown in fig 2 the raw data observed at the six stations are hourly resolution the daily data was obtained by the raw data and was used as input data of the lstm model the radiative fluxes data in the input of the model contain downward shortwave radiation rsd upward shortwave radiation rsu downward longwave radiation rld upward longwave radiation rlu data we do not use net radiation as model input mainly considering that upward long and short wave radiation can also reflect the land surface condition of the site such as vegetation type vegetation cover etc which have a great influence on the et estimation other meteorological elements of the input data include wind speed ws wind direction wd air temperature ta and relative humidity rh the height of the data measurement is slightly different at different stations but it is all within the range of 1 2 m above ground level soil data of the input is soil water content swc observed at the depth of 20 cm in the experiment the air temperature was used instead of soil temperature as input because they have a high correlation and there was a large amount of missing data for soil temperature daily et was obtained by the latent heat flux le data obtained from the eddy covariance observations there are some missing data at each observation station due to natural and equipment reasons for data continuity continuous records for more than 1 month and data integrity containing at least 10 data attributes the continuous available data period for the 6 stations was compiled and are shown in table s1 in the supplementary material further descriptions of data continuity and integrity are shown in table s2 2 3 the lstm model lstm is an improvement of the traditional rnn recurrent neural network model hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 lstm solves the problem of gradient

from 0 to 1 σ is the logistic sigmoid function and wf rf and bf are three sets of learning parameters of the forget gate in the first time step the first hidden state h is initialized by a vector of zeros with a user defined length before computing the second gate cell candidate gt fig 4 b is used to represent a potential update vector for the cell state 2 g t tanh w g x t r g h t 1 b g where gt is a vector with values in the range 1 1 tanh is the hyperbolic tangent and wg rg and bg are another set of learning parameters the second gate fig 4 c is the input gate it 3 i t σ w i x t r i h t 1 b i where it is a vector with values in the range 0 1 and wi ri and bi are a set of learning parameters input gate it is defined as the amount of information used to update the cell state in gt combining the results of equations 1 3 the cell state ct fig 4 d is updated by the following equation 4 c t f t c t 1 i t g t where ʘ denotes element wise multiplication ft ʘ ct 1 can be interpreted as information stored in ct 1 which will be forgotten and it ʘ gt denotes new information stored in gt that will be added to the cell state the cell state is initialized by a vector of zeros in the first time step the last gate fig 4 e is the output gate ot 5 o t σ w o x t r o h t 1 b o where wo ro and bo are a set of learning parameters output gate controls the information of ct that flows into the new hidden state fig 4 f ht 6 h t tanh c t o t to compute the final simulated et the output from the last lstm layer at the last time step hn is used as input into a dense layer figure s1 in the supplementary material 7 y w d h n b d where y is the simulated et by lstm hn is the output of the last lstm layer at the last time step wd and bd are the weight matrix of the dense layer and the bias term respectively the lstm was run using the matlab r2020b version the deep learning toolbox lstm layer 2 3 2 parameter calibration of the lstm model and data set firstly we need to delineate a test set which is unreachable by the model during training and in this study we set it as 20 of the total sample size yang et al 2017a 2017b all diagrams which compare the simulated et with observed et and diagrams of values of the statistical metrics in this paper are based on the test set fig 5 secondly the remaining 80 samples are used to train lstm to calibrate the parameters and validate the model the flowchart for partitioning the dataset training model and evaluating the simulated et in a designed experiment is shown in fig 5 there are two groups of parameters of the lstm namely the learning parameters and the hyperparameters the learning parameters can be updated during the training process automatically and the hyperparameters of the model cannot be updated while model training in many cases these hyperparameters need to be changed by the user to achieve optimal performance on a given dataset which is called model tuning in this study in each experiment the hyperparameters are manually calibrated by several trials in different trials the model is trained using a different set of hyperparameters the learning parameters including two groups of weights wf wi wg wo and rf ri rg ro and one group of biases bf bi bg bo are updated depending on a given loss function of an iteration step these parameters are optimized to minimize the root mean square error rmse of simulated et for efficient learning all input variables as well as the output data are normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation lecun et al 2012 because we are more interested in the generalization ability of the model we need to delineate a portion of the validation samples not involved in training to evaluate the accuracy of the training model at each training session a single training session may cause overfitting due to the sample distribution therefore we use k fold cross validation yang et al 2017a 2017b the k fold cross validation divides the training sample into k random portions and one portion is selected as the validation set for each training session and the remaining k 1 portions are used as the training set therefore there are k times of training and corresponding k lstm models are obtained because too large values of k increase the training time and reduce the efficiency we set k to be 10 in this study the mean rmse of k validations is set as a criterion for evaluating the model performance fig 5 in different trials the optimal hyperparameters are determined by trial and error with the mean rmse fig 5 yang et al 2017a 2017b zhang et al 2018 the description of the hyperparameters in this study is shown in table 2 among these hyperparameters the number of lstm layers hidden units per layer and the number of maximum iterations are the major parameters zhang et al 2018 generally more layers and hidden units per layer lead to a better learning ability of the lstm model however too many layers and hidden units result in over fit in the training set and poor performance in the validation set also excessive training time in the calibration we found that when the number of hidden layers was 1 the model performance was poor due to insufficient learning ability when the number of layers was set to 2 the learning capacity was enhanced and the model showed good performance with the number of layers larger than 2 the improvement in learning ability was not significant and even decreased over fitting and the training time increased significantly this is consistent with many previous studies in which lstm usually had 2 hidden layers involving time series issues lecun et al 2015 kratzert et al 2018 2019 similarly we found that when the number of hidden layers was 2 and the number of hidden cells was greater than 100 the model improvement ceased and over fit occurred therefore we finally concluded that the number of hidden layers of 2 and the number of hidden cells of 100 were most suitable for the lstm zhang et al 2018 found that the number of maximum iterations more significantly improved the lstm than the number of hidden nodes we set minibatchsize to get appropriate iterations in this study table 2 furthermore in each of the training sessions in this study the decreasing trend of the loss function started to level off at around 25 epochs therefore we set the learningratedropfactor to reduce the initial learning rate after 25 epochs table 2 finally we use the test data to evaluate the ability of the lstm model for simulating et fig 5 in this study we more focused on the impact of the data on the lstm rather than the uncertainties of the architecture of the lstm more suggestions for model parameterization can be found in zhang et al 2018 systematic uncertainty analysis of the different hyperparameters was not done and is one of our future works 2 4 evaluation metrics for the evaluation of the model performance three commonly used statistical indicators kişi 2013 despotovic et al 2015 lu et al 2018 root mean square error rmse eq 8 coefficient of determination r2 eq 9 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse eq 10 were used 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i s y i o 2 9 r 2 i 1 n y i s y i s y i o y i o 2 i 1 n y i s y i s 2 i 1 n y i o y i o 2 10 nse 1 i 1 n y i o y i s 2 i 1 n y i o y i o 2 where yi s yi o y i s y i o and n are simulated et observed et mean of simulated et mean of observed et and sample size respectively rmse reflects the magnitude of the difference between the simulated and measured values r2 reflects the degree of fit between simulated and measured values nse reflects the accuracy of the variation of simulated and measured values in general the smaller the rmse the closer r2 and nse are to 1 the better the performance of the model lu et al 2018 considering dl may have the phenomenon of overfitting in addition to the above three quantitative indicators the graphs comparing the simulated values with the measured values were also used to evaluate the model performance 2 5 experiment design 2 5 1 experiment a data selection effect the simulation of et and epan using ml have poor performance with excessively few types of input data as reported in previous studies kişi 2006 in this study we designed experiment a and built a separate lstm model at each site in this experiment to evaluate the effect of input data selection for dl model performance we found that the four radiation variables rsd rsu rld and rlu had a high correlation with observed et and these four radiation variables have not been separated as inputs to the dl model in previous studies therefore the lstm model only using these four radiation fluxes as inputs was used in the first scenario a1 in experiment a as the base model in scenarios a2 a5 relative humidity air temperature soil moisture wind speed and radiation flux were modeled together in turn for training validation and test in the last scenario a6 we used all the above mentioned types of observations as input 80 of all data at each site was used for the model training set and the remaining 20 was used for the model test set fig 5 the set of hyperparameters is shown in table 2 2 5 2 experiment b data fusion effect the six stations are geographically dispersed on the qtp how well the data from the six sites were fused to develop a unified model to improve the model performance was the initial idea for designing this experiment in this experiment 80 of the total data observed at each site was drawn and merged to form a training set and the model was tested separately at each site using the remaining 20 of the data at each site the input data types for the model are the same as that in experiment a with a total of six scenarios the set of hyperparameters is shown in table 2 2 5 3 experiment c lead time effect the local meteorological variables related to et such as precipitation and water vapor content at the current day may be influenced by the meteorological variables in previous days through land atmosphere interactions which have been reported globally including the qtp chen et al 2019 gao et al 2020 li et al 2019b the time scale of such interactions has large spatial variations on the other hand compared to experiment b of multi source learning considering input from previous days is also a way to increase the amount of data for model training therefore the relationship between et in the current day and the meteorological variables in previous days in dl modeling needs to be investigated however the influence of sequence input on simulated et has not been considered in ml in previous studies experiment c is designed to study the lead time effect by lstm lstm can make the input data time continuous by changing the hyperparameter sequence length of the model it is called sequence length in matlab s lstm version or called time steps in other programming languages for the first two experiments we set the sequence length to be 1 figure s1 a in experiment c we set five gradients for the sequence length namely 1 2 7 14 30 in this experiment all kinds of continuously observed data were used as input variables for the model i e four types of radiation data wind speed air temperature relative humidity and soil water content for a successive sample set of length when the sequence length is t we composed one training sample of observed et of the current day with the input data of the current day and previous t 1 days figure s1 this will make et of the first t 1 days for one successive sample set at each site was not involved in the simulation only the observed et from the seventh day can be used figure s1 b when the sequence length increased the number of samples in the corresponding training and test sets decreased qo has a continuous observation record of 47 days which is the shortest continuous observation period in the dataset therefore the upper limit of the sequence length was set to one month to ensure the availability of data other criteria of the model data set remained the same as that in experiment b the set of hyperparameters is shown in table 2 3 results 3 1 sensitivity to types of input data experiment a is designed to test the selection for the types of input data for simulating et using the lstm model fig 6 and fig 7 show a comparison of the simulated and observed et for 4 sites in the test set at the bj site in experiment a the simulated et in scenarios a1 a2 a3 and a5 does not show large differences and it exhibits relatively flat fluctuations fig 6 a however the results in scenarios a4 and a6 which included the soil water content in the model input were significantly different from the other four scenarios in scenarios a4 and a6 the simulated et showed larger variations than that in the other scenarios and the simulated peaks were more close to the observations indicating a better agreement at the ma site the simulated et in scenarios a4 and a6 were also different from that in a1 a2 a3 and a5 fig 6 b compared with other scenarios the overestimation of et was reduced in a4 and a6 therefore these two sites have larger nse r2 and lower rmse in a4 and a6 than the other scenarios except a2 at the bj station table 3 and fig 8 qo and nam are two typical stations of the remaining four sites in experiment a compared with the base model in scenario a1 the performance of the model in other scenarios did not show significant differences fig 7 it also showed limited differences in rmse nse and r2 among the results in different scenarios table 3 a comparison of the simulated et and observations for the remaining two stations can be found in the supplementary materials and the results were consistent with that at qo and nam figure s2 previous work has demonstrated the key role of swc in estimating et using ml jung et al 2010 zhao et al 2019b the swc observed at the same depth of 20 cm was selected in experiment a for all the stations the varying sensitivity of the results to swc at different sites may be also related to the variability of swc at different depths fig 9 compares the variations of swc at different depths at five sites the se station was not shown due to abundant missing data of swc the vegetation cover of bj and nam is alpine meadow and alpine steppe respectively which have the largest vegetation cover among the five sites at the nam site swc at the 20 cm depth did not fluctuate as much as that at the 0 cm depth the sensitivity analysis to swc depth will be further discussed in section 4 1 it should be noted that the results in scenarios a2 and a4 were similar at the bj and qo sites as shown in table 3 or fig 8 these results imply that the variation in swc can be reflected by rh which was consistent with the relationship described by the complementary principle the bj qo and ma stations showed the best performance when running the model with all possible types of model inputs in a6 based on the rmse nse and r2 values shown in table 3 this finding is consistent with the conclusions in previous studies that the ml model works better with more input data types for simulating epan kişi 2006 2013 wang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 however the differences between a1 a4 and a6 were not significant these findings suggest that in areas where observations are scarce such as the qtp a few missing data types have little impact on the accuracy of dl however some methods based on physical processes cannot be applied with missing data types mital et al 2020 developed a new sequential imputation algorithm based on a random forest technique for interpolating the missing values in daily precipitation records they emphasized that for reliable imputation including a few strongly correlated variables in the input was more effective than including a large number of weakly correlated variables those data types such as ws and ta are crucial in the physical process based models but for ml they are redundant when there are enough similar inputs however the selection of key input data types cannot be independent from the understanding of the physical processes for example the simulation of bj and ma stations was strongly influenced by swc indicating that water stress has a non negligible effect on et 3 2 multi source learning and generalization ability of lstm experiment b was a study on the generalization ability of the lstm model to simulate et fig 10 and fig 11 show the simulated and observed et in the test set in four typical scenarios in experiment b the results of experiment a were also added for comparison in the figure the results in scenarios b2 b3 and b5 were quite similar therefore only the results of scenario b2 are shown in fig 10 the results of scenarios b3 and b5 can be found in figure s3 in the supplementary material the results in experiment a suggest a significant enhancement of model performance at the bj station when swc was added into the input so the results of scenario b4 are typically shown in fig 11 a in scenarios b1 b2 b3 and b5 the simulated et of the lstm model by fusing training of six sites has a greater range of variation at each site than the lstm model trained using data at a single site in experiment a in these four scenarios in experiment b except for the nad and se station the results of the model at the bj qo ma and nam station more closely matched the observations compared with the models with the same input in experiment a fig 8 shows the comparison of rmse and nse between experiment a and b the values of r2 can be found in figure s4 the bj ma and qo stations had lower rmse larger nse and r2 in experiment b than experiment a in almost all scenarios these three sites are far away from each other and are covered by different land covers data is the only tutor for dl shen et al 2018 with one data source it is hard for dl to break out of itself multi source learning for dl can be considered as multiple tutors to help dl to improve its performance compared to the stations with good spatial coverage on the plains the stations on the qtp are usually far apart the good performance for multi source learning at the bj ma and qo stations also provide a potential opportunity of applying the fusing training dl model at these sites to upscale simulating et on the qtp using remote sensing products however the values of the statistical metrics at the nad se and nam stations suggest that the simulated et showed worse performance in experiment b than experiment a this result may be caused by the different climate patterns at these stations and it implies that there are some limitations on the generalization ability of the lstm the effect of differences in the climate characteristics between sites on the generalization ability of the lstm model is further discussed in section 4 2 3 3 the effect of lead time of the input data on the et simulation the input data in both experiments a and b did not consider the time series of input data figs 12 and 13 showed the results in the test set at 4 typical stations in experiment c the simulated et did not differ much from c1 to c5 at the bj site fig 12 a at the nad site in scenario c1 with the sequence length equal to 1 the simulated et showed the largest fluctuations with the greatest number of peaks and the peaks were reduced in scenario c2 as the sequence length increased the underestimation of observed large et was enhanced fig 12 b although the decrease in the number of peaks as the increase in sequence length was also illustrated at the qo and nam site fig 13 the simulated et is not as unsatisfactory as that at the nad site the reduction of simulated peaks as sequence length increased was also found at the ma and se sites shown in figure s5 fig 14 displays the variation of the values of the three statistical metrics as the sequence length increased except for the nad site all the other five stations showed a decreasing trend in rmse and an increasing trend in nse and r2 as the sequence length increased when the sequence length was less than 7 this result implies that consideration of meteorological inputs within a one week lead time period is useful for improving the et estimation by dl from the perspective of data considering input from the lead time period is also a way to increase the amount of input data this means we use multiple input data to simulate one day s et dl can learn more information from more input data however fig 14 also shows that the rmse nse and r2 at the bj qo and ma sites did not show significant changes as sequence length increased this is because that the climate at these stations was mainly influenced by large scale atmosphere circulations and water vapor transport from oceans therefore there was a weak strength of land atmosphere interactions at these stations gao et al 2020 this leads to a weak relationship between meteorological variables in previous days and the et on the current day in contrast the nam site is located near a lake the lake leads to a strong strength of local land atmosphere interactions and a long period of local water recycling this causes a significant relationship between the meteorological variables in the lead time period and the et at the current day similar reasons may also explain the results at the se site shown in fig 14 the se site is located in a mountain valley close to the forested southeastern qtp where complex local topography and large vegetation coverage may also lead to strong local land atmosphere interactions therefore the simulated et can be improved at the nam and se sites as sequence length increases however the nad site showed the opposite performance the reason for this is further explained and discussed in section 4 2 in previous studies of using ml to model epan and et researchers disregarded the time series of the model input data so they composed a training sample including the daily or monthly et and input and broke up the composing sample for training the lstm model can consider the consecutive time series of the model input data in simulation which differs from the ml models used in previous studies compared to multi source learning considering input in a lead time period is also a way to increase the amount of input data to improve the performance in the data poor region 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of soil moisture observation depth on et simulation the gradient of the depth for observed swc varied among different sites fig 9 the depth of 20 cm is the depth at which continuous observations of swc are recorded for all six sites in this study we found that swc had a noticeable effect on the estimation of et at the bj and ma stations we further compared the swc of different depths at other typical stations except for the se which does not have swc observations above 20 cm and the results are displayed in table 4 the sensitivity analysis of swc observation depth is based on the model in scenario a4 at the bj site which was sensitive to the input of swc results of model input of observed swc at the depth of 4 cm were added as a comparison with the original results of scenario a4 fig 15 a the lstm model overestimated et in spring circled by an ellipse both for the results of model input of swc at 4 cm and 20 cm depth the results of model input of swc at 4 cm depth had a more evident overestimation of et than that of swc at 20 cm depth in spring where they differed most clearly however the rmse r2 and nse had similar values for the input with swc at these two different depths table 4 the qo site is selected as the typical station where land type is alpine desert for sensitivity analysis although apparent discrepancy didn t exist in the comparison of model input of swc at 0 cm 10 cm and 20 cm depth for estimating et in fig 15 b employing swc observed at a shallow depth as input led to a lower rmse and larger nse than that at 20 cm depth table 4 and table 3 this result indicates that including swc at the shallow depth improved the et estimation at the qo site the nam site is selected as another typical station where land cover is alpine steppe including swc at 0 cm depth in the input the simulated et was closer to the observations although observed et was still overestimated the improvement in the values of the statistical metrics also demonstrates the improved model performance table 4 the height of the grass at the nam site is shorter than that at the bj site and the root depth is relatively shallow therefore the swc at 0 cm had a larger effect on transpiration than swc at 20 cm this result implies that the root depth of grass may influence the selection of swc observation depth this also interprets why the dl model performs well in experiment a2 at this site which can also be interpreted by the complementary principle 4 2 the impact of different climatology on multi source learning the elevated topography of the qtp not only acts as a barrier to the midlatitude westerlies but also strengthens the indian monsoon through its dynamical and thermal impacts thus contributing to large scale atmospheric circulation bothe et al 2011 the eastern of the qtp is also influenced by the east asian monsoon yao et al 2013 based on the observed annual mean wind fields yao et al 2013 ma is influenced by the westerlies wind all year round the bj and qo sites are influenced by the westerlies in winter and the indian monsoon in summer therefore there were stable climate patterns at these sites in contrast the nad site is located at the convergence zone of the indian monsoon and westerly wind where these two atmospheric circulations interact intensively the nad site was selected as an excellent location for the study of westerly monsoon interactions on the desert landscape ma et al 2020 this implies that et at nad was influenced by the climate interacted by the dry westerlies and humid indian monsoon which was an unstable pattern this can be demonstrated in experiment c that when considering the meteorological input during one week or one month leading time the simulated et became worse this finding implies that there was a complex relationship between meteorological input and et within a week or a month which was not captured by the training of data under stable climate patterns at other stations this also explains the poor model performance at nad in multi source learning the climate at the se site is influenced by both the east asian monsoon and the indian monsoon also resulting in poor performance in multi source learning at this station due to the unstable pattern the nam site is located on the banks of lake nam co with the nyainqentanglha mountain behind the lake has a significant influence on the climate at this site and it plays a certain role in regulating variations in air temperature and precipitation ma et al 2020 our results found that et at the nam site was sensitive to humidity and temperature input in experiment a fig 8 these results imply that the influence of lakes on the local microclimate had an evident effect on et therefore the application of multi source learning by dl should also consider the physical processes such as the climate pattern local landscapes which helps us improve the selection of sites to upscaling et simulation by dl 4 3 determination of similarity in et characteristics of sites recent studies have involved fusing multiple sites to simulate et by ml fang et al 2020a applied the support vector regression svr method to develop an et dataset for the cropland in the north china plain ncp by integrating eight flux sites all sites had similar climatic conditions land surface types and human disturbances pang et al 2021 also applied svr to simulate et over the temperate semi arid grassland of china tsgc with 13 flux towers they built two separate sets of svr models on the steppe and sandy grassland respectively the six sites used for the multi source model in this study are distinct in terms of elevation climatic zone air temperature et values and subsurface conditions the reasonability for qualitatively judging the similarity of individual sites by these metrics seems inadequate for ml or dl that are only sensitive to the input and output data and do not take physical factors into account we did a correlation analysis between each variable at the six sites fig 16 the matrix of correlation coefficients for the four radiative variables and ws ta rh and swc is framed in red in fig 16 in general the correlations between the four radiative variables and the other input variables at the six sites showed similar results at nad there was a positive correlation between ws and radiation and this is different from the results at the other five sites which showed a negative correlation between radiation and ws this result may also explain that nad is interacted by the westerlies and indian monsoon which led to the worst results in simulated et by multi source learning the correlations between the four radiative variables upper left area of the subplot and the remaining four variables lower right area of the subplot show almost identical results across the six sites we can surmise that if the correlation between the input variables is the same across sites sites in a stable climate regime then the sites can be considered to be similar for ml or dl multi source learning allows the model to learn a wider range of similar data and more training reduces the errors for model simulation 4 4 comparison with previous studies on et estimation using ml and the advantages of dl for estimating et some previous studies have focused on using ml to estimate epan kişi 2006 2013 wang et al 2017 feng et al 2018 lu et al 2018 majhi et al 2020 yaseen et al 2020 however epan doesn t represent et and converting epan to et is still a tricky issue han and tian 2020 thus it is necessary to estimate et directly using ml some previous studies estimated et using the nondeep learning method jung et al 2011 tramontana et al 2016 li et al 2018 chen et al 2020 simulated et and vegetation transpiration in vegetable farmland in southern china in the growing seasons using svr they emphasized that air temperature and solar radiation were essential inputs for ml models this finding is different from the results of this study which suggests that air temperature is not necessary if radiation has been included in model inputs this difference may be because that the air temperature and radiation have similar patterns of fluctuation and are highly correlated see fig 16 chen et al 2020 mainly focused on the transpiration estimation in the growing season and we estimated the et for the whole year including the warm season with vegetation existence and cold season with complex land atmosphere interactions due to snow cover or frozen soil zhao et al 2019b considered the vegetation factor likewise and found that vegetation height and soil moisture were the main regulators of et and surface resistance at the sites in this study it was extremely difficult to obtain detailed observations on the vegetation on the other hand including the upward long and short wave radiation in the model input in this study indirectly reflect the effect of vegetation on et training and validating the growing season data and simulating et separately in cold and warm seasons on the qtp is a future work in this study we investigated some features for dl which are not analyzed in the previous ml studies for et estimation we have indicated that the time series of model input may influence the et estimation using dl and this was not considered in the previous studies in this study we found that multi source learning may improve the model performance of dl for et estimation this means that for et estimation at an individual site the data at other sites which have stable climate and locate far away from it are probably also beneficial for dl developing a single dl model by pooled data from multi sites is better than building a model separately using limited data at each site appropriate consideration of the time series of the input data for multi source training could also improve the simulation this implies that the dl has a great power of transfer learning this finding is quite different from the traditional physical based hydrological or land surface models which usually perform best by calibration separately at individual sites or regions this is also different from that of some previous studies for et estimation using ml for example lu et al 2018 suggested only a distance of less than 100 km between two cross stations was recommended for cross station applications with satisfactory prediction accuracy for estimating daily epan however it is consistent with the findings of a preprint by fang et al 2021 for estimating soil moisture and streamflow in the usa using dl process based physical models commonly require an extensive array of ground level parameter estimation and model calibration to attain model certainty this study highlights that the dl model is a fast and low cost method to simulate et simulating et overall qtp using dl and comparison with the physically modeled or remote sensing et product for example the monthly et during 2001 2018 estimated by han et al 2021 is another future work 5 conclusion this study explores the ability of deep learning to simulate et in areas where observed data are scarce using six stations on the qinghai tibetan plateau as an example the characteristics of the lstm model to simulate et was investigated using three sets of experiments the following conclusions summarize the characteristics of the lstm model for simulating et based on our results which reflect the advantages of deep learning over the physical process based methods in areas where observed data are scarce 1 the lstm model showed the best performance with all available types of data as inputs suggesting that it is better to provide comprehensive types of data for dl when there is enough data when using the four radiative fluxes as input adding some extra types of data from existing observations does not significantly change the results except for soil water content this suggests that in the data poor region the lstm model just needs key input data when simulating et while process based physical methods often cannot be applied without one or two data types which is the aspect where deep learning may superior to process based physical methods for et estimation 2 data from distant stations on the qtp are fused to build an lstm model further demonstrating the ability of deep learning to generalize in simulating et more importantly this multi source learning model performs significantly better than the models built separately using an increased variety of input data at some individual sites where the climate is stable and similar process based physical methods often require a unique set of parameters for different regions whereas deep learning can be used to obtain a common set of parameters for different regions through multi source learning this also brings the potential opportunity of applying the multi source learning model in conjunction with remote sensing products to upscale simulating et by dl on the qtp 3 in the precedent applications using machine learning to simulate et the time series of the input data is not considered in this study this is considered in the deep learning simulation of et this aspect is considered by appropriately changing the value of the sequence length the results suggest that the lstm model simulations can be improved by setting the appropriate sequence length this is also a way to increase the amount of training for dl in data poor regions the above findings demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of deep learning for estimating et in areas where observed data are scarce such as the qtp in future work it requires exploring the impact of adding distinctive input data types such as snow cover on the simulation of et in winter it still needs to be investigated whether the conclusions obtained from experiments on small scale sites in this study can be applied to the estimation of et on large scales by the lstm model credit authorship

3602,this paper considers overland flow resistance at low reynolds numbers through analysis of experimental runs carried out using water only and water glycerol mixtures we first examined the power relationship between the darcy weisbach friction factor f and the reynolds number re to obtain the values of the k coefficient and b exponent these results confirmed the applicability of the values of b suggested in literature while k required a specific calibration for laminar open channel flows the analysis revealed that transition from a laminar to turbulent flow regime for water only flows occurred at a threshold value of re equal to 500 as described historically the estimate of f by the power relationship and the calibrated b and k values were reliable for water only runs when re 500 the measurements were also used to test a theoretical flow resistance law based on a power velocity distribution the calibrated theoretical relationship between the velocity profile parameter γv bed slope flow froude number and re enabled a good estimate of f for water flows for mixed fluid flows the effect of the velocity profile shape was considered calibrating this relationship by two datasets obtained setting a threshold reynolds number equal to 7 for flows with re 7 the shape of the velocity profile can be linear or convex while for flows at re 7 the shape of the velocity distribution is always concave the theoretical flow resistance allowed an accurate estimate also for mixed fluid flows even at re 7 the different shape of the power velocity distribution highlighted that mixed flows

flow is characterised by non homogeneity and non constancy of flow discharges due to complex topography geomorphology and rainfall emmett 1978 grismer 2016a pan et al 2016 in hillslope interrill erosion process rain impact detaches soil particles while overland flow is the main driving force to transport sediments from interrill areas to rills kinnell 2005 ali et al 2011 hessel and jetten 2007 nicosia et al 2021 smith et al 2007 the main characteristic of overland flow is the low value of water depth mutchler and young 1975 toy et al 2002 the study of overland flow is complex as the variables are not easily definable and simple hydraulic procedures for predicting overland flow are beset with many difficulties emmett 1970 an accurate estimate of friction factor coefficients is required for modelling runoff and soil erosion and directly affects the calculation of the mean flow velocity three widely applied empirical equations for calculating mean flow velocity darcy weisbach chézy and manning equations are currently used in runoff and soil erosion models smith et al 2007 in addition mean flow velocity affects the hillslope water flow path the prediction of sediment transport capacity soil erosion and pollutant transport govers et al 2000 hessel et al 2003 hu and abrahams 2005 kim et al 2012 recent studies have shown that soil erosion intensity is directly related to flow variables including shear stress stream power and unit stream power ali et al 2011 mahmoodabadi et al 2014 these variables are calculated by the flow depth and flow velocity of overland flow are affected by flow resistance and vary under different flow patterns rainfall rates and boundary conditions the darcy weisbach friction factor f of open channel flow hydraulics is often applied to study overland flow motion on different soils due to its applicability to both laminar and turbulent flows hessel et al 2003 li 2009 different opinions regarding overland flow regimes have been formulated horton 1945 and selby 1993 proposed the concept of mixed laminar turbulent flow to describe overland flows on a slope with the same viewpoint emmett 1970 found that overland flow is not strictly consistent with the laminar transitional and turbulent flows in the accepted sense and defined it as disturbed laminar flow when considering the effect of rainfall however overland flows in watershed modelling can often be laminar and the flow parameters associated with erosion across the landscape would be poorly predicted using turbulent flow assumptions grismer 2016a b woolhiser et al 1970 found that laminar flow becomes turbulent at a transitional reynolds number re vh ν k where v is the mean flow velocity h is the flow depth and νk is the kinematic viscosity of 300 for overland flow in rangeland watersheds however no objective procedure has been developed to estimate the transitional reynolds number morgali 1970 demonstrated that the laminar to turbulent transition occurs at a reynolds number of approximately 100 for a turf plane for a concrete surface the transitional reynolds number varies from 200 to 1000 yu and mcnown 1964 while that of open channel flows ranges from 500 to 700 yen 2002 savat 1980 considered a reynolds number of 600 as the critical reynolds number separating the laminar from the turbulent regimes in a rough supercritical sheet flow overland flow hydraulics are mainly affected by rainfall intensity and soil roughness nicosia et al 2020a regarding rainfall yoon and wenzel 1971 concluded that at re 2000 the rainfall intensity effects on flow resistance can be considered negligible while an increase in rainfall intensity always results in a higher flow resistance at re 2000 previous research has stated that for re 2000 the effect of rainfall impact is also negligible for rainfall intensities greater than a critical value occurring in the range of 31 75 95 25 mm h 1 nicosia et al 2020a as the bed surface affects the overland flow motion many experiments have been conducted for both smooth and rough beds the total flow resistance in smooth rough and sloping bed conditions is constituted by the internal fluid and frictional resistance at the channel boundary katz et al 1995 a uniform laminar flow which is not affected by boundary roughness is characterised by a linear variation in the flow shear stress with the bottom distance and by a flow velocity value equal to zero at the boundary the local velocity increases parabolically to a maximum velocity at the free surface katz et al 1995 yalin 1977 by integrating the parabolic velocity distribution the following expression for the mean velocity v can be obtained yalin 1977 1 v u 1 3 u h ν k where u grs is the shear velocity r is the hydraulic radius s is the bed slope and g is the acceleration due to gravity for laminar flow conditions by multiplying both members of eq 1 for v u and considering that the darcy weisbach friction factor f 8 u 2 v2 the following theoretical expression of f can be obtained katz et al 1995 yalin 1977 yoon and wenzel 1971 2 f k re where k is a constant equal to 24 for a uniform flow on a smooth bed myers 2002 yen 2002 savat 1980 and roels 1984 suggested that the overland flow resistance law can be expressed by the following relationship 3 f k re b where b is a coefficient for laminar flow b is equal to 1 and k is related to surface roughness phelps 1975 savat 1980 for turbulent flow the value of b is 0 25 and k is related to slope gradient flow depth and surface roughness savat 1980 therefore as b 1 for overland flow characterised by a laminar flow regime eqs 2 and 3 are coincident for this hydraulic condition for an overland flow under rainfall yoon and wenzel 1971 and katz et al 1995 demonstrated that the constant k exceeds the theoretical value for smooth laminar flow and increases with rainfall intensity that is for a laminar overland flow eq 2 states that the resistance increases with the rainfall intensity a limitation in simulating overland flow using hillslope scale runoff models is that the use of hydraulic equations such as manning and darcy weisbach is extremely simplistic smith et al 2007 and the resistance coefficient changes for different surface conditions kowobari et al 1972 recently ferro 2017 developed a theoretical flow resistance equation to determine the darcy weisbach friction factor f which was successfully applied to open channel and rill flows di stefano et al 2017 di stefano et al 2019 ferro 2018 ferro and pecoraro 2000 this flow resistance equation was applicable for overland flow under simulated rainfall with a smooth bed for a vegetated hillslope surface nicosia et al 2020a b and for a stony hillslope nicosia et al 2020c this study aimed to explore the applicability of the resistance literature relationship eq 3 using overland flow measurements characterised by low reynolds numbers on a rough bed laboratory flume for two types of flow i e water alone and a mix of water and glycerol this setup was selected due to the need to study flow resistance for small reynolds number values typical of overland flows these data were also used to test the theoretically deduced flow resistance equation di stefano et al 2017 ferro 2017 2018 ferro and porto 2018 palmeri et al 2018 based on a power velocity profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus the experiment was conducted at the laboratory of the institute of soil and water conservation engineering at northwest a f university china the experimental device consisted of water supply steady flow and level water devices and a test flume the constant water tank was 2 1 and 0 5 m in length width and height respectively and had a rectangular overflow plate this tank can provide a stable water level and the flow discharge can be stabilized within ten minutes to prevent the impact of inflow disturbances on the thin flow a steady flow tank with dimensions of 0 5 0 6 1 0 m was set up the water then flowed through the steady flow barrier into the flat water facility with a camel hump weir finally the test flume consisted of a slope adjustable steel tank with a length width and height of 6 5 0 6 and 0 2 m respectively as shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design two types of flows were used in the experiments a mixed flow composed of 80 glycerol and 20 water table 1 and a water only flow table 2 the sediment transport in laminar flows is an important research topic because overland flow erosion sometimes occurs with a low small average re range 0 002 54 806 shih and yang 2009 white 1970 and yalin and karahan 1979 used a glycerine solution to study the incipient motion of sediments under laminar flow conditions their results showed that in laminar conditions the flow action on sediments differs from that of turbulent flows in this study a mixed flow 80 glycerol and 20 water was applied to study the resistance of laminar flow with a low reynolds number five slope gradients 3 6 9 12 and 15 were applied the experiments were carried out for a fixed bed condition obtained gluing to the flume three types of impermeable sandpaper for fixed bed conditions flow resistance is entirely due to grain resistance the average heights ks of rough elements 0 08 0 18 and 0 38 mm were determined following the procedure proposed by nikolaz lin et al 2005 the reynolds numbers of the experimental flows were widened by applying flow discharges of 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 15 17 5 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 l min 1 and the corresponding unit width flow discharge ranged from 0 069 10 3 to 2 5 10 3 m2 s 1 for each flow type 225 experimental runs were performed 2 3 measurement techniques the error caused by the unsteady flow in the initial section of the flume was avoided by setting the observation section 1 5 m upstream of the flume inlet each observation section was set with three horizontally distributed observation points five sections at 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 and 5 5 m from the outlet to the inlet of the main experimental flume were defined to measure the surface flow velocity and flow depth an sx402 digital probe tester chongqing hydrological instrument factory chongqing china with 0 01 mm precision was used to measure the flow depth when the flow surface stabilised initially a plexiglass plate was laid at the bottom of the flume to prevent the rough elements from affecting the measured water depth followed by the measurement of the flow depth between the flow surface and plexiglass plate surface the layer flow depth was calculated as 0 25 ks as the flow passed through the cracks between the sand grains on the artificial rough bed thus the final flow depth was the sum of the measured value the thickness of the plexiglass plate and 0 25 ks the mean flow velocity v was calculated from the measured discharge q and water depth h values the mean flow velocity and depth were also used to calculate the flow froude number f v gh for the water only experiments f ranged from 0 35 to 6 24 while it varied from 0 16 to 4 88 for the mixed flow experiments during the experimental runs the temperature t of the tested fluid and its kinematic viscosity was measured the kinematic viscosity of water ν kw was calculated using poiseuille s equation as follows 4 ν kw 0 01775 1 0 0337 t 0 000221 t 2 10 4 where t is the temperature expressed in centigrade the dynamic viscosity μm values of the mixed flow 80 glycerol 20 water were determined following the falling ball method brizard et al 2005 francis 1933 the dynamic viscosity μm and density ρm of the 80 glycerol and 20 water mixed flow at 25 c were 0 0459 n s m 2 and 1205 44 kg m 3 respectively the kinematic viscosity υkm of the mixed flow ranged from 3 83 10 5 to 3 52 10 5 m2 s 1 with a temperature range of 25 26 5 c the temperature and kinematic viscosity values for each run are listed in table 1 the reynolds number varied from 63 to 3323 for water flows and from 2 to 71 for mixed glycerol and water flows 2 4 data analysis the root mean square error rmse was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed flow resistance equations corresponding to the two types of flows 5 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where o i and p i denote the measured and predicted values respectively and n is the total number of paired values the smaller the rmse the closer the predicted values are to those observed 3 overland flow resistance law in rough beds at low reynolds numbers for an open channel flow the local flow velocity distribution v y along a given vertical direction is expressed by the following functional relationship barenblatt 1987 1993 di stefano et al 2017 ferro 1997 6 ϕ dv dy y h d u s ρ μ g 0 where ϕ is a functional symbol y is the distance from

relationship between the darcy weisbach friction factor and reynolds number the relationship expressed by eq 3 was studied for the two investigated flow types the experimental values of f and re obtained for each slope value under the water only flow are plotted in fig 2 the darcy weisbach friction factor first decreased sharply and then decreased gradually as re increased and there was a transition point corresponding to a re value of approximately 500 the detected turning point could be the threshold re value for the transition from the laminar to the turbulent flow regime therefore in this study the data obtained for water flows were divided into two datasets the first dataset consisted of 100 data points with re 500 while the second dataset comprised 125 data points characterised by re 500 the data obtained in the runs conducted with the mixed flow consisting of 80 glycerol and 20 water were treated together as re ranged from 2 to 71 and consequently the flow regime was always laminar first fixing the b coefficient the pairs f re b were investigated to determine the value of constant k which is equal to the slope coefficient of the best fit straight line passing through the origin of the axes for each ks value according to savat 1980 for water data characterised by re 500 and for the mixed flows coefficient b was fixed at 1 while coefficient b was fixed at 0 25 for the water data characterised by re 500 the k values obtained for the three datasets are presented in table 3 fig 3 compares the measured darcy weisbach friction factor values and those calculated using the k values for the water data characterised by re 500 fig 3 a and re 500 fig 3 b and for the mixed flow data fig 3 c the friction factor values calculated are characterised by errors less than or equal to 20 for 38 and less than or equal to 10 for 18 of cases for the water only data with re 500 less than or equal to 20 for 75 2 and less than or equal to 10 for 56 8 of cases for the water only data with re 500 and less than or equal to 20 for 43 1 and less than or equal to 10 for 18 2 of cases for the mixed flow data the relationship expressed by eq 3 was then explored without fixing the b coefficient the k and b values were obtained by studying the pairs f re and the results are listed in table 3 additionally the k and b values were used to calculate the darcy weisbach friction factor values using eq 3 fig 4 compares the measured darcy weisbach friction factor values and those calculated using the obtained k and b values for the water data with re 500 fig 4

and less than or equal to 10 for 34 2 of cases for mixed flows 4 2 testing the theoretical flow resistance equation for this investigation 225 available data points corresponding to the water only flows were examined in total the investigated range of reynolds number values from 63 to 3323 ensured that flow regime conditions ranging from laminar to turbulent were examined furthermore according to eq 22 the exponent δ of the velocity profile corresponding to the experimental re values ranged from 0 362 to 0 185 with a mean value of 0 241 this range of δ 0 185 0 362 ensures that the velocity

relationship between the darcy weisbach friction factor and reynolds number as shown in fig 2 f generally increased as the surface roughness increased table 3 shows that k always increased with surface roughness furthermore k deviated far from the value suggested in the literature for open channel flows in the laminar flow regime equal to 24 for most of the investigated laminar flow regime cases when using the fixed b values mentioned by savat 1980 k had a high variability for water only runs characterised by re 500 and for mixed flow runs however for the water only runs characterised by re 500 the values obtained for different surface roughness were very similar these discrepancies could also be detected in the estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor using the obtained k values the results were good for the water only runs characterised by re 500 the study of the relationship without fixing coefficient b highlighted that both k and b increased with increasing surface roughness in addition under this condition k had high variability however there was no significant change in coefficient b which fluctuated around 1 for the mixed flow 0 89 1 20 and water only flow conditions characterised by re 500 0 94 1 39 the average b values were 1 06 and 1 19 respectively indicating that f can be expressed using eq 2 this result indicates that the relationship between f and re for open channel flow under laminar conditions can be applied to overland flow under the same flow regime and that the b coefficient value mentioned by savat 1980 could be verified for this type of flow in addition for water only flow characterised by re 500 the obtained b coefficient values fluctuated around the suggested value of 0 25 this indicated that the transition point re 500 found for these data determines the differences in flow regime which reflect into the b coefficient confirming that for overland flow the threshold between laminar and turbulent flow regimes was relatively low in this case the best estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor using the values of k and b identified were obtained for water only runs characterised by re 500 5 2 testing the theoretical flow resistance equation the results obtained for the water only flows highlighted that eq 28 provides a good estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor additionally eq 31 provided a good estimate of f for mixed flow data characterised by re 7 instead the performance of eq 34 in the estimate of f for mixed flow data characterised with re 7 was inferior to that for the previous datasets furthermore the last datasets re 7 did not agree with eq 31 calibrated by data characterised by reynolds number higher than 7 this result can be justified by considering that these two datasets were characterised by different ranges of δ this result indicates that the hydraulic behaviour of mixed flow differed from that of the water only flow and this difference was enhanced for mixed flow with low re the different shapes of the velocity distribution concave for water flow and linear or convex for mixed flows affected the flow resistance by the exponent δ in all the examined cases the data analyses showed that flow resistance increased with increasing reynolds number and slope gradient while it decreased with increasing flow froude number that is eqs 29 32 and 35 demonstrated that f increased with re while an inverse f re trend was expected according to eq 3 5 3 limitations and future work the loess plateau is the area with the most severe soil erosion in china the average roughness heights ks 0 08 0 38 mm of this investigation are included in the range of median grain diameters d 50 of common soils in this area 0 04 0 53 mm li et al 2020 li et al 2021 in order to test the applicability of the equation established in this study for the grain resistance condition the dataset by li et al 2021 was used as a testing dataset li et al 2021 used a 3 m long runoff plot to conduct interrill erosion tests under simulated rainfall conditions there was no rill during the whole process and the topography of the bed did not change much this verification selected the instantaneous data recorded at an interval of one minute after runoff occurred a total of 132 datasets with rainfall intensity of 60 and 140 mm h 1 were used to verify the proposed equations this dataset was characterised by slope ranging from 9 to 21 unit flow discharge ranging from 0 011 to 0 154 10 3 m2 s 1 mean flow velocity ranging from 0 039 to 0 303 m s 1 and 9 re 135 fig 11 compares the darcy weisbach friction factor values measured by li et al 2021 and those calculated by eq 28 for 63 re 135 and eq 31 for 9 re 63 as shown in fig 11 the data points are distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line the friction factor values calculated were characterised by errors less than or equal to 20 for 72 and less than or equal to 10 for 31 of cases these results showed that the equation has certain predictive accuracy however the resistance of the fixed bed investigated in this study was different from that of the movable bed used by li et al 2021 this study used artificial impermeable sandpaper as the underlying surface and only grain resistance occurred while the resistance in the study of li et al 2021 included not only the grain resistance but also the form resistance caused by the surface microtopography and the rainfall resistance the form resistance here refers to the energy dissipated by the surface microtopography protrusions the above prediction results can be explained as follows 1 li et al 2021 focused on interrill erosion rate with no rill occurring in the experimental process hence the form resistance produced by surface microtopograghy was not obvious 2 as for rainfall resistance there are controversial debates on the effect of rainfall on flow resistance katz et al 1995 found that the resistance increases with the rainfall intensity however recent researches showed that the darcy weisbach friction factor decreases with the increase of rainfall intensity yang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in addition the effect of rainfall impact is negligible for rainfall intensities greater than a critical value occurring in the range of 31 75 95 25 mm h 1 nicosia et al 2020a as a consequence in the study by li et al 2021 the comprehensive resistance of the form resistance owing to microtopograghy and rainfall resistance was the minor part while the grain resistance was the dominant part of overland flow resistance furthermore the flow resistance equation calibrated by laboratory fixed bed test data has a relevant prediction accuracy when it is used to calculate the friction factor of natural land surface flow with little change in microtopography however to further expand the applicability of this equation the overland flow resistance equation should be calibrated and tested by different soils of the loess plateau 6 conclusions overland flow data obtained for water only flows and mixed flows of 80 glycerol and 20 water were used to investigate the flow resistance at low reynolds numbers and test a theoretical flow resistance law first the relationship between the darcy weisbach friction factor and the reynolds number was investigated the available measurements divided into three datasets were used to obtain the values of the k and b coefficients of eq 3 the results confirmed that the values of b mentioned in the literature by savat 1980 are applicable to this database while k is often far from the value suggested in the literature for open channel flows under the laminar flow regime furthermore a threshold value of re 500 was found for the transition from the laminar to turbulent flow regime for water only flows the estimated f values calculated using b and k obtained for each dataset were particularly good for the water only runs characterised by re 500 overland flow data were also used to calibrate the theoretical relationship between the velocity profile parameter γv bed slope flow froude number and reynolds number for water flows the friction factor values calculated using eq 28 were characterised by errors that were always less than or equal to 20 and less than or equal to 10 for 97 8 of cases for mixed flows considering the effect of the velocity profile shape eq 26 was calibrated using a threshold reynolds number ret of 7 to divide the data into two datasets as the shape of the velocity profile was frequently linear or convex for re 7 while it was always concave for re 7 for re 7 180 data points the friction factor values calculated by eq 31 were characterised by errors that were always less than or equal to 20 and less than or equal to 10 for 92 2 of cases the worst performance of eq 34 which was obtained for re 7 maybe due to the number of available measurements 45 data points and the investigated re values 2 4 5 in conclusion the results also highlight that mixed flows behave differently from water only flows very different values of δ were obtained for the three examined conditions indicating different power velocity distribution shapes finally for all investigated cases the flow resistance increased with increasing re and slope gradient and decreased with increasing flow froude number 7 data availability all data used during the

3602,this paper considers overland flow resistance at low reynolds numbers through analysis of experimental runs carried out using water only and water glycerol mixtures we first examined the power relationship between the darcy weisbach friction factor f and the reynolds number re to obtain the values of the k coefficient and b exponent these results confirmed the applicability of the values of b suggested in literature while k required a specific calibration for laminar open channel flows the analysis revealed that transition from a laminar to turbulent flow regime for water only flows occurred at a threshold value of re equal to 500 as described historically the estimate of f by the power relationship and the calibrated b and k values were reliable for water only runs when re 500 the measurements were also used to test a theoretical flow resistance law based on a power velocity distribution the calibrated theoretical relationship between the velocity profile parameter γv bed slope flow froude number and re enabled a good estimate of f for water flows for mixed fluid flows the effect of the velocity profile shape was considered calibrating this relationship by two datasets obtained setting a threshold reynolds number equal to 7 for flows with re 7 the shape of the velocity profile can be linear or convex while for flows at re 7 the shape of the velocity distribution is always concave the theoretical flow resistance allowed an accurate estimate also for mixed fluid flows even at re 7 the different shape of the power velocity distribution highlighted that mixed flows behave differently as compared to water only flows keywords mixed flow flow resistance velocity profile bed roughness dimensional analysis self similarity 1 introduction naturally occurring overland flow is characterised by non homogeneity and non constancy of flow discharges due to complex topography geomorphology and rainfall emmett 1978 grismer 2016a pan et al 2016 in hillslope interrill erosion process rain impact detaches soil particles while overland flow is the main driving force to transport sediments from interrill areas to rills kinnell 2005 ali et al 2011 hessel and jetten 2007 nicosia et al 2021 smith et al 2007 the main characteristic of overland flow is the low value of water depth mutchler and young 1975 toy et al 2002 the study of overland flow is complex as the variables are not easily definable and simple hydraulic procedures for predicting overland flow are beset with many difficulties emmett 1970 an accurate estimate of friction factor coefficients is required for modelling runoff and soil erosion and directly affects the calculation of the mean flow velocity three widely applied empirical equations for calculating mean flow velocity darcy weisbach chézy and manning equations are currently used in runoff and soil erosion models smith et al 2007 in addition mean flow velocity affects the hillslope water flow path the prediction of sediment transport capacity soil erosion and pollutant transport govers et al 2000 hessel et al 2003 hu and abrahams 2005 kim et al 2012 recent studies have shown that soil erosion intensity is directly related to flow variables including shear stress stream power and unit stream power ali et al 2011 mahmoodabadi et al 2014 these variables are calculated by the flow depth and flow velocity of overland flow are affected by flow resistance and vary under different flow patterns rainfall rates and boundary conditions the darcy weisbach friction factor f of open channel flow hydraulics is often applied to study overland flow motion on different soils due to its applicability to both laminar and turbulent flows hessel et al 2003 li 2009 different opinions regarding overland flow regimes have been formulated horton 1945 and selby 1993 proposed the concept of mixed laminar turbulent flow to describe overland flows on a slope with the same viewpoint emmett 1970 found that overland flow is not strictly consistent with the laminar transitional and turbulent flows in the accepted sense and defined it as disturbed laminar flow when considering the effect of rainfall however overland flows in watershed modelling can often be laminar and the flow parameters associated with erosion across the landscape would be poorly predicted using turbulent flow assumptions grismer 2016a b woolhiser et al 1970 found that laminar flow becomes turbulent at a transitional reynolds number re vh ν k where v is the mean flow velocity h is the flow depth and νk is the kinematic viscosity of 300 for overland flow in rangeland watersheds however no objective procedure has been developed to estimate the transitional reynolds number morgali 1970 demonstrated that the laminar to turbulent transition occurs at a reynolds number of approximately 100 for a turf plane for a concrete surface the transitional reynolds number varies from 200 to 1000 yu and mcnown 1964 while that of open channel flows ranges from 500 to 700 yen 2002 savat 1980 considered a reynolds number of 600 as the critical reynolds number separating the laminar from the turbulent regimes in a rough supercritical sheet flow overland flow hydraulics are mainly affected by rainfall intensity and soil roughness nicosia et al 2020a regarding rainfall yoon and wenzel 1971 concluded that at re 2000 the rainfall intensity effects on flow resistance can be considered negligible while an increase in rainfall intensity always results in a higher flow resistance at re 2000 previous research has stated that for re 2000 the effect of rainfall impact is also negligible for rainfall intensities greater than a critical value occurring in the range of 31 75 95 25 mm h 1 nicosia et al 2020a as the bed surface affects the overland flow motion many experiments have been conducted for both smooth and rough beds the total flow resistance in smooth rough and sloping bed conditions is constituted by the internal fluid and frictional resistance at the channel boundary katz et al 1995 a uniform laminar flow which is not affected by boundary roughness is characterised by a linear variation in the flow shear stress with the bottom distance and by a flow velocity value equal to zero at the boundary the local velocity increases parabolically to a maximum velocity at the free surface katz et al 1995 yalin 1977 by integrating the parabolic velocity distribution the following expression for the mean velocity v can be obtained yalin 1977 1 v u 1 3 u h ν k where u grs is the shear velocity r is the hydraulic radius s is the bed slope and g is the acceleration due to gravity for laminar flow conditions by multiplying both members of eq 1 for v u and considering that the darcy weisbach friction factor f 8 u 2 v2 the following theoretical expression of f can be obtained katz et al 1995 yalin 1977 yoon and wenzel 1971 2 f k re where k is a constant equal to 24 for a uniform flow on a smooth bed myers 2002 yen 2002 savat 1980 and roels 1984 suggested that the overland flow resistance law can be expressed by the following relationship 3 f k re b where b is a coefficient for laminar flow b is equal to 1 and k is related to surface roughness phelps 1975 savat 1980 for turbulent flow the value of b is 0 25 and k is related to slope gradient flow depth and surface roughness savat 1980 therefore as b 1 for overland flow characterised by a laminar flow regime eqs 2 and 3 are coincident for this hydraulic condition for an overland flow under rainfall yoon and wenzel 1971 and katz et al 1995 demonstrated that the constant k exceeds the theoretical value for smooth laminar flow and increases with rainfall intensity that is for a laminar overland flow eq 2 states that the resistance increases with the rainfall intensity a limitation in simulating overland flow using hillslope scale runoff models is that the use of hydraulic equations such as manning and darcy weisbach is extremely simplistic smith et al 2007 and the resistance coefficient changes for different surface conditions kowobari et al 1972 recently ferro 2017 developed a theoretical flow resistance equation to determine the darcy weisbach friction factor f which was successfully applied to open channel and rill flows di stefano et al 2017 di stefano et al 2019 ferro 2018 ferro and pecoraro 2000 this flow resistance equation was applicable for overland flow under simulated rainfall with a smooth bed for a vegetated hillslope surface nicosia et al 2020a b and for a stony hillslope nicosia et al 2020c this study aimed to explore the applicability of the resistance literature relationship eq 3 using overland flow measurements characterised by low reynolds numbers on a rough bed laboratory flume for two types of flow i e water alone and a mix of water and glycerol this setup was selected due to the need to study flow resistance for small reynolds number values typical of overland flows these data were also used to test the theoretically deduced flow resistance equation di stefano et al 2017 ferro 2017 2018 ferro and porto 2018 palmeri et al 2018 based on a power velocity profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus the experiment was conducted at the laboratory of the institute of soil and water conservation engineering at northwest a f university china the experimental device consisted of water supply steady flow and level water devices and a test flume the constant water tank was 2 1 and 0 5 m in length width and height respectively and had a rectangular overflow plate this tank can provide a stable water level and the flow discharge can be stabilized within ten minutes to prevent the impact of inflow disturbances on the thin flow a steady flow tank with dimensions of 0 5 0 6 1 0 m was set up the water then flowed through the steady flow barrier into the flat water facility with a camel hump weir finally the test flume consisted of a slope adjustable steel tank with a length width and height of 6 5 0 6 and 0 2 m respectively as shown in fig 1 2 2 experimental design two types of flows were used in the experiments a mixed flow composed of 80 glycerol and 20 water table 1 and a water only flow table 2 the sediment transport in laminar flows is an important research topic because overland flow erosion sometimes occurs with a low small average re range 0 002 54 806 shih and yang 2009 white 1970 and yalin and karahan 1979 used a glycerine solution to study the incipient motion of sediments under laminar flow conditions their results showed that in laminar conditions the flow action on sediments differs from that of turbulent flows in this study a mixed flow 80 glycerol and 20 water was applied to study the resistance of laminar flow with a low reynolds number five slope gradients 3 6 9 12 and 15 were applied the experiments were carried out for a fixed bed condition obtained gluing to the flume three types of impermeable sandpaper for fixed bed conditions flow resistance is entirely due to grain resistance the average heights ks of rough elements 0 08 0 18 and 0 38 mm were determined following the procedure proposed by nikolaz lin et al 2005 the reynolds numbers of the experimental flows were widened by applying flow discharges of 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 15 17 5 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 l min 1 and the corresponding unit width flow discharge ranged from 0 069 10 3 to 2 5 10 3 m2 s 1 for each flow type 225 experimental runs were performed 2 3 measurement techniques the error caused by the unsteady flow in the initial section of the flume was avoided by setting the observation section 1 5 m upstream of the flume inlet each observation section was set with three horizontally distributed observation points five sections at 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 and 5 5 m from the outlet to the inlet of the main experimental flume were defined to measure the surface flow velocity and flow depth an sx402 digital probe tester chongqing hydrological instrument factory chongqing china with 0 01 mm precision was used to measure the flow depth when the flow surface stabilised initially a plexiglass plate was laid at the bottom of the flume to prevent the rough elements from affecting the measured water depth followed by the measurement of the flow depth between the flow surface and plexiglass plate surface the layer flow depth was calculated as 0 25 ks as the flow passed through the cracks between the sand grains on the artificial rough bed thus the final flow depth was the sum of the measured value the thickness of the plexiglass plate and 0 25 ks the mean flow velocity v was calculated from the measured discharge q and water depth h values the mean flow velocity and depth were also used to calculate the flow froude number f v gh for the water only experiments f ranged from 0 35 to 6 24 while it varied from 0 16 to 4 88 for the mixed flow experiments during the experimental runs the temperature t of the tested fluid and its kinematic viscosity was measured the kinematic viscosity of water ν kw was calculated using poiseuille s equation as follows 4 ν kw 0 01775 1 0 0337 t 0 000221 t 2 10 4 where t is the temperature expressed in centigrade the dynamic viscosity μm values of the mixed flow 80 glycerol 20 water were determined following the falling ball method brizard et al 2005 francis 1933 the dynamic viscosity μm and density ρm of the 80 glycerol and 20 water mixed flow at 25 c were 0 0459 n s m 2 and 1205 44 kg m 3 respectively the kinematic viscosity υkm of the mixed flow ranged from 3 83 10 5 to 3 52 10 5 m2 s 1 with a temperature range of 25 26 5 c the temperature and kinematic viscosity values for each run are listed in table 1 the reynolds number varied from 63 to 3323 for water flows and from 2 to 71 for mixed glycerol and water flows 2 4 data analysis the root mean square error rmse was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed flow resistance equations corresponding to the two types of flows 5 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n where o i and p i denote the measured and predicted values respectively and n is the total number of paired values the smaller the rmse the closer the predicted values are to those observed 3 overland flow resistance law in rough beds at low reynolds numbers for an open channel flow the local flow velocity distribution v y along a given vertical direction is expressed by the following functional relationship barenblatt 1987 1993 di stefano et al 2017 ferro 1997 6 ϕ dv dy y h d u s ρ μ g 0 where ϕ is a functional symbol y is the distance from

experimental results barenblatt and prostokishin 1993 butera et al 1993 ferro and pecoraro 2000 the integration constant ci can be assumed to be equal to zero and eq 20 can be rewritten as follows 21 v u γ s r e f u y ν k δ where γ s re f is a function of the channel slope reynolds number and flow froude number to be defined by velocity measurements and the exponent δ can be calculated by the following theoretical equation barenblatt 1991 castaing et al 1990 22 δ 1 5 lnre by integrating the velocity distribution eq 21 the following expression of the darcy weisbach friction factor f can be

γv can be estimated by s re and f using the following power equation 26 γ v a f b s c re e where a b c and e are the coefficients to be determined from experimental measurements 4 results 4 1 relationship between the darcy weisbach friction factor and reynolds number the relationship expressed by eq 3 was studied for the two investigated flow types the experimental values of f and re obtained for each slope value under the water only flow are plotted in fig 2 the darcy weisbach friction factor first decreased sharply and then decreased gradually as re increased and there was a transition point corresponding to a re value of approximately 500 the detected turning point could be the threshold re value for the transition from the laminar to the turbulent flow regime therefore in this study the data obtained for water flows were divided into two datasets the first dataset consisted of 100 data points with re 500 while the second dataset comprised 125 data points characterised by re 500 the data obtained in the runs conducted with the mixed flow consisting of 80 glycerol and 20 water were treated together as re ranged from 2 to 71 and consequently the flow regime was always laminar first fixing the b coefficient the pairs f re b were investigated to determine the value of constant k which is equal to the slope coefficient of the best fit straight line passing through the origin of the axes for each ks value according to savat 1980 for water data characterised by re 500 and for the mixed flows coefficient b was fixed at 1 while coefficient b was fixed at 0 25 for the water data characterised by re 500 the k values obtained for the three datasets are presented in table 3 fig 3 compares the measured darcy weisbach friction factor values and those calculated using the k values for the water data characterised by re 500 fig 3 a and re 500 fig 3 b and for the mixed flow data fig 3 c the friction factor values calculated are characterised by errors less than or equal to 20 for 38 and less than or equal to 10 for 18 of cases for the water only data with re 500 less than or equal to 20 for 75 2 and less than or equal to 10 for 56 8 of cases for the water only data with re 500 and less than or equal to 20 for 43 1 and less than or equal to 10 for 18 2 of cases for the mixed flow data the relationship expressed by eq 3 was then explored without fixing the b coefficient the k and b values were obtained by studying the pairs f re and the results are listed in table 3 additionally the k and b values were used to calculate the darcy weisbach friction factor values using eq 3 fig 4 compares the measured darcy weisbach friction factor values and those calculated using the obtained k and b values for the water data with re 500 fig 4

and less than or equal to 10 for 34 2 of cases for mixed flows 4 2 testing the theoretical flow resistance equation for this investigation 225 available data points corresponding to the water only flows were examined in total the investigated range of reynolds number values from 63 to 3323 ensured that flow regime conditions ranging from laminar to turbulent were examined furthermore according to eq 22 the exponent δ of the velocity profile corresponding to the experimental re values ranged from 0 362 to 0 185 with a mean value of 0 241 this range of δ 0 185 0 362 ensures that the velocity

relationship between the darcy weisbach friction factor and reynolds number as shown in fig 2 f generally increased as the surface roughness increased table 3 shows that k always increased with surface roughness furthermore k deviated far from the value suggested in the literature for open channel flows in the laminar flow regime equal to 24 for most of the investigated laminar flow regime cases when using the fixed b values mentioned by savat 1980 k had a high variability for water only runs characterised by re 500 and for mixed flow runs however for the water only runs characterised by re 500 the values obtained for different surface roughness were very similar these discrepancies could also be detected in the estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor using the obtained k values the results were good for the water only runs characterised by re 500 the study of the relationship without fixing coefficient b highlighted that both k and b increased with increasing surface roughness in addition under this condition k had high variability however there was no significant change in coefficient b which fluctuated around 1 for the mixed flow 0 89 1 20 and water only flow conditions characterised by re 500 0 94 1 39 the average b values were 1 06 and 1 19 respectively indicating that f can be expressed using eq 2 this result indicates that the relationship between f and re for open channel flow under laminar conditions can be applied to overland flow under the same flow regime and that the b coefficient value mentioned by savat 1980 could be verified for this type of flow in addition for water only flow characterised by re 500 the obtained b coefficient values fluctuated around the suggested value of 0 25 this indicated that the transition point re 500 found for these data determines the differences in flow regime which reflect into the b coefficient confirming that for overland flow the threshold between laminar and turbulent flow regimes was relatively low in this case the best estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor using the values of k and b identified were obtained for water only runs characterised by re 500 5 2 testing the theoretical flow resistance equation the results obtained for the water only flows highlighted that eq 28 provides a good estimate of the darcy weisbach friction factor additionally eq 31 provided a good estimate of f for mixed flow data characterised by re 7 instead the performance of eq 34 in the estimate of f for mixed flow data characterised with re 7 was inferior to that for the previous datasets furthermore the last datasets re 7 did not agree with eq 31 calibrated by data characterised by reynolds number higher than 7 this result can be justified by considering that these two datasets were characterised by different ranges of δ this result indicates that the hydraulic behaviour of mixed flow differed from that of the water only flow and this difference was enhanced for mixed flow with low re the different shapes of the velocity distribution concave for water flow and linear or convex for mixed flows affected the flow resistance by the exponent δ in all the examined cases the data analyses showed that flow resistance increased with increasing reynolds number and slope gradient while it decreased with increasing flow froude number that is eqs 29 32 and 35 demonstrated that f increased with re while an inverse f re trend was expected according to eq 3 5 3 limitations and future work the loess plateau is the area with the most severe soil erosion in china the average roughness heights ks 0 08 0 38 mm of this investigation are included in the range of median grain diameters d 50 of common soils in this area 0 04 0 53 mm li et al 2020 li et al 2021 in order to test the applicability of the equation established in this study for the grain resistance condition the dataset by li et al 2021 was used as a testing dataset li et al 2021 used a 3 m long runoff plot to conduct interrill erosion tests under simulated rainfall conditions there was no rill during the whole process and the topography of the bed did not change much this verification selected the instantaneous data recorded at an interval of one minute after runoff occurred a total of 132 datasets with rainfall intensity of 60 and 140 mm h 1 were used to verify the proposed equations this dataset was characterised by slope ranging from 9 to 21 unit flow discharge ranging from 0 011 to 0 154 10 3 m2 s 1 mean flow velocity ranging from 0 039 to 0 303 m s 1 and 9 re 135 fig 11 compares the darcy weisbach friction factor values measured by li et al 2021 and those calculated by eq 28 for 63 re 135 and eq 31 for 9 re 63 as shown in fig 11 the data points are distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line the friction factor values calculated were characterised by errors less than or equal to 20 for 72 and less than or equal to 10 for 31 of cases these results showed that the equation has certain predictive accuracy however the resistance of the fixed bed investigated in this study was different from that of the movable bed used by li et al 2021 this study used artificial impermeable sandpaper as the underlying surface and only grain resistance occurred while the resistance in the study of li et al 2021 included not only the grain resistance but also the form resistance caused by the surface microtopography and the rainfall resistance the form resistance here refers to the energy dissipated by the surface microtopography protrusions the above prediction results can be explained as follows 1 li et al 2021 focused on interrill erosion rate with no rill occurring in the experimental process hence the form resistance produced by surface microtopograghy was not obvious 2 as for rainfall resistance there are controversial debates on the effect of rainfall on flow resistance katz et al 1995 found that the resistance increases with the rainfall intensity however recent researches showed that the darcy weisbach friction factor decreases with the increase of rainfall intensity yang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in addition the effect of rainfall impact is negligible for rainfall intensities greater than a critical value occurring in the range of 31 75 95 25 mm h 1 nicosia et al 2020a as a consequence in the study by li et al 2021 the comprehensive resistance of the form resistance owing to microtopograghy and rainfall resistance was the minor part while the grain resistance was the dominant part of overland flow resistance furthermore the flow resistance equation calibrated by laboratory fixed bed test data has a relevant prediction accuracy when it is used to calculate the friction factor of natural land surface flow with little change in microtopography however to further expand the applicability of this equation the overland flow resistance equation should be calibrated and tested by different soils of the loess plateau 6 conclusions overland flow data obtained for water only flows and mixed flows of 80 glycerol and 20 water were used to investigate the flow resistance at low reynolds numbers and test a theoretical flow resistance law first the relationship between the darcy weisbach friction factor and the reynolds number was investigated the available measurements divided into three datasets were used to obtain the values of the k and b coefficients of eq 3 the results confirmed that the values of b mentioned in the literature by savat 1980 are applicable to this database while k is often far from the value suggested in the literature for open channel flows under the laminar flow regime furthermore a threshold value of re 500 was found for the transition from the laminar to turbulent flow regime for water only flows the estimated f values calculated using b and k obtained for each dataset were particularly good for the water only runs characterised by re 500 overland flow data were also used to calibrate the theoretical relationship between the velocity profile parameter γv bed slope flow froude number and reynolds number for water flows the friction factor values calculated using eq 28 were characterised by errors that were always less than or equal to 20 and less than or equal to 10 for 97 8 of cases for mixed flows considering the effect of the velocity profile shape eq 26 was calibrated using a threshold reynolds number ret of 7 to divide the data into two datasets as the shape of the velocity profile was frequently linear or convex for re 7 while it was always concave for re 7 for re 7 180 data points the friction factor values calculated by eq 31 were characterised by errors that were always less than or equal to 20 and less than or equal to 10 for 92 2 of cases the worst performance of eq 34 which was obtained for re 7 maybe due to the number of available measurements 45 data points and the investigated re values 2 4 5 in conclusion the results also highlight that mixed flows behave differently from water only flows very different values of δ were obtained for the three examined conditions indicating different power velocity distribution shapes finally for all investigated cases the flow resistance increased with increasing re and slope gradient and decreased with increasing flow froude number 7 data availability all data used during the

3603,lack the connection between the air sea interaction and deep hydrological processes hinders to clarify the response of western pacific warm pool wpwp to recent global warming in this paper δ18o δd combined with other properties of seawater collecting during the 37th and 47th chinese research expedition cruises were measured to trace the potential hydrological processes in the tropical pacific ocean the change in δ18o and d excess signatures of surface water revealed that two different zones were separated at 155 e along the transect this coincided with the spatial evaporation precipitation pattern of the pacific walker circulation pwc at station ctd03 18o enriched water salinity 35 psu δ18o 0 20 in average at a depth of 100 150 m was potentially attributed to the recirculation of the kuroshio extension flow kef in contrast the deep water with low δ18o 0 60 in average from 2000 m to 5680 m indicated the dominant lower circumpolar pacific water lcpw these contributions of water mass sources to the hydrological structure of western pacific warm pool wpwp were confirmed by a mass balance model furthermore significant linear correlations between chlorophyll and δ18o as well as chlorophyll and d excess within the upper 200 m at station ctd03 indicated that the seawater δ18o signature could be impacted by biogenic fractionation the research highlights the validity of δ18o and d excess to indicate both hydrological processes and watermass structure in wpwp further proofs based on investigation and experiments are required keywords stable isotopes hydrological structure western pacific warm pool water masses pacific walker circulation biogenic processes 1 introduction the tropical pacific is sensitive to global climate changes and small fluctuations in ocean atmosphere interaction can trigger large climatic responses such as el niño southern oscillation enso this is particularly true in the western pacific warm pool wpwp between approximately 0 16 n and 125 165 e a region characterized by sea surface temperatures sst warmer than 28 c cravatte et al 2009 previous researches indicated that the influence of global warming includes the weakening of tropical easterly trade winds accelerated warming of the surface ocean near the equator shoaling of the equatorial thermocline and fluctuating of the tropical pacific walker circulation pwc collins et al 2010 martini et al 2016 these projections are mostly based on monitoring and modeling physical indicators such as sst wind stress surface atmosphere temperature sat sea level pressure slp precipitation energy cycles and similar physical meteorological parameters meehl et al 2011 veiga et al 2013 wang et al 2012 zhang and karnauskas 2017 however the characteristics of enso and pwc over the historical period are still uncertain and vigorously debated collins et al 2010 the ongoing debate also pertains to whether the equatorial pacific responds to increased heating by enhancing the east west gradient or reducing it cane et al 1997 liu et al 2013 dinezio et al 2013 zhang and karnauskas 2017 most observations and models in previous studies show that global mean sst has risen steadily over the past century and the pwc has slowed down in response to global warming tokinaga et al 2012 vecchi et al 2006 martini et al 2016 coral o isotopic records also suggests a significant weakening of the pwc over the twentieth century in response to the development of el niño liu et al 2019 others suggested the intensification of the pwc with the eastward shift has contributed to the current pause in global warming bayr et al 2014 this ongoing warming hiatus response has been amplified by accelerated trade winds increasing of equatorial upwelling and lowering sea surface temperature in the central and eastern pacific warming amplification in the atlantic rapid sea level rise in the western tropical pacific strengthening of indo pacific ocean currents and even the increased uptake of heat in the equatorial pacific thermocline mcgregor et al 2014 kosaka and xie 2013 england et al 2014 the water mass structure of the wpwp plays a role in water heating cooling processes ultimately influencing both the equatorial thermocline and sea air interactions meehl et al 2011 to quantify the observational sensitivity of the wpwp to climate change reliable tracers are necessary to link climate and hydrological processes for instance distinct h and o stable isotopic compositions of water at various hydrological stages may help to trace different formation processes such as melting of sea ice glacial and river run off as well as changes in deep ocean water masses craig and gordon 1965 meredith et al 1999 specifically deuterium excess or d excess was used as an index of deviation from the global meteoric water line providing an independent climatic parameter for tracing past and present precipitation processes dansgaard 1964 pfahl and sodemann 2014 merlivat and jouzel 1979 however due to the low analytical precision of deuterium measurements d excess variations can be complicated for interpretation froehlich and gibson 2002 similarly enrichment or depletion in δ18o under nonequilibrium state of evaporation precipitation the relationship between δ18o and salinity were often used to trace the hydrological processes including runoff mixing oceanic advection and diffusion in deep waters craig and gordon 1965 frew et al 2000 delaygue et al 2001 voelker et al 2015 srivastava et al 2010 in the subtropical north atlantic a modified optimum multiparameter analysis including δ18o and δd was proposed to diagnose various water sources and rationalize their distributions with depths and along certain transect jenkins et al 2015 the migration of water from different sources in the northeast atlantic was also assessed using δ18o and δd voelker et al 2015 in the tropical pacific ocean the hydrological processes are complicated and sensitive to climate change hu et al 2015 although sst gradients across the tropical pacific strongly influence global rainfall liu et al 2013 very few reports documenting the pwc oscillation are based on the variation of δ18o and δd of seawater in the surface thermocline or deep waters moreover those biogenic and chemical processes inducing isotope fractionation in seawater are not yet fully understood eisenstadt et al 2010 accordingly the aim of present study was to provide insight into the hydrological structure and water cycle in the tropical pacific by combining data on surface and deep water many indicators including seawater δ18o and δd signatures d excess temperature salinity precipitation and those associated with biogenetic processes were considered here 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection surface water samples denoted as 1 to 24 were collected on board of vessel xiang yang hong 06 on august 2017 along a transect from the western subtropical pacific to the central pacific during the 47th cruise of chinese research expedition comra except 3 surface water samples 8 14 20 which were ruined during the transport the locations of all other samples are included in fig 1 three water column were also collected at depths from different regions i e from central pacific a5 a2 during the 47th cruise and from tropical pacific ctd03 during the 37th cruise of comra the collecting information of water samples were shown in table 1 temperature and salinity were recorded in situ using a sea bird ctd sbe 911 plus during the water column sampling the monthly data source for sst precipitation and npp data along the transect were provided by noaa s national centers for environmental information ncei and the ocean productivity website 2 2 measurement of δ18o and δd all the water samples for δ18o and δd measurement were filtered through a 0 2 µm filter stored in small screwed tubes with no bubbles under 4 oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios of the water samples were determined using a mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer high temperature pyrolysis of water samples was achieved with h2 or co gas separately in the elemental analyzer the h2 or co gas were then let into the mass spectrometer for isotopic analysis the oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition are expressed in conventional units as defined in eq 1 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample d h or 18o 16o according to the guidelines established by the international atomic energy agency coplen 1996 stable isotopic oxygen and hydrogen ratios were reported as enrichments or depletions denoted as relative to the standard mean oceanic water v smow standard the error of the measured values of δ18o was 0 2 and that of δd was 1 0 the deuterium excess or d excess defined by dansgaard 1964 was calculated according to eq 2 as below 2 d excess δd 8δ18o moreover δ18o data in surface water 3 m of the tropical pacific were obtained from the nasa website schmidt et al 1999 for comparison 2 3 dissolved organic carbon measurement dissolved organic carbon doc of the seawater samples was determined using a vario toc cube germany with standard procedure provided by the elemetar company beforehand the samples were acidified with 0 2 ml of 98 h2so4 to ph 2 in the sample containers in order to outgas the dissolved inorganic carbon dic the detailed principal and procedure were provided by menzel and vaccaro 2003 2 4 chlorophyll concentration the chlorophyll concentration was determined on board using the fluorescence method zhang et al 2012 before the measurement phytoplankton in each 500 mililiter water subsample was concentrated onto a gf f filter 0 45 μm by low vacuum filtration pigments were extracted with 10 ml of 90 acetone for 24 h at 4 c with periodic shaking 2 5 mass balance model based on the mass balance equations proposed by östlund and hut 1984 different sources of various water masses can be distinguished the mass balance equations have been applied a lot in the arctic ocean schlosser et al 1994 bauch et al 1995 macdonald et al 1995 according to the oceanic currents in the tropical pacific as indicated by talley et al 2011 four stable water masses were considered as potential sources for the surface and deep water in the western tropical pacific the fractionations of the different water mass contributions were calculated using salinity δ18o and silicate composition the mass balance at station ctd03 was calculated using the following eqs 3 6 3 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 1 4 f 1 s 1 f 2 s 2 f 3 s 3 f 4 s 4 s m 5 f 1 δ 18 o 1 f 2 δ 18 o 2 f 3 δ 18 o 3 f 4 δ 18 o δ 18 o m 6 f 1 si 1 f 2 si 2 f 3 si 3 f 4 si 4 si m where f 1 f 2 f 3 and f 4 denote the proportions of western pacific surface water wpsw kuroshio extension water kef north pacific intermediate water npiw and lower circumpolar pacific water lcpw respectively the designations s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 δ 18 o 1 δ 18 o 2 δ 18 o 3 δ 18 o 4 and si 1 si 2 si 3 si 4 refer to the corresponding salinities δ18o and silicate concentration for these four end member sources meanwhile s m δ 18 o m and si m refer to the mixed salinity δ18o and silicate concentration for each layer of the water column at station ctd03 respectively the features for the four end member water sources are listed in table 2 pearson correlation and linear regression model were carried out to explore the relationships between different indicators along the sampling transect or vertical profiles by using r version 3 6 3 the original data were standardized and normalized when necessary 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of δ18o and d excess signature from the western to central tropical pacific the δ18o values in surface water increased eastward while d excess values decreased two different zones could be clearly identified separated by the longitude of 155 e fig 2 in contrast salinity of surface water during the investigation month august 2017 was relatively low both in the easternmost and westernmost stations from stations 1 to 5 and from stations 22 to 24 the average sea surface temperature sst ranged from 27 5 to 29 5 while net primary productivity npp and from less than 100 to over 150 mg m 3 day 1 the precipitation at the same month was fluctuated along the transect ranging from less than 0 5 to 8 mm pre day with the highest precipitation at about 170 w significant pearson s correlations were found between the salinity and δ18o r 0 52 n 21 p 0 01 or d excess r 0 49 n 21 p 0 05 between sst and δ18o r 0 42 n 21 p 0 05 or d excess r 0 49 n 21 p 0 05 between precipitation and sst r 0 53 n 21 p 0 01 and between salinity and npp r 0 60 n 21 p 0 01 3 2 vertical features of potential temperature salinity and water mass structure in the western pacific as shown in table 3 the surface potential temperature of ctd03 is higher than 29 c but decreases rapidly within the upper 200 m then decrease more slowly until 2000 m and remained constant 2 c below the depth of 2000 m the maximum practical salinity reached 35 17 psu at depth 125 m decreasing upward and downward to a minimum of 33 48 psu in surface water the δ18o and δd values fluctuated from 0 97 to 0 53 and from 11 29 to 0 07 respectively doc concentrations were low with an average value of 109 86 μmol l maximum of 179 04 μmol l at the depth of 2000 m and minimum of 68 92 μmol l at the depth of 125 m the silicate concentrations ranged from 1 50 to 139 28 μmol l increasing with depth to a high concentration over 130 μmol l below the depth of 2000 m and with the maximum at the depth of 4000 m 3 3 comparison of vertical water properties between the western and central pacific within the depth of 200 m the potential temperature and practical salinity profiles above 200 m at station ctd03 indicated a deep and thick upper thermocline in comparison with the station a2 and a5 which is coincident with the features of the wpwp fig 3 the maximum chlorophyll concentration occurred at a depth of 100 m at all stations the δ18o and d excess values roughly fluctuated oppositely along the depth relatively high values of δ18o were evident at a depth of 125 m at station ctd03 moreover the profile of d excess at station ctd03 can be depicted as decreasing stabilizing and increasing with depth significant linear correlations were found between chlorophyll and d excess r2 0 51 p 0 05 and between chlorophyll and δ18o r2 0 60 p 0 05 however no significant correlation of these indicators was found at station a5 and a2 fig 4 3 4 model result on the contribution of different water sources with depths at ctd03 water mass mixing and advection is one of the most important factors controlling water characteristics in the deep ocean by using the mass balance eqs 3 6 the potential water masses contributing to each layer was estimated along the water column of station ctd03 in the wpwp see figs 5 and 6 according to the potential temperature salinity relationship of ctd03 fig 5 three sections along the water column were detected i e the surface and upper thermocline intermediate and deep water masses the maximum salinity was associated with a potential temperature around 24 c the modeling result fig 6 showed that the surface water 3 m at station ctd03 was dominated by western pacific surface water wpsw while the kuroshio extension flow kef was predominant at the depth of 100 150 m the intermediate water was dominant by north pacific intermediate water npiw in the depth between 200 and 1000 m following the uniform pacific deep water mass which was dominant by lower circumpolar pacific water lcpw deeper than 2000 m however the uncertainty of each water layer in this calculation ranges from 12 to 57 indicating that the predominant water mass compositions could be impacted by other processes such as vertically diffusive mixing processes especially in the surface and upper thermocline as well as the deep waters 4 discussion 4 1 the fractionation of o isotopes of surface water within the tropical pacific although the variability of water isotopes composition in surface water is often inferred by the results of freshwater fluxes horizontal advection vertical upwelling and diffusion the relationship between δ18oseawater and salinity often considered to be uniform across water masses and served as a proxy to understand the circulation between the ocean and atmosphere in a given region conroy et al 2014 meteorological processes in temperature and pressure have potential impacts on h and o isotope fractionation of surface seawater driesner 1997 horita et al 2002 polyakov et al 2006 at the regional scale the walker circulation has been recognized to play an important role in the regulation of the tropical sea surface temperature sst because of its efficient heat transport bjerknes 1969 schwendike et al 2014 liu 1997 in the central tropical pacific evaporation imparts a strong influence on the stable isotopic composition of both rain and surface seawater conroy et al 2014 in our result significant correlation was found between the δ18o and sst salinity across the tropical pacific surface water which is consistent with the pwc process as δd was much less sensitive to kinetic effects than the δ18o in a non equilibrium evaporation processes liu et al 2014 dansgaard 1964 the negative value of d excess from 155 e eastward further inferred an evaporation dominant fractionation above the surface of central pacific ocean a similar pattern of δ18o in the tropical pacific was found based on the surface water 3 m data from the nasa website but we got a lower value of δ18o in the westernmost sampling stations fig 2 although these sampling locations were still within the range of warm pool the westernmost stations 1 5 in our data are far northward from those of the nasa s website the lower δ18os in surface water were not connected with the surface temperature instead they were potenitally connected the amount effect of monthly precipitation with lower δ18os under the subtropical higher pressure dansgaard 1964 moreover the increasing divergence between the western pacific and the central pacific seems to coincide with the intensity in tropical pacific circulation which was associated with a strengthening of precipitation and temperature in the western pacific area wang et al 2012 england et al 2014 in previous research the disparity between the higher slope of δ18oseawater and salinity relationship in the western tropical pacific versus the eastern tropical pacific was considered likely in response to the interannual el niño southern oscillation enso variability conroy et al 2017 temporal isotope salinity datasets will provide a better estimate of ocean circulation and climate variability conroy et al 2014 4 2 vertical hydrological structure of the western tropical pacific at the regional scale the pacific ocean is impacted not only by wind driven circulation systems but also from the broad regions of deep upwelling that returns deep waters back to mid depths or even the surface in the tropics talley et al 2011 as shown in fig 7 two major currents control the surficial western tropical pacific ocean the north equatorial current nec between 9 and 18 n and the counter equatorial current cec between 3 and 8 n wang et al 2016 below the surface north pacific intermediate water npiw which originates from the alaska gyre is defined as the primary salinity minimum in the subtropical north pacific at depths of 300 700 m talley 1993 you et al 2000 based on the salinity temperature and dissolved oxygen features three predominant water masses were suggested to flow into the deep and the bottom of the north pacific i e antarctic intermediate water aaiw north pacific deep water npdw and lower circumpolar pacific water lcpw johnson and toole 1993 the lcpw bifurcated into eastern and western branch currents after entering the north pacific basin and overlapped with npdw in the central pacific at 10 n johnson and toole 1993 kawabe et al 2003 kawabe and fujio 2010 it is worth noting that station ctd03 was located in the deep channel of the yap mariana junction the variable bathymetric and upwelling downwelling features also play an important role in determining the vertical circulation the westward propagation of lower circumpolar water has been directly confirmed by current measurement siedler et al 2004 as a consequence the persistent throughflow imposed a profound influence on the deep watermass structure both in the mariana and caroline basins siedler et al 2004 wang et al 2021 the depleted δ18o value 0 51 at depths between 2000 and 5000 m suggested the strong mixing watermass of npdw and lcpw in the water column in contrast the bottom water below 5000 m at ctd03 potential temperature 1 04 c and salinity 34 7 psu is predominantly derived from lcpw which is characterized by temperature below 1 2 c and salinity 34 707 psu in the low latitude pacific johnson and toole 1993 in our model the deep and bottom water mass at ctd03 was simplified by the dominant lcpw because the pacific deep waters are much better mixed with respect to salt than in the atlantic bigg and rohling 2000 talley et al 2011 the lcpw was characterized by a higher salinity and oxygen rich cold bottom water while npdw was characterized a particular imprint of strong silica signal 140 μmol l johnson and toole 1993 siedler et al 2004 talley and joyce 1992 therefore more conservative indicators are expected to distinguish the deep water masses and promote the model accuracy in the future moreover the staion ctd03 was also located on the southern pathway of wind driven shallow pacific meridional overturning circulation pmoc which plays an essential role on the global climate change owning to the impact on the transport of heat between the tropical and subtropical oceans wang et al 2021 song et al 2018 based on our model npiw which was characterized with low δ18o owning to the subpolar origin you 2003 also intruded into the upper thermocline in constrast the salty 18o enriched water salinity 35 psu δ18o 0 20 in average at the depth of 100 150 m indicated the recirculation of the kuroshio extension flow kef after the kurishio extended eastward within the boundary of the subpolar gyre the kef also formed an equatorial return flow with a salinity maximum in the thermocline talley et al 2011 the result is consistent with previous studies in the north central pacific where the mixing water mass within the upper thermocline was suggested to be originated from the kuroshio extension bigg and rohling 2000 4 3 the uncertain impact of biogenic process on the o isotope fractionation in water within the euphotic zone significant linear correlation between δ18o and chlorophyll as well as between d excess and chlorophyll at the western pacific station ctd03 indicate an increase of 18o in the residual water where algae aggregated fig 4 although chlorophyll has been utilized as a tracer to indicate water mass variation cooper et al 2012 martini et al 2016 the interaction between the oxygen isotope fractionation in seawater and chlorophyll via physiological processes of phytoplankton has not been clarified many incubation experiments confirmed that water cleavage for o2 release during photosynthesis in psii system with hardly any fractionation while the photorespiration of phytoplankton which lead to the enrichment of the heavier oxygen isotopes 17o and 18o in the substrate water may provide information on the effective photosynthesis performance eisenstadt et al 2010 guy et al 1993 kroopnick 1975 luz et al 2002 luz and barkan 2005 this may explain the internal connection between chlorophyll and δ18o as well as between chlorophyll and d excess within the depth less than 200 m at station ctd03 moreover the minimum doc concentration at depth of 125 m at ctd03 table 2 suggested the vigorous photorespiration could occur however the biogenetic effect on isotope fractionation could be amplified when the water source in the phytoplankton aggregation layer was predominant by kef in contrast the shoaling of thermocline in the central pacific as well as the higher δ18o background in the surface water may fade away the biogenetic effects at station a2 and a5 it was the lack of more widely sampling in the western warm pool region that further exploration on the relationship between o stable isotope fractionation and biological processes such as the photosynthesis efficiency in the euphotic zone is necessary 5 conclusions this investigation of δ18o δd and other indicators illuminated the watermass structure of wpwp and the hydrological processes connecting with adjacent areas the δ18o and d excess values of surface water samples 3 m show significant change along the transect from the western to the central pacific the positive to negative d excess stemming from the non equilibrium state between precipitation and evaporation is consistent with the process of the pacific walker circulation along the vertical profile of water properties in the wpwp at station ctd03 δ18o enriched water salinity 35 psu δ18o 0 20 in average at the depth of 100 150 m suggest the presence of recirculation of the kef water in the region the depleted δ18o 0 60 in average in deep water from 2000 to 5680 m is consistent with the dominance of lcpw the energy change connecting with these hydrological processes may impact on the response of the wpwp to recent global warming credit authorship contribution

3603,lack the connection between the air sea interaction and deep hydrological processes hinders to clarify the response of western pacific warm pool wpwp to recent global warming in this paper δ18o δd combined with other properties of seawater collecting during the 37th and 47th chinese research expedition cruises were measured to trace the potential hydrological processes in the tropical pacific ocean the change in δ18o and d excess signatures of surface water revealed that two different zones were separated at 155 e along the transect this coincided with the spatial evaporation precipitation pattern of the pacific walker circulation pwc at station ctd03 18o enriched water salinity 35 psu δ18o 0 20 in average at a depth of 100 150 m was potentially attributed to the recirculation of the kuroshio extension flow kef in contrast the deep water with low δ18o 0 60 in average from 2000 m to 5680 m indicated the dominant lower circumpolar pacific water lcpw these contributions of water mass sources to the hydrological structure of western pacific warm pool wpwp were confirmed by a mass balance model furthermore significant linear correlations between chlorophyll and δ18o as well as chlorophyll and d excess within the upper 200 m at station ctd03 indicated that the seawater δ18o signature could be impacted by biogenic fractionation the research highlights the validity of δ18o and d excess to indicate both hydrological processes and watermass structure in wpwp further proofs based on investigation and experiments are required keywords stable isotopes hydrological structure western pacific warm pool water masses pacific walker circulation biogenic processes 1 introduction the tropical pacific is sensitive to global climate changes and small fluctuations in ocean atmosphere interaction can trigger large climatic responses such as el niño southern oscillation enso this is particularly true in the western pacific warm pool wpwp between approximately 0 16 n and 125 165 e a region characterized by sea surface temperatures sst warmer than 28 c cravatte et al 2009 previous researches indicated that the influence of global warming includes the weakening of tropical easterly trade winds accelerated warming of the surface ocean near the equator shoaling of the equatorial thermocline and fluctuating of the tropical pacific walker circulation pwc collins et al 2010 martini et al 2016 these projections are mostly based on monitoring and modeling physical indicators such as sst wind stress surface atmosphere temperature sat sea level pressure slp precipitation energy cycles and similar physical meteorological parameters meehl et al 2011 veiga et al 2013 wang et al 2012 zhang and karnauskas 2017 however the characteristics of enso and pwc over the historical period are still uncertain and vigorously debated collins et al 2010 the ongoing debate also pertains to whether the equatorial pacific responds to increased heating by enhancing the east west gradient or reducing it cane et al 1997 liu et al 2013 dinezio et al 2013 zhang and karnauskas 2017 most observations and models in previous studies show that global mean sst has risen steadily over the past century and the pwc has slowed down in response to global warming tokinaga et al 2012 vecchi et al 2006 martini et al 2016 coral o isotopic records also suggests a significant weakening of the pwc over the twentieth century in response to the development of el niño liu et al 2019 others suggested the intensification of the pwc with the eastward shift has contributed to the current pause in global warming bayr et al 2014 this ongoing warming hiatus response has been amplified by accelerated trade winds increasing of equatorial upwelling and lowering sea surface temperature in the central and eastern pacific warming amplification in the atlantic rapid sea level rise in the western tropical pacific strengthening of indo pacific ocean currents and even the increased uptake of heat in the equatorial pacific thermocline mcgregor et al 2014 kosaka and xie 2013 england et al 2014 the water mass structure of the wpwp plays a role in water heating cooling processes ultimately influencing both the equatorial thermocline and sea air interactions meehl et al 2011 to quantify the observational sensitivity of the wpwp to climate change reliable tracers are necessary to link climate and hydrological processes for instance distinct h and o stable isotopic compositions of water at various hydrological stages may help to trace different formation processes such as melting of sea ice glacial and river run off as well as changes in deep ocean water masses craig and gordon 1965 meredith et al 1999 specifically deuterium excess or d excess was used as an index of deviation from the global meteoric water line providing an independent climatic parameter for tracing past and present precipitation processes dansgaard 1964 pfahl and sodemann 2014 merlivat and jouzel 1979 however due to the low analytical precision of deuterium measurements d excess variations can be complicated for interpretation froehlich and gibson 2002 similarly enrichment or depletion in δ18o under nonequilibrium state of evaporation precipitation the relationship between δ18o and salinity were often used to trace the hydrological processes including runoff mixing oceanic advection and diffusion in deep waters craig and gordon 1965 frew et al 2000 delaygue et al 2001 voelker et al 2015 srivastava et al 2010 in the subtropical north atlantic a modified optimum multiparameter analysis including δ18o and δd was proposed to diagnose various water sources and rationalize their distributions with depths and along certain transect jenkins et al 2015 the migration of water from different sources in the northeast atlantic was also assessed using δ18o and δd voelker et al 2015 in the tropical pacific ocean the hydrological processes are complicated and sensitive to climate change hu et al 2015 although sst gradients across the tropical pacific strongly influence global rainfall liu et al 2013 very few reports documenting the pwc oscillation are based on the variation of δ18o and δd of seawater in the surface thermocline or deep waters moreover those biogenic and chemical processes inducing isotope fractionation in seawater are not yet fully understood eisenstadt et al 2010 accordingly the aim of present study was to provide insight into the hydrological structure and water cycle in the tropical pacific by combining data on surface and deep water many indicators including seawater δ18o and δd signatures d excess temperature salinity precipitation and those associated with biogenetic processes were considered here 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection surface water samples denoted as 1 to 24 were collected on board of vessel xiang yang hong 06 on august 2017 along a transect from the western subtropical pacific to the central pacific during the 47th cruise of chinese research expedition comra except 3 surface water samples 8 14 20 which were ruined during the transport the locations of all other samples are included in fig 1 three water column were also collected at depths from different regions i e from central pacific a5 a2 during the 47th cruise and from tropical pacific ctd03 during the 37th cruise of comra the collecting information of water samples were shown in table 1 temperature and salinity were recorded in situ using a sea bird ctd sbe 911 plus during the water column sampling the monthly data source for sst precipitation and npp data along the transect were provided by noaa s national centers for environmental information ncei and the ocean productivity website 2 2 measurement of δ18o and δd all the water samples for δ18o and δd measurement were filtered through a 0 2 µm filter stored in small screwed tubes with no bubbles under 4 oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios of the water samples were determined using a mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer high temperature pyrolysis of water samples was achieved with h2 or co gas separately in the elemental analyzer the h2 or co gas were then let into the mass spectrometer for isotopic analysis the oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition are expressed in conventional units as defined in eq 1 1 δ r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample d h or 18o 16o according to the guidelines established by the international atomic energy agency coplen 1996 stable isotopic oxygen and hydrogen ratios were reported as enrichments or depletions denoted as relative to the standard mean oceanic water v smow standard the error of the measured values of δ18o was 0 2 and that of δd was 1 0 the deuterium excess or d excess defined by dansgaard 1964 was calculated according to eq 2 as below 2 d excess δd 8δ18o moreover δ18o data in surface water 3 m of the tropical pacific were obtained from the nasa website schmidt et al 1999 for comparison 2 3 dissolved organic carbon measurement dissolved organic carbon doc of the seawater samples was determined using a vario toc cube germany with standard procedure provided by the elemetar company beforehand the samples were acidified with 0 2 ml of 98 h2so4 to ph 2 in the sample containers in order to outgas the dissolved inorganic carbon dic the detailed principal and procedure were provided by menzel and vaccaro 2003 2 4 chlorophyll concentration the chlorophyll concentration was determined on board using the fluorescence method zhang et al 2012 before the measurement phytoplankton in each 500 mililiter water subsample was concentrated onto a gf f filter 0 45 μm by low vacuum filtration pigments were extracted with 10 ml of 90 acetone for 24 h at 4 c with periodic shaking 2 5 mass balance model based on the mass balance equations proposed by östlund and hut 1984 different sources of various water masses can be distinguished the mass balance equations have been applied a lot in the arctic ocean schlosser et al 1994 bauch et al 1995 macdonald et al 1995 according to the oceanic currents in the tropical pacific as indicated by talley et al 2011 four stable water masses were considered as potential sources for the surface and deep water in the western tropical pacific the fractionations of the different water mass contributions were calculated using salinity δ18o and silicate composition the mass balance at station ctd03 was calculated using the following eqs 3 6 3 f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 1 4 f 1 s 1 f 2 s 2 f 3 s 3 f 4 s 4 s m 5 f 1 δ 18 o 1 f 2 δ 18 o 2 f 3 δ 18 o 3 f 4 δ 18 o δ 18 o m 6 f 1 si 1 f 2 si 2 f 3 si 3 f 4 si 4 si m where f 1 f 2 f 3 and f 4 denote the proportions of western pacific surface water wpsw kuroshio extension water kef north pacific intermediate water npiw and lower circumpolar pacific water lcpw respectively the designations s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 δ 18 o 1 δ 18 o 2 δ 18 o 3 δ 18 o 4 and si 1 si 2 si 3 si 4 refer to the corresponding salinities δ18o and silicate concentration for these four end member sources meanwhile s m δ 18 o m and si m refer to the mixed salinity δ18o and silicate concentration for each layer of the water column at station ctd03 respectively the features for the four end member water sources are listed in table 2 pearson correlation and linear regression model were carried out to explore the relationships between different indicators along the sampling transect or vertical profiles by using r version 3 6 3 the original data were standardized and normalized when necessary 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of δ18o and d excess signature from the western to central tropical pacific the δ18o values in surface water increased eastward while d excess values decreased two different zones could be clearly identified separated by the longitude of 155 e fig 2 in contrast salinity of surface water during the investigation month august 2017 was relatively low both in the easternmost and westernmost stations from stations 1 to 5 and from stations 22 to 24 the average sea surface temperature sst ranged from 27 5 to 29 5 while net primary productivity npp and from less than 100 to over 150 mg m 3 day 1 the precipitation at the same month was fluctuated along the transect ranging from less than 0 5 to 8 mm pre day with the highest precipitation at about 170 w significant pearson s correlations were found between the salinity and δ18o r 0 52 n 21 p 0 01 or d excess r 0 49 n 21 p 0 05 between sst and δ18o r 0 42 n 21 p 0 05 or d excess r 0 49 n 21 p 0 05 between precipitation and sst r 0 53 n 21 p 0 01 and between salinity and npp r 0 60 n 21 p 0 01 3 2 vertical features of potential temperature salinity and water mass structure in the western pacific as shown in table 3 the surface potential temperature of ctd03 is higher than 29 c but decreases rapidly within the upper 200 m then decrease more slowly until 2000 m and remained constant 2 c below the depth of 2000 m the maximum practical salinity reached 35 17 psu at depth 125 m decreasing upward and downward to a minimum of 33 48 psu in surface water the δ18o and δd values fluctuated from 0 97 to 0 53 and from 11 29 to 0 07 respectively doc concentrations were low with an average value of 109 86 μmol l maximum of 179 04 μmol l at the depth of 2000 m and minimum of 68 92 μmol l at the depth of 125 m the silicate concentrations ranged from 1 50 to 139 28 μmol l increasing with depth to a high concentration over 130 μmol l below the depth of 2000 m and with the maximum at the depth of 4000 m 3 3 comparison of vertical water properties between the western and central pacific within the depth of 200 m the potential temperature and practical salinity profiles above 200 m at station ctd03 indicated a deep and thick upper thermocline in comparison with the station a2 and a5 which is coincident with the features of the wpwp fig 3 the maximum chlorophyll concentration occurred at a depth of 100 m at all stations the δ18o and d excess values roughly fluctuated oppositely along the depth relatively high values of δ18o were evident at a depth of 125 m at station ctd03 moreover the profile of d excess at station ctd03 can be depicted as decreasing stabilizing and increasing with depth significant linear correlations were found between chlorophyll and d excess r2 0 51 p 0 05 and between chlorophyll and δ18o r2 0 60 p 0 05 however no significant correlation of these indicators was found at station a5 and a2 fig 4 3 4 model result on the contribution of different water sources with depths at ctd03 water mass mixing and advection is one of the most important factors controlling water characteristics in the deep ocean by using the mass balance eqs 3 6 the potential water masses contributing to each layer was estimated along the water column of station ctd03 in the wpwp see figs 5 and 6 according to the potential temperature salinity relationship of ctd03 fig 5 three sections along the water column were detected i e the surface and upper thermocline intermediate and deep water masses the maximum salinity was associated with a potential temperature around 24 c the modeling result fig 6 showed that the surface water 3 m at station ctd03 was dominated by western pacific surface water wpsw while the kuroshio extension flow kef was predominant at the depth of 100 150 m the intermediate water was dominant by north pacific intermediate water npiw in the depth between 200 and 1000 m following the uniform pacific deep water mass which was dominant by lower circumpolar pacific water lcpw deeper than 2000 m however the uncertainty of each water layer in this calculation ranges from 12 to 57 indicating that the predominant water mass compositions could be impacted by other processes such as vertically diffusive mixing processes especially in the surface and upper thermocline as well as the deep waters 4 discussion 4 1 the fractionation of o isotopes of surface water within the tropical pacific although the variability of water isotopes composition in surface water is often inferred by the results of freshwater fluxes horizontal advection vertical upwelling and diffusion the relationship between δ18oseawater and salinity often considered to be uniform across water masses and served as a proxy to understand the circulation between the ocean and atmosphere in a given region conroy et al 2014 meteorological processes in temperature and pressure have potential impacts on h and o isotope fractionation of surface seawater driesner 1997 horita et al 2002 polyakov et al 2006 at the regional scale the walker circulation has been recognized to play an important role in the regulation of the tropical sea surface temperature sst because of its efficient heat transport bjerknes 1969 schwendike et al 2014 liu 1997 in the central tropical pacific evaporation imparts a strong influence on the stable isotopic composition of both rain and surface seawater conroy et al 2014 in our result significant correlation was found between the δ18o and sst salinity across the tropical pacific surface water which is consistent with the pwc process as δd was much less sensitive to kinetic effects than the δ18o in a non equilibrium evaporation processes liu et al 2014 dansgaard 1964 the negative value of d excess from 155 e eastward further inferred an evaporation dominant fractionation above the surface of central pacific ocean a similar pattern of δ18o in the tropical pacific was found based on the surface water 3 m data from the nasa website but we got a lower value of δ18o in the westernmost sampling stations fig 2 although these sampling locations were still within the range of warm pool the westernmost stations 1 5 in our data are far northward from those of the nasa s website the lower δ18os in surface water were not connected with the surface temperature instead they were potenitally connected the amount effect of monthly precipitation with lower δ18os under the subtropical higher pressure dansgaard 1964 moreover the increasing divergence between the western pacific and the central pacific seems to coincide with the intensity in tropical pacific circulation which was associated with a strengthening of precipitation and temperature in the western pacific area wang et al 2012 england et al 2014 in previous research the disparity between the higher slope of δ18oseawater and salinity relationship in the western tropical pacific versus the eastern tropical pacific was considered likely in response to the interannual el niño southern oscillation enso variability conroy et al 2017 temporal isotope salinity datasets will provide a better estimate of ocean circulation and climate variability conroy et al 2014 4 2 vertical hydrological structure of the western tropical pacific at the regional scale the pacific ocean is impacted not only by wind driven circulation systems but also from the broad regions of deep upwelling that returns deep waters back to mid depths or even the surface in the tropics talley et al 2011 as shown in fig 7 two major currents control the surficial western tropical pacific ocean the north equatorial current nec between 9 and 18 n and the counter equatorial current cec between 3 and 8 n wang et al 2016 below the surface north pacific intermediate water npiw which originates from the alaska gyre is defined as the primary salinity minimum in the subtropical north pacific at depths of 300 700 m talley 1993 you et al 2000 based on the salinity temperature and dissolved oxygen features three predominant water masses were suggested to flow into the deep and the bottom of the north pacific i e antarctic intermediate water aaiw north pacific deep water npdw and lower circumpolar pacific water lcpw johnson and toole 1993 the lcpw bifurcated into eastern and western branch currents after entering the north pacific basin and overlapped with npdw in the central pacific at 10 n johnson and toole 1993 kawabe et al 2003 kawabe and fujio 2010 it is worth noting that station ctd03 was located in the deep channel of the yap mariana junction the variable bathymetric and upwelling downwelling features also play an important role in determining the vertical circulation the westward propagation of lower circumpolar water has been directly confirmed by current measurement siedler et al 2004 as a consequence the persistent throughflow imposed a profound influence on the deep watermass structure both in the mariana and caroline basins siedler et al 2004 wang et al 2021 the depleted δ18o value 0 51 at depths between 2000 and 5000 m suggested the strong mixing watermass of npdw and lcpw in the water column in contrast the bottom water below 5000 m at ctd03 potential temperature 1 04 c and salinity 34 7 psu is predominantly derived from lcpw which is characterized by temperature below 1 2 c and salinity 34 707 psu in the low latitude pacific johnson and toole 1993 in our model the deep and bottom water mass at ctd03 was simplified by the dominant lcpw because the pacific deep waters are much better mixed with respect to salt than in the atlantic bigg and rohling 2000 talley et al 2011 the lcpw was characterized by a higher salinity and oxygen rich cold bottom water while npdw was characterized a particular imprint of strong silica signal 140 μmol l johnson and toole 1993 siedler et al 2004 talley and joyce 1992 therefore more conservative indicators are expected to distinguish the deep water masses and promote the model accuracy in the future moreover the staion ctd03 was also located on the southern pathway of wind driven shallow pacific meridional overturning circulation pmoc which plays an essential role on the global climate change owning to the impact on the transport of heat between the tropical and subtropical oceans wang et al 2021 song et al 2018 based on our model npiw which was characterized with low δ18o owning to the subpolar origin you 2003 also intruded into the upper thermocline in constrast the salty 18o enriched water salinity 35 psu δ18o 0 20 in average at the depth of 100 150 m indicated the recirculation of the kuroshio extension flow kef after the kurishio extended eastward within the boundary of the subpolar gyre the kef also formed an equatorial return flow with a salinity maximum in the thermocline talley et al 2011 the result is consistent with previous studies in the north central pacific where the mixing water mass within the upper thermocline was suggested to be originated from the kuroshio extension bigg and rohling 2000 4 3 the uncertain impact of biogenic process on the o isotope fractionation in water within the euphotic zone significant linear correlation between δ18o and chlorophyll as well as between d excess and chlorophyll at the western pacific station ctd03 indicate an increase of 18o in the residual water where algae aggregated fig 4 although chlorophyll has been utilized as a tracer to indicate water mass variation cooper et al 2012 martini et al 2016 the interaction between the oxygen isotope fractionation in seawater and chlorophyll via physiological processes of phytoplankton has not been clarified many incubation experiments confirmed that water cleavage for o2 release during photosynthesis in psii system with hardly any fractionation while the photorespiration of phytoplankton which lead to the enrichment of the heavier oxygen isotopes 17o and 18o in the substrate water may provide information on the effective photosynthesis performance eisenstadt et al 2010 guy et al 1993 kroopnick 1975 luz et al 2002 luz and barkan 2005 this may explain the internal connection between chlorophyll and δ18o as well as between chlorophyll and d excess within the depth less than 200 m at station ctd03 moreover the minimum doc concentration at depth of 125 m at ctd03 table 2 suggested the vigorous photorespiration could occur however the biogenetic effect on isotope fractionation could be amplified when the water source in the phytoplankton aggregation layer was predominant by kef in contrast the shoaling of thermocline in the central pacific as well as the higher δ18o background in the surface water may fade away the biogenetic effects at station a2 and a5 it was the lack of more widely sampling in the western warm pool region that further exploration on the relationship between o stable isotope fractionation and biological processes such as the photosynthesis efficiency in the euphotic zone is necessary 5 conclusions this investigation of δ18o δd and other indicators illuminated the watermass structure of wpwp and the hydrological processes connecting with adjacent areas the δ18o and d excess values of surface water samples 3 m show significant change along the transect from the western to the central pacific the positive to negative d excess stemming from the non equilibrium state between precipitation and evaporation is consistent with the process of the pacific walker circulation along the vertical profile of water properties in the wpwp at station ctd03 δ18o enriched water salinity 35 psu δ18o 0 20 in average at the depth of 100 150 m suggest the presence of recirculation of the kef water in the region the depleted δ18o 0 60 in average in deep water from 2000 to 5680 m is consistent with the dominance of lcpw the energy change connecting with these hydrological processes may impact on the response of the wpwp to recent global warming credit authorship contribution

the incipient motion condition occurs when the flow induced shear stress over the bed exceeds a certain critical value known as css critical shear stress incipient motion studies are crucial because they aid in the solution of a variety of issues such as soil erosion reservoir sedimentation channel design river morphological forecasts and the impact of fine sediment deposition on aquatic life etc shields 1936 was the first researcher who introduced the shields curve for calculating the css in uniform cohesionless sediment several investigations on incipient motion of uniform iwagaki 1956 yalin and karahan 1979 yang 1973 and non uniform ashida 1971 bridge and bennett 1992 dey and debnath 2000 egiazaroff 1965 parker et al 1982 patel and ranga raju 1999 wu et al 2000 cohesionless sediment are also reported in the literature for cohesionless uniform sediments the incipient motion criterion is well established for calculating the css garde and raju 2000 hrissanthou and hartmann 1998 however the css is still under investigation for non uniform sediment especially in the presence of clay in nature river bed material is made up of a mix of non cohesive as well as cohesive sediments garde and raju 2000 due to the dominance of cohesive sediment s physio chemical characteristics the erosion characteristic of cohesive sediment differs significantly from that of cohesionless material garde and raju 2000 when cohesive sediment is mixed with cohesionless sediment the resulting mixture is called a cohesive sediment mixture singh et al 2019 singh and ahmad 2019 several laboratory studies on the incipient motion for various cohesive sediment mixtures have been done in the past such as clay sand clay silt sand clay gravel clay sand gravel clay silt gravel and clay silt sand gravel mixtures ahmad et al 2018 ansari et al 2007 dunn 1959 julian and torres 2006 kamphuis and hall 1983 kothyari and jain 2008 mitchener and torfs 1996 panagiotopoulos et al 1997 singh et al 2017b torfs et al 1994 wang and hwang 2012 however only a few studies have been conducted regarding gravel particles in a cohesive mixture and their model results are limited to the correlation coefficient of between computed and measured values dimensionless css around 0 80 singh et al 2017b wang and hwang 2012 the present study considered equations 1 2 and 3 for incipient motion for calculating τ cc τ cm for

represents dimensionless css as the present study deals with the computation of critical shear stress for gravel particles in the presence of clay particles in the sediment mixture equations 1 2 and 3 were chosen because they directly incorporate the impact of both gravel and clay in the sediment mixture while comparing these three equations there is the absence of silt particles in sediment mixture for kothyari and jain 2008 absence of sand particles for ahmad et al 2018 and presence of both silt and sand particles for singh et al 2017b the presence or absence of sand silt particles may act like a limitation which may cause the application of one equation expression to be more or less well suited to other sediment mixtures in recent decades artificial intelligence ai approaches have

natural and manufactured channels asce task committee 2000 bizimana and altunkaynak 2019 safari et al 2016 zounemat kermani et al 2018 najafzadeh and oliveto employed a variety of artificial

programming approach could accurately estimate the sediment transport in sewers bizimana and altunkaynak 2021 investigated the influence of bed roughness on critical shear stresses and incipient motion using hybrid geno fuzzy and neuro fuzzy methods they found that the outcomes of the hybrid geno fuzzy method outperformed the neuro fuzzy and linear regression methods more recently pandey et al predicted scour depth near spur dikes using two novel tree based ensemble models namely stacked boosting regression tree sbrt and stacked bagging regression tree sbgt pandey et al 2021b also pandey et al 2021a presented three robust ai based techniques including gradient boosting decision tree gbdt cascaded forward neural network cfnn and kernel ridge regression krr to predict the scour depth around spur dike in cohesive sediment mixtures the main goal of this research was to assess the potential of a new multi level voting based ensemble model which along with experimental investigation was developed to predict τ cc τ cm in the cohesive sediment mixture here the outcomes of three expert ensemble machine learning models i e xgboost adaboost and rf are combined using a voting strategy to enhance the standalone model accuracy in the prediction process in addition the best input combinations were identified based on a forward stepwise feature selection and mutual information consequences the outcomes of the voting model were validated using external validation in addition the robustness of all models was comprehensively examined with the previous empirical investigations 2 material and method 2 1 data and description of experimentation from the literature a large quantity of experimental laboratory data for critical shear stress in cohesive sediments was collected from singh et al 2017b kothyari and jain 2008 and ahmad et al 2018 a total of 125 experimental laboratory data from prior investigations were included in addition 18 experimental tests were completed by the authors to calculate the critical shear stresses in cohesive sediments thus our artificial intelligence approach to predict cs s was based on a total of 143 datasets table 1 shows the flow and sediment parameters of the current data and data from the literature in this table d a is the arithmetic mean size of the sediment mixture h is average flow depth u is the velocity of flow s f is water surface slope and w is the water content in the cohesive mixture all experiments were completed at the hydraulic laboratory of the civil engineering department indian institute of technology iit roorkee uttarakhand india for clay silt gravel and clay silt sand gravel mixture by singh et al 2017b clay was varied from 10 to 50 in cohesive mixtures such as clay silt gravel and clay silt sand gravel while cohesionless sediments were varied in equal proportions in the remaining quantity the experimental flume had a working section of 6 00 m long 0 75 m wide and 0 18 m deep starting at a distance of 7 00 m from the flume entrance the depth of the working section in the flume for filling of cohesive sediments was 0 18 m which is taken as the flume bed s general level here a thin coating of the same sediment was uniformly placed on the rest of the flume bed to imitate the roughness of the working section the water flow in the flume was controlled by a valve installed in the inlet line leading from the overhead tank a rectangular tank is provided at the end of the flume after the flow deflector for discharge measurement fig 1 illustrates a schematic view of the experimental setup the appropriate sediments were first dried and weighted according to proportion before being physically mixed to prepare the channel bed water was added to the sediment mixture and thoroughly mixed for equal moisture distribution the prepared sediment mixture was covered with polythene and left for around 24 h before being placed in the working section the sediment mixture was carefully mixed again to finalize the working section the sediments mixture was filled in the working section and compacted into three layers the working section was compacted using the dynamic compaction method in this method each layer was compacted with a 400 n cylindrical roller and the flume sides were compressed with a rectangular bottom hand rammer as illustrated in fig 2 initially a low discharge was permitted in the flume for each experimental run and uniform flow was maintained by operating the tailgate the sediment bed was visually inspected during the process of generating the uniform flow to check for sediment particle dissociation the sediment bed was visually inspected during the process of generating the uniform flow to check the detachment of the sediments the small increment in discharge and maintaining a consistent flow were repeated until the gravel particle movement began quantitative measurement of sediment transport rate was done for reliable observation in support of visual observations the discharge water surface profile and bed surface profile measurements were collected at the flow condition when incipient motion occurred both bed and water surface profiles were measured on the centerline of the working section along the longitudinal direction of flow at an interval of 50 cm here the water surface profile indicates the top level of the water surface along the longitudinal direction of flow the average velocity was calculated using measured discharge and flow depth the difference between the water and measured bed surface profile at the center of each 50 cm interval from the upstream working section along the flow direction was used to calculate the flow depth shear stress corresponding to incipient motion i e critical shear stress was computed using the measured flow depth and slope of the water surface as reported by ahmad et al 2018 2 2 dimensionless analysis several parameters are considered to develop a relationship for the css of gravel particles contained in the cohesive sediment mixtures kothyari and jain 2010 singh et al 2019 however only the parameters that produced superior outcomes were included in the following analysis 4 τ cc f τ cm w p c d 50 d a σ g γ b γ w using dimensional analysis 5 τ cc τ cm f p c σ cc γ b γ w w 6 σ cc σ d 50 σ g d a here d 50 is the median size of the sediment and σ g is the geometric standard deviation of the particular sediment present in the mixture equation 4 gives the functional relationship between css and the other parameters the presence of clay in the sediment mixture is accounted for parameter p c and the parameter γ b γ w was chosen to account for the variety of cohesive bed compactness as the mean size of cohesive sediment mixture d a is significantly different from the median size d 50 of individual sediment present in the mixture and this variability in sediment sizes creates the hiding exposure phenomena hence to account for this variability the parameter σ cc has been incorporated for developing the relationship for css water content w is considered a variable that plays a significant role in bonding the particles together a large number of trials were done using soft computing with the parameters given in equation 5 that led to cs s 2 3 data description and correlation analysis the statistical description of all the data used in the current study is presented in table 2 fig 3 also shows the frequency histogram of each of the variables used in the research if the skewness and kurtosis values are between 2 and 2 the data distribution can be suitable for modeling nie et al 1975 and george 2011 correlation and regression analysis should be performed to determine the influential variables on the target variable fig 4 shows the pearson correlation coefficient between the independent variables and the incipient motion criterion according to the figure the highest correlation coefficient is observed between the percentage of clay p c and the incipient motion criterion r c 0 77 the weighted standard deviation of the cohesive mixture σ cc is the second most effective parameter r c 0 58 the lowest correlation is related to the variable antecedent moisture content of the cohesive mixture w r c 0 34 due to the positive values r c all the independent variables under study directly affect the incipient motion criterion which means that increasing their values increases critical shear stress also to investigate the relationship between the variables the mutual information mi method was used in information theory mutual information is a non linear and nonparametric measure index that can evaluate the correlation between two measured variables the value of mi is calculated by the following equation tian et al 2019 7 m i x y p xy log p xy p x p y where p x and p y are marginal probability distribution functions and p x y is the joint probability distribution function of variables x and y if and y are independent the mi 0 and larger values show dependency between two variables tian et al 2019 the mi values for the p c w σ cc and γ b γ w were computed to be 0 4728 0 1048 0 4724 and 0 2501 respectively the highest mi values are related to two variables namely the percentage of clay p c mi 0 4728 and weighted standard deviation of the cohesive mixture σ cc mi 0 4724 2 4 feature selection by the forward stepwise selection method before using machine learning models applying an effective feature selection process can reduce input variables and reduce computation time in the present study the forward stepwise selection method was used in this method one of the common methods for selecting attributes independent variables were added to the model step by step jamei et al 2021 at each stage an independent variable with the most significant impact on performance improvement is considered based on the statistical indicators such as adjusted r2 mean square error mse the mallows

wang et al 2001 according to the criteria mentioned in the previous section the optimal input combination of independent variables can be selected for model input according to the information presented in table 3 the last two rows with the number of three variables pc σ cc γ b γ w with mse 0 147 adjusted r2 0 760 mallow s cp 7 365 akaike s aic 269 982 and pc 0 248 combo 2 and last row by

selection criteria for identifying the best input combinations hereinafter the input combination includes all the variables introduced as the combo 1 and the combination consists of pc w σ cc γ b γ w identified as the combo 2 the k fold cross validation k 10 method was used to evaluate the models in k fold cross validation the data is split into a k subset one is used for validation and the other k 1 subset for training this procedure is repeated k times and all data is used exactly once for training and validation finally the average result of this k validation is chosen as a final estimate the 5 fold or 10 fold validation methods are typically used to reduce the computational cost all input and target variables are normalized by the following equation 11 x normalized 2 x x min x max x min 1 here x is the original value of the variable and min and max subscripts present the minimum and maximum of it respectively 3 overview of the data driven approaches and model development 3 1 extreme gradient boosting xgboost method in the field of machine learning extreme gradient boosting xgboost is an advanced supervised algorithm proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 likewise xgboost is the expansion of the traditional gradient boosting decision tree gbdt algorithm and is computationally exploited to resolve regression and classification problems osman et al 2021 in recent times the xgboost algorithm received massive applications in numerous disciplines such as streamflow forecasting ni et al 2020 sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 zhang et al 2019 reference evapotranspiration estimation fan et al 2018 ferreira and da cunha 2020 han et al 2019 wu et al 2019a wu et al 2019b wu and fan 2019 undrained shear strength prediction zhang et al 2021 irradiation induced transition

water table depth brédy et al 2020 fundamentally xgboost trains a series of regression trees based on residuals and then folds these trees to boost the classification act zhang et al 2019 a typical structure of the xgboost algorithm is shown in fig 6 the xgboost model is less prone to overfitting due to adding a regularization term to objective function or loss function and executes a second order taylor expansion on objective function to gain an optimal outcome sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 wu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the objective function of the xgboost model is written as chen and guestrin 2016 ni et al 2020 12 ϕ i 1 n l y i y i k 1 k f k in equation 12 ϕ represents the objective function l y i y i defines training loss function that measures the difference between predicted y

a child min child weight and the fraction of randomly selected variables used for growing a tree colsample bytree which are given in table 4 for the comprehensive background of the xgboost algorithm refer to chen and guestrin 2016 3 2 random forest rf the perception of the random forest rf model was created by breiman 2001 based on bagging bootstrap knowledge to assemble a group of decision trees through controlled variance breiman 1996 the rf is a supervised machine learning model and is efficiently recognized to optimize the regression and classification problems lindner et al 2015 in the last two decades the rf model has been extensively utilized in water resources engineering brédy et al 2020 fan et al 2018 feigl et al 2021 ferreira and da cunha 2020 park et al 2020 sattari et al 2020 sihag et al 2019b 2019a sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 singh et al 2017a yaseen et al 2021 fig 7 illustrates the architecture of the rf model which integrates many random decision trees fitted in different subsets of the input features training dataset through the bootstrap method each tree in the rf model is created from two thirds 2 3 of each bootstrap sample inbag while one third 1 3 is excluded from the bootstrap sample out of bag oob for a non biased calculation of regression error when trees are added to the forest brédy et al 2020 an average majority voting of the predictions from all the decision trees in case of a regression results in an rf model additionally for optimizing large dataset problems the rf model runs fast and efficiently without overfitting guo et al 2011 the application of the rf model requires the tuning of two main hyperparameters i the number of trees grown n estimators and ii the number of input features considered too severe at each leaf node max depth which are given in table 4 readers can obtain more information about the rf model from breiman 2001 and tyralis et al 2019 3 3 adaboost approach freund and schapire freund and schapire 1997 developed adaptive boosting adaboost as a kind of boosting algorithm adaboost is an iterative algorithm for ensemble learning that can solve classification and regression problems its main idea is to create strong learners by combining weak learners in the training phase of the adaboost algorithm a weight is assigned to each weak learner based on the accuracy rate and weight is given to each training sample which indicates the correctness of the training process if any training samples are classified correctly the weight will be reduced while adding a weak learner otherwise its weight will increase so the classifier can focus on the wrongly classified instance in the next iteration the main disadvantage of this method is the variance in data training but when the number of trees increases this problem is primarily solved buitinck et al 2013 the algorithm of the adaboost method is as follows el bilali et al 2021 suppose a training dataset as d x 1 y 1 x m y m where y m is target vector x m is the input vector and m is the number of training data the weight vector is initialized as follows 13 w 1 x i 1 m f o r i 1 2 m by considering t weak learners h t t 1 2 t calculate the error rate as 14 ε t p t x i h t x i y i here p t x i w t x i i 1 m w t x i and if ε t 0 5 and t t 1 exit the loop the following equation can calculate weight confidence 15 α t l o g ε t 1 ε t in the next stage weight modification can be done for all training data from i to m 16 w t 1 x i w t x i e y i h t x i α t if ε t 0 001 and t t determine p t x i and repeat until the criteria are satisfied the final output creates a strong learner by combining weak weight learners jamei et al 2021c 17 h x s i g n j t α t h t x y in the present study the cart decision tree is used as a base regressor the learning rate adjusts contribution of weak learners in the final strong learner the maximum depth of the trees max depth and the maximum number of trees n estimator controls the number of weak learners are important parameters to define the adaboost model the grid search approach was used to fine tune mentioned parameters fig 8 presents the schematic flowchart of the adaboost algorithm 3 4 voting scheme a voting or ensemble mechanism handles multiple learners classifiers or weak base learners together it produces a powerful novel learner to solve the regression and classification problems in the machine learning field wang et al 2019 also for maintaining the class imbalance the voting or ensemble mechanism is performed guo et al 2011 wang et al 2019 similarly the voting mechanism increases the strength and diversity of the base classifiers learners park et al 2020 tripoliti et al 2013 in the regression problems a voting ensemble predicts the average of multiple other learners regressor generally regressor ensembles techniques optimize the regression problems by adopting the simple or weighted average to combine the targets by considering a single value regression problem without loss of generality f x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x t y t there exist n learners or regressors r i i 1 n using t training samples the ensemble output y is written as 18 y j i 1 n w i z ij i 1 n w i r i x j j 1 2 t here w i defines the weight of the i th regressor r i z ij describes the i th regressor output corresponding to the i th training sample x j z ij r i x j apart from all the combined ensemble the voting averaged ensemble algorithm combines the output in the following stages i classifying the regressor output z j z 1 j z 2 j z nj t can be divided into m classes c jk k 1 m according to some strategies such as c j 1 c j 2 c jm c l a s s i f y i n g z j ii voting according to the voting of the majority the k th class is the winner class such as c j k v o t i n g c j 1 c j 2 c jm iii averaging the weighted or simple average value of the k th class is considered as the ensemble output equivalent to the i th sample such as y j a v e r a g i n g c j k in the present study three base learners models including rf xgboost and adaboost have been trained in the python scikit learn library to estimate cs s in a cohesive sediment mixture fig 9 shows the roadmap of the voting mechanism adopted in the current study 3 5 goodness of fit criteria to evaluate the performance of the developed models five sophisticated statistical indexes including correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape t stat and king gupta metric kge were used as follows ahmadianfar et al 2021 jamei et al 2021b 19 r i 1 n p i p t i t i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n t i t 2 1 r 1 20 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i t i 2 0 5 0 r m s e 21 mape 1 n i 1 n t i p i t i 0 m a p e 22 t s t a t n 1 m b e 2 rms e 2 m b e 2 m b e 1 n i 1 n p i t i 23 kge 1 r 1 2 s t d p s t d t 1 2 p t 1 2 k g e 1 here pi is the predicted value and ti is the target value t and p are the mean value of the target and predicted values respectively st d p and st d t are the standard deviation of predicted and target values the closing value of the correlation coefficient r and the kge index to one depicts the better performance of the developed models models with smaller rmse and mape values have higher accuracy 3 6 model development and configuration here a multi level voting based ensemble machine learning model was developed to predict the cs s in the cohesive sediment mixture obtained from the integrative prediction of three robust standalone ensemble models including xgboost adaboost and rf the best two input combinations combo 1 and 2 were extracted through a stepwise feature selection combined with mutual information among four input variables pc w γ b γ w and σ cc the setting parameters owing to three standalone models were optimized through a grid search process by definition of a suitable interval space all designed models grid search framework and the feature selection approach mutual information and forward stepwise were performed on a system with intel core i7 9850h cpu with 3 40 ghz and 16 0 gb of ram through the open source scikit learn package pedregosa et al 2011 and xgboost as an api reference in the python 3 8 environment the optimum architectures of all standalone ensemble ml models and voting schemes are detailed in table 4 fig 10 illustrates the 3d variation of rmse versus two main setting parameters in each standalone ensemble model according to fig 10 in the rf model n estimator and max depth parameters as the most influential setting parameters yield the optimum solution in the spaces of 180 250 and 10 20 respectively fig 10 shows the variation of rmse versus n estimator and learn rate parameters in the adaboost model it can be seen that the optimum zone is available in ranges of 5 10 and 0 01 0 05 for the n estimator and learn rate respectively besides the n estimator and learn rate as the most crucial setting parameters in the xgboost model yield the most promising performance in rages of 20 50 and 0 1 0 2 respectively 4 application results and discussion in order to insightfully evaluate the competence of the provided ai ensemble models five efficient statistical metrics r rmse mape kge and t stat were utilized these statistical criteria address extensive information for accurate assessment of the predictability potential of each developed model during the training and testing phases table 5 lists the performance metrics of each model for the selective input combinations in which the superior model was identified based on the highest r and kge values and the lowest rmse mape and t stat values the results listed in table 5 for the training stage of combo 1 exhibit that the voting model owing to r 0 9765 rmse 0 1932 mape 5 5003 kge 0 8699 and t stat 1 8244 has the desirable agreement with the observational datasets besides rf and xgboost in terms of r 0 9761 rmse 0 1822 mape 7 6545 and t stat 0 2071 and r 0 9619 rmse 0 2355 mape 7 8419 and t stat 1 9673 stood on second and third ranks in the training phase the statistical metrics of the testing phase for combo 1 show that the multi level voting model by combining the predictive results of three standalone ensemble approaches could significantly enhance the accuracy of simulation of cs s regarding r 0 9641 rmse 0 2022 and mape 5 5003 the xgboost and adaboost on account of r 0 9482 rmse 0 2375 and kge 0 9268 and r 0 9496 rmse 0 2387 and kge 0 9318 respectively have relatively similar performance in the testing phase for simulation of τ cc τ cm it is noteworthy that the rf model arising in an acceptable range r 0 9392 and mape 11 7058 less than 20 lewis 1982 can be introduced as a reliable option for modeling the τ cc τ cm although it is not as accurate as of the xgboost and adaboost methods in total it can be concluded that the multi level voting model is extremely superior to three standalone models in both the training and testing phase of combo 1 and adaboost regarding better performance in testing phase is introduced as the best standalone ensemble model for prediction of τ cc τ cm according to the listed statistical accuracy metrics in table 5 for combo 2 the voting model as the main novelty of this research in terms of r 0 9333 rmse 0 2937 and kge 0 8368 for training and r 0 9067 rmse 0 3239 and kge 0 8980 for testing yields the most promising performance and adaboost with r 0 9201 and rmse 0 3163 for training and r 0 9041and rmse 0 3283 for testing has the most deserving performance among all standalone ensemble models besides a comparison of the predicting skill of each model in two examined input combinations demonstrates that all provided ml models attained better precision in combo 1 than combo 2 and the multi level ensemble model was competently selected as the most accurate model against their standalone counterparts to better understand the performance of the proposed ml methods based on statistical criteria the radar diagrams in fig 11 are utilized which show the capability of each model in the test phase the distribution of statistical criteria in the modeling indicates that the multi level voting model in violet line due to having the lowest metrics rmse mape and t stat and the highest r and kge is able to perform the modeling task in a more sophisticated manner compared to the standalone methods in both considered combinations fig 12 demonstrates a comparison between measured and predicted values of τ cc τ cm in the form of scatter plots to evaluate the goodness of fitness related models for both selective combinations in the training and testing phases in the voting scatter plot in combo 1 it can obviously be seen that all data points fell around the 45 identity line and nearly all points are between the two lines representing variations of plus or minus 20 from the line of exact fit which is a better result than for either of the three standalone ensemble models as indicated by the scatter plots among all standalone ensemble models the adaboost model on account of better agreement with the measured cs s values can be considered as the best predictor by reliable results for both training and testing series in addition the study of the distribution of obtained τ cc τ cm values from the modeling of all the methods presented in the combo 2 confirms its weaker predictive performance than those of combo 1 in combo 2 voting and adaboost owing to the better agreement were found as the more efficient ml models respectively for estimating the τ cc τ cm values in cohesive sediment mixture fig 13 exhibits the boxplot distribution function of τ cc τ cm value for all models in the testing phase of both optimal input combinations in both input combinations the best predictive performance belongs to the multi level voting ensemble models which are superior compared to three standalone counterparts besides the adaboost and xgboost in spite of similar accuracy can be ranked as the second and third best models of the combo 1 respectively whereas the adaboost was identified as the best second model in combo 2 furthermore it should be mentioned that the accuracy of all models in combo 1 is superior to combo 2 in the training and testing stages fig 14 demonstrates the taylor diagram taylor 2001 of all provided models for the selective combinations in training and testing phases the results of the taylor diagram clearly show that the voting method red symbol shows the best accuracy and efficiency in both combos 1 and 2 with respect to the smallest physical distance from the target point it can also be found that the results of the combo 1 including all input variables have higher accuracy than the combo 2 in contrast the results of all models in the test phase indicate their similar accuracy given the superiority of combo 1 the other steps of model suitability are performed for this input combination fig 15 shows the variation trend related to the outcomes of each model versus the measured τ cc τ cm value in training and testing phases the results support the conclusion that the multi level voting ensemble scheme by accurately capturing the highly non linear oscillation τ cc τ cm has the best agreement with the measured values in comparison with other models moreover it can be seen that the adaboost results illustrate a slightly higher accuracy in estimating the local non linearity than the xgboost model and rf stood as the last accuracy rank aiming to further validate the proposed models efficient error analysis based on the relative deviation rd was conducted for all data sets to specify the reliability of the predictive models for estimating the cs s according to fig 16 a the maximum and minimum magnitude of rd values are related to methods adaboost rd 29 86 and xgboost 47 68 respectively in comparison the voting approach with the lowest rd domain 38 4 21 75 band 60 15 yields the best performance and the highest level of reliability in estimating the cs s in the sediment moreover adaboost by the second lowest rd band 65 16 yields acceptable accuracy for simulating the τ cc τ cm values fig 16 b presents a comprehensive interpretation by depicting the probability density function of the rd using all predictive ml models it can be clearly seen that the multi level voting method being relatively confined to the rd range of 40 and 20 gives the least error and the best accuracy for estimating the τ cc τ cm parameter 5 comparison between experimental investigations and ml model results the comparison has been made using soft computing approaches viz xgboost adaboost rf and voting along with the existing experimental based empirical relationships given by ahmad et al ahmad et al 2018 singh et al 2017b and kothyari and jain kothyari and jain 2008 the scatter plots of the observed and computed cs s are shown with the lines of 20 and a correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the outcomes of each approach as can be seen in fig 17 a also the variation between the total datasets in percentage and the percentage error is shown in fig 17 b for xgboost adaboost rf and voting approaches approximately 90 of the datasets were determined to have errors of less than 20 whereas 100 of datasets for these approaches were determined to have errors of less than 30 as can be seen in fig 17 b according to fig 17 b comparing the proposed regression based relationships of ahmad et al 2018 kothyari and jain 2008 singh et al 2017 and outcomes of the predictive models ascertains that 70 of the predicted datasets have errors of less than 20 whereas in the previous regression based investigation 100 of datasets yield the errors of more than 50 6 variables importance assessment variable importance assessment or analysis of sensitivity is one of the vital parts in modeling based on artificial intelligence which indicates the effect of each of the predictors in the predictive model jamei et al 2020a rehamnia et al 2021 in the current study a new approach based on rf methodology was conducted using variable importance vi measure for exploring the impact of every variable in modeling τ cc τ cm using mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdg han et al 2016 mda evaluates the reduction rate of model accuracy for excluding each variable whereas mdg measures the contribution degree of every variable in rf consequence of nodes homogeneity the higher values of these criteria for a variable the more important it is in modeling fig 18 indicates the tornado diagram of mda and mdg indices for determining the importance of the variables accordingly pc owing to higher mda 0 43 and mdg 28 24 and σ cc in terms of mda 0 21 and mdg 17 97 are identified as the most important predictors respectively and w had the least effect on the prediction of cs s besides the mutual information ranking mi pc 0 4728 mi σ cc 0 4724 mi yb yw 0 2501 mi w 0 1048 confirms aforementioned discussion 7 external validation in this study for robustness evaluation of the provided intelligent models an efficient external validation strategy was addressed which was proposed by tropsha et al tropsha et al 2003 basically this external validation approach regarding new criteria is based on the model s established prediction performance table 6 shows the validation criteria and related statistics for the proposed models when k and k p are between 0 85 and 1 15 and m and n are less than 0 1 the criteria are satisfied a higher value of correlation coefficient r is observed in the voting model r 0 976 for train and r 0 964 for test dataset the higher value of m and n coefficient is observed in the voting model m 0 075 and n 0 074 for the test dataset according to table 6 all the required criteria have been met for all four models in the training and testing dataset which shows that the models possess predictive goodness and a high correlation between target and output is not accidental fig 19 also shows the criteria to be evaluated for the train upper and test lower datasets considering fig 19 all models are within the allowable range for training and testing datasets 8 conclusion and future direction in this paper a new multi level ensemble machine framework based on the voting regression of three standalone ensemble models namely xgboost adaboost and rf was adopted to predict the cs s values of gravel particles in a cohesive mixture in the present study critical shear stress was computed using the measured flow depth and slope of the water surface as reported by ahmad et al 2018 to develop greater efficiency the best input variables were found on the basis of a correlation based feature selection so called forward stepwise method in this regard two superior combinations including and all variables the water content in the fraction in a cohesive mixture were examined for the prediction of τ cc τ cm values the predictive performance of the voting model was compared with the results of each of the standalone models the outcomes ascertained that the voting model by incorporating the advantage of every standalone ensemble model could enhance the accuracy of the prediction process in both input combinations for instance in the training phase of combo 1 as the superior case the voting model decreased about 26 16 and 15 of rmse values associated with rf adaboost and xgboost models respectively the holistic and diagnostic evaluation in combo 1 reveals that the voting generates superior accuracy in terms of r 0 9641 and kge 0 9353 in comparison to the standalone ensemble models followed by adaboost r 0 9496 and kge 0 9318 xgboost r 0 9482 and kge 0 9268 and rf r 0 9392 and kge 0 9241 respectively moreover comparing the purposed intelligent models and previous empirical based investigations reveals the superiority of all developed ensemble models in contrast kothyari and jain kothyari and jain 2008 model had the best performance among all empirical relationships for estimating τ cc τ cm of gravel particles in a cohesive sediment mixture the most influential variable in the predicting process was indicated with respect to mean decrease accuracy strategy in terms of mdg 28 2 and mda 0 43 eventually the external validation proved that all predictive approaches were confined in 0 85 k k p 1 15 and m n 0 1 according to the developed model s performance on training and test data the ability of good generalization is demonstrated and this proves that introducing new data to the models will give good results and high performance although the proposed methods for accurate estimation of τ cc τ cm values of gravel particles yielded good accuracy diverse aspects of ensemble ml strategy such as stacking bagging and boosting schemes as well as physical aspects of the problem i e study on the τ cc τ cm of the non cohesive sediments can be considered as future research credit authorship

the incipient motion condition occurs when the flow induced shear stress over the bed exceeds a certain critical value known as css critical shear stress incipient motion studies are crucial because they aid in the solution of a variety of issues such as soil erosion reservoir sedimentation channel design river morphological forecasts and the impact of fine sediment deposition on aquatic life etc shields 1936 was the first researcher who introduced the shields curve for calculating the css in uniform cohesionless sediment several investigations on incipient motion of uniform iwagaki 1956 yalin and karahan 1979 yang 1973 and non uniform ashida 1971 bridge and bennett 1992 dey and debnath 2000 egiazaroff 1965 parker et al 1982 patel and ranga raju 1999 wu et al 2000 cohesionless sediment are also reported in the literature for cohesionless uniform sediments the incipient motion criterion is well established for calculating the css garde and raju 2000 hrissanthou and hartmann 1998 however the css is still under investigation for non uniform sediment especially in the presence of clay in nature river bed material is made up of a mix of non cohesive as well as cohesive sediments garde and raju 2000 due to the dominance of cohesive sediment s physio chemical characteristics the erosion characteristic of cohesive sediment differs significantly from that of cohesionless material garde and raju 2000 when cohesive sediment is mixed with cohesionless sediment the resulting mixture is called a cohesive sediment mixture singh et al 2019 singh and ahmad 2019 several laboratory studies on the incipient motion for various cohesive sediment mixtures have been done in the past such as clay sand clay silt sand clay gravel clay sand gravel clay silt gravel and clay silt sand gravel mixtures ahmad et al 2018 ansari et al 2007 dunn 1959 julian and torres 2006 kamphuis and hall 1983 kothyari and jain 2008 mitchener and torfs 1996 panagiotopoulos et al 1997 singh et al 2017b torfs et al 1994 wang and hwang 2012 however only a few studies have been conducted regarding gravel particles in a cohesive mixture and their model results are limited to the correlation coefficient of between computed and measured values dimensionless css around 0 80 singh et al 2017b wang and hwang 2012 the present study considered equations 1 2 and 3 for incipient motion for calculating τ cc τ cm for cohesive mixtures including gravel particles established by ahmad et al 2018 singh et al 2017b and kothyari and jain 2008 respectively 1 τ cc τ cm 1 0 354 p c 2 081 1 p s 2 275 ρ b ρ w 4 10 2 τ cc τ

sediment having a size equal to the arithmetic mean size of cohesive sediment mixture n m2 p c is the clay percentage in fraction by weight p s is the sand percentage in fraction by weight ρ b is the bulk density of cohesive sediment kg m3 ρ w is fluid density kg m3 uc s is the dimensionless unconfined compressive strength of cohesive sediment mixture e is the void ratio σ cc is weighted geometric standard deviation for particle size in cohesive sediment mixture γ b is the bulk unit weight of cohesive sediment n m3 γ w is the unit weight of water n m3 the term cs s is used for τ cc τ cm which represents dimensionless css as the present study deals with the computation of critical shear stress for gravel particles in the presence of clay particles in the sediment mixture equations 1 2 and 3 were chosen because they directly incorporate the impact of both gravel and clay in the sediment mixture while comparing these three equations there is the absence of silt particles in sediment mixture for kothyari and jain 2008 absence of sand particles for ahmad et al 2018 and presence of both silt and sand particles for singh et al 2017b the presence or absence of sand silt particles may act like a limitation which may cause the application of one equation expression to be more or less well suited to other sediment mixtures in recent decades artificial intelligence ai approaches have been widely used to solve complex hydraulic and water resources engineering problems aamir and ahmad 2019 azamathulla and jarrett 2013 azamathulla and mohd yusoff 2013 najafzadeh and oliveto 2020 pandey et al 2020a 2020b parsaie et al 2019 safari et al 2016 jamei et al 2021a recently researchers have advocated for the use of ai to forecast critical shear stresses and sediment transport in natural and manufactured channels asce task committee 2000 bizimana and altunkaynak 2019 safari et al 2016 zounemat kermani et al 2018 najafzadeh and oliveto employed a variety of artificial intelligence algorithms to calculate the riprap incipient motion for overtopping flows najafzadeh and oliveto 2020 ebtehaj et al used different intelligence algorithms approaches to predict the critical stresses in rigid rectangular stormwater channels and reported good agreements with experimental data ebtehaj et al 2017 azamathulla et al used an artificial intelligence technique i e support vector machine to calculate the sediment load and stated that the support vector machine technique showed a higher level of performance than other standard sediment loading methods azamathulla et al 2010 ghani and azamathulla used gene expression programming for calculating the sediment transport in sewer systems ab ghani and md azamathulla 2011 they stated that the gene expression programming approach could accurately estimate the sediment transport in sewers bizimana and altunkaynak 2021 investigated the influence of bed roughness on critical shear stresses and incipient motion using hybrid geno fuzzy and neuro fuzzy methods they found that the outcomes of the hybrid geno fuzzy method outperformed the neuro fuzzy and linear regression methods more recently pandey et al predicted scour depth near spur dikes using two novel tree based ensemble models namely stacked boosting regression tree sbrt and stacked bagging regression tree sbgt pandey et al 2021b also pandey et al 2021a presented three robust ai based techniques including gradient boosting decision tree gbdt cascaded forward neural network cfnn and kernel ridge regression krr to predict the scour depth around spur dike in cohesive sediment mixtures the main goal of this research was to assess the potential of a new multi level voting based ensemble model which along with experimental investigation was developed to predict τ cc τ cm in the cohesive sediment mixture here the outcomes of three expert ensemble machine learning models i e xgboost adaboost and rf are combined using a voting strategy to enhance the standalone model accuracy in the prediction process in addition the best input combinations were identified based on a forward stepwise feature selection and mutual information consequences the outcomes of the voting model were validated using external validation in addition the robustness of all models was comprehensively examined with the previous empirical investigations 2 material and method 2 1 data and description of experimentation from the literature a large quantity of experimental laboratory data for critical shear stress in cohesive sediments was collected from singh et al 2017b kothyari and jain 2008 and ahmad et al 2018 a total of 125 experimental laboratory data from prior investigations were included in addition 18 experimental tests were completed by the authors to calculate the critical shear stresses in cohesive sediments thus our artificial intelligence approach to predict cs s was based on a total of 143 datasets table 1 shows the flow and sediment parameters of the current data and data from the literature in this table d a is the arithmetic mean size of the sediment mixture h is average flow depth u is the velocity of flow s f is water surface slope and w is the water content in the cohesive mixture all experiments were completed at the hydraulic laboratory of the civil engineering department indian institute of technology iit roorkee uttarakhand india for clay silt gravel and clay silt sand gravel mixture by singh et al 2017b clay was varied from 10 to 50 in cohesive mixtures such as clay silt gravel and clay silt sand gravel while cohesionless sediments were varied in equal proportions in the remaining quantity the experimental flume had a working section of 6 00 m long 0 75 m wide and 0 18 m deep starting at a distance of 7 00 m from the flume entrance the depth of the working section in the flume for filling of cohesive sediments was 0 18 m which is taken as the flume bed s general level here a thin coating of the same sediment was uniformly placed on the rest of the flume bed to imitate the roughness of the working section the water flow in the flume was controlled by a valve installed in the inlet line leading from the overhead tank a rectangular tank is provided at the end of the flume after the flow deflector for discharge measurement fig 1 illustrates a schematic view of the experimental setup the appropriate sediments were first dried and weighted according to proportion before being physically mixed to prepare the channel bed water was added to the sediment mixture and thoroughly mixed for equal moisture distribution the prepared sediment mixture was covered with polythene and left for around 24 h before being placed in the working section the sediment mixture was carefully mixed again to finalize the working section the sediments mixture was filled in the working section and compacted into three layers the working section was compacted using the dynamic compaction method in this method each layer was compacted with a 400 n cylindrical roller and the flume sides were compressed with a rectangular bottom hand rammer as illustrated in fig 2 initially a low discharge was permitted in the flume for each experimental run and uniform flow was maintained by operating the tailgate the sediment bed was visually inspected during the process of generating the uniform flow to check for sediment particle dissociation the sediment bed was visually inspected during the process of generating the uniform flow to check the detachment of the sediments the small increment in discharge and maintaining a consistent flow were repeated until the gravel particle movement began quantitative measurement of sediment transport rate was done for reliable observation in support of visual observations the discharge water surface profile and bed surface profile measurements were collected at the flow condition when incipient motion occurred both bed and water surface profiles were measured on the centerline of the working section along the longitudinal direction of flow at an interval of 50 cm here the water surface profile indicates the top level of the water surface along the longitudinal direction of flow the average velocity was calculated using measured discharge and flow depth the difference between the water and measured bed surface profile at the center of each 50 cm interval from the upstream working section along the flow direction was used to calculate the flow depth shear stress corresponding to incipient motion i e critical shear stress was computed using the measured flow depth and slope of the water surface as reported by ahmad et al 2018 2 2 dimensionless analysis several parameters are considered to develop a relationship for the css of gravel particles contained in the cohesive sediment mixtures kothyari and jain 2010 singh et al 2019 however only the parameters that produced superior outcomes were included in the following analysis 4 τ cc f τ cm w p c d 50 d a σ g γ b γ w using dimensional analysis 5 τ cc τ cm f p c σ cc γ b γ w w 6 σ cc σ d 50 σ g d a here d 50 is the median size of the sediment and σ g is the geometric standard deviation of the particular sediment present in the mixture equation 4 gives the functional relationship between css and the other parameters the presence of clay in the sediment mixture is accounted for parameter p c and the parameter γ b γ w was chosen to account for the variety of cohesive bed compactness as the mean size of cohesive sediment mixture d a is significantly different from the median size d 50 of individual sediment present in the mixture and this variability in sediment sizes creates the hiding exposure phenomena hence to account for this variability the parameter σ cc has been incorporated for developing the relationship for css water content w is considered a variable that plays a significant role in bonding the particles together a large number of trials were done using soft computing with the parameters given in equation 5 that led to cs s 2 3 data description and correlation analysis the statistical description of all the data used in the current study is presented in table 2 fig 3 also shows the frequency histogram of each of the variables used in the research if the skewness and kurtosis values are between 2 and 2 the data distribution can be suitable for modeling nie et al 1975 and george 2011 correlation and regression analysis should be performed to determine the influential variables on the target variable fig 4 shows the pearson correlation coefficient between the independent variables and the incipient motion criterion according to the figure the highest correlation coefficient is observed between the percentage of clay p c and the incipient motion criterion r c 0 77 the weighted standard deviation of the cohesive mixture σ cc is the second most effective parameter r c 0 58 the lowest correlation is related to the variable antecedent moisture content of the cohesive mixture w r c 0 34 due to the positive values r c all the independent variables under study directly affect the incipient motion criterion which means that increasing their values increases critical shear stress also to investigate the relationship between the variables the mutual information mi method was used in information theory mutual information is a non linear and nonparametric measure index that can evaluate the correlation between two measured variables the value of mi is calculated by the following equation tian et al 2019 7 m i x y p xy log p xy p x p y where p x and p y are marginal probability distribution functions and p x y is the joint probability distribution function of variables x and y if and y are independent the mi 0 and larger values show dependency between two variables tian et al 2019 the mi values for the p c w σ cc and γ b γ w were computed to be 0 4728 0 1048 0 4724 and 0 2501 respectively the highest mi values are related to two variables namely the percentage of clay p c mi 0 4728 and weighted standard deviation of the cohesive mixture σ cc mi 0 4724 2 4 feature selection by the forward stepwise selection method before using machine learning models applying an effective feature selection process can reduce input variables and reduce computation time in the present study the forward stepwise selection method was used in this method one of the common methods for selecting attributes independent variables were added to the model step by step jamei et al 2021 at each stage an independent variable with the most significant impact on performance improvement is considered based on the statistical indicators such as adjusted r2 mean square error mse the mallows

wang et al 2001 according to the criteria mentioned in the previous section the optimal input combination of independent variables can be selected for model input according to the information presented in table 3 the last two rows with the number of three variables pc σ cc γ b γ w with mse 0 147 adjusted r2 0 760 mallow s cp 7 365 akaike s aic 269 982 and pc 0 248 combo 2 and last row by

selection criteria for identifying the best input combinations hereinafter the input combination includes all the variables introduced as the combo 1 and the combination consists of pc w σ cc γ b γ w identified as the combo 2 the k fold cross validation k 10 method was used to evaluate the models in k fold cross validation the data is split into a k subset one is used for validation and the other k 1 subset for training this procedure is repeated k times and all data is used exactly once for training and validation finally the average result of this k validation is chosen as a final estimate the 5 fold or 10 fold validation methods are typically used to reduce the computational cost all input and target variables are normalized by the following equation 11 x normalized 2 x x min x max x min 1 here x is the original value of the variable and min and max subscripts present the minimum and maximum of it respectively 3 overview of the data driven approaches and model development 3 1 extreme gradient boosting xgboost method in the field of machine learning extreme gradient boosting xgboost is an advanced supervised algorithm proposed by chen and guestrin 2016 likewise xgboost is the expansion of the traditional gradient boosting decision tree gbdt algorithm and is computationally exploited to resolve regression and classification problems osman et al 2021 in recent times the xgboost algorithm received massive applications in numerous disciplines such as streamflow forecasting ni et al 2020 sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 zhang et al 2019 reference evapotranspiration estimation fan et al 2018 ferreira and da cunha 2020 han et al 2019 wu et al 2019a wu et al 2019b wu and fan 2019 undrained shear strength prediction zhang et al 2021 irradiation induced transition

water table depth brédy et al 2020 fundamentally xgboost trains a series of regression trees based on residuals and then folds these trees to boost the classification act zhang et al 2019 a typical structure of the xgboost algorithm is shown in fig 6 the xgboost model is less prone to overfitting due to adding a regularization term to objective function or loss function and executes a second order taylor expansion on objective function to gain an optimal outcome sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 wu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the objective function of the xgboost model is written as chen and guestrin 2016 ni et al 2020 12 ϕ i 1 n l y i y i k 1 k f k in equation 12 ϕ represents the objective function l y i y i defines training loss function that measures the difference between predicted y

a child min child weight and the fraction of randomly selected variables used for growing a tree colsample bytree which are given in table 4 for the comprehensive background of the xgboost algorithm refer to chen and guestrin 2016 3 2 random forest rf the perception of the random forest rf model was created by breiman 2001 based on bagging bootstrap knowledge to assemble a group of decision trees through controlled variance breiman 1996 the rf is a supervised machine learning model and is efficiently recognized to optimize the regression and classification problems lindner et al 2015 in the last two decades the rf model has been extensively utilized in water resources engineering brédy et al 2020 fan et al 2018 feigl et al 2021 ferreira and da cunha 2020 park et al 2020 sattari et al 2020 sihag et al 2019b 2019a sikorska senoner and quilty 2021 singh et al 2017a yaseen et al 2021 fig 7 illustrates the architecture of the rf model which integrates many random decision trees fitted in different subsets of the input features training dataset through the bootstrap method each tree in the rf model is created from two thirds 2 3 of each bootstrap sample inbag while one third 1 3 is excluded from the bootstrap sample out of bag oob for a non biased calculation of regression error when trees are added to the forest brédy et al 2020 an average majority voting of the predictions from all the decision trees in case of a regression results in an rf model additionally for optimizing large dataset problems the rf model runs fast and efficiently without overfitting guo et al 2011 the application of the rf model requires the tuning of two main hyperparameters i the number of trees grown n estimators and ii the number of input features considered too severe at each leaf node max depth which are given in table 4 readers can obtain more information about the rf model from breiman 2001 and tyralis et al 2019 3 3 adaboost approach freund and schapire freund and schapire 1997 developed adaptive boosting adaboost as a kind of boosting algorithm adaboost is an iterative algorithm for ensemble learning that can solve classification and regression problems its main idea is to create strong learners by combining weak learners in the training phase of the adaboost algorithm a weight is assigned to each weak learner based on the accuracy rate and weight is given to each training sample which indicates the correctness of the training process if any training samples are classified correctly the weight will be reduced while adding a weak learner otherwise its weight will increase so the classifier can focus on the wrongly classified instance in the next iteration the main disadvantage of this method is the variance in data training but when the number of trees increases this problem is primarily solved buitinck et al 2013 the algorithm of the adaboost method is as follows el bilali et al 2021 suppose a training dataset as d x 1 y 1 x m y m where y m is target vector x m is the input vector and m is the number of training data the weight vector is initialized as follows 13 w 1 x i 1 m f o r i 1 2 m by considering t weak learners h t t 1 2 t calculate the error rate as 14 ε t p t x i h t x i y i here p t x i w t x i i 1 m w t x i and if ε t 0 5 and t t 1 exit the loop the following equation can calculate weight confidence 15 α t l o g ε t 1 ε t in the next stage weight modification can be done for all training data from i to m 16 w t 1 x i w t x i e y i h t x i α t if ε t 0 001 and t t determine p t x i and repeat until the criteria are satisfied the final output creates a strong learner by combining weak weight learners jamei et al 2021c 17 h x s i g n j t α t h t x y in the present study the cart decision tree is used as a base regressor the learning rate adjusts contribution of weak learners in the final strong learner the maximum depth of the trees max depth and the maximum number of trees n estimator controls the number of weak learners are important parameters to define the adaboost model the grid search approach was used to fine tune mentioned parameters fig 8 presents the schematic flowchart of the adaboost algorithm 3 4 voting scheme a voting or ensemble mechanism handles multiple learners classifiers or weak base learners together it produces a powerful novel learner to solve the regression and classification problems in the machine learning field wang et al 2019 also for maintaining the class imbalance the voting or ensemble mechanism is performed guo et al 2011 wang et al 2019 similarly the voting mechanism increases the strength and diversity of the base classifiers learners park et al 2020 tripoliti et al 2013 in the regression problems a voting ensemble predicts the average of multiple other learners regressor generally regressor ensembles techniques optimize the regression problems by adopting the simple or weighted average to combine the targets by considering a single value regression problem without loss of generality f x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 x t y t there exist n learners or regressors r i i 1 n using t training samples the ensemble output y is written as 18 y j i 1 n w i z ij i 1 n w i r i x j j 1 2 t here w i defines the weight of the i th regressor r i z ij describes the i th regressor output corresponding to the i th training sample x j z ij r i x j apart from all the combined ensemble the voting averaged ensemble algorithm combines the output in the following stages i classifying the regressor output z j z 1 j z 2 j z nj t can be divided into m classes c jk k 1 m according to some strategies such as c j 1 c j 2 c jm c l a s s i f y i n g z j ii voting according to the voting of the majority the k th class is the winner class such as c j k v o t i n g c j 1 c j 2 c jm iii averaging the weighted or simple average value of the k th class is considered as the ensemble output equivalent to the i th sample such as y j a v e r a g i n g c j k in the present study three base learners models including rf xgboost and adaboost have been trained in the python scikit learn library to estimate cs s in a cohesive sediment mixture fig 9 shows the roadmap of the voting mechanism adopted in the current study 3 5 goodness of fit criteria to evaluate the performance of the developed models five sophisticated statistical indexes including correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape t stat and king gupta metric kge were used as follows ahmadianfar et al 2021 jamei et al 2021b 19 r i 1 n p i p t i t i 1

deviation of predicted and target values the closing value of the correlation coefficient r and the kge index to one depicts the better performance of the developed models models with smaller rmse and mape values have higher accuracy 3 6 model development and configuration here a multi level voting based ensemble machine learning model was developed to predict the cs s in the cohesive sediment mixture obtained from the integrative prediction of three robust standalone ensemble models including xgboost adaboost and rf the best two input combinations combo 1 and 2 were extracted through a stepwise feature selection combined with mutual information among four input variables pc w γ b γ w and σ cc the setting parameters owing to three standalone models were optimized through a grid search process by definition of a suitable interval space all designed models grid search framework and the feature selection approach mutual information and forward stepwise were performed on a system with intel core i7 9850h cpu with 3 40 ghz and 16 0 gb of ram through the open source scikit learn package pedregosa et al 2011 and xgboost as an api reference in the python 3 8 environment the optimum architectures of all standalone ensemble ml models and voting schemes are detailed in table 4 fig 10 illustrates the 3d variation of rmse versus two main setting parameters in each standalone ensemble model according to fig 10 in the rf model n estimator and max depth parameters as the most influential setting parameters yield the optimum solution in the spaces of 180 250 and 10 20 respectively fig 10 shows the variation of rmse versus n estimator and learn rate parameters in the adaboost model it can be seen that the optimum zone is available in ranges of 5 10 and 0 01 0 05 for the n estimator and learn rate respectively besides the n estimator and learn rate as the most crucial setting parameters in the xgboost model yield the most promising performance in rages of 20 50 and 0 1 0 2 respectively 4 application results and discussion in order to insightfully evaluate the competence of the provided ai ensemble models five efficient statistical metrics r rmse mape kge and t stat were utilized these statistical criteria address extensive information for accurate assessment of the predictability potential of each developed model during the training and testing phases table 5 lists the performance metrics of each model for the selective input combinations in which the superior model was identified based on the highest r and kge values and the lowest rmse mape and t stat values the results listed in table 5 for the training stage of combo 1 exhibit that the voting model owing to r 0 9765 rmse 0 1932 mape 5 5003 kge 0 8699 and t stat 1 8244 has the desirable agreement with the observational datasets besides rf and xgboost in terms of r 0 9761 rmse 0 1822 mape 7 6545 and t stat 0 2071 and r 0 9619 rmse 0 2355 mape 7 8419 and t stat 1 9673 stood on second and third ranks in the training phase the statistical metrics of the testing phase for combo 1 show that the multi level voting model by combining the predictive results of three standalone ensemble approaches could significantly enhance the accuracy of simulation of cs s regarding r 0 9641 rmse 0 2022 and mape 5 5003 the xgboost and adaboost on account of r 0 9482 rmse 0 2375 and kge 0 9268 and r 0 9496 rmse 0 2387 and kge 0 9318 respectively have relatively similar performance in the testing phase for simulation of τ cc τ cm it is noteworthy that the rf model arising in an acceptable range r 0 9392 and mape 11 7058 less than 20 lewis 1982 can be introduced as a reliable option for modeling the τ cc τ cm although it is not as accurate as of the xgboost and adaboost methods in total it can be concluded that the multi level voting model is extremely superior to three standalone models in both the training and testing phase of combo 1 and adaboost regarding better performance in testing phase is introduced as the best standalone ensemble model for prediction of τ cc τ cm according to the listed statistical accuracy metrics in table 5 for combo 2 the voting model as the main novelty of this research in terms of r 0 9333 rmse 0 2937 and kge 0 8368 for training and r 0 9067 rmse 0 3239 and kge 0 8980 for testing yields the most promising performance and adaboost with r 0 9201 and rmse 0 3163 for training and r 0 9041and rmse 0 3283 for testing has the most deserving performance among all standalone ensemble models besides a comparison of the predicting skill of each model in two examined input combinations demonstrates that all provided ml models attained better precision in combo 1 than combo 2 and the multi level ensemble model was competently selected as the most accurate model against their standalone counterparts to better understand the performance of the proposed ml methods based on statistical criteria the radar diagrams in fig 11 are utilized which show the capability of each model in the test phase the distribution of statistical criteria in the modeling indicates that the multi level voting model in violet line due to having the lowest metrics rmse mape and t stat and the highest r and kge is able to perform the modeling task in a more sophisticated manner compared to the standalone methods in both considered combinations fig 12 demonstrates a comparison between measured and predicted values of τ cc τ cm in the form of scatter plots to evaluate the goodness of fitness related models for both selective combinations in the training and testing phases in the voting scatter plot in combo 1 it can obviously be seen that all data points fell around the 45 identity line and nearly all points are between the two lines representing variations of plus or minus 20 from the line of exact fit which is a better result than for either of the three standalone ensemble models as indicated by the scatter plots among all standalone ensemble models the adaboost model on account of better agreement with the measured cs s values can be considered as the best predictor by reliable results for both training and testing series in addition the study of the distribution of obtained τ cc τ cm values from the modeling of all the methods presented in the combo 2 confirms its weaker predictive performance than those of combo 1 in combo 2 voting and adaboost owing to the better agreement were found as the more efficient ml models respectively for estimating the τ cc τ cm values in cohesive sediment mixture fig 13 exhibits the boxplot distribution function of τ cc τ cm value for all models in the testing phase of both optimal input combinations in both input combinations the best predictive performance belongs to the multi level voting ensemble models which are superior compared to three standalone counterparts besides the adaboost and xgboost in spite of similar accuracy can be ranked as the second and third best models of the combo 1 respectively whereas the adaboost was identified as the best second model in combo 2 furthermore it should be mentioned that the accuracy of all models in combo 1 is superior to combo 2 in the training and testing stages fig 14 demonstrates the taylor diagram taylor 2001 of all provided models for the selective combinations in training and testing phases the results of the taylor diagram clearly show that the voting method red symbol shows the best accuracy and efficiency in both combos 1 and 2 with respect to the smallest physical distance from the target point it can also be found that the results of the combo 1 including all input variables have higher accuracy than the combo 2 in contrast the results of all models in the test phase indicate their similar accuracy given the superiority of combo 1 the other steps of model suitability are performed for this input combination fig 15 shows the variation trend related to the outcomes of each model versus the measured τ cc τ cm value in training and testing phases the results support the conclusion that the multi level voting ensemble scheme by accurately capturing the highly non linear oscillation τ cc τ cm has the best agreement with the measured values in comparison with other models moreover it can be seen that the adaboost results illustrate a slightly higher accuracy in estimating the local non linearity than the xgboost model and rf stood as the last accuracy rank aiming to further validate the proposed models efficient error analysis based on the relative deviation rd was conducted for all data sets to specify the reliability of the predictive models for estimating the cs s according to fig 16 a the maximum and minimum magnitude of rd values are related to methods adaboost rd 29 86 and xgboost 47 68 respectively in comparison the voting approach with the lowest rd domain 38 4 21 75 band 60 15 yields the best performance and the highest level of reliability in estimating the cs s in the sediment moreover adaboost by the second lowest rd band 65 16 yields acceptable accuracy for simulating the τ cc τ cm values fig 16 b presents a comprehensive interpretation by depicting the probability density function of the rd using all predictive ml models it can be clearly seen that the multi level voting method being relatively confined to the rd range of 40 and 20 gives the least error and the best accuracy for estimating the τ cc τ cm parameter 5 comparison between experimental investigations and ml model results the comparison has been made using soft computing approaches viz xgboost adaboost rf and voting along with the existing experimental based empirical relationships given by ahmad et al ahmad et al 2018 singh et al 2017b and kothyari and jain kothyari and jain 2008 the scatter plots of the observed and computed cs s are shown with the lines of 20 and a correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the outcomes of each approach as can be seen in fig 17 a also the variation between the total datasets in percentage and the percentage error is shown in fig 17 b for xgboost adaboost rf and voting approaches approximately 90 of the datasets were determined to have errors of less than 20 whereas 100 of datasets for these approaches were determined to have errors of less than 30 as can be seen in fig 17 b according to fig 17 b comparing the proposed regression based relationships of ahmad et al 2018 kothyari and jain 2008 singh et al 2017 and outcomes of the predictive models ascertains that 70 of the predicted datasets have errors of less than 20 whereas in the previous regression based investigation 100 of datasets yield the errors of more than 50 6 variables importance assessment variable importance assessment or analysis of sensitivity is one of the vital parts in modeling based on artificial intelligence which indicates the effect of each of the predictors in the predictive model jamei et al 2020a rehamnia et al 2021 in the current study a new approach based on rf methodology was conducted using variable importance vi measure for exploring the impact of every variable in modeling τ cc τ cm using mean decrease accuracy mda and mean decrease gini mdg han et al 2016 mda evaluates the reduction rate of model accuracy for excluding each variable whereas mdg measures the contribution degree of every variable in rf consequence of nodes homogeneity the higher values of these criteria for a variable the more important it is in modeling fig 18 indicates the tornado diagram of mda and mdg indices for determining the importance of the variables accordingly pc owing to higher mda 0 43 and mdg 28 24 and σ cc in terms of mda 0 21 and mdg 17 97 are identified as the most important predictors respectively and w had the least effect on the prediction of cs s besides the mutual information ranking mi pc 0 4728 mi σ cc 0 4724 mi yb yw 0 2501 mi w 0 1048 confirms aforementioned discussion 7 external validation in this study for robustness evaluation of the provided intelligent models an efficient external validation strategy was addressed which was proposed by tropsha et al tropsha et al 2003 basically this external validation approach regarding new criteria is based on the model s established prediction performance table 6 shows the validation criteria and related statistics for the proposed models when k and k p are between 0 85 and 1 15 and m and n are less than 0 1 the criteria are satisfied a higher value of correlation coefficient r is observed in the voting model r 0 976 for train and r 0 964 for test dataset the higher value of m and n coefficient is observed in the voting model m 0 075 and n 0 074 for the test dataset according to table 6 all the required criteria have been met for all four models in the training and testing dataset which shows that the models possess predictive goodness and a high correlation between target and output is not accidental fig 19 also shows the criteria to be evaluated for the train upper and test lower datasets considering fig 19 all models are within the allowable range for training and testing datasets 8 conclusion and future direction in this paper a new multi level ensemble machine framework based on the voting regression of three standalone ensemble models namely xgboost adaboost and rf was adopted to predict the cs s values of gravel particles in a cohesive mixture in the present study critical shear stress was computed using the measured flow depth and slope of the water surface as reported by ahmad et al 2018 to develop greater efficiency the best input variables were found on the basis of a correlation based feature selection so called forward stepwise method in this regard two superior combinations including and all variables the water content in the fraction in a cohesive mixture were examined for the prediction of τ cc τ cm values the predictive performance of the voting model was compared with the results of each of the standalone models the outcomes ascertained that the voting model by incorporating the advantage of every standalone ensemble model could enhance the accuracy of the prediction process in both input combinations for instance in the training phase of combo 1 as the superior case the voting model decreased about 26 16 and 15 of rmse values associated with rf adaboost and xgboost models respectively the holistic and diagnostic evaluation in combo 1 reveals that the voting generates superior accuracy in terms of r 0 9641 and kge 0 9353 in comparison to the standalone ensemble models followed by adaboost r 0 9496 and kge 0 9318 xgboost r 0 9482 and kge 0 9268 and rf r 0 9392 and kge 0 9241 respectively moreover comparing the purposed intelligent models and previous empirical based investigations reveals the superiority of all developed ensemble models in contrast kothyari and jain kothyari and jain 2008 model had the best performance among all empirical relationships for estimating τ cc τ cm of gravel particles in a cohesive sediment mixture the most influential variable in the predicting process was indicated with respect to mean decrease accuracy strategy in terms of mdg 28 2 and mda 0 43 eventually the external validation proved that all predictive approaches were confined in 0 85 k k p 1 15 and m n 0 1 according to the developed model s performance on training and test data the ability of good generalization is demonstrated and this proves that introducing new data to the models will give good results and high performance although the proposed methods for accurate estimation of τ cc τ cm values of gravel particles yielded good accuracy diverse aspects of ensemble ml strategy such as stacking bagging and boosting schemes as well as physical aspects of the problem i e study on the τ cc τ cm of the non cohesive sediments can be considered as future research credit authorship
