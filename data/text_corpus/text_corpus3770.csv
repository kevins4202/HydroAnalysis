18850,iron fe based chemically enhanced primary sedimentation ceps is an effective process used to remove organic and phosphorus p pollutants from wastewater into sludge in this study electro fermentation ef technology was developed to treat the organic and p rich fe sludge for the purposes of sludge reduction and resource recovery using a two chamber bioreactor with a cation exchange membrane and an exterior voltage 0 5 1 0 v for sludge treatment the ef system enabled product accumulation and separation during the fermentation process compared with the conventional fermentation in a single chamber reactor the ef treatment of fe sludge significantly improved the efficiency of p dissolution from the sludge from 8 to 56 after 4 d meanwhile about 70 of released ammonium ions and 50 of fe in the sludge were driven by the current from the sludge suspension into the cathode chamber for potential recovery with a similar yield of volatile fatty acids vfas but less ammonium remaining the codvfa nnh4 of the sludge supernatant from the ef reactor could reach 67 7 much higher than that from the single chamber fermenter at 13 0 the protease activity was effectively promoted by the ef treatment suggesting that both electrochemical and biological hydrolysis effects contributed to the increased p release from the sludge microbial community analysis showed that the electrical

novel technologies are needed to achieve sludge reduction and effective separation and recovery of valuable resources and products acidogenic fermentation of waste sludge especially the ceps sludge can be a cost effective method for p extraction and organic recovery it is achieved by producing volatile fatty acids vfas from waste organics and increasing the solubility of p precipitates under the anaerobic and acidic ph condition meulepas et al 2015 vfas from sludge fermentation are valuable organic carbon substrates that can be used for wastewater denitrification or bioplastic polyhydroxyalkanoates pha production lee et al 2014 xu et al 2018 however the high contents of ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 3 released into the fermented liquor limit the potential utilization of vfas in other words the nutrient elements must be removed firstly to reduce the nutrient load in the wastewater treatment or biosynthesis system tong and chen 2009 compared with the removal of phosphates via struvite precipitation removal of ammonium is more difficult to complete due to its excessive amount than phosphates zhang and chen 2009 recently microbial electrochemical cells mxcs including microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs have been applied to recover nh4 n from waste streams kelly and he 2014 kuntke et al 2012 villano et al 2013 attributed to current driven migration across the cation exchange membrane cem nh4 can be concentrated by an order of magnitude in the catholyte of mecs kelly and he 2014 villano et al 2013 electro fermentation ef is a novel process that relies on a small current density to trigger and enhance the fermentation process via the mediation of both extracellular and intracellular oxidation reduction potentials orp under an unbalanced condition moscoviz et al 2016 to prevent the product inhibition anion exchange membrane aem has been installed in ef reactors for electrical extraction of organic acids from the solution redwood et al 2012 however the cem based ef process has attracted little attention which would facilitate the separation of other positively charged compounds such as ammonium and metal ions in this study a synchronous sludge fermentation and nutrient separation was realized by the ef system in a two chamber cell separated with a cem the fe based ceps sludge fe sludge was fed into the anode chamber for vfas production and p release while the electric field drove nh4 n and fe cations into the cathode chamber for separation and potential recovery in the experimental work the ef performance in sludge fermentation and product separation was evaluated in comparison with the conventional single chamber fermenter to investigate the influence of current on the microbial activity during the ef process the microbial community and the activity of hydrolytic enzymes were also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge for experiments typical sewage was collected from stanley sewage treatment works in hong kong based on laboratory jar test results lin et al 2017a fecl3 was dosed at 20 mg fe l into the raw sewage for chemically enhanced primary sedimentation achieving more than 70 organic and 95 orthophosphate removals the sediment mixture reduced 25 times from the original sewage volume was obtained as the fe based ceps sludge fe sludge for the fermentation tests the characteristics of the wastewater and fe sludge are summarized in table 1 2 2 the electro fermentation setup and its cultivation the schematics of the electro fermentation reactors for sludge fermentation are shown in fig 1 the cylindrical reactor was a two compartment cell consisting of an anode and a cathode chamber both of which were 6 2 cm in length and 7 2 cm in internal diameter and separated by a cation exchange membrane ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international usa the liquid volume of each chamber was 250 ml and the cross section of the cem was 40 7 cm2 two graphite fiber brushes were used as the electrodes od 3 cm l 4 cm each had a short titanium wire as the connecting node for the external circuit for the mfc type reactor labeled as ef 1 without a power input the anode and cathode were connected via an external variable resistor which was operated mainly for comparison purpose for the two mec type reactors labeled as ef 2 and ef 3 a dc power source was supplied it6322 itech taiwan at 0 5 and 1 0 v respectively to enable more ion migrations the currents of the individual ef reactors were recorded in 5 min intervals using a data logger hobo 4 channel analog logger onset usa to start up an ef reactor the anode chamber was inoculated with the effluent from an acidogenic sludge fermenter that had been operated in the laboratory for more than 1 year the fe sludge with a volatile solids vs content of around 5 8 g l was filled into the anode chamber as the substrate to grow electrochemically active biofilms on the anode during the cultivation a half volume of the fermented sludge in the anode chamber was exchanged with fresh fe sludge every 4 days the cathode chamber was filled with a 100 mm nacl solution as the catholyte without phosphate buffer added no ph adjustment was made in the anolyte sludge suspensions and catholyte during the cultivation and fermentation used as a control reactor a serum bottle with a 250 ml working volume was fed with the same fe sludge and operated as a conventional single chamber fermentation reactor the sludge suspensions in all of the fermenters were continuously mixed with magnetic stirrers in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c after 4 months of cultivation effective electrochemically active biofilm was developed on the anodes in the ef reactors as shown by the decrease in internal resistance fig s1 ten ml of the mixed sludge suspension was left in each reactor as the inoculum for the subsequent batch fermentation test 2 3 batch electro fermentation experiments in the three closed circuit ef reactors ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 the anodic half cell potential was measured by placing an hg hg2cl2 reference electrode 1 cm away from the anode frame in the anode chamber the cathodic potential was calculated as the difference between the total cell voltage and anodic potential the single chamber fermentation reactor labeled as control was conducted to investigate the sludge fermentation performance in the suspension without a membrane and electrodes another control a two chamber reactor in open circuit no external circuit mode with the cem and electrode brushes was labeled as open c and operated in parallel to evaluate the chemical transport driven by diffusion across the membrane the external resister for ef 1 was maintained at 1 kω during the batch experiment after each feeding all of the reactors were sealed by silicone plug for acidogenic fermentation during a batch fermentation for 6 d 1 5 ml of the mixed suspension was sampled daily from each chamber of the reactors for chemical analysis as significant solid precipitation was found in three ef reactors after the batch fermentation the mixed catholyte was withdrawn and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the fe containing solids which were then dried by lyophilization and followed by quantification and analysis 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 chemical analysis the solution ph was measured using a ph meter starter 3100 ohaus usa the sludge mixtures sampled from the reactors were immediately centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solids and supernatant for analysis the total solids ts volatile solids vs soluble chemical oxygen demand scod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn orthophosphate p po4 3 p and total p tp were determined in accordance with the standard methods apha 2005 the total fe tfe concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer after pretreatment of the samples by hno3 h2o2 digestion for complete fe dissolution and organics oxidation ottosen et al 2016 vfa compounds including acetic acid hac propionic acid hpr n butyric acid n hbu iso butyric acid iso hbu n valeric acid n hva and iso valeric acid iso hva were quantified using a gas chromatograph 6890a agilent usa lin and li 2018 the experimental data were expressed as averages with standard deviations of the results from triplicate tests 2 4 2 hydrolytic enzymes and atp measurement enzymatic activity of the sludge mixture during fermentation was assessed focusing on α glucosidase protease and acid phosphatase activities in relation to the organic hydrolysis and p release performance dick 2011 as described by goel et al 1998 the assay of α glucosidase and protease activities was conducted using 0 1 p nitrophenyl α d glucopyranoside and 0 5 azocasein as the substrates respectively while the acid phosphatase was measured using 0 1 p nitrophenyl phosphate disodium as the substrate in an acetate acid buffer ph 4 8 the adenosine 5 triphosphate atp content of the sludge in the fermentation reactors was determined using a luminescent atp detection assay kit ab113849 abcam uk by quantifying the luminescence emitted from the reaction of luciferase with atp using a fluoroskan ascent fl thermo scientific usa dalzell and christofi 2002 2 4 3 characterization of the recovered fe product the dry

energy dispersive spectroscopy eds hitachi s4800 fef sem japan were used to study the morphology of the solid product and related elemental distribution 2 4 4 microbial community analysis after 4 months of cultivation and fermentation the mixed sludge samples from the four fermentation reactors control ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 were collected for total genomic dna extraction using a mo bio isolation kit mobio laboratories usa following the manufacturer s instructions primers 338f and 806r targeting the v3 v4 regions of bacteria 16s rdna genes were used for pcr amplification yuan et al 2015 the qualified pcr products were then used for sequencing on an illumia miseq platform in accordance with standard protocols bgi china the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with an average length of 462 bp by setting a 97 identity threshold in usearch software following the procedures previously described yuan et al 2015 the otu information was identified into phylum family and genus levels for taxonomic classification 2 5 characterization of the electrochemical properties for each ef cell the polarization curve captured by varying the external resistance 10 20 kω was measured before and after cultivation to confirm the biofilm establishment and the resulting biological and electrochemical activities as described by logan et al 2006 the polarization curve was plotted against the cell potential u and current i from the same experiment fischer et al 2011 the power density was calculated by p i u a normalized to the cem area a electrons harvested through the electrical circuit q expressed in coulombs c was determined by integrating the current over time i e i d t during the batch fermentation the amount of charge transported to the cathode q c ion expressed in terms of c with the specific cation through the cem was determined according to q c i o n m t m 0 v z f where m 0 and m t m are the initial and final molar concentrations of the cation concerned in the catholyte at the beginning and end of the batch experiment respectively v is the volume of the catholyte l z is the charge of the cation and f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol kuntke et al 2011 the charge transfer efficiency was calculated as the ratio of q c ion q 3 results and discussion 3 1 vfa variation and ef performance under the anaerobic condition the fe sludge with a high organic content underwent hydrolysis and acidogenesis naturally the vfa production and consumption during the fermentation process led first to the ph decrease and then to an increase in the reactors fig s2 a as shown in fig 2 a the change in vfa concentrations in the five batch reactors agreed well with the trend of ph variations vfas reached the highest concentration level on day 4 at 1745 mg cod l in the control reactor 1718 mg cod l in open c 1540 mg cod l in ef 1 1585 mg cod l in ef 2 and 1599 mg cod l in ef 3 following the reduction of vfas since day 4 the currents generated in the ef 1 and ef 2 reactors increased obviously from 1 38 to 3 41 a m2 to the highest level of 2 54 and 5 28 a m2 respectively fig 2 b the anode potentials eanode in the ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 reactors during fermentation remained at rather stable levels of around 209 1 176 0 and 238 0 mv versus the standard hydrogen electrode she respectively as the easiest substrate for anode respiring bacteria arb on the anode acetic acid has a theoretical potential e0 of 280 mv for its electron transfer in mineralization c h 3 c o o 2 h 2 o 8 e 2 c o 2 7 h kuntke et al 2011 the higher eanode found in the ef reactors suggested a partial current generation in the ef system might be contributed by the vfa usage via arb for electron transfer this may explain the slightly lower vfa contents in three ef reactors than other two controls especially during days 4 6 a similar phenomenon of vfas reduction with the current increase was also found by zhang et al 2013a in mec reactors it should be noted that although the voltage applied on the ef 2 reactor 0 5 v was lower than ef 3 1 0 v ef 2 exhibited a 1 0 a m2 higher current density in the later stage corresponding to a faster vfa utilization rate this comparison suggests that different voltages applied may affect the properties of the biofilms formed on the anodes as reported by torres et al 2009 a low anode potential was more effective than a high potential 150 vs 370 mv for improving the biofilm growth and current density 10 3 vs 0 6 a m2 as shown in table 2 hpr was the dominating vfa compound in all of the reactors accounting for 48 57 of the tvfas however compared with other reactors notably more hac and less hpr were observed in ef 3 probably due to the anode oxidation of hpr with a relatively higher potential applied feng et al 2015 found a similar phenomenon when they processed activated sludge in a single chamber mec at 0 3 v 3 2 release and separation of nh4 n as protein based organics are a major component of sludge their hydrolysis and acidogenesis released a significant amount of nh4 into the supernatant in the control reactor the nh4 n concentration increased to 140 6 mg n l in the sludge suspension after 5 days fig 3 a in the two chamber reactors dissolved nh4 ions mitigated from the sludge chamber to the cathode chamber compared with typical mxcs the current in ef system would mainly contribute to the migration of ions instead of energy generation as shown in fig 3 b for the open c reactor without current nh4 diffused into the cathode chamber owing to the concentration gradient haddadi et al 2013 leading to 12 mg n l in the catholyte in the closed circuit reactors the nh4 ions transported into the catholyte more rapidly as driven mainly by the current for charge neutrality kuntke et al 2012 the nh4 n concentration in catholyte increased to over 100 mg n l after day 5 and remained stable afterwards due to the different amounts of electrons harvested through the electrical circuit q i the charge transfer efficiency for nh4 transport within the first 5 days was 40 4 11 5 and 10 0 for ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively the rate of nh4 migration to the catholyte was expected to increase with the working voltage zhang et al 2013b but the nh4 n concentrations in the three ef reactors 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 v did not show an obvious difference it is apparent that the rate limiting factor for nh4 transport for the experimental conditions was the release of nh4 ions in the anode chamber corresponding to the nh4 transport into the cathode chamber the nh4 concentration in the sludge supernatant decreased to 40 mg n l or lower in the three ef reactors as a result the ratio of codvfa nnh4 in the sludge liquor increased from 13 0 in control to 49 4 in ef 1 and further to 67 7 in ef 3 with the significant increase in the codvfa nnh4 ratio and the corresponding decrease of the nitrogen loading the fermented sludge liquor could be well used to provide the organic carbon source for biological nitrogen removal in the mainstream wastewater treatment or for other beneficial uses meanwhile concentration of nh4 n in the catholyte enables its effective recovery by means such as air or steam stripping and membrane distillation zarebska et al 2014 in fact if the ef reactors were fed semi continuously with the fe sludge and the catholyte was less changed in the cathode chamber nh4 n would be further concentrated in the catholyte compared with the traditional electrodialysis process with a voltage of 10 v or higher applied ippersiel et al 2012 the ef treatment consumes much less energy for nh4 transport and separation in short using the two chamber ef reactors for sludge fermentation and product separation can result in an ammonium recovery rate of over 75 from the fermented sludge liquor with a low power consumption 3 3 dissolution and separation of fe and po4 3 p when fe iii is dosed into wastewater for ceps po4 3 can be effectively removed the fe p compounds in fe sludge are either fe p precipitates or iron oxides with po4 3 adsorbed wilfert et al 2015 under the anaerobic condition the acidophilic heterotrophic iron reducers can use the organic carbon as an electron donor to reduce fe iii to fe ii rapidly this results in the dissolution of fe p precipitates and iron hydroxides and hence the release of po4 3 p into the supernatant as depicted in fig 4 a about 8 3 mg l of po4 3 p was released from fe sludge into the supernatant in the control reactor on day 4 accompanied by 92 9 mg fe l dissolved in the sludge suspension fig 4 b in comparison the dissolution of po4 3 p increased greatly in the ef reactors especially in ef 2 and ef 3 with the exterior voltage applied the final po4 3 p concentrations were 45 4 64 7 and 72 3 mg l in ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively up to 67 6 of the p in the fe sludge was dissolved in ef 3 in the form of orthophosphates at the same time a considerable amount of dissolved fe migrated into the catholyte leading to a notable fe decrease in the sludge supernatant after migration into the cathode chamber fe precipitated immediately onto the electrode brush surface fig 5 a with less than 1 mg l of fe dissolved in the catholyte the sem eds and xrd analysis fig 5 b d confirmed that the mineral phase of the fe based precipitates was pure iron oxides by the end of fermentation the cathode chamber contained 113 4 189 6 and 207 6 mg l of tfe in ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively in the open c reactor without current only 14 3 mg l of tfe was found in the cathode chamber in other words about 50 of fe in sludge was effectively separated and recovered by the ef treatment as depicted in fig 6 two factors probably accounted for the much enhanced p release from the fe sludge in the ef reactors i the local acidic ph environment at the bio anode surface which weakened the fe po4 bonds in solid precipitates and hence facilitated the p dissolution thinnappan et al 2008 and ii the equilibrium displacement caused by the decrease of fe in the anode chamber owing to its transport into the catholyte during electro fermentation which promoted the continuous dissolution of the fe p complex viader et al 2015 this may explain the increased releases of p and fe with the voltage increase it is easy to extract the released p in the sludge supernatant after fermentation as shown in fig s3 a the dissolved p from the control reactor tended to precipitate with fe2 firstly instead of mg2 in forming vivianite when the solution ph approached to neutral lin et al 2017b which is however regarded as a poor p fertilizer wilfert et al 2015 but for the fermented supernatant from the ef 3 reactor the dissolved p could be readily recovered by precipitation with mg2 and nh4 at ph 10 to form struvite type p fertilizer fig s3 b in fact due to the enhancement of the p dissolution and the separation of nh4 n the fermented sludge supernatant had a nearly perfect n p ratio i e nn np 1 05 in ef 2 on day 5 for struvite formation zhang and chen 2009 and attributed to the effective extraction the adverse effect of soluble fe ions on the process of struvite crystallization was effectively mitigated yan and shih 2016 as summarized in fig 7 the conventional single chamber fermentation of fe sludge realized 27 9 of tcod and 7 8 of tp solubilization from the sludge after 4 d leading to the productions of 1744 mg cod l of vfas 8 3 mg l of po4 3 p 133 9 mg l of nh4 n and 92 9 mg l of fe in the sludge liquor the low p but high n and fe contents actually limited the feasibility of the organic vfa usage not to mention nutrient recovery on the contrary up to 57 5 of the tp and 29 2 of the tcod in the sludge was released into the supernatant in the ef 3 reactor 1 0 v meanwhile 40 2 of the tfe in the sludge and 75 of the released nh4 migrated into the cathode chamber that could be readily recovered 3 4 enzyme activity for sludge hydrolysis hydrolysis was governed by various extracellular enzymes nybroe et al 1992 for instance α glucosidase was expected to break the α 1 4 glucosidic linkage in maltose molecules and protease was expected to break the peptide bonds in proteins goel et al 1998 as carbohydrate and protein based organics are the major organic fractions in sludge the activities of α glucosidase and protease were measured during the sludge fermentation tests the acid phosphatase which hydrolyzed phosphate esters and released phosphate groups was also analyzed for its biological effect on p dissolution as shown in fig 8 a and b the control and ef reactors did not show a significant difference in the activities of α glucosidase and acid phosphatase during sludge fermentation for example the α glucosidase activities in all of the reactors decreased similarly from 0 42 to 0 46 eu l on day 0 to 0 28 0 31 eu l on day 6 however compared with the control and ef 1 reactors the α glucosidase activities in ef 2 and ef 3 dropped earlier on day 4 instead of day 6 suggesting a faster decrease of available carbohydrates except for the beginning the maximum activities of acid phosphatase in ef 2 and ef 3 were 0 72 eu l day 4 and 0 74 eu l day 2 respectively slightly higher than the control at 0 60 eu l day 4 indicating that the enzymatic p release was somewhat enhanced with the exterior charge applied protein based organics are more dominant than carbohydrates in ceps sludge ghyoot and verstraete 1997 and the ef treatment displayed its obvious effect on the protease activity during sludge fermentation as shown in fig 8 c the protease activity in control decreased rapidly from 0 31 eu l on day 0 0 09 eu l on day 4 in contrast the protease activities in the ef reactors exhibited a rising trend in the later stage of fermentation with the maximum activities at 0 62 eu l day 6 0 54 eu l day 6 and 0 39 eu l day 4 in ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively suggesting the enhanced hydrolysis of proteins in fact the tcod concentration in the sludge suspension after 6 day fermentation decreased more in the ef reactors by 22 than that in control by 8 implying enhanced sludge hydrolysis and degradation with the current applied zhao et al 2016 found that the protein degradation efficiency of activated sludge increased from 38 in the conventional digester to 60 in mec 0 6 v which was mainly contributed by the anodic oxidation with the presence of conductive electrodes and exoelectrogens direct interspecies electron transfer and enzyme activity would be enhanced to accelerate the substrate degradation rasmussen et al 2016 since proteins are part of the major p containing compounds in ceps sludge the much improved activity of protease in the ef reactors could also help to increase p dissolution as illustrated in fig 6 atp is the bioenergy source in metabolic reactions so it is frequently used to indicate the general activity of the microbial population chen et al 2013 after each new sludge feeding the atp concentrations in all of the reactors shot up from 0 02 to 0 04 μm initially to 0 13 0 22 μm within the first 2 4 d and then mostly decreased afterwards fig 8 d meanwhile the atp level in reactor ef 2 reached its second peak at 0 15 μm on day 6 perhaps due to the activation of arb in connection with the observed current increase during the period fig 2 b 3 5 microbial community analysis to investigate the microorganisms involved in the electro fermentation process the relative bacterial community abundances in the mixed sludge samples from the control c and three ef reactors were analyzed at the phylum level fig 9 a results show that firmicutes 28 9 46 6 bacteroidetes 13 8 34 2 and proteobacteria 11 6 22 2 with the organic fermenting capability dominated in four reactors with moderate variation echoing previous findings in anaerobic fermenters and anodic biofilms with various organic substrates torres et al 2009 jung and regan 2007 compared with the control reactor the relative abundance of gram positive firmicutes in the ef reactors increased from 28 9 to 40 4 46 6 while the gram negative bacteroidetes decreased to some extents namely the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes f b increased significantly from 0 84 in control to 1 45 2 92 in ef reactors suggesting that the electric current changed the profile of microbial community for fermentation on the other hand the dominant orders in firmicutes and bacteroidetes phyla clostridiales and bacteroidales are known propionate producing bacteria miceli et al 2016 which explains the highest percentage of hpr in the vfas composition for all reactors table 2 besides the acidobacteria phylum was detected only in ef reactors 0 9 1 5 that has been reported to withstand metal contaminated acidic and other extreme environments barns et al 2007 implying the exterior current stimulated their growth and enrichment zhang et al 2013a also found the accumulation of acidobacteria at the anode biofilm in mec reactor with fe addition further comparison down to the family level was conducted to reveal more information about the microbial community structure in total 115 families were found in all samples and the relative abundance of the first 18 ones is given in fig 9 b belonging to the firmicutes phylum the abundances of veillonellaceae erysipelotrichaceae and ruminococcaceae amounted to 25 39 in sum for all reactors particularly the increased abundance of firmicutes in ef reactors was mainly attributed to veillonellaceae which are obligate anaerobes and can convert lactate into propionate belenguer et al 2007 it should be noted that a new phylum fibrobacteres dominated only in the ef 1 reactor with a 25 5 relative abundance which was contributed by the fibrobacteraceae family with the cellulose degrading ability ransom jones et al 2012 this result demonstrated the formation of different microbial population structures in the mfc and mec type ef reactors besides the comamonadaceae family of β proteobacteria group was found more enriched in ef reactors 7 5 8 5 than control 5 2 in fact a predominance of β proteobacteria clones in the diverse anode community has been reported in mfc reactors fed with the starch processing wastewater or river water chae et al 2009 as one of the most important exoelectrogens in bioelectrochemical systems geobacter can use vfas to build a direct electron transfer connection with other species zhao et al 2016 in this study however the relative abundance of geobacter at the genus level was rather low 0 2 with the absolute tag numbers at 2 66 91 and 65 in the control ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 reactors respectively the considerably greater abundance of fermenting bacteria over exoelectrogens was probably caused by the ceps sludge as the substrates the particulate organics in the sludge had to be firstly fermented to vfas then to be utilized by arb moreover the fermenting bacteria usually have a higher growth yield than that of arb leading to the predominance of acidogenic biomass lee et al 2008 nevertheless the increased number of geobacter in the ef reactors compared to the control confirmed the successful cultivation of arb on the anodic biofilms especially for the ef 2 reactor with the highest current density furthermore as the mixed sludge was sampled from the suspension in chamber rather than the anode surface the actual abundance of geobacter might have been underestimated 4 conclusions fe coagulant addition for ceps appears to be low cost and effective means to remove cod and p from wastewater the settled sludge can be fermented to recover the organic carbon source in this study for the first time electro fermentation technology with a two chamber reactor separated by a cem was developed to treat fe based ceps sludge the process enabled effective recovery of organics po4 3 p nh4 n and fe resources from the sludge simultaneously during the fermentation process compared with conventional sludge fermentation in a single chamber reactor the ef system with an exterior voltage of 0 5 1 0 v applied significantly improved the p dissolution efficiency from 7 8 to 58 with a similar vfa yield at 276 mg cod g vs meanwhile the electrical field led to the transportation and separation of the released nh4 and fe cations into the cathode chamber for potential recovery the electrical stimulation apparently altered the microbial community for sludge fermentation with a significant increase in the abundance of firmicutes and the growth of acidobacteria in ef reactors the protease activity was also promoted by the ef treatment suggesting that both electrochemical and biological hydrolysis contributed to the increased p release from the sludge with its low energy consumption and recovery of valuable products treatment of the fe based ceps sludge

novel technologies are needed to achieve sludge reduction and effective separation and recovery of valuable resources and products acidogenic fermentation of waste sludge especially the ceps sludge can be a cost effective method for p extraction and organic recovery it is achieved by producing volatile fatty acids vfas from waste organics and increasing the solubility of p precipitates under the anaerobic and acidic ph condition meulepas et al 2015 vfas from sludge fermentation are valuable organic carbon substrates that can be used for wastewater denitrification or bioplastic polyhydroxyalkanoates pha production lee et al 2014 xu et al 2018 however the high contents of ammonium nh4 and phosphate po4 3 released into the fermented liquor limit the potential utilization of vfas in other words the nutrient elements must be removed firstly to reduce the nutrient load in the wastewater treatment or biosynthesis system tong and chen 2009 compared with the removal of phosphates via struvite precipitation removal of ammonium is more difficult to complete due to its excessive amount than phosphates zhang and chen 2009 recently microbial electrochemical cells mxcs including microbial fuel cells mfcs and microbial electrolysis cells mecs have been applied to recover nh4 n from waste streams kelly and he 2014 kuntke et al 2012 villano et al 2013 attributed to current driven migration across the cation exchange membrane cem nh4 can be concentrated by an order of magnitude in the catholyte of mecs kelly and he 2014 villano et al 2013 electro fermentation ef is a novel process that relies on a small current density to trigger and enhance the fermentation process via the mediation of both extracellular and intracellular oxidation reduction potentials orp under an unbalanced condition moscoviz et al 2016 to prevent the product inhibition anion exchange membrane aem has been installed in ef reactors for electrical extraction of organic acids from the solution redwood et al 2012 however the cem based ef process has attracted little attention which would facilitate the separation of other positively charged compounds such as ammonium and metal ions in this study a synchronous sludge fermentation and nutrient separation was realized by the ef system in a two chamber cell separated with a cem the fe based ceps sludge fe sludge was fed into the anode chamber for vfas production and p release while the electric field drove nh4 n and fe cations into the cathode chamber for separation and potential recovery in the experimental work the ef performance in sludge fermentation and product separation was evaluated in comparison with the conventional single chamber fermenter to investigate the influence of current on the microbial activity during the ef process the microbial community and the activity of hydrolytic enzymes were also analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge for experiments typical sewage was collected from stanley sewage treatment works in hong kong based on laboratory jar test results lin et al 2017a fecl3 was dosed at 20 mg fe l into the raw sewage for chemically enhanced primary sedimentation achieving more than 70 organic and 95 orthophosphate removals the sediment mixture reduced 25 times from the original sewage volume was obtained as the fe based ceps sludge fe sludge for the fermentation tests the characteristics of the wastewater and fe sludge are summarized in table 1 2 2 the electro fermentation setup and its cultivation the schematics of the electro fermentation reactors for sludge fermentation are shown in fig 1 the cylindrical reactor was a two compartment cell consisting of an anode and a cathode chamber both of which were 6 2 cm in length and 7 2 cm in internal diameter and separated by a cation exchange membrane ultrex cmi 7000 membranes international usa the liquid volume of each chamber was 250 ml and the cross section of the cem was 40 7 cm2 two graphite fiber brushes were used as the electrodes od 3 cm l 4 cm each had a short titanium wire as the connecting node for the external circuit for the mfc type reactor labeled as ef 1 without a power input the anode and cathode were connected via an external variable resistor which was operated mainly for comparison purpose for the two mec type reactors labeled as ef 2 and ef 3 a dc power source was supplied it6322 itech taiwan at 0 5 and 1 0 v respectively to enable more ion migrations the currents of the individual ef reactors were recorded in 5 min intervals using a data logger hobo 4 channel analog logger onset usa to start up an ef reactor the anode chamber was inoculated with the effluent from an acidogenic sludge fermenter that had been operated in the laboratory for more than 1 year the fe sludge with a volatile solids vs content of around 5 8 g l was filled into the anode chamber as the substrate to grow electrochemically active biofilms on the anode during the cultivation a half volume of the fermented sludge in the anode chamber was exchanged with fresh fe sludge every 4 days the cathode chamber was filled with a 100 mm nacl solution as the catholyte without phosphate buffer added no ph adjustment was made in the anolyte sludge suspensions and catholyte during the cultivation and fermentation used as a control reactor a serum bottle with a 250 ml working volume was fed with the same fe sludge and operated as a conventional single chamber fermentation reactor the sludge suspensions in all of the fermenters were continuously mixed with magnetic stirrers in a temperature controlled incubator at 37 1 c after 4 months of cultivation effective electrochemically active biofilm was developed on the anodes in the ef reactors as shown by the decrease in internal resistance fig s1 ten ml of the mixed sludge suspension was left in each reactor as the inoculum for the subsequent batch fermentation test 2 3 batch electro fermentation experiments in the three closed circuit ef reactors ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 the anodic half cell potential was measured by placing an hg hg2cl2 reference electrode 1 cm away from the anode frame in the anode chamber the cathodic potential was calculated as the difference between the total cell voltage and anodic potential the single chamber fermentation reactor labeled as control was conducted to investigate the sludge fermentation performance in the suspension without a membrane and electrodes another control a two chamber reactor in open circuit no external circuit mode with the cem and electrode brushes was labeled as open c and operated in parallel to evaluate the chemical transport driven by diffusion across the membrane the external resister for ef 1 was maintained at 1 kω during the batch experiment after each feeding all of the reactors were sealed by silicone plug for acidogenic fermentation during a batch fermentation for 6 d 1 5 ml of the mixed suspension was sampled daily from each chamber of the reactors for chemical analysis as significant solid precipitation was found in three ef reactors after the batch fermentation the mixed catholyte was withdrawn and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to obtain the fe containing solids which were then dried by lyophilization and followed by quantification and analysis 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 chemical analysis the solution ph was measured using a ph meter starter 3100 ohaus usa the sludge mixtures sampled from the reactors were immediately centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solids and supernatant for analysis the total solids ts volatile solids vs soluble chemical oxygen demand scod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n total nitrogen tn orthophosphate p po4 3 p and total p tp were determined in accordance with the standard methods apha 2005 the total fe tfe concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer after pretreatment of the samples by hno3 h2o2 digestion for complete fe dissolution and organics oxidation ottosen et al 2016 vfa compounds including acetic acid hac propionic acid hpr n butyric acid n hbu iso butyric acid iso hbu n valeric acid n hva and iso valeric acid iso hva were quantified using a gas chromatograph 6890a agilent usa lin and li 2018 the experimental data were expressed as averages with standard deviations of the results from triplicate tests 2 4 2 hydrolytic enzymes and atp measurement enzymatic activity of the sludge mixture during fermentation was assessed focusing on α glucosidase protease and acid phosphatase activities in relation to the organic hydrolysis and p release performance dick 2011 as described by goel et al 1998 the assay of α glucosidase and protease activities was conducted using 0 1 p nitrophenyl α d glucopyranoside and 0 5 azocasein as the substrates respectively while the acid phosphatase was measured using 0 1 p nitrophenyl phosphate disodium as the substrate in an acetate acid buffer ph 4 8 the adenosine 5 triphosphate atp content of the sludge in the fermentation reactors was determined using a luminescent atp detection assay kit ab113849 abcam uk by quantifying the luminescence emitted from the reaction of luciferase with atp using a fluoroskan ascent fl thermo scientific usa dalzell and christofi 2002 2 4 3 characterization of the recovered fe product the dry

energy dispersive spectroscopy eds hitachi s4800 fef sem japan were used to study the morphology of the solid product and related elemental distribution 2 4 4 microbial community analysis after 4 months of cultivation and fermentation the mixed sludge samples from the four fermentation reactors control ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 were collected for total genomic dna extraction using a mo bio isolation kit mobio laboratories usa following the manufacturer s instructions primers 338f and 806r targeting the v3 v4 regions of bacteria 16s rdna genes were used for pcr amplification yuan et al 2015 the qualified pcr products were then used for sequencing on an illumia miseq platform in accordance with standard protocols bgi china the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus with an average length of 462 bp by setting a 97 identity threshold in usearch software following the procedures previously described yuan et al 2015 the otu information was identified into phylum family and genus levels for taxonomic classification 2 5 characterization of the electrochemical properties for each ef cell the polarization curve captured by varying the external resistance 10 20 kω was measured before and after cultivation to confirm the biofilm establishment and the resulting biological and electrochemical activities as described by logan et al 2006 the polarization curve was plotted against the cell potential u and current i from the same experiment fischer et al 2011 the power density was calculated by p i u a normalized to the cem area a electrons harvested through the electrical circuit q expressed in coulombs c was determined by integrating the current over time i e i d t during the batch fermentation the amount of charge transported to the cathode q c ion expressed in terms of c with the specific cation through the cem was determined according to q c i o n m t m 0 v z f where m 0 and m t m are the initial and final molar concentrations of the cation concerned in the catholyte at the beginning and end of the batch experiment respectively v is the volume of the catholyte l z is the charge of the cation and f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol kuntke et al 2011 the charge transfer efficiency was calculated as the ratio of q c ion q 3 results and discussion 3 1 vfa variation and ef performance under the anaerobic condition the fe sludge with a high organic content underwent hydrolysis and acidogenesis naturally the vfa production and consumption during the fermentation process led first to the ph decrease and then to an increase in the reactors fig s2 a as shown in fig 2 a the change in vfa concentrations in the five batch reactors agreed well with the trend of ph variations vfas reached the highest concentration level on day 4 at 1745 mg cod l in the control reactor 1718 mg cod l in open c 1540 mg cod l in ef 1 1585 mg cod l in ef 2 and 1599 mg cod l in ef 3 following the reduction of vfas since day 4 the currents generated in the ef 1 and ef 2 reactors increased obviously from 1 38 to 3 41 a m2 to the highest level of 2 54 and 5 28 a m2 respectively fig 2 b the anode potentials eanode in the ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 reactors during fermentation remained at rather stable levels of around 209 1 176 0 and 238 0 mv versus the standard hydrogen electrode she respectively as the easiest substrate for anode respiring bacteria arb on the anode acetic acid has a theoretical potential e0 of 280 mv for its electron transfer in mineralization c h 3 c o o 2 h 2 o 8 e 2 c o 2 7 h kuntke et al 2011 the higher eanode found in the ef reactors suggested a partial current generation in the ef system might be contributed by the vfa usage via arb for electron transfer this may explain the slightly lower vfa contents in three ef reactors than other two controls especially during days 4 6 a similar phenomenon of vfas reduction with the current increase was also found by zhang et al 2013a in mec reactors it should be noted that although the voltage applied on the ef 2 reactor 0 5 v was lower than ef 3 1 0 v ef 2 exhibited a 1 0 a m2 higher current density in the later stage corresponding to a faster vfa utilization rate this comparison suggests that different voltages applied may affect the properties of the biofilms formed on the anodes as reported by torres et al 2009 a low anode potential was more effective than a high potential 150 vs 370 mv for improving the biofilm growth and current density 10 3 vs 0 6 a m2 as shown in table 2 hpr was the dominating vfa compound in all of the reactors accounting for 48 57 of the tvfas however compared with other reactors notably more hac and less hpr were observed in ef 3 probably due to the anode oxidation of hpr with a relatively higher potential applied feng et al 2015 found a similar phenomenon when they processed activated sludge in a single chamber mec at 0 3 v 3 2 release and separation of nh4 n as protein based organics are a major component of sludge their hydrolysis and acidogenesis released a significant amount of nh4 into the supernatant in the control reactor the nh4 n concentration increased to 140 6 mg n l in the sludge suspension after 5 days fig 3 a in the two chamber reactors dissolved nh4 ions mitigated from the sludge chamber to the cathode chamber compared with typical mxcs the current in ef system would mainly contribute to the migration of ions instead of energy generation as shown in fig 3 b for the open c reactor without current nh4 diffused into the cathode chamber owing to the concentration gradient haddadi et al 2013 leading to 12 mg n l in the catholyte in the closed circuit reactors the nh4 ions transported into the catholyte more rapidly as driven mainly by the current for charge neutrality kuntke et al 2012 the nh4 n concentration in catholyte increased to over 100 mg n l after day 5 and remained stable afterwards due to the different amounts of electrons harvested through the electrical circuit q i the charge transfer efficiency for nh4 transport within the first 5 days was 40 4 11 5 and 10 0 for ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively the rate of nh4 migration to the catholyte was expected to increase with the working voltage zhang et al 2013b but the nh4 n concentrations in the three ef reactors 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 v did not show an obvious difference it is apparent that the rate limiting factor for nh4 transport for the experimental conditions was the release of nh4 ions in the anode chamber corresponding to the nh4 transport into the cathode chamber the nh4 concentration in the sludge supernatant decreased to 40 mg n l or lower in the three ef reactors as a result the ratio of codvfa nnh4 in the sludge liquor increased from 13 0 in control to 49 4 in ef 1 and further to 67 7 in ef 3 with the significant increase in the codvfa nnh4 ratio and the corresponding decrease of the nitrogen loading the fermented sludge liquor could be well used to provide the organic carbon source for biological nitrogen removal in the mainstream wastewater treatment or for other beneficial uses meanwhile concentration of nh4 n in the catholyte enables its effective recovery by means such as air or steam stripping and membrane distillation zarebska et al 2014 in fact if the ef reactors were fed semi continuously with the fe sludge and the catholyte was less changed in the cathode chamber nh4 n would be further concentrated in the catholyte compared with the traditional electrodialysis process with a voltage of 10 v or higher applied ippersiel et al 2012 the ef treatment consumes much less energy for nh4 transport and separation in short using the two chamber ef reactors for sludge fermentation and product separation can result in an ammonium recovery rate of over 75 from the fermented sludge liquor with a low power consumption 3 3 dissolution and separation of fe and po4 3 p when fe iii is dosed into wastewater for ceps po4 3 can be effectively removed the fe p compounds in fe sludge are either fe p precipitates or iron oxides with po4 3 adsorbed wilfert et al 2015 under the anaerobic condition the acidophilic heterotrophic iron reducers can use the organic carbon as an electron donor to reduce fe iii to fe ii rapidly this results in the dissolution of fe p precipitates and iron hydroxides and hence the release of po4 3 p into the supernatant as depicted in fig 4 a about 8 3 mg l of po4 3 p was released from fe sludge into the supernatant in the control reactor on day 4 accompanied by 92 9 mg fe l dissolved in the sludge suspension fig 4 b in comparison the dissolution of po4 3 p increased greatly in the ef reactors especially in ef 2 and ef 3 with the exterior voltage applied the final po4 3 p concentrations were 45 4 64 7 and 72 3 mg l in ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively up to 67 6 of the p in the fe sludge was dissolved in ef 3 in the form of orthophosphates at the same time a considerable amount of dissolved fe migrated into the catholyte leading to a notable fe decrease in the sludge supernatant after migration into the cathode chamber fe precipitated immediately onto the electrode brush surface fig 5 a with less than 1 mg l of fe dissolved in the catholyte the sem eds and xrd analysis fig 5 b d confirmed that the mineral phase of the fe based precipitates was pure iron oxides by the end of fermentation the cathode chamber contained 113 4 189 6 and 207 6 mg l of tfe in ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively in the open c reactor without current only 14 3 mg l of tfe was found in the cathode chamber in other words about 50 of fe in sludge was effectively separated and recovered by the ef treatment as depicted in fig 6 two factors probably accounted for the much enhanced p release from the fe sludge in the ef reactors i the local acidic ph environment at the bio anode surface which weakened the fe po4 bonds in solid precipitates and hence facilitated the p dissolution thinnappan et al 2008 and ii the equilibrium displacement caused by the decrease of fe in the anode chamber owing to its transport into the catholyte during electro fermentation which promoted the continuous dissolution of the fe p complex viader et al 2015 this may explain the increased releases of p and fe with the voltage increase it is easy to extract the released p in the sludge supernatant after fermentation as shown in fig s3 a the dissolved p from the control reactor tended to precipitate with fe2 firstly instead of mg2 in forming vivianite when the solution ph approached to neutral lin et al 2017b which is however regarded as a poor p fertilizer wilfert et al 2015 but for the fermented supernatant from the ef 3 reactor the dissolved p could be readily recovered by precipitation with mg2 and nh4 at ph 10 to form struvite type p fertilizer fig s3 b in fact due to the enhancement of the p dissolution and the separation of nh4 n the fermented sludge supernatant had a nearly perfect n p ratio i e nn np 1 05 in ef 2 on day 5 for struvite formation zhang and chen 2009 and attributed to the effective extraction the adverse effect of soluble fe ions on the process of struvite crystallization was effectively mitigated yan and shih 2016 as summarized in fig 7 the conventional single chamber fermentation of fe sludge realized 27 9 of tcod and 7 8 of tp solubilization from the sludge after 4 d leading to the productions of 1744 mg cod l of vfas 8 3 mg l of po4 3 p 133 9 mg l of nh4 n and 92 9 mg l of fe in the sludge liquor the low p but high n and fe contents actually limited the feasibility of the organic vfa usage not to mention nutrient recovery on the contrary up to 57 5 of the tp and 29 2 of the tcod in the sludge was released into the supernatant in the ef 3 reactor 1 0 v meanwhile 40 2 of the tfe in the sludge and 75 of the released nh4 migrated into the cathode chamber that could be readily recovered 3 4 enzyme activity for sludge hydrolysis hydrolysis was governed by various extracellular enzymes nybroe et al 1992 for instance α glucosidase was expected to break the α 1 4 glucosidic linkage in maltose molecules and protease was expected to break the peptide bonds in proteins goel et al 1998 as carbohydrate and protein based organics are the major organic fractions in sludge the activities of α glucosidase and protease were measured during the sludge fermentation tests the acid phosphatase which hydrolyzed phosphate esters and released phosphate groups was also analyzed for its biological effect on p dissolution as shown in fig 8 a and b the control and ef reactors did not show a significant difference in the activities of α glucosidase and acid phosphatase during sludge fermentation for example the α glucosidase activities in all of the reactors decreased similarly from 0 42 to 0 46 eu l on day 0 to 0 28 0 31 eu l on day 6 however compared with the control and ef 1 reactors the α glucosidase activities in ef 2 and ef 3 dropped earlier on day 4 instead of day 6 suggesting a faster decrease of available carbohydrates except for the beginning the maximum activities of acid phosphatase in ef 2 and ef 3 were 0 72 eu l day 4 and 0 74 eu l day 2 respectively slightly higher than the control at 0 60 eu l day 4 indicating that the enzymatic p release was somewhat enhanced with the exterior charge applied protein based organics are more dominant than carbohydrates in ceps sludge ghyoot and verstraete 1997 and the ef treatment displayed its obvious effect on the protease activity during sludge fermentation as shown in fig 8 c the protease activity in control decreased rapidly from 0 31 eu l on day 0 0 09 eu l on day 4 in contrast the protease activities in the ef reactors exhibited a rising trend in the later stage of fermentation with the maximum activities at 0 62 eu l day 6 0 54 eu l day 6 and 0 39 eu l day 4 in ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 respectively suggesting the enhanced hydrolysis of proteins in fact the tcod concentration in the sludge suspension after 6 day fermentation decreased more in the ef reactors by 22 than that in control by 8 implying enhanced sludge hydrolysis and degradation with the current applied zhao et al 2016 found that the protein degradation efficiency of activated sludge increased from 38 in the conventional digester to 60 in mec 0 6 v which was mainly contributed by the anodic oxidation with the presence of conductive electrodes and exoelectrogens direct interspecies electron transfer and enzyme activity would be enhanced to accelerate the substrate degradation rasmussen et al 2016 since proteins are part of the major p containing compounds in ceps sludge the much improved activity of protease in the ef reactors could also help to increase p dissolution as illustrated in fig 6 atp is the bioenergy source in metabolic reactions so it is frequently used to indicate the general activity of the microbial population chen et al 2013 after each new sludge feeding the atp concentrations in all of the reactors shot up from 0 02 to 0 04 μm initially to 0 13 0 22 μm within the first 2 4 d and then mostly decreased afterwards fig 8 d meanwhile the atp level in reactor ef 2 reached its second peak at 0 15 μm on day 6 perhaps due to the activation of arb in connection with the observed current increase during the period fig 2 b 3 5 microbial community analysis to investigate the microorganisms involved in the electro fermentation process the relative bacterial community abundances in the mixed sludge samples from the control c and three ef reactors were analyzed at the phylum level fig 9 a results show that firmicutes 28 9 46 6 bacteroidetes 13 8 34 2 and proteobacteria 11 6 22 2 with the organic fermenting capability dominated in four reactors with moderate variation echoing previous findings in anaerobic fermenters and anodic biofilms with various organic substrates torres et al 2009 jung and regan 2007 compared with the control reactor the relative abundance of gram positive firmicutes in the ef reactors increased from 28 9 to 40 4 46 6 while the gram negative bacteroidetes decreased to some extents namely the ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes f b increased significantly from 0 84 in control to 1 45 2 92 in ef reactors suggesting that the electric current changed the profile of microbial community for fermentation on the other hand the dominant orders in firmicutes and bacteroidetes phyla clostridiales and bacteroidales are known propionate producing bacteria miceli et al 2016 which explains the highest percentage of hpr in the vfas composition for all reactors table 2 besides the acidobacteria phylum was detected only in ef reactors 0 9 1 5 that has been reported to withstand metal contaminated acidic and other extreme environments barns et al 2007 implying the exterior current stimulated their growth and enrichment zhang et al 2013a also found the accumulation of acidobacteria at the anode biofilm in mec reactor with fe addition further comparison down to the family level was conducted to reveal more information about the microbial community structure in total 115 families were found in all samples and the relative abundance of the first 18 ones is given in fig 9 b belonging to the firmicutes phylum the abundances of veillonellaceae erysipelotrichaceae and ruminococcaceae amounted to 25 39 in sum for all reactors particularly the increased abundance of firmicutes in ef reactors was mainly attributed to veillonellaceae which are obligate anaerobes and can convert lactate into propionate belenguer et al 2007 it should be noted that a new phylum fibrobacteres dominated only in the ef 1 reactor with a 25 5 relative abundance which was contributed by the fibrobacteraceae family with the cellulose degrading ability ransom jones et al 2012 this result demonstrated the formation of different microbial population structures in the mfc and mec type ef reactors besides the comamonadaceae family of β proteobacteria group was found more enriched in ef reactors 7 5 8 5 than control 5 2 in fact a predominance of β proteobacteria clones in the diverse anode community has been reported in mfc reactors fed with the starch processing wastewater or river water chae et al 2009 as one of the most important exoelectrogens in bioelectrochemical systems geobacter can use vfas to build a direct electron transfer connection with other species zhao et al 2016 in this study however the relative abundance of geobacter at the genus level was rather low 0 2 with the absolute tag numbers at 2 66 91 and 65 in the control ef 1 ef 2 and ef 3 reactors respectively the considerably greater abundance of fermenting bacteria over exoelectrogens was probably caused by the ceps sludge as the substrates the particulate organics in the sludge had to be firstly fermented to vfas then to be utilized by arb moreover the fermenting bacteria usually have a higher growth yield than that of arb leading to the predominance of acidogenic biomass lee et al 2008 nevertheless the increased number of geobacter in the ef reactors compared to the control confirmed the successful cultivation of arb on the anodic biofilms especially for the ef 2 reactor with the highest current density furthermore as the mixed sludge was sampled from the suspension in chamber rather than the anode surface the actual abundance of geobacter might have been underestimated 4 conclusions fe coagulant addition for ceps appears to be low cost and effective means to remove cod and p from wastewater the settled sludge can be fermented to recover the organic carbon source in this study for the first time electro fermentation technology with a two chamber reactor separated by a cem was developed to treat fe based ceps sludge the process enabled effective recovery of organics po4 3 p nh4 n and fe resources from the sludge simultaneously during the fermentation process compared with conventional sludge fermentation in a single chamber reactor the ef system with an exterior voltage of 0 5 1 0 v applied significantly improved the p dissolution efficiency from 7 8 to 58 with a similar vfa yield at 276 mg cod g vs meanwhile the electrical field led to the transportation and separation of the released nh4 and fe cations into the cathode chamber for potential recovery the electrical stimulation apparently altered the microbial community for sludge fermentation with a significant increase in the abundance of firmicutes and the growth of acidobacteria in ef reactors the protease activity was also promoted by the ef treatment suggesting that both electrochemical and biological hydrolysis contributed to the increased p release from the sludge with its low energy consumption and recovery of valuable products treatment of the fe based ceps sludge

18851,a method for operating membrane capacitive deionization mcdi systems without electrode reactions at a high cell potential was studied the charge supplied to the cell was controlled to suppress faradaic reactions the maximum allowable charge mac that can be supplied to a carbon electrode without electrode reactions was measured to be 58 c g adsorption experiments were conducted while supplying a charge of 55 c g 95 of the mac value in constant current cc and constant voltage cv mode the cell potential increased to 1 42 v in cc 1 43 4 29 ma cm2 mode but the concentration and ph of the effluent were kept constant in addition the effluent ph was stable in cv 1 25 2 0 v mode the salt adsorption capacities and charge efficiencies were approximately 15 5 mg g and 92 respectively regardless of the current densities and cell potentials applied to the cell with increasing cell potential the concentration polarization in the feed stream was intensified resulting in an increase in cell resistance it was thought that electrode reactions did not occur at a high cell potential because of the high voltage drop due to the cell resistance the higher the cell potential or current density is the faster the desalination rate in mcdi operation it is expected that this operation method applying the mac concept will contribute to the stable operation of mcdi systems and an improvement in desalination performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane capacitive deionization maximum allowable charge electrode reaction cell potential electrode potential voltage drop

in particular stable operation of the cdi system without electrode reactions is an important and urgent challenge in expanding the commercial use of the cdi process omosebi et al 2014 tang et al 2017 however research on operation technology is still insufficient in cdi operation ions are removed by non faradaic charges supplied to the carbon electrodes thus it is advantageous to apply a high cell potential to increase the adsorption amount when the cell potential reaches a certain level however faradaic reactions occur bard and faulkner 2001 electrode reactions during cdi operation cause serious problems such as a deterioration of desalination performance as well as energy loss cohen et al 2013 he et al 2016 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the main electrode reactions in cdi cells are carbon oxidation water oxidation and the reduction of dissolved oxygen zhang et al 2018 in particular the carbon oxidation reaction shortens the lifetime of carbon electrodes and consequently reduces desalination performance omosebi et al 2014 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 additionally the reaction products can contaminate the treated water in case of feed water containing hardness components such as ca2 and mg2 ions scale can be formed on the carbon electrode due to the reaction products choi 2014 therefore the suppression of electrode reactions during cdi operation is very important for the long term stable operation of the cdi system generally the adsorption amount and adsorption rate during cdi operation are controlled by the cell potential lu et al 2017 zhao et al 2013a when the cell potential is increased the adsorption amount and the rate can be increased but electrode reactions may occur typically cdi systems are operated at a cell potential of 1 0 1 4 v to prevent electrode reactions suss et al 2015 however electrode reactions are governed by the electrode potential not by the cell potential the mcdi cell which is mainly applied to the actual desalination process has a structure of carbon electrode anion exchange membrane aem spacer cation exchange membrane cem carbon electrode when applying an electric potential to the mcdi cell the electrode potential increases as charge is accumulated in the carbon electrode at the same time voltage drops occur as the ions move through resistance elements such as iems and the feed stream dykstra et al 2016 the voltage drop is proportional to the current and the cell resistance the electrode potential of the mcdi system which has different cell resistances can be different even at the same cell potential this indicates that the cell potential is not a suitable operating parameter to suppress electrode reactions since electrode reactions are governed by the electrode potential it is necessary to operate the mcdi system based on the electrode potential instead of the cell potential the electrode potential increases proportional to the charge accumulated on the carbon electrode and electrode reactions begin when an overpotential is reached bard and faulkner 2001 in a previous study we introduced the concept of maximum allowable charge mac as a new metric for expressing the adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes yoon and choi 2019 separately the mac concept can be used as an important means to suppress electrode reactions in mcdi operation if the charge supplied to the cell does not exceed the mac value electrode reactions can be suppressed regardless of the cell potential in this study we investigated a stable operation method for mcdi systems without electrode reactions at a high cell potential using the mac concept the mac value of the carbon electrode was measured the adsorption experiments were carried out while supplying a charge of 95 of the mac value to the mcdi cell at various current densities 1 43 4 29 ma cm2 and cell potentials 1 25 2 0 v the stability of the mcdi system for electrode reactions was evaluated by measuring the current voltage energy consumption effluent concentration and ph change in addition the changes in electrode potential and the voltage drops due to cell resistance during the adsorption process were analyzed 2 experimental 2 1 construction of the mcdi unit cell and desalination experimental setup carbon electrodes to be used for the mcdi unit cell were prepared using activated carbon powder cep 21 k pct co korea carbon powder sbr emulsion eq lib sbr mti co usa and water to adjust the viscosity of the slurry were mixed the mixture was stirred using a planetary centrifugal mixer ar 100 thinky co japan for 30 min to prepare a homogeneous electrode slurry then the electrode slurry was cast on a graphite foil f02511 dongbang carbon co korea as a current collector and dried in a drying oven at 50 c for 3 h the sbr content in the prepared carbon electrode was 10 wt and the thickness of the carbon layer was approximately 160 μm carbon electrodes the cem neosepta cmx astom co japan and the aem neosepta amx were cut into a circular shape with a diameter of 9 5 cm a hole with a diameter of 1 cm was formed in the center of the iems and the carbon electrodes the effective area of the carbon electrodes used in the mcdi cell was 70 cm2 and the mass was 0 65 g 0 002 an amx membrane was attached to the surface of the anode carbon electrode and a cmx membrane was attached to the cathode carbon electrode a 180 μm thick spacer ex31 071 80 pw nbc meshtec inc japan was inserted between the aem and cem influent was supplied to the edge of the carbon electrodes passed through the spacer and flowed out through the central hole all mcdi experiments were carried out in single pass mode in which the effluent passed through the cell was discarded a nacl solution with a concentration of 1000 mg l was supplied to the cell at a flow rate of 30 ml min in addition power was supplied through a potentiostat wpg100 wona tech co korea during the desalination experiments the current voltage cumulative charge and energy consumption were measured at 2 s intervals using the potentiostat operating software the conductivity and ph sensors con bta ph bta vernier software technology usa were installed at the point where the effluent was drained from the cell conductivity and ph were measured at 2 s intervals using a computer connected interface labquest vernier software technology usa the nacl concentration was calculated using the correlation between the conductivity and the nacl concentration porada et al 2013 yoon and choi 2019 2 2 measurement of the mac value of the carbon electrode with supplying electric charge to a carbon electrode the electrode potential rises electrode reactions start when the electrode potential reaches the overpotential in a previous study we defined mac as the charge supplied to a carbon electrode at the overpotential yoon and choi 2019 to measure the mac value of the carbon electrode used in the mcdi experiments adsorption experiments were conducted while supplying a constant current to accurately analyze the desalination characteristics of mcdi cells the adsorption desorption process must reach dynamic steady state dss porada et al 2013 electrode reactions at the carbon electrodes can affect the adsorption characteristics in consideration of this first an adsorption desorption experiment was performed at a cell potential at which no electrode reactions occurred the adsorption proceeded at a current density of 1 43 ma cm2 until the cell potential reached 1 0 v followed by a desorption process for 400 s at a cell potential of 0 v the adsorption desorption process was repeated three times to reach dss then charges were supplied to the cell at the same current density 1 43 ma cm2 until the cell potential reached 1 6 v to determine the mac value desorption was performed again at 0 0 v for 400 s to confirm the reproducibility of the experimental results an mcdi cell was constructed with new carbon electrodes the same experiments were repeated three times under the same experimental conditions 2 3 desalination experiments using mcdi unit cells at high cell potentials the mac indicates the maximum charge that can be applied to a carbon electrode without electrode reactions occurring it is expected that the mcdi system can be operated without electrode reactions even at high cell potentials if the total charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption process does not exceed the mac value the mac value of the carbon electrode was measured to be approximately 58 c g mcdi experiments were carried out while supplying a charge of 55 c g which is 95 of the mac value the mass of the carbon electrode was 0 65 g so the actual charge supplied was 36 c adsorption experiments were carried out in constant current cc and constant voltage cv modes to evaluate the desalination performance according to the power supply method used in cc mode mcdi experiments were carried out at current densities of 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 the adsorption experiments in cv mode were performed at cell potentials of 1 25 1 50 1 75 and 2 00 v regardless of the current density and cell potential the total charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption process was fixed at 55 c g after adsorption was completed the cell potential was changed to 0 0 v and desorption was performed for 300 s the analysis of desalination performances is based on an adsorption desorption cycle that has reached dss we have confirmed that dss was reached after the second cycle desalination data according to the number of cycle was provided in supporting information adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 3 times at each operation condition to verify the reproducibility of the experimental results mcdi cells were fabricated with new carbon electrodes and the same experiment was repeated three times under the same conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the mac value of the carbon electrode to determine the mac value of the carbon electrode a constant current 1 43 ma cm2 was supplied to the mcdi unit cell until the cell potential reached 1 6 v fig 1 shows the change in effluent concentration during the adsorption process the cumulative charge was used as the x axis variable instead of the adsorption time the cumulative charge was calculated by dividing the charge supplied to the cell at each adsorption time by the mass of the carbon electrode in mcdi operation the adsorption rate is proportional to the current supplied to the cell when a constant current is supplied the effluent concentration is kept constant the effluent concentration was constant at 884 mg l until the cumulative charge reached approximately 58 c g however it can be seen that the concentration of the effluent started to increase gradually when the cumulative charge exceeded 58 c g furthermore the effluent concentration increased at a faster rate at a cumulative charge of approximately 80 c g or more the change in effluent concentration can be interpreted as a result of electrode reactions at the carbon electrodes although not shown in this paper we observed a decrease in ph when the effluent concentration began to change when electrode reactions occur in an mcdi cell h ions are generated by the oxidation reaction of carbon and water at the anode and accumulate on the surface of the carbon electrode as the concentration of h ions increases the h ions migrate to the feed stream past through the aem resulting in a decrease in effluent ph choi 2014 tang et al 2017 the permeation of h ions leads to a decrease in the permselectivity of the amx membrane and consequently increases the concentration of the effluent when electrode reactions occur in an mcdi cell the charge efficiency decreases because the amount of adsorption is reduced to accurately determine the point where the electrode reactions start the instantaneous charge efficiency ice λ q t at a cumulative charge of q t was calculated using eq 1 the ice change according to the cumulative charge is shown in fig 1 1 λ q t f δ v c o c q t 2 c q t 2 q t q t 2 100 where f is the faraday constant 96 500 c mol δv is the volume of the feed water supplied to the cell for 2 s l q t is the cumulative charge at time t s and c o and c q t are the concentration of the feed water and concentration of the effluent at a cumulative charge of q t mol l respectively the adsorption experiment was carried out at a current density of 1 43 ma cm2 0 1 a q t q t 2 was always 0 2 c three characteristic regions can be seen in the ice curve after the start of adsorption ice remained constant at approximately 95 until a charge of 58 c g was delivered as the charge increased ice began to decrease gradually in addition ice dropped rapidly after approximately 80 c g the decrease in ice is attributed to the result of electrode reactions the mac value was determined at the point where the ice starts to decrease as illustrated in fig 2 and was approximately 58 c g 3 2 operational stability of mcdi cells in constant current mode the adsorption experiments were carried out until a charge of 55 c g was supplied in cc mode the cell potential was then switched to 0 0 v and desorption was performed for 300 s the adsorption experiments were carried out at various current densities 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 to evaluate the effect of current density on the desalination performance fig 2 a shows the effluent concentration and ph change at each current density at current densities of 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 the effluent concentrations were 884 759 and 652 mg l respectively unlike in fig 1 the effluent concentration remained constant throughout the adsorption period fig 2 b shows the ph change in the effluent during the adsorption desorption process the initial ph of the feed water was approximately 6 2 regardless of the current density the effluent ph showed a slight change in the range of 6 1 6 4 the slight increase in effluent ph during the adsorption process is attributed to the different removal rates of oh and h ions not by electrode reactions the ionic mobility of h ion 3 63 10 3 cm2 s v is approximately 1 8 times higher than that of oh ion 2 05 10 3 cm2 s v bard and faulkner 2001 it is thought that the removal rate of h ions is higher than that of oh ions during the adsorption process resulting in an increase in effluent ph through the changes in the concentration and ph of the effluent it was confirmed that electrode reactions did not occur regardless of the current density when 55 c g of charge was supplied to the cell fig 3 shows the cell potential change according to the cumulative charge supplied at current densities of 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 the initial cell voltages were 0 18 0 37 and 0 55 v respectively and increased in proportion to the current density supplied the initial cell voltage was caused by the electrical resistances of the iems and feed stream inside the cell the concentration of the feed stream at the beginning of adsorption was equal to the influent concentration 1000 mg l from the relationship between current and voltage it can be seen that the electrical resistance of the initial mcdi cell was 1 84 ω on the other hand the cell potential rose nonlinearly until approximately 20 c g of charge was supplied to the cell thereafter the cell potential increased in proportion to the cumulative charge regardless of the current density at current densities of 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 the final cell potentials when 55 c g of charge was supplied were 1 06 1 24 and 1 42 v respectively when a current is supplied to an mcdi cell electric charges q are accumulated on the carbon electrodes and the electrode potential rises the electrode potential φ e l e of a carbon electrode with a specific capacitance of c e l e is q c e l e additionally voltage drops occur when ions pass through the resistance elements iems and feed stream inside the cell the total voltage drop φ i r in the mcdi cell consists of the voltage drops due to the electrical resistances of the cem φ i r c e m aem φ i r a e m and feed stream φ i r s o l the cell potential φ c e l l of the mcdi system is composed of the electrode potentials of the anode and cathode carbon electrode and the voltage drop due to the resistance elements assuming that the electrode potentials of anode and cathode carbon electrode are the same the cell potential is expressed as follows 2 φ c e l l 2 φ e l e φ i r 2 q c e l e φ i r 3 φ i r φ i r c e m φ i r a e m φ i r s o l on the other hand the concentration of the feed stream before applying a current is equal to the concentration of feed water when supplying a current to the cell the concentration of the feed stream decreases as the ions move salt concentration at the surface of iem is reduced because of the different transference numbers in the solution and in the iem which is called concentration polarization bard and faulkner 2001 strathmann 2004 thus the electrical resistance of the feed stream can be increased by concentration polarization if the cell resistance is r o before concentration polarization occurs and φ c p is the voltage drop that is additionally incurred by the concentration polarization eq 3 can be expressed as follows 4 φ i r i r o φ c p assuming that the electrical resistances of the aem and cem are constant without being influenced by the concentration polarization the cell potential in cc mode can be expressed as eq 5 5 φ c e l l 2 q c e l e i r o φ c p when a constant current is supplied to the cell the electrode potential increases in direct proportion to the charge supplied and a voltage drop due to the initial cell resistance occurs in proportion to the intensity of the current applied in addition concentration polarization occurs in the feed stream and a further voltage drop occurs in fig 3 the cell potential increased nonlinearly until approximately 20 c g of charge was supplied this is interpreted as the result of concentration polarization in the feed stream at the beginning of adsorption after that the cell potential rose in proportion to the charge supplied regardless of the current density the concentration polarization in the feed stream stabilizes as adsorption proceeds and φ c p converges to a constant value when the initial cell resistance r o and the voltage drop φ c p due to concentration polarization are constant in eq 5 the specific capacitance of the carbon electrode can be calculated from the changes in the cumulative charge and the cell potential in fig 3 the specific capacitance was found to be 78 f g at all current densities cell potential was subdivided into electrode potential voltage drop from initial cell resistance and voltage drop from concentration polarization the electrode potential and voltage drop due to the cell resistance were calculated using the specific capacitance 78 f g of the carbon electrode and the initial cell resistance 1 84 ω in addition the voltage drop due to concentration polarization was calculated by subtracting the φ e l e and i r o values from the cell potential fig 4 shows the respective potential changes according to the cumulative charge at a current density of 4 29 ma cm2 the cell potential increased from 0 55 to 1 42 v during the adsorption process since the cell is supplied with a constant current the voltage drop due to the initial cell resistance was constant at 0 55 v however the voltage drop due to concentration polarization increased rapidly at the beginning of the adsorption process with the stabilization of concentration polarization in the feed stream the voltage drop due to concentration polarization maintained a constant value of 0 17 v the cell potential was 1 42 v when the cumulative charge supplied reached 55 c g at this point the sum of the voltage drop due to cell resistance and that due to concentration polarization was 0 72 v and the electrode potential affecting electrode reactions was only approximately 0 70 v although the cell potential was as high as 1 42 v the electrode potential was 0 70 v which was too low to cause electrode reactions the salt adsorption capacity sac and the charge efficiency λ were calculated from the effluent concentration and the total charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption process using eqs 6 and 7 the adsorption rates were calculated by dividing sac by adsorption time the energy consumption was obtained by dividing the energy consumed during the adsorption process by the amount of nacl adsorbed the desalination performances at each current density are summarized in table 1 6 sac m g g m v c o c a v g w 7 λ f v c o c a v g i d t 100 where m is the molecular mass of nacl mg mol v is the total volume supplied to the cell during the adsorption process l c o and c a v g are the feed concentration and the average concentration of effluent during the adsorption process mol l respectively w is the mass of the anode and cathode carbon electrodes g and i is the current supplied to the cell a the total charge supplied to the cell was 55 c g at all current densities as a result sac showed similar values of approximately 15 6 mg g regardless of the current density in addition the charge efficiency was approximately 91 at all current densities when the current density was 4 29 ma cm2 the cell potential increased to 1 42 v but electrode reactions did not occur resulting in a high charge efficiency in the operation of an mcdi system the adsorption rate is proportional to the current density applied to the cell with increasing current density the adsorption time can be reduced which indicates an improvement in the desalination performance of the mcdi system however as the current density increases more energy is consumed the energy consumption increased by approximately 55 when the current density was tripled from 1 43 to 4 29 ma cm2 increasing the current density leads to an increase in cell resistance due to concentration polarization in the feed stream which causes high energy consumption 3 3 operational stability of mcdi cells at a high cell potential adsorption experiments were carried out until a charge of 55 c g was supplied to the mcdi cell at a constant cell potential 1 25 1 50 1 75 or 2 00 v after adsorption was completed the cell potential was changed to 0 0 v and desorption was performed for 300 s fig 5 shows the changes in the concentration and ph of the effluent during the adsorption desorption process at each cell potential as the cell potential increased the concentration of the effluent decreased further at a cell potential of 2 0 v the effluent concentration decreased to approximately 200 mg l additionally it can be seen that the adsorption times the time required to supply 55 c g of charge were reduced as the cell potential increased when the cell potential was 1 25 v the adsorption time was 102 s but at 2 0 v the time was shortened to 54 s on the other hand the concentration of effluent in the desorption process was similar regardless of the cell potential in the adsorption process from this it can be deduced that adsorption takes place stably at a cell potential of 1 25 2 0 v fig 5 b shows the ph change in the effluent during the adsorption desorption process the effluent ph drops when electrode reactions occur in mcdi operation however the ph rose from 6 47 to 6 79 with increasing cell potential the increase in effluent ph during the adsorption process is attributed to the different removal rate of h and oh ions through the changes in concentration and ph it was confirmed that electrode reactions did not occur even at a cell potential of 2 0 v when the charge supplied to the mcdi cell did not exceed the mac value fig 6 shows the changes in the current and cumulative charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption period at different cell potentials as expected a higher current was supplied as the cell potential increased as adsorption progressed the current density gradually decreased at 1 25 v the initial current density was 8 5 ma cm2 but decreased to 2 7 ma cm2 at a cell potential of 2 0 v however a current density of 8 2 ma cm2 was maintained until adsorption was completed mcdi operation at a high current density has the advantage of reducing the adsorption time the operation of the mcdi system without faradaic reactions is possible even at a high current density of 10 ma cm2 or more the electrode potential voltage drop due to the initial cell resistance and voltage drop caused by concentration polarization were analyzed for mcdi operation in cv mode fig 7 shows the potential changes according to the cumulative charge supplied to the cell at a cell potential of 2 0 v the initial cell resistance was 1 84 ω as the current density decreased from 10 7 to 8 2 ma cm2 the voltage drop due to the initial cell resistance decreased from 1 36 v to 1 06 v the concentration polarization in the feed stream is expected to become severe with increasing current density as a result the voltage drop due to concentration polarization showed a high value of 0 24 0 62 v depending on the cell potential the sum of the electrode potentials of the anode and cathode carbon electrodes increased in proportion to the cumulative charge and was approximately 0 70 v at the end of adsorption from fig 7 it can be seen that a large voltage drop occurred due to cell resistance and concentration polarization when the mcdi was operated at a high cell potential electrode reactions do not occur at high cell potential because of the high voltage drop caused by the cell resistance the desalination performances were analyzed from the adsorption experiment results in cv mode and are summarized in table 2 as the cell potential increased sac and charge efficiency seemed to decrease slightly however this is attributed to the effluent concentration in the early stage of adsorption process that is the adsorption time was shortened as the cell potential increased thereby the initial effluent concentration can influence the calculation of sac and charge efficiency on the whole sac showed a constant value of approximately 15 5 mg g regardless of the cell potential the charge efficiency also remained high at approximately 92 at all cell potentials from these results it could be concluded that electrode reactions did not occur even at a high cell potential if the charge supplied to the mcdi cell did not exceed the mac value in addition as the cell potential was stepped up from 1 25 to 2 0 v the adsorption rate was nearly doubled from 9 4 to 17 3 mg g min and the energy consumption increased by 64 from 2 22 to 3 63 j mg as the cell potential increased the current supplied to the cell increased which raised the energy consumption due to intensified concentration polarization in the feed stream from tables 1 and 2 it can be seen that the energy consumption was proportional to the adsorption rate current density thus it is necessary to reduce the cell resistances of the iems and feed stream to operate an mcdi system at high current density with low energy consumption 4 conclusion we have investigated a method to safely operate an mcdi system without electrode reactions at a high cell potential the charge supplied to the mcdi cell was controlled to suppress electrode reactions the mac value was determined to be approximately 58 c g to confirm the stability of mcdi operation adsorption experiments were conducted while supplying a charge of 55 c g 95 of mac at a high cell potential it was observed that the effluent concentration and ph were stable even at a high cell potential the sac and charge efficiency were constant at 15 mg g and 92 respectively regardless of the current density and cell potential applied to the cell it was thought that electrode reactions did not occur at a high cell potential because of the high voltage drop due to the cell resistance of the iems and feed stream during the mcdi adsorption process a voltage drop occurs due to the cell resistance the cell resistance is affected by the iems used in the cell the concentration of the feed solution and the spacer thickness since electrode reactions are governed by the electrode potential electrode reactions can be suppressed by controlling the cell potential a typical mcdi operating parameter the electrode potential is proportional to the charge accumulated on the carbon electrode and is not affected by the cell resistance or current supplied to the cell thus mcdi systems can be stably operated without electrode reactions by controlling the charge supplied to the cell regardless of the operating conditions cell potential or current in addition the adsorption rate can be freely controlled by the cell potential or current density it is expected that this new operation method applying the mac concept will contribute to the stable operation of mcdi and an improvement in desalination performance acknowledgement this work was supported by the national

18851,a method for operating membrane capacitive deionization mcdi systems without electrode reactions at a high cell potential was studied the charge supplied to the cell was controlled to suppress faradaic reactions the maximum allowable charge mac that can be supplied to a carbon electrode without electrode reactions was measured to be 58 c g adsorption experiments were conducted while supplying a charge of 55 c g 95 of the mac value in constant current cc and constant voltage cv mode the cell potential increased to 1 42 v in cc 1 43 4 29 ma cm2 mode but the concentration and ph of the effluent were kept constant in addition the effluent ph was stable in cv 1 25 2 0 v mode the salt adsorption capacities and charge efficiencies were approximately 15 5 mg g and 92 respectively regardless of the current densities and cell potentials applied to the cell with increasing cell potential the concentration polarization in the feed stream was intensified resulting in an increase in cell resistance it was thought that electrode reactions did not occur at a high cell potential because of the high voltage drop due to the cell resistance the higher the cell potential or current density is the faster the desalination rate in mcdi operation it is expected that this operation method applying the mac concept will contribute to the stable operation of mcdi systems and an improvement in desalination performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane capacitive deionization maximum allowable charge electrode reaction cell potential electrode potential voltage drop 1 introduction as population growth and industrialization accelerate demand for water continues to increase however due to the global warming climate change is becoming worse and it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure residential and industrial water in recent years desalination technologies for the treatment of seawater and brine solution have attracted attention as fundamental solutions to the water shortage problem elimelech and phillip 2011 the most commonly used desalination processes today are distillation and reverse osmosis ro membrane processes elimelech and phillip 2011 ghaffour et al 2013 since 2000 capacitive deionization cdi has attracted much attention as a process that can reduce energy costs in the desalination process anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 cdi is a technology for removing ions by electrostatic attraction by applying an electric potential to a carbon electrode when adsorption is completed the ions adsorbed on the carbon electrodes are desorbed by shorting the electrodes or by applying a reverse potential porada et al 2013 kim and choi 2010 compared with conventional desalination processes such as distillation and ro cdi has the advantages of low energy consumption and high recovery comparing with ro it has been known that cdi is more energy efficient in the lower concentration roughly below 2 g l suss et al 2015 zhao et al 2013b it is also known as a simple and environmentally friendly process because of these technical merits cdi has been evaluated as a promising future desalination technology anderson et al 2010 porada et al 2013 suss et al 2015 zhao et al 2013b over the past two decades intensive studies on carbon electrodes which are the core components of cdi systems and cell structures have yielded remarkable achievements huang et al 2017 lee et al 2014 li et al 2008 li et al 2009 nie et al 2012 carbon electrodes with an adsorption capacity of 30 mg g or more were developed by modifying the type and function of carbon material used lee et al 2014 in addition desalination performance has been enhanced by improving the cdi cell structure membrane cdi mcdi which combines ion exchange membranes iems with carbon electrodes has been developed resulting in a dramatic improvement in charge efficiency biesheuvel and van der wal 2010 lee et al 2006 various cell structures such as flow electrode cdi jeon et al 2013 porada et al 2014 flow through cdi suss et al 2012 and inverted cdi gao et al 2015 2016 have been developed to overcome the drawbacks of conventional cdi cells to date cdi research has focused on improving the performance of systems such as carbon electrodes and cell structures to facilitate the commercialization of cdi long term stable operation of the cdi system is essential in particular stable operation of the cdi system without electrode reactions is an important and urgent challenge in expanding the commercial use of the cdi process omosebi et al 2014 tang et al 2017 however research on operation technology is still insufficient in cdi operation ions are removed by non faradaic charges supplied to the carbon electrodes thus it is advantageous to apply a high cell potential to increase the adsorption amount when the cell potential reaches a certain level however faradaic reactions occur bard and faulkner 2001 electrode reactions during cdi operation cause serious problems such as a deterioration of desalination performance as well as energy loss cohen et al 2013 he et al 2016 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the main electrode reactions in cdi cells are carbon oxidation water oxidation and the reduction of dissolved oxygen zhang et al 2018 in particular the carbon oxidation reaction shortens the lifetime of carbon electrodes and consequently reduces desalination performance omosebi et al 2014 tang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 additionally the reaction products can contaminate the treated water in case of feed water containing hardness components such as ca2 and mg2 ions scale can be formed on the carbon electrode due to the reaction products choi 2014 therefore the suppression of electrode reactions during cdi operation is very important for the long term stable operation of the cdi system generally the adsorption amount and adsorption rate during cdi operation are controlled by the cell potential lu et al 2017 zhao et al 2013a when the cell potential is increased the adsorption amount and the rate can be increased but electrode reactions may occur typically cdi systems are operated at a cell potential of 1 0 1 4 v to prevent electrode reactions suss et al 2015 however electrode reactions are governed by the electrode potential not by the cell potential the mcdi cell which is mainly applied to the actual desalination process has a structure of carbon electrode anion exchange membrane aem spacer cation exchange membrane cem carbon electrode when applying an electric potential to the mcdi cell the electrode potential increases as charge is accumulated in the carbon electrode at the same time voltage drops occur as the ions move through resistance elements such as iems and the feed stream dykstra et al 2016 the voltage drop is proportional to the current and the cell resistance the electrode potential of the mcdi system which has different cell resistances can be different even at the same cell potential this indicates that the cell potential is not a suitable operating parameter to suppress electrode reactions since electrode reactions are governed by the electrode potential it is necessary to operate the mcdi system based on the electrode potential instead of the cell potential the electrode potential increases proportional to the charge accumulated on the carbon electrode and electrode reactions begin when an overpotential is reached bard and faulkner 2001 in a previous study we introduced the concept of maximum allowable charge mac as a new metric for expressing the adsorption capacity of carbon electrodes yoon and choi 2019 separately the mac concept can be used as an important means to suppress electrode reactions in mcdi operation if the charge supplied to the cell does not exceed the mac value electrode reactions can be suppressed regardless of the cell potential in this study we investigated a stable operation method for mcdi systems without electrode reactions at a high cell potential using the mac concept the mac value of the carbon electrode was measured the adsorption experiments were carried out while supplying a charge of 95 of the mac value to the mcdi cell at various current densities 1 43 4 29 ma cm2 and cell potentials 1 25 2 0 v the stability of the mcdi system for electrode reactions was evaluated by measuring the current voltage energy consumption effluent concentration and ph change in addition the changes in electrode potential and the voltage drops due to cell resistance during the adsorption process were analyzed 2 experimental 2 1 construction of the mcdi unit cell and desalination experimental setup carbon electrodes to be used for the mcdi unit cell were prepared using activated carbon powder cep 21 k pct co korea carbon powder sbr emulsion eq lib sbr mti co usa and water to adjust the viscosity of the slurry were mixed the mixture was stirred using a planetary centrifugal mixer ar 100 thinky co japan for 30 min to prepare a homogeneous electrode slurry then the electrode slurry was cast on a graphite foil f02511 dongbang carbon co korea as a current collector and dried in a drying oven at 50 c for 3 h the sbr content in the prepared carbon electrode was 10 wt and the thickness of the carbon layer was approximately 160 μm carbon electrodes the cem neosepta cmx astom co japan and the aem neosepta amx were cut into a circular shape with a diameter of 9 5 cm a hole with a diameter of 1 cm was formed in the center of the iems and the carbon electrodes the effective area of the carbon electrodes used in the mcdi cell was 70 cm2 and the mass was 0 65 g 0 002 an amx membrane was attached to the surface of the anode carbon electrode and a cmx membrane was attached to the cathode carbon electrode a 180 μm thick spacer ex31 071 80 pw nbc meshtec inc japan was inserted between the aem and cem influent was supplied to the edge of the carbon electrodes passed through the spacer and flowed out through the central hole all mcdi experiments were carried out in single pass mode in which the effluent passed through the cell was discarded a nacl solution with a concentration of 1000 mg l was supplied to the cell at a flow rate of 30 ml min in addition power was supplied through a potentiostat wpg100 wona tech co korea during the desalination experiments the current voltage cumulative charge and energy consumption were measured at 2 s intervals using the potentiostat operating software the conductivity and ph sensors con bta ph bta vernier software technology usa were installed at the point where the effluent was drained from the cell conductivity and ph were measured at 2 s intervals using a computer connected interface labquest vernier software technology usa the nacl concentration was calculated using the correlation between the conductivity and the nacl concentration porada et al 2013 yoon and choi 2019 2 2 measurement of the mac value of the carbon electrode with supplying electric charge to a carbon electrode the electrode potential rises electrode reactions start when the electrode potential reaches the overpotential in a previous study we defined mac as the charge supplied to a carbon electrode at the overpotential yoon and choi 2019 to measure the mac value of the carbon electrode used in the mcdi experiments adsorption experiments were conducted while supplying a constant current to accurately analyze the desalination characteristics of mcdi cells the adsorption desorption process must reach dynamic steady state dss porada et al 2013 electrode reactions at the carbon electrodes can affect the adsorption characteristics in consideration of this first an adsorption desorption experiment was performed at a cell potential at which no electrode reactions occurred the adsorption proceeded at a current density of 1 43 ma cm2 until the cell potential reached 1 0 v followed by a desorption process for 400 s at a cell potential of 0 v the adsorption desorption process was repeated three times to reach dss then charges were supplied to the cell at the same current density 1 43 ma cm2 until the cell potential reached 1 6 v to determine the mac value desorption was performed again at 0 0 v for 400 s to confirm the reproducibility of the experimental results an mcdi cell was constructed with new carbon electrodes the same experiments were repeated three times under the same experimental conditions 2 3 desalination experiments using mcdi unit cells at high cell potentials the mac indicates the maximum charge that can be applied to a carbon electrode without electrode reactions occurring it is expected that the mcdi system can be operated without electrode reactions even at high cell potentials if the total charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption process does not exceed the mac value the mac value of the carbon electrode was measured to be approximately 58 c g mcdi experiments were carried out while supplying a charge of 55 c g which is 95 of the mac value the mass of the carbon electrode was 0 65 g so the actual charge supplied was 36 c adsorption experiments were carried out in constant current cc and constant voltage cv modes to evaluate the desalination performance according to the power supply method used in cc mode mcdi experiments were carried out at current densities of 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 the adsorption experiments in cv mode were performed at cell potentials of 1 25 1 50 1 75 and 2 00 v regardless of the current density and cell potential the total charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption process was fixed at 55 c g after adsorption was completed the cell potential was changed to 0 0 v and desorption was performed for 300 s the analysis of desalination performances is based on an adsorption desorption cycle that has reached dss we have confirmed that dss was reached after the second cycle desalination data according to the number of cycle was provided in supporting information adsorption desorption cycle was repeated 3 times at each operation condition to verify the reproducibility of the experimental results mcdi cells were fabricated with new carbon electrodes and the same experiment was repeated three times under the same conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the mac value of the carbon electrode to determine the mac value of the carbon electrode a constant current 1 43 ma cm2 was supplied to the mcdi unit cell until the cell potential reached 1 6 v fig 1 shows the change in effluent concentration during the adsorption process the cumulative charge was used as the x axis variable instead of the adsorption time the cumulative charge was calculated by dividing the charge supplied to the cell at each adsorption time by the mass of the carbon electrode in mcdi operation the adsorption rate is proportional to the current supplied to the cell when a constant current is supplied the effluent concentration is kept constant the effluent concentration was constant at 884 mg l until the cumulative charge reached approximately 58 c g however it can be seen that the concentration of the effluent started to increase gradually when the cumulative charge exceeded 58 c g furthermore the effluent concentration increased at a faster rate at a cumulative charge of approximately 80 c g or more the change in effluent concentration can be interpreted as a result of electrode reactions at the carbon electrodes although not shown in this paper we observed a decrease in ph when the effluent concentration began to change when electrode reactions occur in an mcdi cell h ions are generated by the oxidation reaction of carbon and water at the anode and accumulate on the surface of the carbon electrode as the concentration of h ions increases the h ions migrate to the feed stream past through the aem resulting in a decrease in effluent ph choi 2014 tang et al 2017 the permeation of h ions leads to a decrease in the permselectivity of the amx membrane and consequently increases the concentration of the effluent when electrode reactions occur in an mcdi cell the charge efficiency decreases because the amount of adsorption is reduced to accurately determine the point where the electrode reactions start the instantaneous charge efficiency ice λ q t at a cumulative charge of q t was calculated using eq 1 the ice change according to the cumulative charge is shown in fig 1 1 λ q t f δ v c o c q t 2 c q t 2 q t q t 2 100 where f is the faraday constant 96 500 c mol δv is the volume of the feed water supplied to the cell for 2 s l q t is the cumulative charge at time t s and c o and c q t are the concentration of the feed water and concentration of the effluent at a cumulative charge of q t mol l respectively the adsorption experiment was carried out at a current density of 1 43 ma cm2 0 1 a q t q t 2 was always 0 2 c three characteristic regions can be seen in the ice curve after the start of adsorption ice remained constant at approximately 95 until a charge of 58 c g was delivered as the charge increased ice began to decrease gradually in addition ice dropped rapidly after approximately 80 c g the decrease in ice is attributed to the result of electrode reactions the mac value was determined at the point where the ice starts to decrease as illustrated in fig 2 and was approximately 58 c g 3 2 operational stability of mcdi cells in constant current mode the adsorption experiments were carried out until a charge of 55 c g was supplied in cc mode the cell potential was then switched to 0 0 v and desorption was performed for 300 s the adsorption experiments were carried out at various current densities 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 to evaluate the effect of current density on the desalination performance fig 2 a shows the effluent concentration and ph change at each current density at current densities of 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 the effluent concentrations were 884 759 and 652 mg l respectively unlike in fig 1 the effluent concentration remained constant throughout the adsorption period fig 2 b shows the ph change in the effluent during the adsorption desorption process the initial ph of the feed water was approximately 6 2 regardless of the current density the effluent ph showed a slight change in the range of 6 1 6 4 the slight increase in effluent ph during the adsorption process is attributed to the different removal rates of oh and h ions not by electrode reactions the ionic mobility of h ion 3 63 10 3 cm2 s v is approximately 1 8 times higher than that of oh ion 2 05 10 3 cm2 s v bard and faulkner 2001 it is thought that the removal rate of h ions is higher than that of oh ions during the adsorption process resulting in an increase in effluent ph through the changes in the concentration and ph of the effluent it was confirmed that electrode reactions did not occur regardless of the current density when 55 c g of charge was supplied to the cell fig 3 shows the cell potential change according to the cumulative charge supplied at current densities of 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 the initial cell voltages were 0 18 0 37 and 0 55 v respectively and increased in proportion to the current density supplied the initial cell voltage was caused by the electrical resistances of the iems and feed stream inside the cell the concentration of the feed stream at the beginning of adsorption was equal to the influent concentration 1000 mg l from the relationship between current and voltage it can be seen that the electrical resistance of the initial mcdi cell was 1 84 ω on the other hand the cell potential rose nonlinearly until approximately 20 c g of charge was supplied to the cell thereafter the cell potential increased in proportion to the cumulative charge regardless of the current density at current densities of 1 43 2 86 and 4 29 ma cm2 the final cell potentials when 55 c g of charge was supplied were 1 06 1 24 and 1 42 v respectively when a current is supplied to an mcdi cell electric charges q are accumulated on the carbon electrodes and the electrode potential rises the electrode potential φ e l e of a carbon electrode with a specific capacitance of c e l e is q c e l e additionally voltage drops occur when ions pass through the resistance elements iems and feed stream inside the cell the total voltage drop φ i r in the mcdi cell consists of the voltage drops due to the electrical resistances of the cem φ i r c e m aem φ i r a e m and feed stream φ i r s o l the cell potential φ c e l l of the mcdi system is composed of the electrode potentials of the anode and cathode carbon electrode and the voltage drop due to the resistance elements assuming that the electrode potentials of anode and cathode carbon electrode are the same the cell potential is expressed as follows 2 φ c e l l 2 φ e l e φ i r 2 q c e l e φ i r 3 φ i r φ i r c e m φ i r a e m φ i r s o l on the other hand the concentration of the feed stream before applying a current is equal to the concentration of feed water when supplying a current to the cell the concentration of the feed stream decreases as the ions move salt concentration at the surface of iem is reduced because of the different transference numbers in the solution and in the iem which is called concentration polarization bard and faulkner 2001 strathmann 2004 thus the electrical resistance of the feed stream can be increased by concentration polarization if the cell resistance is r o before concentration polarization occurs and φ c p is the voltage drop that is additionally incurred by the concentration polarization eq 3 can be expressed as follows 4 φ i r i r o φ c p assuming that the electrical resistances of the aem and cem are constant without being influenced by the concentration polarization the cell potential in cc mode can be expressed as eq 5 5 φ c e l l 2 q c e l e i r o φ c p when a constant current is supplied to the cell the electrode potential increases in direct proportion to the charge supplied and a voltage drop due to the initial cell resistance occurs in proportion to the intensity of the current applied in addition concentration polarization occurs in the feed stream and a further voltage drop occurs in fig 3 the cell potential increased nonlinearly until approximately 20 c g of charge was supplied this is interpreted as the result of concentration polarization in the feed stream at the beginning of adsorption after that the cell potential rose in proportion to the charge supplied regardless of the current density the concentration polarization in the feed stream stabilizes as adsorption proceeds and φ c p converges to a constant value when the initial cell resistance r o and the voltage drop φ c p due to concentration polarization are constant in eq 5 the specific capacitance of the carbon electrode can be calculated from the changes in the cumulative charge and the cell potential in fig 3 the specific capacitance was found to be 78 f g at all current densities cell potential was subdivided into electrode potential voltage drop from initial cell resistance and voltage drop from concentration polarization the electrode potential and voltage drop due to the cell resistance were calculated using the specific capacitance 78 f g of the carbon electrode and the initial cell resistance 1 84 ω in addition the voltage drop due to concentration polarization was calculated by subtracting the φ e l e and i r o values from the cell potential fig 4 shows the respective potential changes according to the cumulative charge at a current density of 4 29 ma cm2 the cell potential increased from 0 55 to 1 42 v during the adsorption process since the cell is supplied with a constant current the voltage drop due to the initial cell resistance was constant at 0 55 v however the voltage drop due to concentration polarization increased rapidly at the beginning of the adsorption process with the stabilization of concentration polarization in the feed stream the voltage drop due to concentration polarization maintained a constant value of 0 17 v the cell potential was 1 42 v when the cumulative charge supplied reached 55 c g at this point the sum of the voltage drop due to cell resistance and that due to concentration polarization was 0 72 v and the electrode potential affecting electrode reactions was only approximately 0 70 v although the cell potential was as high as 1 42 v the electrode potential was 0 70 v which was too low to cause electrode reactions the salt adsorption capacity sac and the charge efficiency λ were calculated from the effluent concentration and the total charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption process using eqs 6 and 7 the adsorption rates were calculated by dividing sac by adsorption time the energy consumption was obtained by dividing the energy consumed during the adsorption process by the amount of nacl adsorbed the desalination performances at each current density are summarized in table 1 6 sac m g g m v c o c a v g w 7 λ f v c o c a v g i d t 100 where m is the molecular mass of nacl mg mol v is the total volume supplied to the cell during the adsorption process l c o and c a v g are the feed concentration and the average concentration of effluent during the adsorption process mol l respectively w is the mass of the anode and cathode carbon electrodes g and i is the current supplied to the cell a the total charge supplied to the cell was 55 c g at all current densities as a result sac showed similar values of approximately 15 6 mg g regardless of the current density in addition the charge efficiency was approximately 91 at all current densities when the current density was 4 29 ma cm2 the cell potential increased to 1 42 v but electrode reactions did not occur resulting in a high charge efficiency in the operation of an mcdi system the adsorption rate is proportional to the current density applied to the cell with increasing current density the adsorption time can be reduced which indicates an improvement in the desalination performance of the mcdi system however as the current density increases more energy is consumed the energy consumption increased by approximately 55 when the current density was tripled from 1 43 to 4 29 ma cm2 increasing the current density leads to an increase in cell resistance due to concentration polarization in the feed stream which causes high energy consumption 3 3 operational stability of mcdi cells at a high cell potential adsorption experiments were carried out until a charge of 55 c g was supplied to the mcdi cell at a constant cell potential 1 25 1 50 1 75 or 2 00 v after adsorption was completed the cell potential was changed to 0 0 v and desorption was performed for 300 s fig 5 shows the changes in the concentration and ph of the effluent during the adsorption desorption process at each cell potential as the cell potential increased the concentration of the effluent decreased further at a cell potential of 2 0 v the effluent concentration decreased to approximately 200 mg l additionally it can be seen that the adsorption times the time required to supply 55 c g of charge were reduced as the cell potential increased when the cell potential was 1 25 v the adsorption time was 102 s but at 2 0 v the time was shortened to 54 s on the other hand the concentration of effluent in the desorption process was similar regardless of the cell potential in the adsorption process from this it can be deduced that adsorption takes place stably at a cell potential of 1 25 2 0 v fig 5 b shows the ph change in the effluent during the adsorption desorption process the effluent ph drops when electrode reactions occur in mcdi operation however the ph rose from 6 47 to 6 79 with increasing cell potential the increase in effluent ph during the adsorption process is attributed to the different removal rate of h and oh ions through the changes in concentration and ph it was confirmed that electrode reactions did not occur even at a cell potential of 2 0 v when the charge supplied to the mcdi cell did not exceed the mac value fig 6 shows the changes in the current and cumulative charge supplied to the cell during the adsorption period at different cell potentials as expected a higher current was supplied as the cell potential increased as adsorption progressed the current density gradually decreased at 1 25 v the initial current density was 8 5 ma cm2 but decreased to 2 7 ma cm2 at a cell potential of 2 0 v however a current density of 8 2 ma cm2 was maintained until adsorption was completed mcdi operation at a high current density has the advantage of reducing the adsorption time the operation of the mcdi system without faradaic reactions is possible even at a high current density of 10 ma cm2 or more the electrode potential voltage drop due to the initial cell resistance and voltage drop caused by concentration polarization were analyzed for mcdi operation in cv mode fig 7 shows the potential changes according to the cumulative charge supplied to the cell at a cell potential of 2 0 v the initial cell resistance was 1 84 ω as the current density decreased from 10 7 to 8 2 ma cm2 the voltage drop due to the initial cell resistance decreased from 1 36 v to 1 06 v the concentration polarization in the feed stream is expected to become severe with increasing current density as a result the voltage drop due to concentration polarization showed a high value of 0 24 0 62 v depending on the cell potential the sum of the electrode potentials of the anode and cathode carbon electrodes increased in proportion to the cumulative charge and was approximately 0 70 v at the end of adsorption from fig 7 it can be seen that a large voltage drop occurred due to cell resistance and concentration polarization when the mcdi was operated at a high cell potential electrode reactions do not occur at high cell potential because of the high voltage drop caused by the cell resistance the desalination performances were analyzed from the adsorption experiment results in cv mode and are summarized in table 2 as the cell potential increased sac and charge efficiency seemed to decrease slightly however this is attributed to the effluent concentration in the early stage of adsorption process that is the adsorption time was shortened as the cell potential increased thereby the initial effluent concentration can influence the calculation of sac and charge efficiency on the whole sac showed a constant value of approximately 15 5 mg g regardless of the cell potential the charge efficiency also remained high at approximately 92 at all cell potentials from these results it could be concluded that electrode reactions did not occur even at a high cell potential if the charge supplied to the mcdi cell did not exceed the mac value in addition as the cell potential was stepped up from 1 25 to 2 0 v the adsorption rate was nearly doubled from 9 4 to 17 3 mg g min and the energy consumption increased by 64 from 2 22 to 3 63 j mg as the cell potential increased the current supplied to the cell increased which raised the energy consumption due to intensified concentration polarization in the feed stream from tables 1 and 2 it can be seen that the energy consumption was proportional to the adsorption rate current density thus it is necessary to reduce the cell resistances of the iems and feed stream to operate an mcdi system at high current density with low energy consumption 4 conclusion we have investigated a method to safely operate an mcdi system without electrode reactions at a high cell potential the charge supplied to the mcdi cell was controlled to suppress electrode reactions the mac value was determined to be approximately 58 c g to confirm the stability of mcdi operation adsorption experiments were conducted while supplying a charge of 55 c g 95 of mac at a high cell potential it was observed that the effluent concentration and ph were stable even at a high cell potential the sac and charge efficiency were constant at 15 mg g and 92 respectively regardless of the current density and cell potential applied to the cell it was thought that electrode reactions did not occur at a high cell potential because of the high voltage drop due to the cell resistance of the iems and feed stream during the mcdi adsorption process a voltage drop occurs due to the cell resistance the cell resistance is affected by the iems used in the cell the concentration of the feed solution and the spacer thickness since electrode reactions are governed by the electrode potential electrode reactions can be suppressed by controlling the cell potential a typical mcdi operating parameter the electrode potential is proportional to the charge accumulated on the carbon electrode and is not affected by the cell resistance or current supplied to the cell thus mcdi systems can be stably operated without electrode reactions by controlling the charge supplied to the cell regardless of the operating conditions cell potential or current in addition the adsorption rate can be freely controlled by the cell potential or current density it is expected that this new operation method applying the mac concept will contribute to the stable operation of mcdi and an improvement in desalination performance acknowledgement this work was supported by the national

18852,the objective of this work was to develop a qsbr model for the prioritization of organic pollutants based on biodegradation rates from a database containing globally harmonized biodegradation tests using relevant molecular descriptors to do this we first categorized the chemicals into three groups group 1 simple aromatic chemicals with a single ring group 2 aromatic chemicals with multiple rings and group3 group 1 plus group 2 based on molecular descriptors estimated the first order biodegradation rate of the chemicals using rating values derived from the biowin3 model and finally developed validated and defined the applicability domain of models for each group using a multiple linear regression approach all the developed qsbr models complied with oecd principles for qsar validation the biodegradation rate in the models for the two groups group 2 and 3 chemicals are associated with abstract molecular descriptors that provide little relevant practical information towards understanding the relationship between chemical structure and biodegradation rates however molecular descriptors associated with the qsbr model for group 1 chemicals r2 0 89 q2 loo 0 87 provided information on properties that can readily be scrutinised and interpreted in relation to biodegradation processes in combination these results lead to the conclusion that qsbrs can be an alternative tool to estimate the persistence of chemicals some of which can provide further insights into those factors affecting biodegradation graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation rates molecular descriptors qsbr quantitative structure activity relationships 1 introduction microbial degradation is one of the important processes that determine the fate of anthropogenic chemicals in the environment it can transform potentially hazardous chemicals into less or more harmful products and can ultimately sometimes lead to their complete mineralization into carbon dioxide water and nutrients marchlewicz et al 2017 biodegradation tests have thus become an indispensable step in the regulation of chemicals determining their classification and labelling environmental risk assessment and hazard assessment pavan and worth 2008 rücker and kümmerer 2012 however current laboratory testing methodologies used for the evaluation of biodegradation persistence are expensive time consuming and poorly reproducible goodhead et al 2014 kowalczyk et al 2015 to date only 4214 of the estimated 145 297 chemicals pre registered unique substances under eu reach legislation echa 2017 accessed date 23 06 2017 echa 2017 have been reliably screened for their biodegradability oecd 2017 performing such tests for the remaining existing and new chemicals is a laborious costly and perhaps unachievable task furthermore factors affecting biodegradability are poorly understood and seldom studied rücker and kümmerer 2012 kowalczyk et al 2015 wang et al 2018 therefore an ability to reliably predict biodegradation rates would help to accelerate and improve hazard and environmental risk assessment of chemicals while reducing time monetary cost and potentially unnecessary animal testing requirements pavan and worth 2008 rücker and kümmerer 2012 martin et al 2017a quantitative structure activity relationships qsars are a widely used modelling technique in diverse fields where the physicochemical properties of chemicals are correlated to the strength of a given response or activity okey and stensel 1996 roy et al 2011 lee and von gunten 2012 mikolajczyk et al 2015 cvetnic et al 2017 in recent years the application of qsars to biodegradation quantitative structure biodegradability relationship qsbr has been advocated pavan and worth 2008 rücker and kümmerer 2012 providing valuable prediction of relative or absolute biodegradation rates and or transformation products of biodegradable chemicals strictly on the basis of chemical structures without having to undertake laboratory testing such models could provide a powerful tool to forecast the environmental fate of chemicals and assist in ranking them for in depth evaluation however such techniques are either rarely used in practice or rarely receive regulatory acceptance qsbrs currently provide reliable regulatory data for 20 of 15 873 registered chemicals in the echa database echa 2017 accessed date 23 06 2017 largely due to a lack of high quality experimental data rücker and kümmerer 2012 biodegradation models are broadly classified into qualitative and quantitative models qualitative models simply predict if a chemical is biodegradable or not mostly using structural fragments as a molecular descriptor gamberger et al 1996a 1996b loonen et al 1999 tunkel et al 2000 whereas quantitative models predict the rate and sometimes biodegradation pathways of chemicals mostly using different structural and physicochemical properties of a chemical such as molecular descriptors arnot et al 2005 cvetnic et al 2017 the organization for economic co operation development oecd principles for qsar state that the rigorous validation of qsars or qsbrs requires i a defined endpoint ii a defined domain of applicability iii appropriate measures of goodness of fit robustness and predictability iv expressed in the form of unambiguous algorithms and v if possible capable of providing a potential mechanistic interpretation of biodegradation netzeva et al 2005 most of the currently available quantitative qsbr models do not comply with all these principles they are built based on a small set of congeners without a defined or at least an uncertain applicability domain the theoretical area of the chemical space where for the particular mechanism of biological action or function the model s predictions are reliable puzyn et al 2009 paris et al 1982 1983 banerjee et al 1984 paris and wolfe 1987 pitter and chudoba 1990 okey and stensel 1996 arnot et al 2005 yang et al 2006 and rarely provide information that can be used to better understand the mechanisms of the biodegradation process this limits their application in predicting the biodegradability of chemicals with diverse structural properties there is a need for the development of new validated and mechanistic quantitative models pavan and worth 2008 which would be helped by the availability of high quality endpoint data for biodegradation preferably quantitative for a diverse set of chemicals however such data for biodegradation rates are currently lacking rücker and kümmerer 2012 nolte et al 2018 therefore these must be estimated from standardized biodegradation screening tests arnot et al 2005 advances in computational and statistical tools have motivated researchers to move towards the development of more sophisticated qsbr models by allowing the calculation of the numerous 1d 2d 3d structural and quantum mechanical molecular descriptors that can provide potential information on a chemical s structural physical or electronic properties that have influence on biodegradation process mauri et al 2006 helguera et al 2008 pavan and worth 2008 the availability of databases containing harmonized biodegradation data further allows such models to be tested and validated mansouri et al 2013 ceriani et al 2015 the objective of this work was to develop qsbr models able to provide a potential mechanistic interpretation for organic pollutants based on biodegradation rates from a database containing globally harmonized biodegradation tests using relevant molecular descriptors models were developed and validated following the oecd principals for qsar validation the developed models would not only improve our understanding of the biodegradation of such chemicals but could also be used as a means of prioritising and classifying chemicals in regulatory hazard and risk assessments in place of expensive and time consuming laboratory biodegradation tests 2 methods 2 1 chemical selection and molecular descriptor calculation 140 organic chemicals tables si 5 categorized either as priority pollutants or emerging organic pollutants in the field of water policy decision number 2001 epa 2003 lee and von gunten 2012 were initially selected for model development the identified chemicals encompass aliphatic aromatic and cyclic chemicals in the qsbr approach information on the structural features of chemical are encoded as numerical values of molecular descriptors and provides separate information about the chemical s structure each chemical was characterized by 4897 molecular descriptors 4885 descriptors were computed by dragon software used world wide for the calculation of molecular descriptors version 6 0 2014 dragon the descriptors of selected chemicals in the dragon software were computed with the optimized structure i e structure with minimum energy conformation of the chemicals the optimization of structures was performed with semi empirical pm7 method implemented in mopac software stewart 2007 descriptors with constant values i e some descriptors have the same value for all chemicals and inter correlated descriptors i e correlation coefficient greater than 0 9 were excluded in a pre reduction step thus obtaining a set of 2459 dragon molecular descriptors detailed information on dragon molecular descriptors can be found in the handbook of molecular descriptors todeschini and consonni 2008 another 12 descriptors physio chemical descriptors 7 descriptors pitter and chudoba 1990 saterbak et al 2007 ballabio et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2012 and quantum chemical descriptors 5 descriptors stewart 2007 were obtained from online sources or computed with quantum mechanical method on optimized structure i e semi empirical pm7 method implemented in mopac software respectively tables si 6 2 2 endpoint for qsbr model endpoint refers to any physicochemical biological or environmental effect that can be measured and therefore modelled most of the biodegradation data available in the literature are based on data poor experimental information and are rarely reproducible rücker and kümmerer 2012 half lives which are directly linked to first order rate are the end point commonly used in the regulatory assessment of persistence pavan and worth 2008 first order biodegradation rates derived from biowin3 ultimate biodegradation rating were used as a model endpoint since experimental data for all the chemicals examined was lacking biowin3 is one of several environmental fate estimation models incorporated in epi environmental protection interface suite and uses internationally harmonized biodegradation data us epa 2012 it predicts relative ultimate biodegradation rates of chemicals using the fragment based additive approach us epa 2012 in this study a new statistically significant regression relating the ultimate biodegradation rating and ultimate biodegradation half life of 13 chemicals echemportal was developed table si 1 a and b and figure si 1 a similar approach has been used elsewhere to convert ultimate biodegradation rating into chemical half life arnot et al 2005 but not specifically for the chemicals examined in this study these chemicals are among the few chemicals which were used in the biowin3 model development this regression was used to convert semi quantitative biowin3 biodegradation ratings to half lives of the selected chemicals in the study finally the corresponding first order biodegradation rate of all 140 chemicals were computed using the degradation half life of the chemicals equation 11 si the natural logarithm of first order rate was used as the response variable for subsequent qsbr modelling 2 3 screening of chemicals for qsbr model development clustering analysis enables pattern recognition and classification of chemicals into natural groups that are unknown beforehand by using the common properties characterized by the values of a set of variables pirhadi et al 2015 in this study hierarchical clustering analysis hca distance euclidean method ward was used to group chemicals into clusters based on calculated molecular descriptors pirhadi et al 2015 this resulted into four main clusters figure si 3 composed respectively of aliphatic chemicals and few simple aromatic chemicals cluster 1 mostly simple chemicals having a single aromatic ring and a few aliphatic poly aromatic and acyclic chemicals cluster 2 and 3 and mostly poly aromatic chemicals and a few cyclic chemicals cluster 4 aliphatic chemicals from the first cluster were excluded from further analysis as there were too few 20 chemicals for reliable qsbr model development and validation even though first order rates for those chemicals were available it has to be noted that a qsbr model developed with a small dataset would not reflect the complete property space and as a consequence qsbr results cannot be used to confidently predict the desired activity cherkasov et al 2014 furthermore a small number of acyclic and aliphatic chemicals in total 17 chemicals were present in clusters 2 3 and 4 which were therefore also excluded from further analyses since they are unlikely to confirm to the same applicability domain as aromatic chemicals therefore only aromatic chemicals 103 chemicals were considered for further model development 2 4 dataset splitting cluster analysis in general revealed that figure si 3 regardless of the number of observed clusters the distance between different clusters for simple aromatic chemicals i e clusters 1 2 and 3 were closer to each other as compared to the cluster for poly aromatic chemicals i e cluster 4 we decided to develop qsbr models for simple aromatic chemicals and poly aromatic chemicals separately and also a combined model for all aromatic chemicals after discarding cluster 1 and other structurally dissimilar chemicals mentioned in section 2 3 the selected aromatic chemicals were classified into three groups see tables si 2 tables si 3 and tables si 4 i group 1 simple aromatic chemicals with one aromatic ring 69 chemicals from clusters 2 and 3 ii group 2 poly aromatic chemicals 34 chemicals from cluster 4 and iii group 3 all aromatic chemicals group 1 group 2 103 chemicals each group was analysed as a separate dataset for qsbr modelling it should be noted that each cluster was not used as a separate dataset for qsbr model development as it was unlikely to confirm to the same applicability domain due the presence of chemicals with structural dissimilarities furthermore simple aromatic chemicals formed two clusters and would have required two different models despite showing some similarity firstly principal component analysis pca was used for each group to identify any outliers that could affect the robustness and fitness of the model gramatica et al 2013 pirhadi et al 2015 this analysis also aided in selecting training and validation sets subsequently the random by response approach sorting chemicals by ordering them according to increasing decreasing order of end point value was applied to split the chemicals into training and validation sets mikolajczyk et al 2015 to perform splitting the third chemical from the sorted chemical list was selected from the set as a first validation chemical subsequently every third chemical if possible was selected from the sorted list as a validation chemical the remaining chemicals formed the training set the chemical with the highest and the lowest biodegradation rates were included in the training set to guarantee that the prediction set spanned the entire range of the experimental measurements and was numerically representative of the dataset the final qsbr model for group 1 group 2 and group 3 were developed with 60 tables si 2 28 tables si 3 and 84 tables si 4 chemicals respectively 2 5 qsbr model development and validation qsarins software version 2 0 gramatica et al 2013 was used to develop a qsbr model for the split dataset using multiple linear regression mlr techniques in mlr the endpoint yi is described with the best combination of the most relevant auto scaled descriptors used as independent variables x1 x2 xn as follows 1 y i b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b n x n where b0 is the intercept and b1 b2 bn are the regression coefficients it has to be noted that the two step approach involving clustering i e hca and activity prediction i e mlr are two distinct and independent steps used for different purposes both from molecular descriptors this approach is recommended when qsar models need to be developed from datasets having large number of chemicals with diverse structure he and jurs 2005 initially dragon descriptors i e 2459 descriptors were used to develop qsbr models for the three groups defined in section 2 4 the best combination of the most relevant descriptors was selected using the genetic algorithm ga pavan and worth 2008 gramatica et al 2013 incorporated in qsrins this technique allows identification of the best solution i e helps to search the best combination of descriptors by maximizing or minimizing a selected fitness function in this study q2 loo cross validated coefficient used to evaluate the model s performance in predictions was selected as a fitness function fig 1 summarizes the detailed methodological steps performed during qsbr model development the best models developed by qsarins were sorted using fitting r2 si eq 1 and rmsetr si eq 2 and robustness q2 loo si eq 3 and rmsecv si eq 4 criteria correlation coefficient r2 and the root mean square error of calibration rmsetr were used as measures of the goodness of fit for the developed model puzyn et al 2009 cross validated coefficient q2 loo leave one out method and root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv were used to verify its stability and robustness puzyn et al 2009 for details please refer to the si the internally optimized stable and robust models were further evaluated for their external predictive power with chemicals not used in the model building process using different external validation parameters like q2 f1 eq 5 si q2 f2 eq 6 si q2 f3 eq 7 si and root mean square error of prediction rmsep eq 8 chirico and gramatica 2011 these are predictive squared correlation coefficients and for details please refer to the si in addition the applicability domain of the finally selected model was assessed by the leverage approach and using the williams graph roy et al 2011 a plot of leverage values h versus standardized residuals that generally identifies the structural outliers x outliers those having leverage value greater than critical h value and the residual outliers y outliers those with predicted response value above the user defined standardized residual limit the critical h value h is calculates as h 3 p 1 n where p is the number of model predictors and n is the number of objects training chemicals used to calculate the model the leverage value h i is calculated from the molecular descriptors included in the model and estimated according to equation 9 si after identifying the best model with three dragon descriptors for group1 chemicals an attempt was made to develop new models that incorporated an additional five quantum mechanical descriptors and seven other descriptors describing different physicochemical and structural properties of chemicals 15 descriptors tables si 6 these descriptors were those that pertained to electronic properties and functional groups within the chemical which have been shown to influence the biodegradation of a chemical pitter and chudoba 1990 nolte and ragas 2017 the quantum mechanical descriptors were calculated at the semi empirical level of theory with the use of pm7 method implemented in mopac software stewart 1994 2007 whereas other descriptors were obtained from different online databases pitter and chudoba 1990 ballabio et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2012 a similar approach as described above was used for model development 3 result and discussion 3 1 qsbr models table 1 provides the overall summary of the best model for each set of chemical groups the qsbr model for the simple aromatic chemicals equation 4 was better than the other two models for complex equation 3 and aromatic chemicals equation 2 as indicated by higher values for r2 q2 loo q2 f1 q2 f2 and q2 f3 the applicability domain of all three models was evaluated by a williams plot fig 2 group 1 and figure si 4 si 5 group 2 3 the williams plots verified the absence of outliers residual values y i y ˆ i were within the limits 3 times standard deviation and showed good applicability of the model for the prediction of the biodegradation rates for all of the studied aromatic chemicals in addition none of the structures of the studied aromatic chemicals were substantially different from the training set chemicals showing a leverage value h i h h g r o u p 1 0 30 h g r o u p 2 0 5 and h g r o u p 3 0 206 proving the applicability of this model for untested aromatic chemicals with calculated h i values lower than the critical value h however it has to be noted that h i values were estimated using equation 9 si which does not take into account structural variability or differences other than those expressed by the selected descriptors therefore the applicability of the model in its actual form is restricted to chemicals which have structural similarities to those used for the training set and should not be employed in prediction of structurally different chemicals e g structural differences in group 1 chemicals are mostly due to different substituent patterns on the mono aromatic ring and the model for group 1 should not be employed in prediction for poly aromatic chemicals the molecular descriptors provide information on specific physicochemical or structural characteristics of the chemical and the ability to interpret the encoded value of the descriptors provide information on the molecular features that are most likely to effect the biological activity of studied chemical todeschini and consonni 2008 however when using an extensive matrix of molecular descriptors the mechanistic interpretation of the endpoint of interest may not always provide useful or easily interpretable information this is evident in the current study as the descriptors associated with qsbr models for chemical datasets belonging to group 2 and group 3 are relatively abstract molecular descriptors of molecular geometry stereochemistry conformational index 2d finger printing and fragments counts while for group 1 the descriptors are for hydrophobic electronic steric size and shape properties of chemical and can be more easily interpreted with respect to offering rational explanations of their affect on biodegradation therefore in upcoming sections the qsbr model for simple aromatic chemicals were principally focused up on evaluating the model in terms of different model parameters defining its applicability domain and providing an underlying understanding between the biodegradation rate and the molecular descriptors associated with the model furthermore an attempt was made to improve the existing model by incorporating some other common descriptors specifically associated with biodegradation of chemicals namely quantum mechanical hydrophobic steric and electronic descriptors tables si 6 3 2 qsbr model for simple aromatic chemicals group 1 table 3 provides the summary statistics for the three descriptor based qsbr model for simple aromatic chemicals equation 4 table 1 there was no significant inter correlation pearson correlation coefficient p value 0 05 between the three descriptors tables si 7 this model showed high stability r2 0 8924 robustness q2 loo 0 8718 and external predictive ability q2 f1 0 8829 q2 f2 0 8835 and q2 f3 0 9178 the plots of the experimental versus predicted values fig 3 a and b showed very good agreement between biowin3 derived first order biodegradation rates and the model predicted values of biodegradation rate for 60 aromatic chemicals for both training and validation sets slopes of 0 89 likewise model predicted half life and biowin3 derived half life also showed good agreement slope of 0 96 in addition the plots confirmed the predictive capability of the developed model after identifying the best three dragon descriptors nn narx and mor08u a further 12 descriptors were included in the dataset to develop new models using the same approach tables si 6 the summary of the best 10 models based on 4 descriptors is reported in table 2 all the models were robust 89 8 r2 93 1 and stable 86 9 q loo 2 91 1 and have good predictive ability 85 6 q2ext 95 8 in addition all the descriptors from the developed models provide interpretable and possible mechanistic insights into the model as these descriptors are related to electronic steric and lipophilic properties of chemicals biodegradation of a chemical has been shown to be influenced by electronic and lipophilic properties along with functional groups within the chemical parsons and govers 1990 cvetnic et al 2017 3 3 qsbr model descriptors and their interpretation in relation to biodegradation rates in this study a simple linear regression model developed result not shown for group 1 chemicals using substituent constant σ which quantitatively examines the inductive and resonance effect of substituents on the biodegradation rate had poor fitting and stability r2 0 173 recently authors have suggested using a combination of different categories of descriptors e g quantum chemical topological constitutional for improved qsar performance in order to predict biological activity e g biodegradation rates mamy et al 2015 cvetnic et al 2017 the type number and position of substitutions on the aromatic ring are important parameters that determine the topological and electronic characteristics of aromatic chemicals and ultimately influence the degree and rate of biodegradation the information provided by the descriptors substituent constant σ nn narx and mor08u used in this study is in agreement with the effect of substitutions in the aromatic ring as follows mor08u is an un weighted morse molecular representations of structure based on electron diffraction descriptors with scattering parameter s 7 å 1 and calculated according to equation 10 si the calculated values of different morse descriptors for chemicals are based on their structural features where distance among the different atoms within a molecule will be the principal means to separate the molecule from others devinyak et al 2014 when qsar models are developed for a structurally similar group of chemicals the difference in the value of 3d morse descriptor is due to several neighbouring atom pairs in the molecule devinyak et al 2014 the differences in these descriptor values result in different physicochemical properties for the monoaromatic chemicals attributable to differences in the number type and position of substituents on the aromatic ring which in turn affect the biodegradation rate this interpretation is in agreement with results previously published in the literature sikarwar and dixit 2012 where an individual qsar model was used to predict the molar refractivity partition coefficient and polarizability of 34 phenolic chemicals using 3d morse descriptors and eigen values respectively number of nitrogen nn and halogen atoms in aromatic chemical narx the biodegradability of a molecule is influenced by electronic inductive and mesomeric steric and lipophilic properties of a molecular system pitter and chudoba 1990 in particular the type number and position of substituent groups present in the aromatic molecule strongly determine the electronic characteristics of that molecule both electronic inductive and mesomeric effects are responsible for attraction or repulsion of electrons affecting the electron density in the reaction centre the presence of halogen and nitrogen atoms in the aromatic system will contribute to deplete the electron density of the reaction system in biodegradation reactions the initial attack on the aromatic ring is mostly assumed to be electrophilic in nature therefore the presence of electron attracting elements like halogens f cl br i and nitrogen cn no2 nh3 conh2 deactivate the aromatic ring in certain positions for attack by oxygenases and results in a lower biodegradation rate pitter and chudoba 1990 3 4 mechanism of aerobic biodegradation the most practical and useful approach to qsbrs is to relate biodegradation rate data to molecular descriptors specifically providing relevant information on potential mechanisms of the biodegradation rate limiting process furthermore biodegradation rates are believed to be a function of the rate of a series of processes that occurs in a stepwise manner parsons and govers 1990 extracellular enzymes initiate microbial mineralization of organic matter by hydrolyzing substrates to sizes sufficiently small to be transported across cell membranes they then diffuse through the cytoplasm to reach the enzyme where the biodegradation reaction is initiated arnosti 2011 subsequently enzyme induction occurs which ultimately results in the binding of the metabolic enzyme and the chemical followed by transformation of the chemical by that enzyme parsons and govers 1990 wammer and peters 2005 the transport of chemicals across the microbial membrane can occur either via active transport mechanisms or passive diffusion an active transport mechanism is mostly involved in efflux and has little significant influence on biodegradation rate parsons and govers 1990 it has been shown that the transport of polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs across the microbial membrane generally occurs via the passive diffusion processes in some pah degrading bacteria bugg et al 2000 furthermore uptake via passive transport tends to correlate with the descriptors that normally describe the hydrophobicity of the chemicals such as logp octanol water partition coefficient polarizability or molar refraction 3d morse banerjee et al 1984 parsons and govers 1990 mamy et al 2015 suggesting diffusion of a chemical through the cytoplasm is an important step in biodegradation the structure of chemicals also likely controls the process of metabolic enzyme induction subsequent binding of the chemical to enzymes and transformation of the chemical parsons and govers 1990 the relationship between biodegradability of aromatic chemicals and molecular descriptors associated with the structure of chemicals are discussed in several papers wolfe et al 1980 okey and stensel 1996 more specifically in mono aromatics the number position and type of substituent are associated with electronic properties of the chemicals and influence their biodegradability pitter and chudoba 1990 in such chemicals aerobic biotransformation is generally initiated with the addition of molecular oxygen to the aromatic ring i e hydroxylation by oxygenase or dioxygenase enzymes pitter and chudoba 1990 peijnenburg 1994 followed by aromatic ring cleavage hydroxylation of the aromatic ring with subsequent ring cleavage is followed by an electrophilic substitution which are considered as the rate determining steps pitter and chudoba 1990 the presence of certain substituent groups increases the electron density of the aromatic ring and accelerates the biodegradation process nitrogen and halogenic substituents strongly deplete the electron density of the aromatic ring decreasing the rate of biodegradation as compared to degradation of aromatic chemicals with other substituents e g oh cho ch3 this effect was demonstrated by several authors alexander and lustigman 1966 vuono et al 2016 cvetnic et al 2017 where they showed retarded biodegradation rates of mono and di substituted benzene by microorganisms with chloro nitro and sulfonate substituents whereas an increased rate was recorded in the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the shape and size of chemicals plays an integral role during fitting of a chemical into the active site of the enzyme wammer and peters 2005 five descriptors in the current models mor08u molecular weight van der waal volume and valence connectivity index vx2 and vx1 are general size and shape descriptors the association of these descriptors with biodegradation rate indicates that the steric properties of aromatic chemicals have a significant role to play in the biodegradation process several qsar models relating biological activity and the molecular descriptors associated with steric properties have been developed elsewhere koch 1982 paris et al 1982 okey and stensel 1996 ceriani et al 2015 3d morse descriptor like mor08u which is weighted by electrotopological states combines both electronic and topological characteristics of atoms or molecules and plays an influential role in determining the biodegradability of aromatic chemicals ceriani et al 2015 in most chemical reactions an energy barrier exists and it must be surmounted for the reaction to occur thus kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are integral in explaining the observed differences in biodegradation in addition thermodynamic feasibility is also considered as an important metric to evaluate the potential of a biodegradation reaction finley et al 2009 two descriptors electronic energy and total energy of a molecule are quantum mechanical descriptors and generally provide information of energy associated with a chemical the relationship between the biodegradability of aromatic chemicals and descriptors associated with the energy of molecules are discussed in several papers wammer and peters 2005 yang et al 2006 total energy toe of a molecule is the sum of total energy of all electrons e el and repulsion energy between atomic nuclei e n u c n u c in a molecule stewart 1994 5 t o e e e l e n u c n u c electronic energy e el is the sum of repulsion energy between electrons and the attraction energy between electron and atomic nuclei according to molecular orbital theory the total electronic energy is directly associated with total energies of the individual occupied molecular orbitals which also provides the information of total bond energy in a molecule karelson et al 1996 petrucci et al 1997 this suggests that the higher the total energy the higher the total bond energy of a molecule thus the molecule with higher total bond energy has strong attraction between electrons and the atomic nuclei this implies that high energy is required to degrade such a molecule therefore when an aromatic chemical has higher total energy they are more resistant to degradation 3 5 implications for predicting biodegradation half lives for fate and hazard assessment real world chemical half lives in different environment compartments are essential for the reliable risk assessment of chemicals yet accurate datasets providing information on half lives are lacking several researchers have attempted to convert biowin output into half lives and ultimately into rates gouin et al 2004 arnot et al 2005 aronson et al 2006 which allows the prioritization of chemicals according to their relatively biodegradabilities even if the absolute rates may be inaccurate we recognize that accurate prediction of half lives or rates with a model can only be reliably achieved by training the model with actually measured half lives or rates rücker and kümmerer 2012 nevertheless in the absence of such a dataset we have developed a qsbr models to predict half lives of 60 aromatic chemicals and made a comparison between the rates predicted in this study figure si 2 and the rates predicted with the model developed by arnot et al 2005 arnot et al 2005 who developed a simple linear regression model by correlating the biowin outputs and experimental aqueous aerobic half lives there was a significant correlation between the first order rates estimated with the aforementioned model and the first order rates used in this study univariate regression analysis r2 0 99 p value 0 05 however the applicability domain of the model was uncertain and the model failed to provide any insights into the principles underlying biodegradation while our models does nevertheless this observed correlation not only suggests that the qsbr model predictions are stable but also provides a framework for evaluating the persistence of chemicals that are within the model applicability domain regulatory frameworks have put much emphasis on identification and prioritization of chemicals based on their environmental hazardous properties i e persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity pbt rather than on their environmental risk alone martin et al 2017b furthermore their guidance also recommends that persistence assessment of chemicals should be performed prior to bioaccumulation and toxicity assessments in order to avoid unnecessary animal tests the latter should be carried out only when the chemical is assigned as potentially persistent echa 2017 half lives are the commonly used end point in the regulatory assessment of persistence rücker and kümmerer 2012 echa 2017 martin et al 2017b the qsbr models for simple aromatic chemicals developed here has been shown to correctly predict and interpret respectively half lives and the affect of chemical parameters on biodegradation of chemicals based on their previous biodegradability classification obtained from biowin3 these models also enabled the generation of first order biodegradation rates of chemicals on the other hand the models developed in this study are unable to provide any information on metabolites and transformation products in addition they also ignore other natural degradation or removal processes such as photolytic degradation and sorption 4 conclusions qsbr models for simple aromatic chemicals were robust appear reliable and can be more easily interpreted with respect to potential mechanistic explanations of their affect on biodegradation than the models for two other groups of chemicals developed in this study this is a first proof of principle step showing that qsbr models can be an alternative approach to expensive laboratory tests both in screening for and making definitive classifications in persistence assessments of chemicals in this instance for mono aromatic chemicals the derived qsbr model needs further validation and calibration using experimentally determined biodegradation rates however a similar approach to that used here could prove useful in deriving accurate qsbrs for other classes of chemicals declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

18852,the objective of this work was to develop a qsbr model for the prioritization of organic pollutants based on biodegradation rates from a database containing globally harmonized biodegradation tests using relevant molecular descriptors to do this we first categorized the chemicals into three groups group 1 simple aromatic chemicals with a single ring group 2 aromatic chemicals with multiple rings and group3 group 1 plus group 2 based on molecular descriptors estimated the first order biodegradation rate of the chemicals using rating values derived from the biowin3 model and finally developed validated and defined the applicability domain of models for each group using a multiple linear regression approach all the developed qsbr models complied with oecd principles for qsar validation the biodegradation rate in the models for the two groups group 2 and 3 chemicals are associated with abstract molecular descriptors that provide little relevant practical information towards understanding the relationship between chemical structure and biodegradation rates however molecular descriptors associated with the qsbr model for group 1 chemicals r2 0 89 q2 loo 0 87 provided information on properties that can readily be scrutinised and interpreted in relation to biodegradation processes in combination these results lead to the conclusion that qsbrs can be an alternative tool to estimate the persistence of chemicals some of which can provide further insights into those factors affecting biodegradation graphical abstract image 1 keywords biodegradation rates molecular descriptors qsbr quantitative structure activity relationships 1 introduction microbial degradation is one of the important processes that determine the fate of anthropogenic chemicals in the environment it can transform potentially hazardous chemicals into less or more harmful products and can ultimately sometimes lead to their complete mineralization into carbon dioxide water and nutrients marchlewicz et al 2017 biodegradation tests have thus become an indispensable step in the regulation of chemicals determining their classification and labelling environmental risk assessment and hazard assessment pavan and worth 2008 rücker and kümmerer 2012 however current laboratory testing methodologies used for the evaluation of biodegradation persistence are expensive time consuming and poorly reproducible goodhead et al 2014 kowalczyk et al 2015 to date only 4214 of the estimated 145 297 chemicals pre registered unique substances under eu reach legislation echa 2017 accessed date 23 06 2017 echa 2017 have been reliably screened for their biodegradability oecd 2017 performing such tests for the remaining existing and new chemicals is a laborious costly and perhaps unachievable task furthermore factors affecting biodegradability are poorly understood and seldom studied rücker and kümmerer 2012 kowalczyk et al 2015 wang et al 2018 therefore an ability to reliably predict biodegradation rates would help to accelerate and improve hazard and environmental risk assessment of chemicals while reducing time monetary cost and potentially unnecessary animal testing requirements pavan and worth 2008 rücker and kümmerer 2012 martin et al 2017a quantitative structure activity relationships qsars are a widely used modelling technique in diverse fields where the physicochemical properties of chemicals are correlated to the strength of a given response or activity okey and stensel 1996 roy et al 2011 lee and von gunten 2012 mikolajczyk et al 2015 cvetnic et al 2017 in recent years the application of qsars to biodegradation quantitative structure biodegradability relationship qsbr has been advocated pavan and worth 2008 rücker and kümmerer 2012 providing valuable prediction of relative or absolute biodegradation rates and or transformation products of biodegradable chemicals strictly on the basis of chemical structures without having to undertake laboratory testing such models could provide a powerful tool to forecast the environmental fate of chemicals and assist in ranking them for in depth evaluation however such techniques are either rarely used in practice or rarely receive regulatory acceptance qsbrs currently provide reliable regulatory data for 20 of 15 873 registered chemicals in the echa database echa 2017 accessed date 23 06 2017 largely due to a lack of high quality experimental data rücker and kümmerer 2012 biodegradation models are broadly classified into qualitative and quantitative models qualitative models simply predict if a chemical is biodegradable or not mostly using structural fragments as a molecular descriptor gamberger et al 1996a 1996b loonen et al 1999 tunkel et al 2000 whereas quantitative models predict the rate and sometimes biodegradation pathways of chemicals mostly using different structural and physicochemical properties of a chemical such as molecular descriptors arnot et al 2005 cvetnic et al 2017 the organization for economic co operation development oecd principles for qsar state that the rigorous validation of qsars or qsbrs requires i a defined endpoint ii a defined domain of applicability iii appropriate measures of goodness of fit robustness and predictability iv expressed in the form of unambiguous algorithms and v if possible capable of providing a potential mechanistic interpretation of biodegradation netzeva et al 2005 most of the currently available quantitative qsbr models do not comply with all these principles they are built based on a small set of congeners without a defined or at least an uncertain applicability domain the theoretical area of the chemical space where for the particular mechanism of biological action or function the model s predictions are reliable puzyn et al 2009 paris et al 1982 1983 banerjee et al 1984 paris and wolfe 1987 pitter and chudoba 1990 okey and stensel 1996 arnot et al 2005 yang et al 2006 and rarely provide information that can be used to better understand the mechanisms of the biodegradation process this limits their application in predicting the biodegradability of chemicals with diverse structural properties there is a need for the development of new validated and mechanistic quantitative models pavan and worth 2008 which would be helped by the availability of high quality endpoint data for biodegradation preferably quantitative for a diverse set of chemicals however such data for biodegradation rates are currently lacking rücker and kümmerer 2012 nolte et al 2018 therefore these must be estimated from standardized biodegradation screening tests arnot et al 2005 advances in computational and statistical tools have motivated researchers to move towards the development of more sophisticated qsbr models by allowing the calculation of the numerous 1d 2d 3d structural and quantum mechanical molecular descriptors that can provide potential information on a chemical s structural physical or electronic properties that have influence on biodegradation process mauri et al 2006 helguera et al 2008 pavan and worth 2008 the availability of databases containing harmonized biodegradation data further allows such models to be tested and validated mansouri et al 2013 ceriani et al 2015 the objective of this work was to develop qsbr models able to provide a potential mechanistic interpretation for organic pollutants based on biodegradation rates from a database containing globally harmonized biodegradation tests using relevant molecular descriptors models were developed and validated following the oecd principals for qsar validation the developed models would not only improve our understanding of the biodegradation of such chemicals but could also be used as a means of prioritising and classifying chemicals in regulatory hazard and risk assessments in place of expensive and time consuming laboratory biodegradation tests 2 methods 2 1 chemical selection and molecular descriptor calculation 140 organic chemicals tables si 5 categorized either as priority pollutants or emerging organic pollutants in the field of water policy decision number 2001 epa 2003 lee and von gunten 2012 were initially selected for model development the identified chemicals encompass aliphatic aromatic and cyclic chemicals in the qsbr approach information on the structural features of chemical are encoded as numerical values of molecular descriptors and provides separate information about the chemical s structure each chemical was characterized by 4897 molecular descriptors 4885 descriptors were computed by dragon software used world wide for the calculation of molecular descriptors version 6 0 2014 dragon the descriptors of selected chemicals in the dragon software were computed with the optimized structure i e structure with minimum energy conformation of the chemicals the optimization of structures was performed with semi empirical pm7 method implemented in mopac software stewart 2007 descriptors with constant values i e some descriptors have the same value for all chemicals and inter correlated descriptors i e correlation coefficient greater than 0 9 were excluded in a pre reduction step thus obtaining a set of 2459 dragon molecular descriptors detailed information on dragon molecular descriptors can be found in the handbook of molecular descriptors todeschini and consonni 2008 another 12 descriptors physio chemical descriptors 7 descriptors pitter and chudoba 1990 saterbak et al 2007 ballabio et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2012 and quantum chemical descriptors 5 descriptors stewart 2007 were obtained from online sources or computed with quantum mechanical method on optimized structure i e semi empirical pm7 method implemented in mopac software respectively tables si 6 2 2 endpoint for qsbr model endpoint refers to any physicochemical biological or environmental effect that can be measured and therefore modelled most of the biodegradation data available in the literature are based on data poor experimental information and are rarely reproducible rücker and kümmerer 2012 half lives which are directly linked to first order rate are the end point commonly used in the regulatory assessment of persistence pavan and worth 2008 first order biodegradation rates derived from biowin3 ultimate biodegradation rating were used as a model endpoint since experimental data for all the chemicals examined was lacking biowin3 is one of several environmental fate estimation models incorporated in epi environmental protection interface suite and uses internationally harmonized biodegradation data us epa 2012 it predicts relative ultimate biodegradation rates of chemicals using the fragment based additive approach us epa 2012 in this study a new statistically significant regression relating the ultimate biodegradation rating and ultimate biodegradation half life of 13 chemicals echemportal was developed table si 1 a and b and figure si 1 a similar approach has been used elsewhere to convert ultimate biodegradation rating into chemical half life arnot et al 2005 but not specifically for the chemicals examined in this study these chemicals are among the few chemicals which were used in the biowin3 model development this regression was used to convert semi quantitative biowin3 biodegradation ratings to half lives of the selected chemicals in the study finally the corresponding first order biodegradation rate of all 140 chemicals were computed using the degradation half life of the chemicals equation 11 si the natural logarithm of first order rate was used as the response variable for subsequent qsbr modelling 2 3 screening of chemicals for qsbr model development clustering analysis enables pattern recognition and classification of chemicals into natural groups that are unknown beforehand by using the common properties characterized by the values of a set of variables pirhadi et al 2015 in this study hierarchical clustering analysis hca distance euclidean method ward was used to group chemicals into clusters based on calculated molecular descriptors pirhadi et al 2015 this resulted into four main clusters figure si 3 composed respectively of aliphatic chemicals and few simple aromatic chemicals cluster 1 mostly simple chemicals having a single aromatic ring and a few aliphatic poly aromatic and acyclic chemicals cluster 2 and 3 and mostly poly aromatic chemicals and a few cyclic chemicals cluster 4 aliphatic chemicals from the first cluster were excluded from further analysis as there were too few 20 chemicals for reliable qsbr model development and validation even though first order rates for those chemicals were available it has to be noted that a qsbr model developed with a small dataset would not reflect the complete property space and as a consequence qsbr results cannot be used to confidently predict the desired activity cherkasov et al 2014 furthermore a small number of acyclic and aliphatic chemicals in total 17 chemicals were present in clusters 2 3 and 4 which were therefore also excluded from further analyses since they are unlikely to confirm to the same applicability domain as aromatic chemicals therefore only aromatic chemicals 103 chemicals were considered for further model development 2 4 dataset splitting cluster analysis in general revealed that figure si 3 regardless of the number of observed clusters the distance between different clusters for simple aromatic chemicals i e clusters 1 2 and 3 were closer to each other as compared to the cluster for poly aromatic chemicals i e cluster 4 we decided to develop qsbr models for simple aromatic chemicals and poly aromatic chemicals separately and also a combined model for all aromatic chemicals after discarding cluster 1 and other structurally dissimilar chemicals mentioned in section 2 3 the selected aromatic chemicals were classified into three groups see tables si 2 tables si 3 and tables si 4 i group 1 simple aromatic chemicals with one aromatic ring 69 chemicals from clusters 2 and 3 ii group 2 poly aromatic chemicals 34 chemicals from cluster 4 and iii group 3 all aromatic chemicals group 1 group 2 103 chemicals each group was analysed as a separate dataset for qsbr modelling it should be noted that each cluster was not used as a separate dataset for qsbr model development as it was unlikely to confirm to the same applicability domain due the presence of chemicals with structural dissimilarities furthermore simple aromatic chemicals formed two clusters and would have required two different models despite showing some similarity firstly principal component analysis pca was used for each group to identify any outliers that could affect the robustness and fitness of the model gramatica et al 2013 pirhadi et al 2015 this analysis also aided in selecting training and validation sets subsequently the random by response approach sorting chemicals by ordering them according to increasing decreasing order of end point value was applied to split the chemicals into training and validation sets mikolajczyk et al 2015 to perform splitting the third chemical from the sorted chemical list was selected from the set as a first validation chemical subsequently every third chemical if possible was selected from the sorted list as a validation chemical the remaining chemicals formed the training set the chemical with the highest and the lowest biodegradation rates were included in the training set to guarantee that the prediction set spanned the entire range of the experimental measurements and was numerically representative of the dataset the final qsbr model for group 1 group 2 and group 3 were developed with 60 tables si 2 28 tables si 3 and 84 tables si 4 chemicals respectively 2 5 qsbr model development and validation qsarins software version 2 0 gramatica et al 2013 was used to develop a qsbr model for the split dataset using multiple linear regression mlr techniques in mlr the endpoint yi is described with the best combination of the most relevant auto scaled descriptors used as independent variables x1 x2 xn as follows 1 y i b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b n x n where b0 is the intercept and b1 b2 bn are the regression coefficients it has to be noted that the two step approach involving clustering i e hca and activity prediction i e mlr are two distinct and independent steps used for different purposes both from molecular descriptors this approach is recommended when qsar models need to be developed from datasets having large number of chemicals with diverse structure he and jurs 2005 initially dragon descriptors i e 2459 descriptors were used to develop qsbr models for the three groups defined in section 2 4 the best combination of the most relevant descriptors was selected using the genetic algorithm ga pavan and worth 2008 gramatica et al 2013 incorporated in qsrins this technique allows identification of the best solution i e helps to search the best combination of descriptors by maximizing or minimizing a selected fitness function in this study q2 loo cross validated coefficient used to evaluate the model s performance in predictions was selected as a fitness function fig 1 summarizes the detailed methodological steps performed during qsbr model development the best models developed by qsarins were sorted using fitting r2 si eq 1 and rmsetr si eq 2 and robustness q2 loo si eq 3 and rmsecv si eq 4 criteria correlation coefficient r2 and the root mean square error of calibration rmsetr were used as measures of the goodness of fit for the developed model puzyn et al 2009 cross validated coefficient q2 loo leave one out method and root mean square error of cross validation rmsecv were used to verify its stability and robustness puzyn et al 2009 for details please refer to the si the internally optimized stable and robust models were further evaluated for their external predictive power with chemicals not used in the model building process using different external validation parameters like q2 f1 eq 5 si q2 f2 eq 6 si q2 f3 eq 7 si and root mean square error of prediction rmsep eq 8 chirico and gramatica 2011 these are predictive squared correlation coefficients and for details please refer to the si in addition the applicability domain of the finally selected model was assessed by the leverage approach and using the williams graph roy et al 2011 a plot of leverage values h versus standardized residuals that generally identifies the structural outliers x outliers those having leverage value greater than critical h value and the residual outliers y outliers those with predicted response value above the user defined standardized residual limit the critical h value h is calculates as h 3 p 1 n where p is the number of model predictors and n is the number of objects training chemicals used to calculate the model the leverage value h i is calculated from the molecular descriptors included in the model and estimated according to equation 9 si after identifying the best model with three dragon descriptors for group1 chemicals an attempt was made to develop new models that incorporated an additional five quantum mechanical descriptors and seven other descriptors describing different physicochemical and structural properties of chemicals 15 descriptors tables si 6 these descriptors were those that pertained to electronic properties and functional groups within the chemical which have been shown to influence the biodegradation of a chemical pitter and chudoba 1990 nolte and ragas 2017 the quantum mechanical descriptors were calculated at the semi empirical level of theory with the use of pm7 method implemented in mopac software stewart 1994 2007 whereas other descriptors were obtained from different online databases pitter and chudoba 1990 ballabio et al 2009 lee and von gunten 2012 a similar approach as described above was used for model development 3 result and discussion 3 1 qsbr models table 1 provides the overall summary of the best model for each set of chemical groups the qsbr model for the simple aromatic chemicals equation 4 was better than the other two models for complex equation 3 and aromatic chemicals equation 2 as indicated by higher values for r2 q2 loo q2 f1 q2 f2 and q2 f3 the applicability domain of all three models was evaluated by a williams plot fig 2 group 1 and figure si 4 si 5 group 2 3 the williams plots verified the absence of outliers residual values y i y ˆ i were within the limits 3 times standard deviation and showed good applicability of the model for the prediction of the biodegradation rates for all of the studied aromatic chemicals in addition none of the structures of the studied aromatic chemicals were substantially different from the training set chemicals showing a leverage value h i h h g r o u p 1 0 30 h g r o u p 2 0 5 and h g r o u p 3 0 206 proving the applicability of this model for untested aromatic chemicals with calculated h i values lower than the critical value h however it has to be noted that h i values were estimated using equation 9 si which does not take into account structural variability or differences other than those expressed by the selected descriptors therefore the applicability of the model in its actual form is restricted to chemicals which have structural similarities to those used for the training set and should not be employed in prediction of structurally different chemicals e g structural differences in group 1 chemicals are mostly due to different substituent patterns on the mono aromatic ring and the model for group 1 should not be employed in prediction for poly aromatic chemicals the molecular descriptors provide information on specific physicochemical or structural characteristics of the chemical and the ability to interpret the encoded value of the descriptors provide information on the molecular features that are most likely to effect the biological activity of studied chemical todeschini and consonni 2008 however when using an extensive matrix of molecular descriptors the mechanistic interpretation of the endpoint of interest may not always provide useful or easily interpretable information this is evident in the current study as the descriptors associated with qsbr models for chemical datasets belonging to group 2 and group 3 are relatively abstract molecular descriptors of molecular geometry stereochemistry conformational index 2d finger printing and fragments counts while for group 1 the descriptors are for hydrophobic electronic steric size and shape properties of chemical and can be more easily interpreted with respect to offering rational explanations of their affect on biodegradation therefore in upcoming sections the qsbr model for simple aromatic chemicals were principally focused up on evaluating the model in terms of different model parameters defining its applicability domain and providing an underlying understanding between the biodegradation rate and the molecular descriptors associated with the model furthermore an attempt was made to improve the existing model by incorporating some other common descriptors specifically associated with biodegradation of chemicals namely quantum mechanical hydrophobic steric and electronic descriptors tables si 6 3 2 qsbr model for simple aromatic chemicals group 1 table 3 provides the summary statistics for the three descriptor based qsbr model for simple aromatic chemicals equation 4 table 1 there was no significant inter correlation pearson correlation coefficient p value 0 05 between the three descriptors tables si 7 this model showed high stability r2 0 8924 robustness q2 loo 0 8718 and external predictive ability q2 f1 0 8829 q2 f2 0 8835 and q2 f3 0 9178 the plots of the experimental versus predicted values fig 3 a and b showed very good agreement between biowin3 derived first order biodegradation rates and the model predicted values of biodegradation rate for 60 aromatic chemicals for both training and validation sets slopes of 0 89 likewise model predicted half life and biowin3 derived half life also showed good agreement slope of 0 96 in addition the plots confirmed the predictive capability of the developed model after identifying the best three dragon descriptors nn narx and mor08u a further 12 descriptors were included in the dataset to develop new models using the same approach tables si 6 the summary of the best 10 models based on 4 descriptors is reported in table 2 all the models were robust 89 8 r2 93 1 and stable 86 9 q loo 2 91 1 and have good predictive ability 85 6 q2ext 95 8 in addition all the descriptors from the developed models provide interpretable and possible mechanistic insights into the model as these descriptors are related to electronic steric and lipophilic properties of chemicals biodegradation of a chemical has been shown to be influenced by electronic and lipophilic properties along with functional groups within the chemical parsons and govers 1990 cvetnic et al 2017 3 3 qsbr model descriptors and their interpretation in relation to biodegradation rates in this study a simple linear regression model developed result not shown for group 1 chemicals using substituent constant σ which quantitatively examines the inductive and resonance effect of substituents on the biodegradation rate had poor fitting and stability r2 0 173 recently authors have suggested using a combination of different categories of descriptors e g quantum chemical topological constitutional for improved qsar performance in order to predict biological activity e g biodegradation rates mamy et al 2015 cvetnic et al 2017 the type number and position of substitutions on the aromatic ring are important parameters that determine the topological and electronic characteristics of aromatic chemicals and ultimately influence the degree and rate of biodegradation the information provided by the descriptors substituent constant σ nn narx and mor08u used in this study is in agreement with the effect of substitutions in the aromatic ring as follows mor08u is an un weighted morse molecular representations of structure based on electron diffraction descriptors with scattering parameter s 7 å 1 and calculated according to equation 10 si the calculated values of different morse descriptors for chemicals are based on their structural features where distance among the different atoms within a molecule will be the principal means to separate the molecule from others devinyak et al 2014 when qsar models are developed for a structurally similar group of chemicals the difference in the value of 3d morse descriptor is due to several neighbouring atom pairs in the molecule devinyak et al 2014 the differences in these descriptor values result in different physicochemical properties for the monoaromatic chemicals attributable to differences in the number type and position of substituents on the aromatic ring which in turn affect the biodegradation rate this interpretation is in agreement with results previously published in the literature sikarwar and dixit 2012 where an individual qsar model was used to predict the molar refractivity partition coefficient and polarizability of 34 phenolic chemicals using 3d morse descriptors and eigen values respectively number of nitrogen nn and halogen atoms in aromatic chemical narx the biodegradability of a molecule is influenced by electronic inductive and mesomeric steric and lipophilic properties of a molecular system pitter and chudoba 1990 in particular the type number and position of substituent groups present in the aromatic molecule strongly determine the electronic characteristics of that molecule both electronic inductive and mesomeric effects are responsible for attraction or repulsion of electrons affecting the electron density in the reaction centre the presence of halogen and nitrogen atoms in the aromatic system will contribute to deplete the electron density of the reaction system in biodegradation reactions the initial attack on the aromatic ring is mostly assumed to be electrophilic in nature therefore the presence of electron attracting elements like halogens f cl br i and nitrogen cn no2 nh3 conh2 deactivate the aromatic ring in certain positions for attack by oxygenases and results in a lower biodegradation rate pitter and chudoba 1990 3 4 mechanism of aerobic biodegradation the most practical and useful approach to qsbrs is to relate biodegradation rate data to molecular descriptors specifically providing relevant information on potential mechanisms of the biodegradation rate limiting process furthermore biodegradation rates are believed to be a function of the rate of a series of processes that occurs in a stepwise manner parsons and govers 1990 extracellular enzymes initiate microbial mineralization of organic matter by hydrolyzing substrates to sizes sufficiently small to be transported across cell membranes they then diffuse through the cytoplasm to reach the enzyme where the biodegradation reaction is initiated arnosti 2011 subsequently enzyme induction occurs which ultimately results in the binding of the metabolic enzyme and the chemical followed by transformation of the chemical by that enzyme parsons and govers 1990 wammer and peters 2005 the transport of chemicals across the microbial membrane can occur either via active transport mechanisms or passive diffusion an active transport mechanism is mostly involved in efflux and has little significant influence on biodegradation rate parsons and govers 1990 it has been shown that the transport of polyaromatic hydrocarbons pahs across the microbial membrane generally occurs via the passive diffusion processes in some pah degrading bacteria bugg et al 2000 furthermore uptake via passive transport tends to correlate with the descriptors that normally describe the hydrophobicity of the chemicals such as logp octanol water partition coefficient polarizability or molar refraction 3d morse banerjee et al 1984 parsons and govers 1990 mamy et al 2015 suggesting diffusion of a chemical through the cytoplasm is an important step in biodegradation the structure of chemicals also likely controls the process of metabolic enzyme induction subsequent binding of the chemical to enzymes and transformation of the chemical parsons and govers 1990 the relationship between biodegradability of aromatic chemicals and molecular descriptors associated with the structure of chemicals are discussed in several papers wolfe et al 1980 okey and stensel 1996 more specifically in mono aromatics the number position and type of substituent are associated with electronic properties of the chemicals and influence their biodegradability pitter and chudoba 1990 in such chemicals aerobic biotransformation is generally initiated with the addition of molecular oxygen to the aromatic ring i e hydroxylation by oxygenase or dioxygenase enzymes pitter and chudoba 1990 peijnenburg 1994 followed by aromatic ring cleavage hydroxylation of the aromatic ring with subsequent ring cleavage is followed by an electrophilic substitution which are considered as the rate determining steps pitter and chudoba 1990 the presence of certain substituent groups increases the electron density of the aromatic ring and accelerates the biodegradation process nitrogen and halogenic substituents strongly deplete the electron density of the aromatic ring decreasing the rate of biodegradation as compared to degradation of aromatic chemicals with other substituents e g oh cho ch3 this effect was demonstrated by several authors alexander and lustigman 1966 vuono et al 2016 cvetnic et al 2017 where they showed retarded biodegradation rates of mono and di substituted benzene by microorganisms with chloro nitro and sulfonate substituents whereas an increased rate was recorded in the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups the shape and size of chemicals plays an integral role during fitting of a chemical into the active site of the enzyme wammer and peters 2005 five descriptors in the current models mor08u molecular weight van der waal volume and valence connectivity index vx2 and vx1 are general size and shape descriptors the association of these descriptors with biodegradation rate indicates that the steric properties of aromatic chemicals have a significant role to play in the biodegradation process several qsar models relating biological activity and the molecular descriptors associated with steric properties have been developed elsewhere koch 1982 paris et al 1982 okey and stensel 1996 ceriani et al 2015 3d morse descriptor like mor08u which is weighted by electrotopological states combines both electronic and topological characteristics of atoms or molecules and plays an influential role in determining the biodegradability of aromatic chemicals ceriani et al 2015 in most chemical reactions an energy barrier exists and it must be surmounted for the reaction to occur thus kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are integral in explaining the observed differences in biodegradation in addition thermodynamic feasibility is also considered as an important metric to evaluate the potential of a biodegradation reaction finley et al 2009 two descriptors electronic energy and total energy of a molecule are quantum mechanical descriptors and generally provide information of energy associated with a chemical the relationship between the biodegradability of aromatic chemicals and descriptors associated with the energy of molecules are discussed in several papers wammer and peters 2005 yang et al 2006 total energy toe of a molecule is the sum of total energy of all electrons e el and repulsion energy between atomic nuclei e n u c n u c in a molecule stewart 1994 5 t o e e e l e n u c n u c electronic energy e el is the sum of repulsion energy between electrons and the attraction energy between electron and atomic nuclei according to molecular orbital theory the total electronic energy is directly associated with total energies of the individual occupied molecular orbitals which also provides the information of total bond energy in a molecule karelson et al 1996 petrucci et al 1997 this suggests that the higher the total energy the higher the total bond energy of a molecule thus the molecule with higher total bond energy has strong attraction between electrons and the atomic nuclei this implies that high energy is required to degrade such a molecule therefore when an aromatic chemical has higher total energy they are more resistant to degradation 3 5 implications for predicting biodegradation half lives for fate and hazard assessment real world chemical half lives in different environment compartments are essential for the reliable risk assessment of chemicals yet accurate datasets providing information on half lives are lacking several researchers have attempted to convert biowin output into half lives and ultimately into rates gouin et al 2004 arnot et al 2005 aronson et al 2006 which allows the prioritization of chemicals according to their relatively biodegradabilities even if the absolute rates may be inaccurate we recognize that accurate prediction of half lives or rates with a model can only be reliably achieved by training the model with actually measured half lives or rates rücker and kümmerer 2012 nevertheless in the absence of such a dataset we have developed a qsbr models to predict half lives of 60 aromatic chemicals and made a comparison between the rates predicted in this study figure si 2 and the rates predicted with the model developed by arnot et al 2005 arnot et al 2005 who developed a simple linear regression model by correlating the biowin outputs and experimental aqueous aerobic half lives there was a significant correlation between the first order rates estimated with the aforementioned model and the first order rates used in this study univariate regression analysis r2 0 99 p value 0 05 however the applicability domain of the model was uncertain and the model failed to provide any insights into the principles underlying biodegradation while our models does nevertheless this observed correlation not only suggests that the qsbr model predictions are stable but also provides a framework for evaluating the persistence of chemicals that are within the model applicability domain regulatory frameworks have put much emphasis on identification and prioritization of chemicals based on their environmental hazardous properties i e persistence bioaccumulation and toxicity pbt rather than on their environmental risk alone martin et al 2017b furthermore their guidance also recommends that persistence assessment of chemicals should be performed prior to bioaccumulation and toxicity assessments in order to avoid unnecessary animal tests the latter should be carried out only when the chemical is assigned as potentially persistent echa 2017 half lives are the commonly used end point in the regulatory assessment of persistence rücker and kümmerer 2012 echa 2017 martin et al 2017b the qsbr models for simple aromatic chemicals developed here has been shown to correctly predict and interpret respectively half lives and the affect of chemical parameters on biodegradation of chemicals based on their previous biodegradability classification obtained from biowin3 these models also enabled the generation of first order biodegradation rates of chemicals on the other hand the models developed in this study are unable to provide any information on metabolites and transformation products in addition they also ignore other natural degradation or removal processes such as photolytic degradation and sorption 4 conclusions qsbr models for simple aromatic chemicals were robust appear reliable and can be more easily interpreted with respect to potential mechanistic explanations of their affect on biodegradation than the models for two other groups of chemicals developed in this study this is a first proof of principle step showing that qsbr models can be an alternative approach to expensive laboratory tests both in screening for and making definitive classifications in persistence assessments of chemicals in this instance for mono aromatic chemicals the derived qsbr model needs further validation and calibration using experimentally determined biodegradation rates however a similar approach to that used here could prove useful in deriving accurate qsbrs for other classes of chemicals declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence

18853,in this study indirect electrochemical reduction with zero valent titanium zvt as anode successfully achieved the selective nitrate removal from simulated groundwater the maximum nitrate removal efficiency and n2 selectivity reached to 83 4 and 78 5 after 12 h respectively experimental results demonstrated that the gaseous by products no and n2o were negligible and the nitrate reduction process could be well depicted by pseudo first order kinetic model decreasing the ph value of electrolyte was favorable to electrical energy utilization efficiency and nitrate removal the chloride ultimately showed inhibitory effects on electrochemical reduction of nitrate during the electrochemical reaction the zvt lost electrons to generate the reducing agents ti3 and ti2 which could afford electrons for nitrate reduction and form the solid by products tio2 4cl0 2n0 1 a 2 stage strategy indirect electrochemical reduction hypochlorite treatment pre reduction post oxidation was developed to completely remove nitrate and the long term performance of nitrate reduction was comprehensively evaluated the effluent nitrate steadily kept at 8 8 mg n l during 120 h continuous operation when the influent nitrate concentration was 25 9 mg n l simultaneously nitrite concentration was lower than 0 01 mg n l and ammonium and ti ions were not detected in the effluent graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate removal zero valent titanium zvt indirect electrochemical reduction essential reaction parameters by products 1 introduction in china the eutrophication and algae bloom in surface water become increasingly serious because of extensive discharge of wastewaters containing nitrate no3 from agricultural production animal husbandry and industrial production marchesini et al 2008 xie et al 2011 excessive nitrate also may have adverse effects to human health as it can be turned into nitrite no2 in the human body and then lead to methaemoglobinaemia nitrite is considered as the precursor of potential stomach cancer carcinogens such as n nitroso compounds gao et al 2003 lundberg et al 2004 thus the united states environmental protection agency us epa and world health organization who declares that the maximum contaminant levels mcl of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water should be under 10 0 and 1 0 mg n l respectively united states environmental protection agency 1991 world health organization 2011 however the concentration of nitrate is even higher than 30 mg n l in some groundwater sahli et al 2008 therefore the conversion of nitrate to non toxic gaseous nitrogen n2 without other by products such as nitrite and ammonium has drawn considerable attention the most frequently used methods to eliminate the nitrate contamination in water can be fallen into five categories 1 physical separation primo et al 2009 schoeman and steyn 2003 2 biological denitrification chen et al 2013 2014 2015 li et al 2014 zhong et al 2016a 3 chemical reduction bao et al 2017 4 catalytic hydrogenation durkin et al 2017 and 5 electrochemical reduction dash and chaudhari 2005 fan et al 2017 su et al 2017 however these methods have more or less some drawbacks in the real application for instance the cost of physical separation usually is expensive because additional treatments are required to dispose the second pollutants for example the high salt concentrate from the reverse osmosis and ion exchange processes biological denitrification is a cheap and effective method for nitrate removal but it maybe bring the possible bacterial and residual organic contamination simultaneously some complicated operations are required to maintain the bacterial activities high performance catalytic hydrogenation for nitrate reduction needs continuous external supply of reducing agent h2 obviously there are great explosion risk for the transportation and storage of h2 recently electrochemical reduction of nitrate has received increasing interest for its high selectivity convenience safety and eco friendly dash and chaudhari 2005 however its application is limited due to the generation of detrimental by products such as nitrite and ammonium nh4 in general nitrate can be reduced on the cathode during electrochemical reduction process an effective and selective catalytic electrode usually plays a significant role in the electrochemical removal of nitrate the promoter metal sn in cu can only convert nitrate to nitrite in order to further catalytically reduce nitrite to nitrogen oxides nox n2 and nh4 the noble meal pd is necessary therefore plenty of bimetallic cathode electrodes pd sn pd in pd cu have been employed in electrochemical reduction of nitrate jung et al 2014 shuai et al 2015 wang et al 2006 nevertheless the synthesis of these bimetallic electrodes is complicated and needs strict conditions meanwhile the noble metal as catalytic electrode will significantly raise the costs of wastewater treatment it is urgent to explore a common and cheap electrode for completely reducing nitrate titanium ti is the fourth most abundant metal on earth and an ordinary industrial material which can be obtained at reasonable price ma and his co worker found that 94 6 nitrate was reduced through electrochemical reduction with an efficient nano titanium electrode ente as the cathode ma et al 2016 they attributed the high efficiency to the regular reticulate nanostructure of ente however the electrocatalytic reduction ability of ti cathode is poor due to the formation of compact titanium oxide on the surface of cathode wang and lin amazedly discovered that nitrate could also be reduced by multivalent ti species ti2 and ti3 derived from the corrosion of ti anode instead of the direct electrochemical reduction on the traditional cathode wang et al 2009 however the detailed mechanisms of direct indirect electrochemical reduction on ti electrodes are unknown for example what roles does the indirect electrochemical reduction on ti anode play what are essential operational factors affected the nitrate reduction and are there detrimental by products gas and solid produced especially when this process is applied in drinking water and groundwater treatment chloride cl a common anion in water can be oxidized to chlorine cl2 on the anode surface cl2 can further react with water to generate oxidizing hypochlorite ion clo which can oxidize nh4 and no2 to n2 and no3 respectively besides the presence of cl can significantly affect the process of metal corrosion to produce metal ions kim et al 2006 liang and liu 2009 lee et al 2011 yang et al 2016 therefore in this research the influences of essential operational factors including current density initial nitrate concentration initial ph and initial chloride concentration on the electrochemical reduction of nitrate and selectivity for n2 generation with zero valent titanium zvt as the anode were investigated the pseudo first order kinetic model was employed to evaluate the nitrate reduction process to amply explain the reaction mechanism the corrosion current density of zvt was examined by the potentiodynamic polarization method the solid by products were gathered and analyzed by scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps furthermore the possible gaseous nitrogen oxides n2o and no were analyzed by gas chromatography and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride spectrophotometric method respectively 2 experimental section 2 1 electrochemical

electrolytic cell with magnetic stirring 600 rpm zvt sheet with an effective geometric surface area of 5 cm2 1 cm 5 cm was used as the anode and cathode in the undivided electrolytic cell the distance

a constant current density imposed by a dc power supply atten pps3005t 3s china 3 ml of solution was taken regularly from the electrolytic cell to determine the concentration of nitrite nitrate ammonium and chloride moreover the solid by products was collected by filtration thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried at 333 k under vacuum to completely remove nitrate and assess the long term performance of nitrate reduction 2 stage treatment process was designed in a continuous flow mode the influent nitrate concentration set as 25 9 mg n l and ph was 7 2 fig s1 in stage 1 pre

method using 10 mv increments of potential with a scanning range 800 to 1800 mv a saturated calomel electrode a pt sheet effective geometric surface area 1 0 cm2 and a zvt sheet effective geometric surface area 0 4 cm2 served as the reference counter and working electrode respectively in this study the generation of the no and n2o were negligible herein the nitrate reduction r n o 3 total

t n a d s is the amount of adsorbed tn mg n l during the reaction table s1 generally nitrate and intermediates ammonium and nitrite could be adsorbed by the produced solid co products tio2 s however the produced amount of ammonium and nitrite was far less than that of the added nitrate therefore the t n a d s is approximately equal to the adsorption amount of nitrate n o 3 a d s eq 4 by tio2 s in

bubbles were observed on the both electrode due to the generation of oxygen o2 on anode and hydrogen h2 on cathode 2h2o o2 2h2 the bubbles on the zvt anode surface largely diminished after 30 min as the pitting and crevice corrosion began fig s2 eqs 7 and 8 7 ti 2 e t i 2 8 ti 3 e t i 3 however gas evolution on the cathode continued for the whole experiment the distributions of nitrate nitrite ammonium and n2 with reaction time were presented in fig 1 a it could be found that nitrate decreased rapidly from 25 9 to 7 7 mg n l within 12 h nitrite and ammonium all increased firstly and then decreased indicating that nitrite and ammonium were the intermediates for indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate fig 1b showed that most of nitrate was directly reduced to n2 70 0 and a small amount transformed to nitrite 11 8 and ammonium 6 0 significantly 12 2 of nitrate was adsorbed on the solid by products tio2 table s1 exp 2 as discussed above the direct or indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate may simultaneously happen on cathode and anode electrode respectively nevertheless the contribution that nitrate reduced by the cathode is unclear in order to ascertain the role of zvt cathode in the electrochemical reduction process a dual chamber electrochemical reactor was designed using zvt and carbon rod as the cathode and anode respectively which were separated by a proton exchange nafion 117 dupont as shown in fig s3 nitrate removal by zvt cathode was only 14 8 these results revealed that nitrate was mainly and indirectly reduced by the zvt anode in the reaction process which was obviously different from the conventional electro catalytic reduction through cathode ma et al 2016 in addition nitrate reduction may produce gaseous by products such as no and n2o the nitrate reduction experiments were carried out in a closed batch reactor to collect the gas sample however the content of no in the electrochemical reduction reactor was below the detection limits 1 0 mg l and n2o was 0 046 mg l suggesting that the nitrate was principally reduced to n2 70 0 in this system these results demonstrated that indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate using zvt was a potential technology for nitrate removal in water 3 2 effect of current density the redox reactions are greatly affected by the current density in the electrochemical reaction process a series of current density 0 6 2 0 4 0 6 0 ma cm2 were selected to determine the optimal current density for nitrate removal and the results were illustrated in fig 2 the nitrate removal efficiency gradually increased from 36 5 to 83 4 when the applied current density ranged from 0 6 to 6 0 ma cm2 similarly tn removal efficiency was only 27 3 at the current density 0 6 ma cm2 while it increased to 67 9 as the current density reached 6 0 ma cm2 meanwhile the electro reduction of nitrate was certified to follow the pseudo first order kinetic model table 1 and the corresponding reaction rate constant markedly increased from 0 03 h 1 at 0 6 ma cm2 to 0 15 h 1 at 6 0 ma cm2 the faraday s law indicates that the mass of the substance liberated at an electrode is in exact ratio to the number of electrons traveled through the electrode which well explained why higher current density resulted in more electrochemical transformation of nitrate in this study our previous research had proven that two electrochemical conversions were involved in the pitting corrosion process of zvt anode including electrochemical corrosion of zvt and electrochemical oxidation of external substances e g oh and cl on the zvt surface zhong et al 2016b thus higher current density accelerated the electrochemical corrosion of zvt and more ti ions reductive agents were produced resulting in the improvement of nitrate reduction the final nitrite slightly raised with increasing the current density however the final ammonium decreased from 1 1 to 0 3 mg n l by increasing the current density from 2 0 to 6 0 ma cm2 the greater the current density was the more the chlorine from the oxidization of chloride fig s4a and the corresponding generated hypochlorite was hypochlorite could oxidize ammonium to nitrite eqs 9 12 based on the variation of inorganic nitrogen nitrate nitrite ammonium and n2 during the electrochemical reduction process the energy utilization efficiency was estimated and the details were shown in supporting information as presented in fig 2b the energy utilization efficiency decreased from 49 0 to 11 5 as the current density increased from 0 6 to 6 0 ma cm2 the lower energy utilization efficiency at the high current density might be attributed to the electricity consumption for the oxidation of chloride and the electrolysis of water both considering of nitrate reduction and energy utilization efficiency 2 0 ma cm2 seemed the compromise value and was used for the following electrochemical reaction 9 2 cl 2 e cl 2 10 cl 2 h 2 o h cl hclo 11 hclo clo h 12 3 clo nh 4 no 2 3 cl h 2 o 2 h 3 3 effect of initial nitrate concentration fig 3 exhibited the effect of initial nitrate concentration on the nitrate reduction and the corresponding kinetic rate constant the nitrate removal efficiency decreased slightly with the initial nitrate concentration increasing from 14 9 to 35 4 mg n l correspondingly the rate constant decreased from 0 14 to 0 08 h 1 table 1 the result demonstrated that the electrochemical pitting corrosion rate of ti was similar under the same current density however the energy utilization efficiency and the absolute amount of no3 n removal improved with the increase of the initial nitrate concentration typically only 11 3 mg n l nitrate was removed when the initial nitrate concentration was 14 9 mg l but the removal efficiency was more than 75 though the removal efficiency was less than 60 21 8 mg n l was reduced when the initial nitrate concentration was 35 4 mg l these results further indicated that the more electrical energy could be used to remove nitrate under higher the initial concentration of nitrate and the electrical energy could be utilized more efficiently 3 4 effect of initial ph to discuss the impact of initial ph on indirect electrochemical nitrate reduction by zvt anode batch experiments were carried out at initial ph 4 0 7 2 and 10 0 and the results were presented in fig 5 the rate constant nitrate reduction efficiency tn removal and energy utilization efficiency all decreased slightly with increasing initial ph in the electrolytic cell the potentiodynamic polarization curves of zvt at different ph fig 4 a demonstrated that the corrosion current density of zvt increased from 1 11 to 1 52 μa cm2 as the ph decreased from 7 2 to 4 0 table s2 indicating that the zvt corrosion rate improved as the solution ph decreased thus the decrease of ph facilitated the formation of ti ions ti2 or and ti3 which were essential reduction agents for nitrate and nitrite reduction resulting in the improvement of nitrate removal and energy utilization efficiency it s interesting that the corrosion current density was very close between the ph at 7 2 and 10 0 table s2 but the nitrate removal and energy utilization efficiency at ph 10 0 were lower than those at ph 7 2 this could be attributed to the decrease of soluble ti ions due to the formation of black ti oh 3 s precipitate ti3 3oh ti oh 3 at higher ph it was worthy to notice that solution ph increased to 6 8 9 2 and 11 6 when the initial solution ph was 4 0 7 2 and 10 0 respectively it should ascribe that the hydrogen was generated during the whole reaction process which consumed plenty of h consequently decreasing the ph value of the electrolyte was favorable to electrical energy utilization and nitrate removal 3 5 effect of initial chloride concentration pitting corrosion is an in situ destruction of oxidation film where pits or holes are produced on the surface of metal it had been reported that the in situ destruction began through adsorption of aggressive anions on the deficient surface oxide film wang et al 2009 chloride is a common halide ion that can act in this way in this study the effects of initial chloride concentration on the zvt electro corrosion and electrochemical reduction of nitrate were investigated at initial chloride concentrations ranging from 12 to 220 mg l the potentiodynamic polarization curves of zvt at different chloride concentration fig 4b proved that the higher initial chloride concentration led to greater corrosion current density of zvt 1 11 μa cm2 at 12 mg l vs 1 65 μa cm2 at 220 mg l table s2 suggesting that the zvt corrosion became more easy at higher initial chloride concentration the pitting corrosion can produce reduction agents ti ions ti2 or and ti3 for nitrate reduction this meant that higher initial chloride concentration might be beneficial to the generation of reduction agents ti ions thereby promoting the nitrate reduction however this assumption was contrary to the experimental results in this work as shown in fig 6 the rate constant tn removal and nitrate removal efficiency decreased significantly when the initial chloride concentration increased from 12 to 220 mg l the nitrate reduction efficiency was 70 2 72 4 63 4 and 44 6 at initial chloride concentration 12 40 100 220 mg l and the corresponding rate constant was 0 12 0 09 0 08 and 0 03 h 1 respectively furthermore the final nitrite and ammonium slightly decreased as the initial chloride concentration increased as presented in fig s4b the chloride concentration decreased to 8 6 29 4 71 7 and 199 5 mg l after reaction when the initial chloride concentration was 12 40 100 and 220 mg l respectively the reduced chloride might be oxidized to generate cl2 on the surface of zvt anode and adsorbed by the solid by products the generated cl2 further reacted with h2o to form hypochlorite which could oxidize nitrite and ammonium to nitrate eqs 13 and 15 and also directly oxidize ammonium to n2 eq 14 so the final nitrite and ammonium in solution decreased in addition the formed hypochlorite might react with ti ions ti2 and ti3 to generate tio2 s eqs 16 and 17 the less ti ions ti2 and ti3 may be the reason for the worse nitrate removal to verify this viewpoint the control experiments were performed by adding sodium hypochlorite in the electrochemical reaction process and direct nitrate reduction using ti3 with different concentration of hypochlorite and the details were provided in supporting information as displayed in fig s5a the nitrate reduction efficiency decreased from 47 1 to 14 3 with the hypochlorite concentration increasing from 20 to 500 mg l the direct chemical reduction of nitrate using ti3 was also significantly inhibited by the hypochlorite fig s5b indicating that the ti ions could react with hypochlorite in addition with the initial chloride concentration improving energy utilization efficiency decreased fig 6b since most of electrical energy was wasted in hypochlorite production through chloride oxidation at high chloride concentration these results suggested that the chloride ultimately showed inhibitory effects on indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate by zvt anode 13 4 clo nh 4 n o 3 4 cl 2 h h 2 o 14 2 n h 4 3 c l o n 2 3 h 2 o 3 c l 2 h 15 clo no 2 n o 3 cl 16 clo t i 2 h 2 o tio 2 s cl 2 h 17 clo 2 t i 3 3 h

initial chloride concentration based on the slope of the linear correlation model the effect of reaction conditions on nitrate reduction rate constant increased in the order initial chloride concentration initial ph initial nitrate concentration current density the results indicated that the current density showed maximum impact on indirect electrochemical nitrate reduction among these reaction conditions 3 6 reaction mechanism the mechanism of the indirect electrochemical nitrate reduction using zvt anode was illustrated in fig 7 several control and analysis experiments sem eds xps and uv vis were executed to validate it as shown in fig 8 a except for the irregular polygonal cracking the surface of raw zvt electrode was bright white because it was polished when the zvt electrode was polarized by additional voltage 8 5 v the tight membrane fig 8b was formed within 30 min before corrosion developed however the numerous irregular micro porous were generated on the zvt surface and edge after the reaction fig 8c these changes suggested that the behavior of zvt corrosion was the holes and spots corrosion the eds analysis showed that there was only ti element to be observed in the zvt before reaction fig 8d but o n s and cl peaks were detected after reaction 30 min due to the adsorption of nitrate chloride and sulfate fig 8e besides two peaks at 399 5 and 406 6 ev appeared in the xps spectra of n1 s of zvt anode after reaction 30 min fig 5i implying the presence of nitrate these results revealed that the adsorption of nitrate onto the zvt surface was the first step for nitrate removal because of the positive charge resulted from the polarized anode 0 01 mg l of ti ions was detected after reaction 1 h indicating that the pitting and holes corrosion of zvt began and multivalent ti ions ti2 and ti3 produced eqs 1 and 2 ti2 and ti3 as strong reductants can closely combine with oxygen and quickly offer electrons for the reduction of oxyanion ions thus this process was considered as an activated process for zvt and a reaction determining step for nitrate reduction the ti ions metal center could associate with nitrate forming the complex during the reduction process amadei and earley 2001 the complex served as an intermediate and facilitated electrons and oxygen atoms transfer eoat resulting in the nitrate reduction and nitrite generation eqs 18 and 19 following the similar pathway nitrite could also pair with ti ions and get electrons hence nitrate was reduced through the eoat process to sequentially produce nitrite ammonium n2o and n2 eqs 18 25 18

ti ions were oxidized to tio2 s in the eoat process as they provided electrons and acquired oxygen atoms for nitrate reduction eqs 19 21 23 and 25 in order to further verify this mechanism the direct reactions between nitrate and ti3 were performed through adding ti3 into the nitrate solution and the details were listed in supporting information fig s7 showed that the uv vis absorption peak of tio2 was not observed before the ti3 adding then the absorbance of tio2 peak was detected reaction 20 and 60 min while that of ti3 peak decreased from 0 05 to 0 02 meanwhile 74 3 nitrate was reduced data not shown these results implied that nitrate was reduced through accepting the electron from ti3 and concurrently ti3 was oxidized to tio2 s eq 19 it could be concluded that the roles of ti ions were to 1 coordinate to nitrate 2 transfer electron for nitrate reduction and 3 facilitate tio2 s formation in the eoat process the percentage of nitrite and ammonium increased from 0 to 11 2 and 6 9 reaction 8 h and then decreased to 8 4 and 4 2 at reaction end fig 1a respectively suggesting that a part of ammonium was further oxidized to nitrate and n2 and a part of nitrite was also oxidized to nitrate by the generated hypochlorite eqs 13 15 furthermore 1 5 mg n l nitrate was adsorbed by tio2 powder in 12 h table s1 exp 2 indicating that the nitrate could be adsorbed by the generation of solid by products in the reaction sem eds and xps were used to analyze the morphology and characteristics of the solid by products produced in the electrochemical reaction as presented in fig 8f several peaks of eds represented ti o n and cl and their atomic ratio was 23 48 56 63 3 30 and 5 31 respectively the xps survey spectra of cl 2p displayed two clear peaks at 197 7 and 199 4 ev which belonged to chloride and corrosion products fretted in nacl fig 8h respectively yao et al 2016 fig 8i showed that there were two obvious peaks at 399 9 and 406 6 ev corresponding to nitrate in the xps survey spectra of n 1s these results revealed that the n and cl elements presented in the solid by products in addition it has been reported that the ti 2p 3 2 and ti 2p 1 2 peaks of the pure p25 tio2 were at 453 8 and 458 7 ev respectively wang et al 2009 however in this study the xps spectra of ti 2p for the pure tio2 exhibited three peaks at 453 1 457 9 and 463 6 ev fig 8g the difference should ascribe to the adsorption of nitrogen or other elements in the analysis process however the ti 2p 3 2 and ti 2p 1 2 peaks changed from 453 1 to 458 3 ev and 457 9 to 464 3 ev respectively for the solid by products versus p25 tio2 powder the peak gap also increased from 4 8 to 6 0 ev results expressly suggested that the n and cl elements were adsorbed and doped into the solid by products forming tio2 4cl0 2n0 1 eqs 26 and 27 26 2 ti 2 0 2 no 3 0 4 cl 1 7 h 2 o o 2 ti 2 o 4 3 cl 0 4 n 0 2 s 3 4 h 27 2 ti 3 0 2 no 3 0 4 cl 2 7 h 2 o o 2 ti 2 o 5 3 cl 0 4 n 0 2 s 5 4 h 3 7 2 stage treatment strategy for complete nitrate removal as aforementioned above most of nitrate 70 2 was successfully reduced with higher selectivity for n2 70 0 through the indirect electrochemical reduction by zvt anode however a small quantity of nitrite 2 0 mg n l and ammonium 1 0 mg n l were inevitably produced compared with nitrate nitrite shows more harmful for human health in general hypochlorite can stably and effectively oxidize nitrite and ammonium to nitrate and n2 respectively jung et al 2014 herein the post treatment of nitrite and ammonium with hypochlorite was investigated as a sequential treatment strategy to completely convert nitrate into n2 fig s1 as showed in fig 9 a the residual nitrate remained nearly 6 5 mg n l within 12 108 h and then progressively increased to 8 4 mg n l after 120 h in 1 stage n2 selectivity varied in the range of 67 2 74 3 during the continuous operation process nevertheless the nitrite and ammonium concentration stabilized at 1 8 and 1 2 mg n l respectively the chloride concentration also decreased to 8 5 mg l these results suggested that it was necessary to further removal of residual nitrite and ammonium after indirect electrochemical reduction reaction at the 2 stage treatment experiments hypochlorite was added into the effluent from the electrochemical reactor and the reaction time was designed as 8 h owing to the oxidation of hypochlorite eqs 13 15 the effluent ammonium was not observed and nitrite decreased to 0 01 mg n l fig 9b although the effluent nitrate increased to 8 8 mg n l it was still lower than the standard reported by who 10 mg n l nitrate in drinking water meanwhile the ti ion concentration was below the detection limit of icp oes 0 001 mg l the chloride concentration increased to 27 2 mg l mainly sodium chloride after oxidation reaction which was far lower than the taste thresholds for chloride anion 200 300 mg l for sodium potassium and calcium chloride in drinking water stipulated by who world health organization 2011 and was almost equaled to the total added chlorine 29 0 mg l indicating that the added hypochlorite was completely converted into chloride through the reduction eqs 13 15 and photolysis 2 clo 2 h 2 hcl o 2 photolysis these results implied 2 stage treatment strategy had greatly potential for complete transformation of nitrate into n2 in groundwater compared with conventional physical treatment banu and meenakshi 2017 mazarji et al 2017 biological denitrification ovez et al 2006 chemical reduction bao et al 2017 catalytic reduction guo et al 2017 hamid et al 2016 jung et al 2014 martínez et al 2017 and traditional electrocatalytic reduction teng et al 2017 martínez et al 2017 indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate by zvt anode displayed great advantages in term of operation convenience material cost and complete transformation of nitrate into n2 table s3 4 conclusions the presence of inorganic nitrogen such as ammonium nitrate and nitrite in water whose sum usually are described as the total nitrogen tn can lead to potential environmental threats like methemoglobinemia and eutrophication thus not only nitrate removal but also tn removal needs to be concerned during the nitrate reduction the indirect electrochemical reduction was adapted to investigate electrochemical reduction of nitrate in simulated groundwater in the work the maximum nitrate and tn removal efficiency and n2 selectivity reached to 83 4 68 7 and 78 5 respectively the effects of essential reaction parameters including initial nitrate concentration current density initial ph and initial chloride concentration on the nitrate reduction were evaluated although nitrate and tn removal was improved by increasing current density the energy utilization efficiency was lower at higher current density the nitrate removal increased from 11 3 to 21 8 mg n l as the initial nitrate concentration increased from 14 9 to 35 4 mg n l decreasing the ph value of electrolyte was favorable to the energy utilization and nitrate removal the chloride ultimately showed inhibitory effects on electrochemical reduction of nitrate on zvt anode the nitrate reduction process could be well depicted by pseudo first order kinetic model with r2 ranging from 0 92 to 0 99 meanwhile the mechanism for indirect electrochemical nitrate reduction using zvt anode was comprehensively verified and discussed a novel 2 stage treatment strategy indirect electrochemical reduction hypochlorite treatment pre reduction post oxidation was developed and achieved effective tn removal 66 0 and high n2 selectivity about 100 however the low nitrate removal and the consumption of ti metal is the deficiency of this technology therefore the researches in future should focus on 1 further enhancing the removal efficiency nitrate and tn 2 recycling the ti metal from the solid by products and 3 applying the solid by products in other aspect such as photocatalysis acknowledgments

18853,in this study indirect electrochemical reduction with zero valent titanium zvt as anode successfully achieved the selective nitrate removal from simulated groundwater the maximum nitrate removal efficiency and n2 selectivity reached to 83 4 and 78 5 after 12 h respectively experimental results demonstrated that the gaseous by products no and n2o were negligible and the nitrate reduction process could be well depicted by pseudo first order kinetic model decreasing the ph value of electrolyte was favorable to electrical energy utilization efficiency and nitrate removal the chloride ultimately showed inhibitory effects on electrochemical reduction of nitrate during the electrochemical reaction the zvt lost electrons to generate the reducing agents ti3 and ti2 which could afford electrons for nitrate reduction and form the solid by products tio2 4cl0 2n0 1 a 2 stage strategy indirect electrochemical reduction hypochlorite treatment pre reduction post oxidation was developed to completely remove nitrate and the long term performance of nitrate reduction was comprehensively evaluated the effluent nitrate steadily kept at 8 8 mg n l during 120 h continuous operation when the influent nitrate concentration was 25 9 mg n l simultaneously nitrite concentration was lower than 0 01 mg n l and ammonium and ti ions were not detected in the effluent graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrate removal zero valent titanium zvt indirect electrochemical reduction essential reaction parameters by products 1 introduction in china the eutrophication and algae bloom in surface water become increasingly serious because of extensive discharge of wastewaters containing nitrate no3 from agricultural production animal husbandry and industrial production marchesini et al 2008 xie et al 2011 excessive nitrate also may have adverse effects to human health as it can be turned into nitrite no2 in the human body and then lead to methaemoglobinaemia nitrite is considered as the precursor of potential stomach cancer carcinogens such as n nitroso compounds gao et al 2003 lundberg et al 2004 thus the united states environmental protection agency us epa and world health organization who declares that the maximum contaminant levels mcl of nitrate and nitrite in drinking water should be under 10 0 and 1 0 mg n l respectively united states environmental protection agency 1991 world health organization 2011 however the concentration of nitrate is even higher than 30 mg n l in some groundwater sahli et al 2008 therefore the conversion of nitrate to non toxic gaseous nitrogen n2 without other by products such as nitrite and ammonium has drawn considerable attention the most frequently used methods to eliminate the nitrate contamination in water can be fallen into five categories 1 physical separation primo et al 2009 schoeman and steyn 2003 2 biological denitrification chen et al 2013 2014 2015 li et al 2014 zhong et al 2016a 3 chemical reduction bao et al 2017 4 catalytic hydrogenation durkin et al 2017 and 5 electrochemical reduction dash and chaudhari 2005 fan et al 2017 su et al 2017 however these methods have more or less some drawbacks in the real application for instance the cost of physical separation usually is expensive because additional treatments are required to dispose the second pollutants for example the high salt concentrate from the reverse osmosis and ion exchange processes biological denitrification is a cheap and effective method for nitrate removal but it maybe bring the possible bacterial and residual organic contamination simultaneously some complicated operations are required to maintain the bacterial activities high performance catalytic hydrogenation for nitrate reduction needs continuous external supply of reducing agent h2 obviously there are great explosion risk for the transportation and storage of h2 recently electrochemical reduction of nitrate has received increasing interest for its high selectivity convenience safety and eco friendly dash and chaudhari 2005 however its application is limited due to the generation of detrimental by products such as nitrite and ammonium nh4 in general nitrate can be reduced on the cathode during electrochemical reduction process an effective and selective catalytic electrode usually plays a significant role in the electrochemical removal of nitrate the promoter metal sn in cu can only convert nitrate to nitrite in order to further catalytically reduce nitrite to nitrogen oxides nox n2 and nh4 the noble meal pd is necessary therefore plenty of bimetallic cathode electrodes pd sn pd in pd cu have been employed in electrochemical reduction of nitrate jung et al 2014 shuai et al 2015 wang et al 2006 nevertheless the synthesis of these bimetallic electrodes is complicated and needs strict conditions meanwhile the noble metal as catalytic electrode will significantly raise the costs of wastewater treatment it is urgent to explore a common and cheap electrode for completely reducing nitrate titanium ti is the fourth most abundant metal on earth and an ordinary industrial material which can be obtained at reasonable price ma and his co worker found that 94 6 nitrate was reduced through electrochemical reduction with an efficient nano titanium electrode ente as the cathode ma et al 2016 they attributed the high efficiency to the regular reticulate nanostructure of ente however the electrocatalytic reduction ability of ti cathode is poor due to the formation of compact titanium oxide on the surface of cathode wang and lin amazedly discovered that nitrate could also be reduced by multivalent ti species ti2 and ti3 derived from the corrosion of ti anode instead of the direct electrochemical reduction on the traditional cathode wang et al 2009 however the detailed mechanisms of direct indirect electrochemical reduction on ti electrodes are unknown for example what roles does the indirect electrochemical reduction on ti anode play what are essential operational factors affected the nitrate reduction and are there detrimental by products gas and solid produced especially when this process is applied in drinking water and groundwater treatment chloride cl a common anion in water can be oxidized to chlorine cl2 on the anode surface cl2 can further react with water to generate oxidizing hypochlorite ion clo which can oxidize nh4 and no2 to n2 and no3 respectively besides the presence of cl can significantly affect the process of metal corrosion to produce metal ions kim et al 2006 liang and liu 2009 lee et al 2011 yang et al 2016 therefore in this research the influences of essential operational factors including current density initial nitrate concentration initial ph and initial chloride concentration on the electrochemical reduction of nitrate and selectivity for n2 generation with zero valent titanium zvt as the anode were investigated the pseudo first order kinetic model was employed to evaluate the nitrate reduction process to amply explain the reaction mechanism the corrosion current density of zvt was examined by the potentiodynamic polarization method the solid by products were gathered and analyzed by scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer sem eds and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps furthermore the possible gaseous nitrogen oxides n2o and no were analyzed by gas chromatography and n 1 naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride spectrophotometric method respectively 2 experimental section 2 1 electrochemical

a constant current density imposed by a dc power supply atten pps3005t 3s china 3 ml of solution was taken regularly from the electrolytic cell to determine the concentration of nitrite nitrate ammonium and chloride moreover the solid by products was collected by filtration thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried at 333 k under vacuum to completely remove nitrate and assess the long

hypochlorite stock solution 10 was added to obtain 30 mg l initial hypochlorite clo concentration and the oxidation reaction carried out 8 h under magnetic stirring 600 rpm to remove the residual nitrite and ammonium the samples were collected regularly from stage 1 and stage 2 to analysis the concentration of nitrite nitrate ammonium chloride and ti ions all tests were duplicated three times

t n a d s is the amount of adsorbed tn mg n l during the reaction table s1 generally nitrate and intermediates ammonium and nitrite could be adsorbed by the produced solid co products tio2 s however the produced amount of ammonium and nitrite was far less than that of the added nitrate therefore the t n a d s is approximately equal to the adsorption amount of nitrate n o 3 a d s eq 4 by tio2 s in this study the n o 3 a d s was estimated by the adsorption experiment with commercially available p25 tio2 powder as the adsorbent and the details and results were listed in supporting information the zvt was nearly oxidized to tio2 in this reaction according to the mass conservation law the generation amount of tio2 m t i o 2 mg could be calculated through the loss of zvt before and after reaction m z v t r mg eq 5 meanwhile the m z v t r is approximately equaled to the loss quality of zvt before and after reaction eq 6 4 t n a d s n o 3 a d s 5 m t i o 2 80 m zvt r 48 6 m zvt r m z v t 0 m z v t f where m z v t r mg stands for the absolute reaction amount of zvt m t i o 2 mg is the mass of tio2 produced in the reaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrate reduction the concentrations of nitrate and its reduced products nitrite and ammonium were monitored every 1 h during electrochemical reduction process with the application of a constant current density 2 0 ma cm2 myriad of fine bubbles were observed on the both electrode due to the generation of oxygen o2 on anode and hydrogen h2 on cathode 2h2o o2 2h2 the bubbles on the zvt anode surface largely diminished after 30 min as the pitting and crevice corrosion began fig s2 eqs 7 and 8 7 ti 2 e t i 2 8 ti 3 e t i 3 however gas evolution on the cathode continued for the whole experiment the distributions of nitrate nitrite ammonium and n2 with reaction time were presented in fig 1 a it could be found that nitrate decreased rapidly from 25 9 to 7 7 mg n l within 12 h nitrite and ammonium all increased firstly and then decreased indicating that nitrite and ammonium were the intermediates for indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate fig 1b showed that most of nitrate was directly reduced to n2 70 0 and a small amount transformed to nitrite 11 8 and ammonium 6 0 significantly 12 2 of nitrate was adsorbed on the solid by products tio2 table s1 exp 2 as discussed above the direct or indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate may simultaneously happen on cathode and anode electrode respectively nevertheless the contribution that nitrate reduced by the cathode is unclear in order to ascertain the role of zvt cathode in the electrochemical reduction process a dual chamber electrochemical reactor was designed using zvt and carbon rod as the cathode and anode respectively which were separated by a proton exchange nafion 117 dupont as shown in fig s3 nitrate removal by zvt cathode was only 14 8 these results revealed that nitrate was mainly and indirectly reduced by the zvt anode in the reaction process which was obviously different from the conventional electro catalytic reduction through cathode ma et al 2016 in addition nitrate reduction may produce gaseous by products such as no and n2o the nitrate reduction experiments were carried out in a closed batch reactor to collect the gas sample however the content of no in the electrochemical reduction reactor was below the detection limits 1 0 mg l and n2o was 0 046 mg l suggesting that the nitrate was principally reduced to n2 70 0 in this system these results demonstrated that indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate using zvt was a potential technology for nitrate removal in water 3 2 effect of current density the redox reactions are greatly affected by the current density in the electrochemical reaction process a series of current density 0 6 2 0 4 0 6 0 ma cm2 were selected to determine the optimal current density for nitrate removal and the results were illustrated in fig 2 the nitrate removal efficiency gradually increased from 36 5 to 83 4 when the applied current density ranged from 0 6 to 6 0 ma cm2 similarly tn removal efficiency was only 27 3 at the current density 0 6 ma cm2 while it increased to 67 9 as the current density reached 6 0 ma cm2 meanwhile the electro reduction of nitrate was certified to follow the pseudo first order kinetic model table 1 and the corresponding reaction rate constant markedly increased from 0 03 h 1 at 0 6 ma cm2 to 0 15 h 1 at 6 0 ma cm2 the faraday s law indicates that the mass of the substance liberated at an electrode is in exact ratio to the number of electrons traveled through the electrode which well explained why higher current density resulted in more electrochemical transformation of nitrate in this study our previous research had proven that two electrochemical conversions were involved in the pitting corrosion process of zvt anode including electrochemical corrosion of zvt and electrochemical oxidation of external substances e g oh and cl on the zvt surface zhong et al 2016b thus higher current density accelerated the electrochemical corrosion of zvt and more ti ions reductive agents were produced resulting in the improvement of nitrate reduction the final nitrite slightly raised with increasing the current density however the final ammonium decreased from 1 1 to 0 3 mg n l by increasing the current density from 2 0 to 6 0 ma cm2 the greater the current density was the more the chlorine from the oxidization of chloride fig s4a and the corresponding generated hypochlorite was hypochlorite could oxidize ammonium to nitrite eqs 9 12 based on the variation of inorganic nitrogen nitrate nitrite ammonium and n2 during the electrochemical reduction process the energy utilization efficiency was estimated and the details were shown in supporting information as presented in fig 2b the energy utilization efficiency decreased from 49 0 to 11 5 as the current density increased from 0 6 to 6 0 ma cm2 the lower energy utilization efficiency at the high current density might be attributed to the electricity consumption for the oxidation of chloride and the electrolysis of water both considering of nitrate reduction and energy utilization efficiency 2 0 ma cm2 seemed the compromise value and was used for the following electrochemical reaction 9 2 cl 2 e cl 2 10 cl 2 h 2 o h cl hclo 11 hclo clo h 12 3 clo nh 4 no 2 3 cl h 2 o 2 h 3 3 effect of initial nitrate concentration fig 3 exhibited the effect of initial nitrate concentration on the nitrate reduction and the corresponding kinetic rate constant the nitrate removal efficiency decreased slightly with the initial nitrate concentration increasing from 14 9 to 35 4 mg n l correspondingly the rate constant decreased from 0 14 to 0 08 h 1 table 1 the result demonstrated that the electrochemical pitting corrosion rate of ti was similar under the same current density however the energy utilization efficiency and the absolute amount of no3 n removal improved with the increase of the initial nitrate concentration typically only 11 3 mg n l nitrate was removed when the initial nitrate concentration was 14 9 mg l but the removal efficiency was more than 75 though the removal efficiency was less than 60 21 8 mg n l was reduced when the initial nitrate concentration was 35 4 mg l these results further indicated that the more electrical energy could be used to remove nitrate under higher the initial concentration of nitrate and the electrical energy could be utilized more efficiently 3 4 effect of initial ph to discuss the impact of initial ph on indirect electrochemical nitrate reduction by zvt anode batch experiments were carried out at initial ph 4 0 7 2 and 10 0 and the results were presented in fig 5 the rate constant nitrate reduction efficiency tn removal and energy utilization efficiency all decreased slightly with increasing initial ph in the electrolytic cell the potentiodynamic polarization curves of zvt at different ph fig 4 a demonstrated that the corrosion current density of zvt increased from 1 11 to 1 52 μa cm2 as the ph decreased from 7 2 to 4 0 table s2 indicating that the zvt corrosion rate improved as the solution ph decreased thus the decrease of ph facilitated the formation of ti ions ti2 or and ti3 which were essential reduction agents for nitrate and nitrite reduction resulting in the improvement of nitrate removal and energy utilization efficiency it s interesting that the corrosion current density was very close between the ph at 7 2 and 10 0 table s2 but the nitrate removal and energy utilization efficiency at ph 10 0 were lower than those at ph 7 2 this could be attributed to the decrease of soluble ti ions due to the formation of black ti oh 3 s precipitate ti3 3oh ti oh 3 at higher ph it was worthy to notice that solution ph increased to 6 8 9 2 and 11 6 when the initial solution ph was 4 0 7 2 and 10 0 respectively it should ascribe that the hydrogen was generated during the whole reaction process which consumed plenty of h consequently decreasing the ph value of the electrolyte was favorable to electrical energy utilization and nitrate removal 3 5 effect of initial chloride concentration pitting corrosion is an in situ destruction of oxidation film where pits or holes are produced on the surface of metal it had been reported that the in situ destruction began through adsorption of aggressive anions on the deficient surface oxide film wang et al 2009 chloride is a common halide ion that can act in this way in this study the effects of initial chloride concentration on the zvt electro corrosion and electrochemical reduction of nitrate were investigated at initial chloride concentrations ranging from 12 to 220 mg l the potentiodynamic polarization curves of zvt at different chloride concentration fig 4b proved that the higher initial chloride concentration led to greater corrosion current density of zvt 1 11 μa cm2 at 12 mg l vs 1 65 μa cm2 at 220 mg l table s2 suggesting that the zvt corrosion became more easy at higher initial chloride concentration the pitting corrosion can produce reduction agents ti ions ti2 or and ti3 for nitrate reduction this meant that higher initial chloride concentration might be beneficial to the generation of reduction agents ti ions thereby promoting the nitrate reduction however this assumption was contrary to the experimental results in this work as shown in fig 6 the rate constant tn removal and nitrate removal efficiency decreased significantly when the initial chloride concentration increased from 12 to 220 mg l the nitrate reduction efficiency was 70 2 72 4 63 4 and 44 6 at initial chloride concentration 12 40 100 220 mg l and the corresponding rate constant was 0 12 0 09 0 08 and 0 03 h 1 respectively furthermore the final nitrite and ammonium slightly decreased as the initial chloride concentration increased as presented in fig s4b the chloride concentration decreased to 8 6 29 4 71 7 and 199 5 mg l after reaction when the initial chloride concentration was 12 40 100 and 220 mg l respectively the reduced chloride might be oxidized to generate cl2 on the surface of zvt anode and adsorbed by the solid by products the generated cl2 further reacted with h2o to form hypochlorite which could oxidize nitrite and ammonium to nitrate eqs 13 and 15 and also directly oxidize ammonium to n2 eq 14 so the final nitrite and ammonium in solution decreased in addition the formed hypochlorite might react with ti ions ti2 and ti3 to generate tio2 s eqs 16 and 17 the less ti ions ti2 and ti3 may be the reason for the worse nitrate removal to verify this viewpoint the control experiments were performed by adding sodium hypochlorite in the electrochemical reaction process and direct nitrate reduction using ti3 with different concentration of hypochlorite and the details were provided in supporting information as displayed in fig s5a the nitrate reduction efficiency decreased from 47 1 to 14 3 with the hypochlorite concentration increasing from 20 to 500 mg l the direct chemical reduction of nitrate using ti3 was also significantly inhibited by the hypochlorite fig s5b indicating that the ti ions could react with hypochlorite in addition with the initial chloride concentration improving energy utilization efficiency decreased fig 6b since most of electrical energy was wasted in hypochlorite production through chloride oxidation at high chloride concentration these results suggested that the chloride ultimately showed inhibitory effects on indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate by zvt anode 13 4 clo nh 4 n o 3 4 cl 2 h h 2 o 14 2 n h 4 3 c l o n 2 3 h 2 o 3 c l 2 h 15 clo no 2 n o 3 cl 16 clo t i 2 h 2 o tio 2 s cl 2 h 17 clo 2 t i 3 3 h

initial chloride concentration based on the slope of the linear correlation model the effect of reaction conditions on nitrate reduction rate constant increased in the order initial chloride concentration initial ph initial nitrate concentration current density the results indicated that the current density showed maximum impact on indirect electrochemical nitrate reduction among these reaction conditions 3 6 reaction mechanism the mechanism of the indirect electrochemical nitrate reduction using zvt anode was illustrated in fig 7 several control and analysis experiments sem eds xps and uv vis were executed to validate it as shown in fig 8 a except for the irregular polygonal cracking the surface of raw zvt electrode was bright white because it was polished when the zvt electrode was polarized by additional voltage 8 5 v the tight membrane fig 8b was formed within 30 min before corrosion developed however the numerous irregular micro porous were generated on the zvt surface and edge after the reaction fig 8c these changes suggested that the behavior of zvt corrosion was the holes and spots corrosion the eds analysis showed that there was only ti element to be observed in the zvt before reaction fig 8d but o n s and cl peaks were detected after reaction 30 min due to the adsorption of nitrate chloride and sulfate fig 8e besides two peaks at 399 5 and 406 6 ev appeared in the xps spectra of n1 s of zvt anode after reaction 30 min fig 5i implying the presence of nitrate these results revealed that the adsorption of nitrate onto the zvt surface was the first step for nitrate removal because of the positive charge resulted from the polarized anode 0 01 mg l of ti ions was detected after reaction 1 h indicating that the pitting and holes corrosion of zvt began and multivalent ti ions ti2 and ti3 produced eqs 1 and 2 ti2 and ti3 as strong reductants can closely combine with oxygen and quickly offer electrons for the reduction of oxyanion ions thus this process was considered as an activated process for zvt and a reaction determining step for nitrate reduction the ti ions metal center could associate with nitrate forming the complex during the reduction process amadei and earley 2001 the complex served as an intermediate and facilitated electrons and oxygen atoms transfer eoat resulting in the nitrate reduction and nitrite generation eqs 18 and 19 following the similar pathway nitrite could also pair with ti ions and get electrons hence nitrate was reduced through the eoat process to sequentially produce nitrite ammonium n2o and n2 eqs 18 25 18

ti ions were oxidized to tio2 s in the eoat process as they provided electrons and acquired oxygen atoms for nitrate reduction eqs 19 21 23 and 25 in order to further verify this mechanism the direct reactions between nitrate and ti3 were performed through adding ti3 into the nitrate solution and the details were listed in supporting information fig s7 showed that the uv vis absorption peak of tio2 was not observed before the ti3 adding then the absorbance of tio2 peak was detected reaction 20 and 60 min while that of ti3 peak decreased from 0 05 to 0 02 meanwhile 74 3 nitrate was reduced data not shown these results implied that nitrate was reduced through accepting the electron from ti3 and concurrently ti3 was oxidized to tio2 s eq 19 it could be concluded that the roles of ti ions were to 1 coordinate to nitrate 2 transfer electron for nitrate reduction and 3 facilitate tio2 s formation in the eoat process the percentage of nitrite and ammonium increased from 0 to 11 2 and 6 9 reaction 8 h and then decreased to 8 4 and 4 2 at reaction end fig 1a respectively suggesting that a part of ammonium was further oxidized to nitrate and n2 and a part of nitrite was also oxidized to nitrate by the generated hypochlorite eqs 13 15 furthermore 1 5 mg n l nitrate was adsorbed by tio2 powder in 12 h table s1 exp 2 indicating that the nitrate could be adsorbed by the generation of solid by products in the reaction sem eds and xps were used to analyze the morphology and characteristics of the solid by products produced in the electrochemical reaction as presented in fig 8f several peaks of eds represented ti o n and cl and their atomic ratio was 23 48 56 63 3 30 and 5 31 respectively the xps survey spectra of cl 2p displayed two clear peaks at 197 7 and 199 4 ev which belonged to chloride and corrosion products fretted in nacl fig 8h respectively yao et al 2016 fig 8i showed that there were two obvious peaks at 399 9 and 406 6 ev corresponding to nitrate in the xps survey spectra of n 1s these results revealed that the n and cl elements presented in the solid by products in addition it has been reported that the ti 2p 3 2 and ti 2p 1 2 peaks of the pure p25 tio2 were at 453 8 and 458 7 ev respectively wang et al 2009 however in this study the xps spectra of ti 2p for the pure tio2 exhibited three peaks at 453 1 457 9 and 463 6 ev fig 8g the difference should ascribe to the adsorption of nitrogen or other elements in the analysis process however the ti 2p 3 2 and ti 2p 1 2 peaks changed from 453 1 to 458 3 ev and 457 9 to 464 3 ev respectively for the solid by products versus p25 tio2 powder the peak gap also increased from 4 8 to 6 0 ev results expressly suggested that the n and cl elements were adsorbed and doped into the solid by products forming tio2 4cl0 2n0 1 eqs 26 and 27 26 2 ti 2 0 2 no 3 0 4 cl 1 7 h 2 o o 2 ti 2 o 4 3 cl 0 4 n 0 2 s 3 4 h 27 2 ti 3 0 2 no 3 0 4 cl 2 7 h 2 o o 2 ti 2 o 5 3 cl 0 4 n 0 2 s 5 4 h 3 7 2 stage treatment strategy for complete nitrate removal as aforementioned above most of nitrate 70 2 was successfully reduced with higher selectivity for n2 70 0 through the indirect electrochemical reduction by zvt anode however a small quantity of nitrite 2 0 mg n l and ammonium 1 0 mg n l were inevitably produced compared with nitrate nitrite shows more harmful for human health in general hypochlorite can stably and effectively oxidize nitrite and ammonium to nitrate and n2 respectively jung et al 2014 herein the post treatment of nitrite and ammonium with hypochlorite was investigated as a sequential treatment strategy to completely convert nitrate into n2 fig s1 as showed in fig 9 a the residual nitrate remained nearly 6 5 mg n l within 12 108 h and then progressively increased to 8 4 mg n l after 120 h in 1 stage n2 selectivity varied in the range of 67 2 74 3 during the continuous operation process nevertheless the nitrite and ammonium concentration stabilized at 1 8 and 1 2 mg n l respectively the chloride concentration also decreased to 8 5 mg l these results suggested that it was necessary to further removal of residual nitrite and ammonium after indirect electrochemical reduction reaction at the 2 stage treatment experiments hypochlorite was added into the effluent from the electrochemical reactor and the reaction time was designed as 8 h owing to the oxidation of hypochlorite eqs 13 15 the effluent ammonium was not observed and nitrite decreased to 0 01 mg n l fig 9b although the effluent nitrate increased to 8 8 mg n l it was still lower than the standard reported by who 10 mg n l nitrate in drinking water meanwhile the ti ion concentration was below the detection limit of icp oes 0 001 mg l the chloride concentration increased to 27 2 mg l mainly sodium chloride after oxidation reaction which was far lower than the taste thresholds for chloride anion 200 300 mg l for sodium potassium and calcium chloride in drinking water stipulated by who world health organization 2011 and was almost equaled to the total added chlorine 29 0 mg l indicating that the added hypochlorite was completely converted into chloride through the reduction eqs 13 15 and photolysis 2 clo 2 h 2 hcl o 2 photolysis these results implied 2 stage treatment strategy had greatly potential for complete transformation of nitrate into n2 in groundwater compared with conventional physical treatment banu and meenakshi 2017 mazarji et al 2017 biological denitrification ovez et al 2006 chemical reduction bao et al 2017 catalytic reduction guo et al 2017 hamid et al 2016 jung et al 2014 martínez et al 2017 and traditional electrocatalytic reduction teng et al 2017 martínez et al 2017 indirect electrochemical reduction of nitrate by zvt anode displayed great advantages in term of operation convenience material cost and complete transformation of nitrate into n2 table s3 4 conclusions the presence of inorganic nitrogen such as ammonium nitrate and nitrite in water whose sum usually are described as the total nitrogen tn can lead to potential environmental threats like methemoglobinemia and eutrophication thus not only nitrate removal but also tn removal needs to be concerned during the nitrate reduction the indirect electrochemical reduction was adapted to investigate electrochemical reduction of nitrate in simulated groundwater in the work the maximum nitrate and tn removal efficiency and n2 selectivity reached to 83 4 68 7 and 78 5 respectively the effects of essential reaction parameters including initial nitrate concentration current density initial ph and initial chloride concentration on the nitrate reduction were evaluated although nitrate and tn removal was improved by increasing current density the energy utilization efficiency was lower at higher current density the nitrate removal increased from 11 3 to 21 8 mg n l as the initial nitrate concentration increased from 14 9 to 35 4 mg n l decreasing the ph value of electrolyte was favorable to the energy utilization and nitrate removal the chloride ultimately showed inhibitory effects on electrochemical reduction of nitrate on zvt anode the nitrate reduction process could be well depicted by pseudo first order kinetic model with r2 ranging from 0 92 to 0 99 meanwhile the mechanism for indirect electrochemical nitrate reduction using zvt anode was comprehensively verified and discussed a novel 2 stage treatment strategy indirect electrochemical reduction hypochlorite treatment pre reduction post oxidation was developed and achieved effective tn removal 66 0 and high n2 selectivity about 100 however the low nitrate removal and the consumption of ti metal is the deficiency of this technology therefore the researches in future should focus on 1 further enhancing the removal efficiency nitrate and tn 2 recycling the ti metal from the solid by products and 3 applying the solid by products in other aspect such as photocatalysis acknowledgments

composed of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming and wingender 2010 a thorough analysis of eps is prerequisite to study the structure and stability of biofilms the analysis of eps is challenging and highly depending on analytical methods that are using standard compounds for quantification fractions of eps proteins saccharides uronic acids humic substances are currently characterized with colorimetric methods colorimetric methods are fast easy to use and cheap these methods were however developed to analyze known substances of unknown concentration dubois

display a way forward in this research field 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection aerobic granular sludge was collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant dinxperlo the netherlands in july 2017 royal haskoningdhv 2018 to separate granular sludge from flocs and other unwanted matter the sludge was sieved with a stainless steel woven wire mesh sieve with a mesh size of 2 mm the fraction 2 mm was collected and washed thoroughly on the mesh with demineralized water subsequently the washed granules were centrifuged at 4000 g and 10 c for 20 min the supernatant was discarded and the pellet of granules was stored at 20 c until being further used 2 2 extraction of structural eps from aerobic granular sludge extraction of structural eps was performed as described previously felz et al 2016 6 g of the sieved washed and centrifuged aerobic granular sludge were transferred into a baffled flask containing 100 ml of demineralized water sodium carbonate was added to the granules in the demineralized water to a final concentration of 0 5 w v the mixture was stirred for 35 min at 80 c in a water bath and then centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was collected and the pellet was discarded the ph of the supernatant was adjusted to 2 2 with 1 m hydrochloric acid the acidified supernatant was centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the pellet containing the structural eps was collected and re dissolved with 1 m sodium hydroxide at ph 8 5 the dissolved structural eps was dialyzed for 24 h against demineralized water in dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut off of 3500 da frozen at 80 c and freeze dried to avoid confusion with other publications on eps and for the ease of this study structural eps will only be called eps throughout the following text the organic and the ash fraction of the eps were determined by drying the sample at 105 c and combusting it at 550 c apha 1998 the obtained values were used for the calculations of the weight percentages of the compounds measured with colorimetric assays 2 3 colorimetric assays eps was characterized with colorimetric methods furthermore standards for proteins sugars uronic acids phenolic substances amino sugars and sugar alcohols were analyzed in terms of their interference in all applied colorimetric methods eps were dissolved in 0 02 m sodium hydroxide and analyzed at

standard for this assay cytochrome c was chosen to compare the method for two commercially available proteins of different size and composition measurements were performed in a 96 well plate the absorbance was measured at 750 nm not only proteins but also humic acids will result in an increased absorbance intensity in the original lowry method box 1983 frølund et al 1995 in the modified lowry method frølund et al 1995 a correction factor is included to decrease the impact of humic acids on the protein measurement a detailed explanation of the correction factor is shown in the original publication frølund et al 1995 the correction factor was calculated for bsa and cytochrome c we applied the lowry method with and without correction factor as both methods are applied in eps research and we wanted to illustrate the effect of standard selection and cross interference for both methods 2 3 1 2 bca assay additionally to the lowry method the bca assay smith et al 1985 is frequently applied in eps research and available as commercial kit for protein quantification this assay is using a similar principle to that of the lowry assay but shows less variability for different proteins and was therefore also applied in this study ras et al 2008 smith et al 1985 analysis was performed with a commercially available kit bc assay protein quantification kit interchim standard lines were prepared with bsa and cytochrome c measurements were performed in a 96 well plate the absorbance was measured at 562 nm 2 3 2 saccharide determination with the phenol sulfuric acid method saccharides were determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 used standards were glucose xylose and a sugar mixture equal amounts of fucose rhamnose galactose glucose xylose mannose ribose glucose is the most commonly applied standard in eps research xylose was selected to illustrate the impact of the measurement wavelength on the final result sugars used in the sugar mixture were all detected in eps and are therefore used as a standard measurements were performed in cuvettes at absorbance maxima of the sugar standards the corresponding wavelengths were 480 nm xylose 482 nm sugar mixture 487 nm glucose in the original publication dubois et al 1956 xylose was measured at 480 nm and glucose at 490 nm in our experiments glucose resulted in a slightly higher absorbance at 487 nm than at 490 nm therefore 487 nm was used 2 3 3 uronic acid determination with the carbazole sulfuric acid method uronic acids were determined using the carbazole sulfuric acid method dische 1946 filisetti cozzi and carpita 1991 galambos 1967 li et al 2007 a modified version of this method was applied li et al 2007 standard lines were prepared with galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid both compounds are commonly used in eps research measurements were performed in cuvettes the absorbance was measured at 525 nm 2 3 4 phenolic compound determination with the modified lowry method phenolic compounds were determined using the modified lowry method which was also used for the protein determination frølund et al 1996 1995 standard lines were prepared with humic acid and gallic acid humic acid is the commonly used standard in eps research gallic acid is an unconventional standard in eps research but is commonly used in the food and plant research to measure the total phenolic content in a sample measurements were performed in a 96 well plate the absorbance was measured at 750 nm 2 4 hpaec pad analysis of monosaccharides in eps eps was hydrolyzed in 1 m hydrochloric acid with a sample concentration of 10 g l 1 the sample suspension was prepared in caped bottles and shortly vortexed hydrolysis was performed in an oven at 105 c for 8 h without mixing after hydrolysis the sample was centrifuged at 13 300 g for 5 min the supernatant was collected and neutralized with 1 m sodium hydroxide the neutralized sample was diluted 1 5 with ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf filter for the qualitative analysis of monosaccharides in the eps the hydrolyzed and filtered eps was analyzed with and without the addition of monosaccharides monosaccharides were added with a concentration of 0 01 g l 1 selected compounds were glycerol galactosamine fucose glucosamine rhamnose galactose glucose xylose mannose ribose galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid multiple other sugar monomers were also analyzed however as these sugars were not detected in the here analyzed eps they are not mentioned analysis was performed with a dionex ics 5000 a carbopac pa20 column and an aminotrap pre column eluents used were ultrapure water 200 mm sodium hydroxide and 50 mm sodium acetate with 200 mm sodium hydroxide samples were analyzed with a quadruple waveform before injection of the first sample the columns were thoroughly washed and re equilibrated samples were analyzed with the elution pattern shown in table 1 chromatograms of eps and spiked eps were overlaid to detect present monosaccharides 3 results 3 1 chemical characterization of eps with colorimetric methods eps extracted from aerobic granular sludge was analyzed with colorimetric methods that are currently frequently applied in eps research and described before the results are visualized in fig 1 below the commonly used standard compounds fig 1a and a set of alternative standards fig 1b were evaluated to see the impact of the standard selection on the eps composition the protein measurement was affected by the selection of the standard and the method the change from bsa to cytochrome c resulted in a difference of 5 2 wt for the equivalents in eps using the modified lowry method also the correction factor has to be taken into account when changing the standard this is not visible in fig 1 the obtained correction factors were 0 29 for bsa and 0 50 for cytochrome c measuring the equivalent without a correction factor resulted in 61 7 wt bsa equivalents and 49 3 wt cytochrome c equivalents in the eps in contrast to the lowry method the bca assay resulted in the same equivalents for bsa and cytochrome c with 45 7 wt overall using these methods as applied in literature would give a variation in protein standard equivalents of 38 62 wt in total organic mass the quantification of saccharides was sensitive towards the selection of the standard and the used wavelength different sugars will result in different absorbance maxima in the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 measuring the sugar equivalent of eps with xylose at 480 nm and 487 nm resulted in 10 7 wt and 12 9 wt respectively measuring the equivalent in eps with glucose at 480 nm and 487 nm resulted in 14 6 wt and 13 8 wt respectively with these methods the saccharide standard equivalent mass would vary from 11 to 15 wt of the organic mass and that of uronic acids from 7 to 13 wt an alternative standard for the quantification of saccharides was introduced based on the monomer composition of eps as follows later hpaec pad analysis of eps showed the presence of several sugars in eps using this result a standard mixture composed of various neutral sugars was additionally applied in the phenol sulfuric acid method glycerol galactosamine and glucosamine were excluded from this sugar mixture as these compounds did not result in an increased absorbance intensity in the range of 480 nm 490 nm using the sugar mixture in the phenol sulfuric acid method resulted in an absorbance maximum at 482 nm which is close to that of eps with 485 nm the sugar mixture showed a good linearity in the here used concentration range of 5 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 with an r2 of 0 9981 applying the sugar mixture as standard compound for eps resulted in a equivalent of 14 6 wt of the organic mass the measurement of phenolic compounds was influenced by the selection of the standards for phenolic compound and protein quantification commercial humic acid standard yielded a much higher phenolic compound equivalent than gallic acid the absorbance of gallic acid in the assay was on the average 5 7 times higher than that of humic acid the correction factor applied in the protein analysis also affects the phenolic compound measurement the results illustrated in fig 1a and b are obtained using the correction factor of bsa using the correction factor of cytochrome c resulted in 6 4 wt humic acid equivalents and 1 1 wt gallic acid equivalents depending on the applied standards for phenolic compounds and proteins the measured content of phenolic compounds would vary from 1 to 29 wt of the organic mass 3 2 possible cross interferences of compounds present in eps with the here applied colorimetric methods the colorimetric analysis above indicated the impact of the standard selection on the obtained eps composition another problem is formed by the cross interference among eps components eps contains proteins neutral sugars uronic acids and phenolic compounds the colorimetric quantification of one component may be interfered by the presence of other components compounds used to evaluate possible cross interferences are listed in the material and methods section the cross interferences are displayed in table 2 below all of the analyzed methods were prone to interference of the selected standard compounds the mixture of sugars showed the same behavior as glucose and is therefore not included into the table glucosamine and glycerol were detected in the eps with hpaec pad and were also included in the cross interference analysis glycerol did not increase the absorbance intensity of any of the here analyzed colorimetric methods which is similar to previously reported results for the sugar alcohols sorbitol and mannitol le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 protein measurements were influenced differently depending on the applied method both lowry method and bca assay were susceptible to humic acid gallic acid and glucosamine with the bca assay exhibiting a much higher interference by glucosamine additionally there was small interference by glucose and galacturonic acid in the bca assay interference of humic acid and gallic acid was removed in the modified lowry assay by the correction factor as proposed by frølund et al 1995 protein quantification can be overestimated in the presence of phenolic compounds glucose galacturonic acid and glucosamine the saccharide measurement was sensitive towards the presence of galacturonic acid and humic acid the phenol sulfuric acid method showed negligible interference to bsa as illustrated here and in the initial publication dubois et al 1956 uronic acids result in an increased absorbance intensity in this method humic acid and galacturonic acid can result in an overestimation of the measured saccharide content the measured value of uronic acids was affected by bsa glucose and humic acid uronic acid measurement exhibited small interference with glucose and humic acid not visible in this chart is the interference of proteins proteins were reported to influence the uronic acid measurement by decreasing the measured value balazs et al 1965 dische 1946 the carbazole sulfuric acid assay was performed with galacturonic acid by itself 50 mg l 1 eps by itself 200 mg l 1 and a mixture of galacturonic acid 50 mg l 1 and eps 200 mg l 1 the measured value of the mixture resulted in an 8 lower value than the sum of the single compound values for bsa similar results were obtained quantification of uronic acids can be overestimated by glucose and humic acid and underestimated in the presence of bsa the quantification of phenolic compounds was only sensitive towards proteins the interference of bsa was removed by the correction factor of bsa the correction factor of bsa was only able to completely remove interference of proteins if the protein standard behaved in the same way as bsa using the correction factor of bsa and cytochrome c as protein standard gave small interference of 2 3 wt without the correction factor the quantification of phenolic compounds had a large interference by bsa the measurement of phenolic compounds can be overestimated in the presence of proteins 3 3 monosaccharide analysis of eps with hpaec pad qualitative analysis of monosaccharides present in eps was performed using hpaec pad detected monosaccharides can be seen in fig 2 a and b in the initial elution with diluted sodium hydroxide fig 2a the presence of one sugar alcohol glycerol 1 two amino sugars galactosamine 3 glucosamine 5 and seven neutral sugars fucose 2 rhamnose 4 galactose 6 glucose 7 xylose 8 mannose 9 and ribose 10 was confirmed further elution with sodium acetate sodium hydroxide fig 2b revealed galacturonic acid 11 and glucuronic acid 12 in eps 4 discussion the colorimetric methods used are all based on the same principle a sample containing a compound of interest is directly or indirectly reacting with a selected color reagent resulting in an increased absorbance intensity at a known wavelength the absorbance intensity is then compared to that of a standard compound of known concentration based on this comparison the concentration of the standard in the sample is calculated a detailed explanation of the mechanisms of the used colorimetric methods is given in previous studies le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 prior et al 2005 smith et al 1985 4 1 selection of the standard colorimetric methods were used to measure the concentration of standards representing proteins saccharides uronic acids and humic substances in eps for all of the analyzed compounds changing the standard compound resulted in a change of the corresponding equivalent in eps this shows the sensitivity of colorimetric methods to the choice of standard and that results of colorimetric methods should only be presented in equivalents of the standard furthermore not only the standard but also the applied method had an influence on the obtained equivalent in eps using the same eps sample and the same standard yielded different equivalents when applying lowry method and bca assay results of colorimetric methods need to be interpreted very carefully inaccuracies of available colorimetric methods were shown for protein and sugar quantification in general and for wastewater and eps samples in particular le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 ras et al 2008 similar findings were shown on the variance of the result when changing the standard compound in the applied methods le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 ras et al 2008 this study is building up on these previous findings about protein and sugar analysis additionally illustrated are problems of colorimetric measurements in eps analysis with uronic acids and phenolic compounds which are frequently investigated in wastewater and eps samples the variance of the results obtained for different standards in colorimetric protein analysis can be explained by the mechanism of lowry method and bca assay peptide bonds the amino acids cysteine tryptophan tyrosine and side groups similar to that of the three amino acids are responsible for the color reaction in these assays folin and ciocalteau 1927 lowry et al 1951 smith et al 1985 wiechelman et al 1988 proteins with a different composition to that of the applied standard can result in an over or underestimation of the protein content in the sample in the bca assay cytochrome c and bsa showed a very similar behavior resulting in the same equivalents for the eps this can be a coincidence for those two proteins as previous studies showed varying results when using the bca assay with different proteins avella et al 2010 le et al 2016 acceptable results in eps analysis can only be obtained with these assays if a standard of similar composition to that of the eps is used already when introducing sugar quantification with the phenol sulfuric acid method a variance in maximum absorbance wavelength and absorbance intensity for monosaccharides was illustrated with xylose mannose glucose galactose and fucose dubois et al 1956 looking at the amount of different sugars detected in eps with hpaec pad a standard composed of one saccharide will not be an adequate standard for eps analysis a possible optimization for a more representative standard was shown in this study using a mixture of sugars can better compensate for the different maximum absorbance wavelengths and intensities of the single sugars and therefore more accurately represent eps the high variance of absorbance intensity for different compounds was also visible in the uronic acid measurement the glucuronic acid equivalent in eps was almost double the amount to that of galacturonic acid both uronic acids were shown to be present in eps similar to the standard applied for the saccharide measurement a mixture of glucuronic and galacturonic can be a more representative standard for eps analysis the two standards used in the analysis of phenolic compounds especially showed the impact of the standard selection in colorimetric methods based on this result it cannot be stated which standard is more representative for the analysis of phenolic compounds in eps humic acid resulted in this assay in a very low absorbance if an inaccurate standard with a very low absorbance is used the measured equivalent in the eps can easily be overestimated the types of phenolic compounds present in eps need to be analyzed to be able to select a suitable standard it is very important to keep in mind that colorimetric methods are highly standard dependent and that inadequate standards can easily result in a misleading result representative standards are needed but can still not ensure an accurate result thus interpretation of results obtained with the above described methods should be done with great care 4 2 cross interference in eps analysis it was demonstrated that all used methods suffer from interference towards compounds present in eps this analysis illustrated that the measured values obtained with colorimetric methods do not only represent the amount of the targeted compound but also of other compounds present in the sample it is crucial to take interfering compounds into account when performing colorimetric methods on eps interfering substances for the quantification of proteins and saccharides were reported frølund et al 1995 le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 in this study standards of compounds found to be present in eps were included in the analysis of interfering compound in the protein and saccharide measurement furthermore the analysis of interfering compounds was extended to the measurement of phenolic compounds and uronic acids results show different interference for the lowry method and the bca assay both assays are very prone to the presence of phenolic compounds the very large interference with phenolic compounds in the lowry method is due to the ability of phenolic compounds to directly interact with the color reagent folin ciocalteu reagent box 1983 everette et al 2010 the bca assay in addition suffered from a large interference of glucosamine possibly bca is interacting stronger with amino sugars and other sugars than the folin ciocalteu reagent interference in this assay can originate from compounds with similar side groups to those of the amino acids interacting with the assay wiechelman et al 1988 to overcome the interference of phenolic compounds in the protein measurement a correction factor was proposed frølund et al 1995 the correction factor is based on the absorbance values of a protein standard in the interference analysis this correction factor completely removed the interference of phenolic compounds with the protein measurement however despite the positive impact on the decreased interference of humic and gallic acid the correction factor was shown to be depending on the standard as the correction factor is affecting the measurement of both proteins and phenolic compounds an inaccurate protein standard will falsify both results if a sample behaves differently than the standard the correction factor can also cause detection of phenolic compounds in a sample in which no phenolic compounds are present avella et al 2010 not only do the protein assays suffer from interfering compounds but also from other interfering parameters such as the structure wiechelman et al 1988 or dissolution of the proteins lowry method and bca assay are performed under highly alkaline conditions eps that are only soluble under acidic conditions pronk et al 2017 can therefore not be analyzed properly with these assays at the current state neither of the here used protein assays will give a reliable result for protein quantification in eps other authors already named the measured substances proteinaceous material le et al 2016 instead of proteins proteomic studies of biofilms will help to analyze present proteins by this it can be evaluated if there is a dominant type of protein present which can be used as a more representative standard also amino acid analysis of eps can help to compare the amount of cysteine tyrosine and tryptophan in relation to a standard the measurement of saccharides was interfered by the presence of galacturonic acid and humic acid both leading to an overestimation of the measured equivalent in eps this is similar to previous studies dubois et al 1956 le and stuckey 2016 the interference of the saccharide measurement was also shown for a very similar method the anthrone sulfuric acid method dreywood 1946 a suggestion to overcome this interference was introduced with measuring both uronic acids and saccharides in the same method at different wavelengths rondel et al 2013 this can be an improvement to reduce the interference but can still lead to a falsification of the result if the selected standard is not accurate as shown before because of the drawbacks of this method recent studies question the applicability of sugar quantification with colorimetric method for wastewater samples le and stuckey 2016 in comparison to protein and saccharide analysis the measurement of uronic acids showed small interference by compounds present in eps glucose and humic acid resulted in a small overestimation of the measured equivalent neutral sugars react with the reagents of this method to decrease the impact of neutral sugars sulfamate was added to the assay balazs et al 1965 thus decreasing the interference important for the uronic acid measurement is to be aware of the interference of proteins balazs et al 1965 dische 1950 1946 which can lead to an underestimation of the measured equivalent the phenolic compound measurement was only susceptible towards the interference of proteins this interference can be explained by the reactivity of the folin ciocalteu reagent towards proteins everette et al 2010 frølund et al 1995 lowry et al 1951 a correction factor was introduced as described before the correction factor calculated based on the absorbance of proteins highly affected the phenolic compound measurement thus having an inaccurate standard for the protein measurement will have a severe impact on the measurement of phenolic compounds measurement of phenolic compounds in eps with and without correction factor will be affected by proteins aside of the shown interference the phenolic compound measurement suffered from the vast variety of compounds that can interact additionally with the folin ciocalteu reagent such as thiol derivatives vitamins and nucleotide bases box 1983 everette et al 2010 ikawa et al 2003 sharma and krishnan 1966 the reactivity of the assay is that broad that it is recommended to use it as a measure of the total antioxidant capacity rather than to measure the phenolic compounds in a sample everette et al 2010 interference of compounds present in eps was visible in all the tested assays partly at severe levels the analysis of interfering compounds and of the standard dependency show that colorimetric methods should only be used as an orientation to analyze eps optimization of colorimetric methods with more adequate standards or correction factors can improve these methods for eps analysis but will not solve all the drawbacks when using colorimetric methods it is important to be aware of other compounds that will be measured besides the intended compounds and obtained values should not be used as absolute values thus colorimetric methods should only be used to obtain an overview of the eps composition and also this overview has to be interpreted very carefully from the analysis above it becomes clear that colorimetric eps analysis is at best indicative of the different fractions of polymers in eps the use of different methods and the presence of varying interfering compounds make a comparison of results between different studies almost impossible the eps research field needs to shift the focus from analyzing the present polymeric material with colorimetric methods to analyzing the different compounds more in depth the high complexity of the present sugars in the polymers was indicated by the result of hpaec pad analysis a next step is to further understand the function and origin of these sugars e g polysaccharides glycosylated groups etc as well as to analyze the exact bond between the sugars there are good options to do so by using mass spectrometric analysis dell and morris 2001 kumirska et al 2010 mariño et al 2010 the same can be stated for proteins analysis with sds page can reveal the presence of certain sizes and types of proteins further analyzing such proteins with mass spectrometry can reveal the composition and function of the present proteins kaltashov et al 2012 svensäter et al 2001 hereto more elaborate meta proteomics techniques will have to be developed garza and dutilh 2015 myrold et al 2014 seen to the importance of eps in the functioning of biofilms and biofouling only a strongly improved analysis of the eps constituents might bring biofilm research to the next level 5 conclusion current eps research largely depends on analytical colorimetric methods that have a significant bias these biases are due to the unavoidable choice of a standard compound a lack of suitable standard compounds and the cross interference of the many eps compounds in the individual assays results obtained with colorimetric methods have to be interpreted very carefully current eps research for natural and wastewater biofilms should focus first on improving and developing more advanced analytical methods e g based on ft ir gc hplc eem nmr ms before it progresses with studying the functionalities of the material that comprises biofilm

18854,biofilm structure and functionality depend on extracellular polymeric substances eps but analytical methods for eps often lack specificity which limits progress of biofilm research eps were extracted from aerobic granular sludge and analyzed with frequently applied colorimetric methods the colorimetric methods were evaluated based on their applicability for eps analysis eps fractions of interest were proteins sugars uronic acids and phenolic compounds the applied methods lowry method bicinchoninic acid assay phenol sulfuric acid method carbazole sulfuric acid method were investigated in terms of their sensitivity towards the selected standard compound interference of compounds present in eps with the colorimetric methods was further evaluated all methods showed to be highly depending on the choice of standard compound and susceptible towards interference by compounds present in eps this study shows that currently used colorimetric methods are not capable of accurately characterizing eps more advanced methods are needed to be able to draw conclusions about biofilm composition structure and functionality graphical abstract image 1 keywords extracellular polymeric substances eps eps analysis colorimetric methods biofilm aerobic granular sludge 1 introduction biofilms are present in natural systems as well as in wastewater and drinking water systems biofilms are composed of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming and wingender 2010 a thorough analysis of eps is prerequisite to study the structure and stability of biofilms the analysis of eps is challenging and highly depending on analytical methods that are using standard compounds for quantification fractions of eps proteins saccharides uronic acids humic substances are currently characterized with colorimetric methods colorimetric methods are fast easy to use and cheap these methods were however developed to analyze known substances of unknown concentration dubois et al 1956 lowry et al 1951 in the initial publications introducing these methods the authors mention the susceptibility of the methods to interfering compounds dische 1946 dubois et al 1956 lowry et al 1951 the current use of methods was evaluated based on a search in the scopus database targeting recent publications focusing on eps analysis with this evaluation colorimetric methods were selected for this study it is clear that no common analytical approaches are used complicating the evaluation of data in literature analyzing eps is performed to understand the biofilm composition and biofilm adjustment to environmental changes interpretations based on the composition however can only be done correctly if the results are reasonably accurate and carefully used previous studies already showed the unreliable results obtained for protein analysis in eps with lowry bradford or bicinchoninic acid bca assay avella et al 2010 le et al 2016 ras et al 2008 in these studies the interference of humic acids with the lowry method avella et al 2010 le et al 2016 the variance of the protein content in the same sample when analyzed with lowry method and bca assay ras et al 2008 and the general inconsistency and unreliability of the methods le et al 2016 were emphasized not only the protein quantification in eps samples is unreliable but also the humic substance and saccharide quantification has certain inaccuracies everette et al 2010 le and stuckey 2016 the folin ciocalteu reagent is used to quantify humic substances in eps the reactivity of the folin ciocalteu reagent with multiple compound classes was analyzed suggesting it to be used to measure the total antioxidant capacity of a sample but not to quantify the phenolic content everette et al 2010 the anthrone sulfuric acid method and the phenol sulfuric acid method are widely applied in eps research similar to the protein analysis le et al 2016 also here interfering substances and the choice of the method can easily result in an under or overestimation of the actual sugar content le and stuckey 2016 the purpose of this study is to evaluate eps analysis with colorimetric methods this study is building up on previous evaluations of eps analysis with colorimetric methods avella et al 2010 le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 ras et al 2008 structural eps felz et al 2016 further denoted here simply as eps from aerobic granular sludge was used this sample was used as an exemplary sample for wastewater sludge or biofilm to illustrate drawbacks of colorimetric analytic methods in eps research additionally to protein and saccharide detection uronic acids and humic substances were included the cross interference of compounds present in eps in the colorimetric measurements was evaluated the significance of the standard compound used in colorimetric methods on the final result was illustrated standard compounds evaluated were proteins bovine serum albumin cytochrome c neutral saccharides xylose glucose mixture of neutral saccharides uronic acids galacturonic acid glucuronic acid and phenolic compounds humic acid gallic acid suggestions are given to improve the standard selection by a detailed analysis of the monosaccharide composition in eps overall this study aimed to provide a critical discussion about drawbacks of colorimetric methods in particular for biofilm eps analysis as well as to display a way forward in this research field 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection aerobic granular sludge was collected from the municipal wastewater treatment plant dinxperlo the netherlands in july 2017 royal haskoningdhv 2018 to separate granular sludge from flocs and other unwanted matter the sludge was sieved with a stainless steel woven wire mesh sieve with a mesh size of 2 mm the fraction 2 mm was collected and washed thoroughly on the mesh with demineralized water subsequently the washed granules were centrifuged at 4000 g and 10 c for 20 min the supernatant was discarded and the pellet of granules was stored at 20 c until being further used 2 2 extraction of structural eps from aerobic granular sludge extraction of structural eps was performed as described previously felz et al 2016 6 g of the sieved washed and centrifuged aerobic granular sludge were transferred into a baffled flask containing 100 ml of demineralized water sodium carbonate was added to the granules in the demineralized water to a final concentration of 0 5 w v the mixture was stirred for 35 min at 80 c in a water bath and then centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the supernatant was collected and the pellet was discarded the ph of the supernatant was adjusted to 2 2 with 1 m hydrochloric acid the acidified supernatant was centrifuged at 4000 g and 4 c for 20 min the pellet containing the structural eps was collected and re dissolved with 1 m sodium hydroxide at ph 8 5 the dissolved structural eps was dialyzed for 24 h against demineralized water in dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cut off of 3500 da frozen at 80 c and freeze dried to avoid confusion with other publications on eps and for the ease of this study structural eps will only be called eps throughout the following text the organic and the ash fraction of the eps were determined by drying the sample at 105 c and combusting it at 550 c apha 1998 the obtained values were used for the calculations of the weight percentages of the compounds measured with colorimetric assays 2 3 colorimetric assays eps was characterized with colorimetric methods furthermore standards for proteins sugars uronic acids phenolic substances amino sugars and sugar alcohols were analyzed in terms of their interference in all applied colorimetric methods eps were dissolved in 0 02 m sodium hydroxide and analyzed at concentrations of 200 mg l 1 and 100 mg l 1 respectively standard lines were prepared in a concentration range from 5 to 100 mg l 1 cross interference of standard compounds was tested at concentrations of 50 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 analysis of cross interference was performed with bovine serum albumin bsa glucose a mixture of neutral sugars galacturonic acid humic acid gallic acid glucosamine and glycerol demineralized water together with the corresponding reagents of the assays was used as a blank in all colorimetric assays measurements were performed in triplicates for all colorimetric assays 2 3 1 protein determination the presence of proteins was analyzed with two different assays the lowry method and the bca assay 2 3 1 1 lowry method proteins were determined according to the modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 1995 the lowry method was performed with bsa and cytochrome c from equine heart as standards bsa is the most commonly used standard for this assay cytochrome c was chosen to compare the method for two commercially available proteins of different size and composition measurements were performed in a 96 well plate the absorbance was measured at 750 nm not only proteins but also humic acids will result in an increased absorbance intensity in the original lowry method box 1983 frølund et al 1995 in the modified lowry method frølund et al 1995 a correction factor is included to decrease the impact of humic acids on the protein measurement a detailed explanation of the correction factor is shown in the original publication frølund et al 1995 the correction factor was calculated for bsa and cytochrome c we applied the lowry method with and without correction factor as both methods are applied in eps research and we wanted to illustrate the effect of standard selection and cross interference for both methods 2 3 1 2 bca assay additionally to the lowry method the bca assay smith et al 1985 is frequently applied in eps research and available as commercial kit for protein quantification this assay is using a similar principle to that of the lowry assay but shows less variability for different proteins and was therefore also applied in this study ras et al 2008 smith et al 1985 analysis was performed with a commercially available kit bc assay protein quantification kit interchim standard lines were prepared with bsa and cytochrome c measurements were performed in a 96 well plate the absorbance was measured at 562 nm 2 3 2 saccharide determination with the phenol sulfuric acid method saccharides were determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 used standards were glucose xylose and a sugar mixture equal amounts of fucose rhamnose galactose glucose xylose mannose ribose glucose is the most commonly applied standard in eps research xylose was selected to illustrate the impact of the measurement wavelength on the final result sugars used in the sugar mixture were all detected in eps and are therefore used as a standard measurements were performed in cuvettes at absorbance maxima of the sugar standards the corresponding wavelengths were 480 nm xylose 482 nm sugar mixture 487 nm glucose in the original publication dubois et al 1956 xylose was measured at 480 nm and glucose at 490 nm in our experiments glucose resulted in a slightly higher absorbance at 487 nm than at 490 nm therefore 487 nm was used 2 3 3 uronic acid determination with the carbazole sulfuric acid method uronic acids were determined using the carbazole sulfuric acid method dische 1946 filisetti cozzi and carpita 1991 galambos 1967 li et al 2007 a modified version of this method was applied li et al 2007 standard lines were prepared with galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid both compounds are commonly used in eps research measurements were performed in cuvettes the absorbance was measured at 525 nm 2 3 4 phenolic compound determination with the modified lowry method phenolic compounds were determined using the modified lowry method which was also used for the protein determination frølund et al 1996 1995 standard lines were prepared with humic acid and gallic acid humic acid is the commonly used standard in eps research gallic acid is an unconventional standard in eps research but is commonly used in the food and plant research to measure the total phenolic content in a sample measurements were performed in a 96 well plate the absorbance was measured at 750 nm 2 4 hpaec pad analysis of monosaccharides in eps eps was hydrolyzed in 1 m hydrochloric acid with a sample concentration of 10 g l 1 the sample suspension was prepared in caped bottles and shortly vortexed hydrolysis was performed in an oven at 105 c for 8 h without mixing after hydrolysis the sample was centrifuged at 13 300 g for 5 min the supernatant was collected and neutralized with 1 m sodium hydroxide the neutralized sample was diluted 1 5 with ultrapure water and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf filter for the qualitative analysis of monosaccharides in the eps the hydrolyzed and filtered eps was analyzed with and without the addition of monosaccharides monosaccharides were added with a concentration of 0 01 g l 1 selected compounds were glycerol galactosamine fucose glucosamine rhamnose galactose glucose xylose mannose ribose galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid multiple other sugar monomers were also analyzed however as these sugars were not detected in the here analyzed eps they are not mentioned analysis was performed with a dionex ics 5000 a carbopac pa20 column and an aminotrap pre column eluents used were ultrapure water 200 mm sodium hydroxide and 50 mm sodium acetate with 200 mm sodium hydroxide samples were analyzed with a quadruple waveform before injection of the first sample the columns were thoroughly washed and re equilibrated samples were analyzed with the elution pattern shown in table 1 chromatograms of eps and spiked eps were overlaid to detect present monosaccharides 3 results 3 1 chemical characterization of eps with colorimetric methods eps extracted from aerobic granular sludge was analyzed with colorimetric methods that are currently frequently applied in eps research and described before the results are visualized in fig 1 below the commonly used standard compounds fig 1a and a set of alternative standards fig 1b were evaluated to see the impact of the standard selection on the eps composition the protein measurement was affected by the selection of the standard and the method the change from bsa to cytochrome c resulted in a difference of 5 2 wt for the equivalents in eps using the modified lowry method also the correction factor has to be taken into account when changing the standard this is not visible in fig 1 the obtained correction factors were 0 29 for bsa and 0 50 for cytochrome c measuring the equivalent without a correction factor resulted in 61 7 wt bsa equivalents and 49 3 wt cytochrome c equivalents in the eps in contrast to the lowry method the bca assay resulted in the same equivalents for bsa and cytochrome c with 45 7 wt overall using these methods as applied in literature would give a variation in protein standard equivalents of 38 62 wt in total organic mass the quantification of saccharides was sensitive towards the selection of the standard and the used wavelength different sugars will result in different absorbance maxima in the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 measuring the sugar equivalent of eps with xylose at 480 nm and 487 nm resulted in 10 7 wt and 12 9 wt respectively measuring the equivalent in eps with glucose at 480 nm and 487 nm resulted in 14 6 wt and 13 8 wt respectively with these methods the saccharide standard equivalent mass would vary from 11 to 15 wt of the organic mass and that of uronic acids from 7 to 13 wt an alternative standard for the quantification of saccharides was introduced based on the monomer composition of eps as follows later hpaec pad analysis of eps showed the presence of several sugars in eps using this result a standard mixture composed of various neutral sugars was additionally applied in the phenol sulfuric acid method glycerol galactosamine and glucosamine were excluded from this sugar mixture as these compounds did not result in an increased absorbance intensity in the range of 480 nm 490 nm using the sugar mixture in the phenol sulfuric acid method resulted in an absorbance maximum at 482 nm which is close to that of eps with 485 nm the sugar mixture showed a good linearity in the here used concentration range of 5 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 with an r2 of 0 9981 applying the sugar mixture as standard compound for eps resulted in a equivalent of 14 6 wt of the organic mass the measurement of phenolic compounds was influenced by the selection of the standards for phenolic compound and protein quantification commercial humic acid standard yielded a much higher phenolic compound equivalent than gallic acid the absorbance of gallic acid in the assay was on the average 5 7 times higher than that of humic acid the correction factor applied in the protein analysis also affects the phenolic compound measurement the results illustrated in fig 1a and b are obtained using the correction factor of bsa using the correction factor of cytochrome c resulted in 6 4 wt humic acid equivalents and 1 1 wt gallic acid equivalents depending on the applied standards for phenolic compounds and proteins the measured content of phenolic compounds would vary from 1 to 29 wt of the organic mass 3 2 possible cross interferences of compounds present in eps with the here applied colorimetric methods the colorimetric analysis above indicated the impact of the standard selection on the obtained eps composition another problem is formed by the cross interference among eps components eps contains proteins neutral sugars uronic acids and phenolic compounds the colorimetric quantification of one component may be interfered by the presence of other components compounds used to evaluate possible cross interferences are listed in the material and methods section the cross interferences are displayed in table 2 below all of the analyzed methods were prone to interference of the selected standard compounds the mixture of sugars showed the same behavior as glucose and is therefore not included into the table glucosamine and glycerol were detected in the eps with hpaec pad and were also included in the cross interference analysis glycerol did not increase the absorbance intensity of any of the here analyzed colorimetric methods which is similar to previously reported results for the sugar alcohols sorbitol and mannitol le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 protein measurements were influenced differently depending on the applied method both lowry method and bca assay were susceptible to humic acid gallic acid and glucosamine with the bca assay exhibiting a much higher interference by glucosamine additionally there was small interference by glucose and galacturonic acid in the bca assay interference of humic acid and gallic acid was removed in the modified lowry assay by the correction factor as proposed by frølund et al 1995 protein quantification can be overestimated in the presence of phenolic compounds glucose galacturonic acid and glucosamine the saccharide measurement was sensitive towards the presence of galacturonic acid and humic acid the phenol sulfuric acid method showed negligible interference to bsa as illustrated here and in the initial publication dubois et al 1956 uronic acids result in an increased absorbance intensity in this method humic acid and galacturonic acid can result in an overestimation of the measured saccharide content the measured value of uronic acids was affected by bsa glucose and humic acid uronic acid measurement exhibited small interference with glucose and humic acid not visible in this chart is the interference of proteins proteins were reported to influence the uronic acid measurement by decreasing the measured value balazs et al 1965 dische 1946 the carbazole sulfuric acid assay was performed with galacturonic acid by itself 50 mg l 1 eps by itself 200 mg l 1 and a mixture of galacturonic acid 50 mg l 1 and eps 200 mg l 1 the measured value of the mixture resulted in an 8 lower value than the sum of the single compound values for bsa similar results were obtained quantification of uronic acids can be overestimated by glucose and humic acid and underestimated in the presence of bsa the quantification of phenolic compounds was only sensitive towards proteins the interference of bsa was removed by the correction factor of bsa the correction factor of bsa was only able to completely remove interference of proteins if the protein standard behaved in the same way as bsa using the correction factor of bsa and cytochrome c as protein standard gave small interference of 2 3 wt without the correction factor the quantification of phenolic compounds had a large interference by bsa the measurement of phenolic compounds can be overestimated in the presence of proteins 3 3 monosaccharide analysis of eps with hpaec pad qualitative analysis of monosaccharides present in eps was performed using hpaec pad detected monosaccharides can be seen in fig 2 a and b in the initial elution with diluted sodium hydroxide fig 2a the presence of one sugar alcohol glycerol 1 two amino sugars galactosamine 3 glucosamine 5 and seven neutral sugars fucose 2 rhamnose 4 galactose 6 glucose 7 xylose 8 mannose 9 and ribose 10 was confirmed further elution with sodium acetate sodium hydroxide fig 2b revealed galacturonic acid 11 and glucuronic acid 12 in eps 4 discussion the colorimetric methods used are all based on the same principle a sample containing a compound of interest is directly or indirectly reacting with a selected color reagent resulting in an increased absorbance intensity at a known wavelength the absorbance intensity is then compared to that of a standard compound of known concentration based on this comparison the concentration of the standard in the sample is calculated a detailed explanation of the mechanisms of the used colorimetric methods is given in previous studies le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 prior et al 2005 smith et al 1985 4 1 selection of the standard colorimetric methods were used to measure the concentration of standards representing proteins saccharides uronic acids and humic substances in eps for all of the analyzed compounds changing the standard compound resulted in a change of the corresponding equivalent in eps this shows the sensitivity of colorimetric methods to the choice of standard and that results of colorimetric methods should only be presented in equivalents of the standard furthermore not only the standard but also the applied method had an influence on the obtained equivalent in eps using the same eps sample and the same standard yielded different equivalents when applying lowry method and bca assay results of colorimetric methods need to be interpreted very carefully inaccuracies of available colorimetric methods were shown for protein and sugar quantification in general and for wastewater and eps samples in particular le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 ras et al 2008 similar findings were shown on the variance of the result when changing the standard compound in the applied methods le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 ras et al 2008 this study is building up on these previous findings about protein and sugar analysis additionally illustrated are problems of colorimetric measurements in eps analysis with uronic acids and phenolic compounds which are frequently investigated in wastewater and eps samples the variance of the results obtained for different standards in colorimetric protein analysis can be explained by the mechanism of lowry method and bca assay peptide bonds the amino acids cysteine tryptophan tyrosine and side groups similar to that of the three amino acids are responsible for the color reaction in these assays folin and ciocalteau 1927 lowry et al 1951 smith et al 1985 wiechelman et al 1988 proteins with a different composition to that of the applied standard can result in an over or underestimation of the protein content in the sample in the bca assay cytochrome c and bsa showed a very similar behavior resulting in the same equivalents for the eps this can be a coincidence for those two proteins as previous studies showed varying results when using the bca assay with different proteins avella et al 2010 le et al 2016 acceptable results in eps analysis can only be obtained with these assays if a standard of similar composition to that of the eps is used already when introducing sugar quantification with the phenol sulfuric acid method a variance in maximum absorbance wavelength and absorbance intensity for monosaccharides was illustrated with xylose mannose glucose galactose and fucose dubois et al 1956 looking at the amount of different sugars detected in eps with hpaec pad a standard composed of one saccharide will not be an adequate standard for eps analysis a possible optimization for a more representative standard was shown in this study using a mixture of sugars can better compensate for the different maximum absorbance wavelengths and intensities of the single sugars and therefore more accurately represent eps the high variance of absorbance intensity for different compounds was also visible in the uronic acid measurement the glucuronic acid equivalent in eps was almost double the amount to that of galacturonic acid both uronic acids were shown to be present in eps similar to the standard applied for the saccharide measurement a mixture of glucuronic and galacturonic can be a more representative standard for eps analysis the two standards used in the analysis of phenolic compounds especially showed the impact of the standard selection in colorimetric methods based on this result it cannot be stated which standard is more representative for the analysis of phenolic compounds in eps humic acid resulted in this assay in a very low absorbance if an inaccurate standard with a very low absorbance is used the measured equivalent in the eps can easily be overestimated the types of phenolic compounds present in eps need to be analyzed to be able to select a suitable standard it is very important to keep in mind that colorimetric methods are highly standard dependent and that inadequate standards can easily result in a misleading result representative standards are needed but can still not ensure an accurate result thus interpretation of results obtained with the above described methods should be done with great care 4 2 cross interference in eps analysis it was demonstrated that all used methods suffer from interference towards compounds present in eps this analysis illustrated that the measured values obtained with colorimetric methods do not only represent the amount of the targeted compound but also of other compounds present in the sample it is crucial to take interfering compounds into account when performing colorimetric methods on eps interfering substances for the quantification of proteins and saccharides were reported frølund et al 1995 le et al 2016 le and stuckey 2016 in this study standards of compounds found to be present in eps were included in the analysis of interfering compound in the protein and saccharide measurement furthermore the analysis of interfering compounds was extended to the measurement of phenolic compounds and uronic acids results show different interference for the lowry method and the bca assay both assays are very prone to the presence of phenolic compounds the very large interference with phenolic compounds in the lowry method is due to the ability of phenolic compounds to directly interact with the color reagent folin ciocalteu reagent box 1983 everette et al 2010 the bca assay in addition suffered from a large interference of glucosamine possibly bca is interacting stronger with amino sugars and other sugars than the folin ciocalteu reagent interference in this assay can originate from compounds with similar side groups to those of the amino acids interacting with the assay wiechelman et al 1988 to overcome the interference of phenolic compounds in the protein measurement a correction factor was proposed frølund et al 1995 the correction factor is based on the absorbance values of a protein standard in the interference analysis this correction factor completely removed the interference of phenolic compounds with the protein measurement however despite the positive impact on the decreased interference of humic and gallic acid the correction factor was shown to be depending on the standard as the correction factor is affecting the measurement of both proteins and phenolic compounds an inaccurate protein standard will falsify both results if a sample behaves differently than the standard the correction factor can also cause detection of phenolic compounds in a sample in which no phenolic compounds are present avella et al 2010 not only do the protein assays suffer from interfering compounds but also from other interfering parameters such as the structure wiechelman et al 1988 or dissolution of the proteins lowry method and bca assay are performed under highly alkaline conditions eps that are only soluble under acidic conditions pronk et al 2017 can therefore not be analyzed properly with these assays at the current state neither of the here used protein assays will give a reliable result for protein quantification in eps other authors already named the measured substances proteinaceous material le et al 2016 instead of proteins proteomic studies of biofilms will help to analyze present proteins by this it can be evaluated if there is a dominant type of protein present which can be used as a more representative standard also amino acid analysis of eps can help to compare the amount of cysteine tyrosine and tryptophan in relation to a standard the measurement of saccharides was interfered by the presence of galacturonic acid and humic acid both leading to an overestimation of the measured equivalent in eps this is similar to previous studies dubois et al 1956 le and stuckey 2016 the interference of the saccharide measurement was also shown for a very similar method the anthrone sulfuric acid method dreywood 1946 a suggestion to overcome this interference was introduced with measuring both uronic acids and saccharides in the same method at different wavelengths rondel et al 2013 this can be an improvement to reduce the interference but can still lead to a falsification of the result if the selected standard is not accurate as shown before because of the drawbacks of this method recent studies question the applicability of sugar quantification with colorimetric method for wastewater samples le and stuckey 2016 in comparison to protein and saccharide analysis the measurement of uronic acids showed small interference by compounds present in eps glucose and humic acid resulted in a small overestimation of the measured equivalent neutral sugars react with the reagents of this method to decrease the impact of neutral sugars sulfamate was added to the assay balazs et al 1965 thus decreasing the interference important for the uronic acid measurement is to be aware of the interference of proteins balazs et al 1965 dische 1950 1946 which can lead to an underestimation of the measured equivalent the phenolic compound measurement was only susceptible towards the interference of proteins this interference can be explained by the reactivity of the folin ciocalteu reagent towards proteins everette et al 2010 frølund et al 1995 lowry et al 1951 a correction factor was introduced as described before the correction factor calculated based on the absorbance of proteins highly affected the phenolic compound measurement thus having an inaccurate standard for the protein measurement will have a severe impact on the measurement of phenolic compounds measurement of phenolic compounds in eps with and without correction factor will be affected by proteins aside of the shown interference the phenolic compound measurement suffered from the vast variety of compounds that can interact additionally with the folin ciocalteu reagent such as thiol derivatives vitamins and nucleotide bases box 1983 everette et al 2010 ikawa et al 2003 sharma and krishnan 1966 the reactivity of the assay is that broad that it is recommended to use it as a measure of the total antioxidant capacity rather than to measure the phenolic compounds in a sample everette et al 2010 interference of compounds present in eps was visible in all the tested assays partly at severe levels the analysis of interfering compounds and of the standard dependency show that colorimetric methods should only be used as an orientation to analyze eps optimization of colorimetric methods with more adequate standards or correction factors can improve these methods for eps analysis but will not solve all the drawbacks when using colorimetric methods it is important to be aware of other compounds that will be measured besides the intended compounds and obtained values should not be used as absolute values thus colorimetric methods should only be used to obtain an overview of the eps composition and also this overview has to be interpreted very carefully from the analysis above it becomes clear that colorimetric eps analysis is at best indicative of the different fractions of polymers in eps the use of different methods and the presence of varying interfering compounds make a comparison of results between different studies almost impossible the eps research field needs to shift the focus from analyzing the present polymeric material with colorimetric methods to analyzing the different compounds more in depth the high complexity of the present sugars in the polymers was indicated by the result of hpaec pad analysis a next step is to further understand the function and origin of these sugars e g polysaccharides glycosylated groups etc as well as to analyze the exact bond between the sugars there are good options to do so by using mass spectrometric analysis dell and morris 2001 kumirska et al 2010 mariño et al 2010 the same can be stated for proteins analysis with sds page can reveal the presence of certain sizes and types of proteins further analyzing such proteins with mass spectrometry can reveal the composition and function of the present proteins kaltashov et al 2012 svensäter et al 2001 hereto more elaborate meta proteomics techniques will have to be developed garza and dutilh 2015 myrold et al 2014 seen to the importance of eps in the functioning of biofilms and biofouling only a strongly improved analysis of the eps constituents might bring biofilm research to the next level 5 conclusion current eps research largely depends on analytical colorimetric methods that have a significant bias these biases are due to the unavoidable choice of a standard compound a lack of suitable standard compounds and the cross interference of the many eps compounds in the individual assays results obtained with colorimetric methods have to be interpreted very carefully current eps research for natural and wastewater biofilms should focus first on improving and developing more advanced analytical methods e g based on ft ir gc hplc eem nmr ms before it progresses with studying the functionalities of the material that comprises biofilm
