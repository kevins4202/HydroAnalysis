24295,assessing the effects of a plant host shift is important for monitoring insect populations over long time periods and for interventions in a conservation or pest management framework in a heterogeneous environment individuals may disperse between sources and sinks in order to persist here we propose a single species two patch model that aims to capture the generational movement of an insect that exhibits density dependent dispersal to see how shifting between hosts could alter its viability and asymptotic dynamics we then analyse the stability and persistence properties of the model and further validate it using parameter estimates derived from laboratory experiments in order to evaluate the potential of this model we applied it to drosophila suzukii diptera drosophilidae which has become a harmful pest in several countries around the world although many studies have investigated the preference and attractiveness of potential hosts on this invasive drosophilid no studies thus far have investigated whether a shift of fruit host could affect such a species ecological viability or spatiotemporal persistence the model results show that a shift in host choice can significantly affect the growth potential and fecundity of a species such as d suzukii which ultimately could aid such invasive populations in their ability to persist within a changing environment keywords structured population model stability dispersal plant host shift invasion persistence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the adaptation of non native species to new environments is essential for biological invasion processes which involve colonization establishment and local or regional dispersal events hengeveld 1989 many invader populations have polyphagous habits usually exploiting different host plants which can result in these species becoming pervasive agricultural pests kennedy and storer 2000 studies that focus on plant host shifts are important to elucidate patterns of movement in insects so as to understand their dispersal dynamics and to provide vital information for integrated pest management ipm programs jian 2019 mathematical models are simple tools commonly used to understand ecological patterns of the movement and population dynamics of invader species shigesada and kawasaki 1997 in recent years additional structure be it spatial or demographic has been incorporated into mathematical and computational models as a first attempt to explain how insects move at different spatiotemporal scales and what various life stages contribute to their growth coutinho et al 2012 malaquias et al 2017 models that include spatial structure can offer a new perspective when investigating the movement of insects in patchy environments okubo and levin 2001 moretti et al 2013 models of population growth combined with laboratory experiments can allow the dynamics of such organisms to be simulated over many successive generations based on empirical parameter estimates longer than what is feasible in vivo heaps et al 2016 dey and joshi 2018 structural models that have been proposed in the past have tried to model the dynamics of insect species by incorporating for example probability of occurrence ørsted and ørsted 2019 and the influence of abiotic factors langille et al 2016 reyes and lira noriega 2020 winkler et al 2020 however to our knowledge no model has tried to assess the effects of a host shift on a species persistence in the present study we investigated how host shift may affect the local establishment equilibrium dynamics and persistence of such a species by combining a laboratory experiment using the newly invasive pest d suzukii and a mathematical model of dispersal this multidisciplinary approach is useful to understand how insects may respond to variations in host availability which for example may promote or hinder the ability of such animals to persist in new multi crop landscapes our main objectives were to 1 assess the possible effects of host shift on the equilibrium dynamics and persistence of an insect population using a two patch dispersal model and to 2 parameterise the model via experimentally validated estimates of survival and fecundity for d suzukii 2 methods 2 1 the model and local patch dynamics to assess the possible effects that shifting between hosts can have on a population s abundance we first propose a two patch mathematical model that incorporates density dependent dispersal and resource heterogeneity dispersal is in general an asymmetric process and may have significant consequences for population persistence rinnan 2018 especially when assessing the impacts of climate change and monitoring species range shifts zhou and kot 2011 when introducing explicit spatiality into population models a phenomenon known as turing instability may arise whereby the extinction equilibrium in the absence of dispersal is asymptotically stable but by allowing dispersal it becomes unstable neubert et al 2002 thus including spatial structure in population models may reveal how such instabilities arise and indicate the mechanisms that drive dispersal consider a polyphagous single species population that inhabits two nonidentical patches and denote the patch population densities in generation t z by x 1 t and x 2 t respectively following reproduction on a patch we assume both subpopulations disperse between patches which in turn depends continuously on their respective densities fig 1 our aim is to qualitatively understand the potential effects of dispersal or host shift between two differing patches on the overall population dynamics to do this we will consider a discrete time model class that incorporates density dependent dispersal and resource heterogeneity a general form for such a model is thus given by the system of difference equations 1 x 1 t 1 p 1 x 1 t x 1 t q 2 x 2 t x 2 t x 2 t 1 p 2 x 2 t x 2 t q 1 x 1 t x 1 t p i x 1 d i x g i x q i x d j x g j x i j 1 2 this formulation considers two continuously differentiable functions g i r r and d i r 0 1 that respectively describe local growth on patch i and density dependent dispersal from patch i we assume dispersal is asymmetric d i d j for i j and bidirectional d i 0 1 later we will briefly discuss the case when dispersal is not permitted in either direction i e each patch is isolated a similar model form to 1 was considered by vortkamp et al 2020 who considered a constant symmetric dispersal rate d and local ricker recruitment subject to an allee effect with threshold a they found that on a local per patch scale populations exhibited either eventual extinction or nontrivial bistability existence of two positive stable equilibria when dispersal was permitted they found that within certain parameter ranges dispersal gave rise to persistence of the population and stabilized the dynamics through the appearance and disappearance of what they call asymmetric attractors where on one patch the population approach periodic orbits above a and on the other they approach periodic orbits below a we can rewrite 1 in nonlinear matrix model form 2 x t 1 a x t x t x 0 x 0 where x x 1 x 2 is a state vector in r 2 x r 2 x 0 the cone of 2 dimensional real vectors with nonnegative components and a r 2 r 2 2 is a continuous function that maps nonnegative vectors into nonnegative square matrices commonly written in matrix form cushing 1998 our nonlinear population projection matrix is thus given by 3 a x p 1 x 1 q 2 x 2 q 1 x 1 p 2 x 2 where p i x q i x are as in 1 for i 1 2 typically matrix projection models are often considered when populations show clear stage or age structure smith and thieme 2011 for example when using leslie matrix models leslie 1945 but we will use them to partition our population into two patches each patch with its own vital rates before analyzing model 2 with a x given by 3 we will recall some key mathematical definitions needed for the results described later for more detail on these and related results the reader should consult the supplementary material we say an equilibrium x of 2 a solution of x a x x is globally asymptotically stable if all trajectories converge to the that equilibrium for all initial conditions on the other hand we can also study what is known as persistence which we will now recall persistence characterizes another situation where populations are maintained at or above some positive threshold asymptotically and thus do not necessarily have to converge to an equilibrium persistence is usually measured by a positive function η r n r known as a persistence function this is typically some quantitative measure of population abundance such as the total or site specific population size for example informally a nonlinear matrix model of the form 2 with state space r n is weakly uniformly persistent with respect to a persistence function η if there exists some ϵ 0 such that for any time t 0 there is some larger time t t where η x t ϵ strong uniform persistence means that there is some t 0 such that the persistence function exceeds the threshold ϵ 0 for all times t t we refer the reader to the supplementary material for the formal definitions of stability and persistence for the rest of this paper we assume that the growth function on patch i is given by 4 g i x i r i s i f i e α x i where f i 0 s i 0 r i 0 1 and α 0 for i 1 2 see fig 1 we also refer to 4 as the recruitment or fitness function chesson 2012 eager at al 2012 the growth function 4 is similar in form to the well known ricker equation ricker 1954 x t 1 x t e r 1 x t k where r is the population growth rate and k the carrying capacity in many applications of this map death is implicit as the model is applied to non overlapping generations and describes the evolution from each generation to the next for our application we are not assuming non overlapping generations as this would not be appropriate for d suzukii however it is important to note here that deaths and outward migrations from each patch can be readily incorporated in a growth function of the general form 4 on patch i if r i s i f i e α x i t x i t describes new additions at time t births that survive to the next census the population at time t 1 will then consist of these surviving individuals plus the remainder of the previous population after deaths and migration during the time step t t 1 if we assume that the death and migration rates are also density dependent with the same constant α this can be modelled with a simple term of the form r i e α x i x i for some r i 0 we can then find some constant p i such that r i p i f i r i this then leads to the following equation describing the population evolution on patch i x i t 1 r i s i p i f i e α x i x i which has the same form of growth function 4 with s i s i p i thus for the remainder of the paper we will assume that the parameter s i implicitly incorporates deaths and migrations as well as newborn survivals in vortkamp et al 2020 they assumed local growth was governed by a ricker map with an allee effect but assumed that it took an identical form for each patch we on the other hand assume growth can be different for each patch and do not explicitly include carrying capacities as these are known to be difficult to calculate and interpret in some contexts zhang et al 2021 we took local growth to be parametrized as in 4 which was inspired by prout and mcchesney 1985 who used a difference equation to describe intraspecific competition among an immature d melanogaster population and ultimately how this affected adult fertility and survival in our model we use demographic parameters f i s i and r i which can be interpreted as respectively being the fecundity survival proportion and sex ratio on patch i density dependence is introduced using a decreasing exponential function e α x i with α capturing the population sensitivity to resource limitations i e as population abundance increases the exponent of our density dependence term decreases this is a simple way of incorporating intra specific competition into discrete time models note that the difference in each patch is also determined by the effects of nutrition and fecundity as expressed through s i and f i being different for each patch i e resource heterogeneity these factors ultimately determine if each generation successfully reproduces and survives on a local scale when both patches are isolated the dynamics on patch i is given by 5 x i t 1 g i x i t x i t f i x i t this local model is unimodal meaning it attains a unique highest value or global maximum see fig 1 this occurs at x i α 1 the maximum possible population size is thus given by f i α 1 g i α 1 α 1 r i f i s i e α 1 and so each patch population is prohibited from reaching arbitrarily large values in isolation this maximum can differ for both patches through local differences in survival and fecundity it can also be seen from 4 and 5 that if r i f i s i 1 then x i t 0 as t for i 1 2 there also exists a unique positive equilibrium for patch i x i ln r i f i s i α 1 0 r i f i s i 1 as the function f i is smooth the local stability of an equilibrium can be determined using lyapunov s indirect method linearisation via taylor expansion about x i the local stability of x i is then determined by whether or not the magnitude of f i x i is greater than or less than 1 for details see elaydi 2005 and theorem 3 3 52 in hinrichsen and pritchard 2005 thus local asymptotic stability is guaranteed once f i x i 1 and so x i is locally asymptotically stable when f i x i 1 ln r i f i s i 1 1 r i f i s i e 2 the threshold behaviour that we observe here where stability is determined by whether the parameter r i f i s i is less than or greater than unity is what logofet and ulanova 2022 call the indicator property in a simple model such as 5 we either get convergence to an equilibrium or unbounded growth in the rest of our analysis we will see that this indicator property appears again when we turn to the stability and persistence of our dispersal model 2 2 the assay we reared a population of d suzukii from colonies maintained in the entomology laboratory of the federal university of pelotas rio grande do sul state brazil the flies used for the assays were kept in cages 30 21 17 cm in climate chambers fitotron at 25 1 c relative humidity 70 5 and 14 10 h photoperiod d suzukii was chosen as a model insect in the present work because it is a continental invasive species of high relevance for fruit growing worldwide and especially in brazil the flies received fresh raspberries cultivated without insecticides obtained from farms in southeastern brazil to obtain the first generation fruits with eggs were removed and incubated under the same conditions until emergence raspberries were chosen as hosts as they are subject to high fruit fly infestations in brazil klesener et al 2018 flies that emerged in raspberry generation f1 were placed on either raspberry or strawberry with five replicates in a completely randomised design fig 2 each replicate consisted of one test tube 7 8 cm height 3 8 cm diameter with one strawberry or two raspberries and ten couples of d suzukii after the adults of the next f2 generation emerged they were placed in another test tube containing raspberries or a strawberry this step was repeated in a completely randomised design but now with three replicates each consisting of a test tube with five females and three males of d suzukii from the f2 generation fig 2 then we repeated the entire assay using the same protocols with the only difference being the number of replicates for the f2 generation which was five for the second assay fig 2 the fruits were replaced daily and the number of eggs and daily mortality of adults were recorded over the f1 and f2 generations we observed the total number of eggs laid in each replicate egg adult viability total oviposition period in days and survival time of the adults in days since we only observed up to the f2 generation in our experiment we will use our mathematical model of host shift to simulate the potential long term behaviour of d suzukii based on estimates of fecundity and survival obtained from the laboratory experimental data see table 2 2 3 analysis of macronutrient concentrations three randomly selected adults from each generation f1 f2 and f3 fig 1 were placed individually in eppendorf tubes containing 100 ethanol four macronutrients protein lipid carbohydrate and glycogen were extracted from each fly following lorenz s 2003 protocol and prepared separately for quantification in a spectrophotometer epoch microplate spectrophotometer biotek protein was quantified using 300 µl of coomassie reagent coomassie plus protein pierce biotechnology inc rockford il usa and 10 µl of each sample in triplicate five standard curves were prepared based on concentrations from 0 µg ml to 2000 µg ml following the manufacturer s protocol the absorbance used was 595 nm for lipid quantification we used vanillin as the reagent in a sulfuric acid solution and 10 µl of each sample in triplicate we used commercial vegetable oil to obtain the five standard curves concentrations of 0 mg dl to 2500 mg dl at an absorbance of 525 nm van handel 1985 carbohydrates and glycogen were quantified using anthrone reagent roe 1955 for the carbohydrate aliquots we prepared a 50 µl solution of each sample individually containing 100 µl of sulfuric acid and 200 µl of anthrone the glycogen aliquots were prepared with a solution containing 25 µl of the sample 50 µl of sulfuric acid and 100 µl of anthrone the five standard curves were constructed with glucose used as default concentrations of 0 mg dl to 100 mg l and an absorbance of 620 nm 2 4 statistical analyses quasi poisson models demétrio et al 2014 were fitted to the data for total number of eggs including the effects of assay to reflect the experimental design generation host and the interaction between generation and host in the linear predictor and the natural logarithm of the number of females as an offset term ftests were performed to assess the significance of the effects and multiple comparisons were performed by obtaining the 95 confidence intervals for the linear predictors goodness of fit was assessed using half normal plots with simulation envelopes moral et al 2017 to study the association between oviposition behaviour over time and survival times of the insects a joint model for longitudinal outcomes oviposition and time until event outcomes survival times was fitted to the data rizopoulos 2010 for the longitudinal part of the model we log transformed the count data and included the effects of the assay to reflect the experimental design generation host time all two way interactions between generation host and time and the three way interaction amongst these factors in the linear predictor as fixed effects we also included a random intercept per female given that the number of eggs laid by the same female is correlated over time for the survival part of the model we used a cox proportional hazards model and included the effects of the assay generation and host and the interaction between generation and host in the linear predictor this modelling strategy allows for the estimation of an association parameter which in this study measures the effect of fecundity on the mortality risk rizopoulos 2010 we performed likelihood ratio lr tests to assess the significance of the fixed effects for both parts of the model and a wald test to assess the significance of the association parameter the quantitative data for metabolised macronutrients were analysed by fitting linear models including the effect of treatment f1 raspberry f2 raspberry f3 raspberry and f3 strawberry in the linear predictor the significance of the treatment effect was assessed using f tests 3 stability and persistence results we will now consider model 1 rewritten as a nonlinear matrix model 2 with a x given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 we assume that dispersal is bidirectional asymmetric and a density dependent process in the rest of the paper ρ b denotes the spectral radius of a square matrix b again we refer the reader to the supplementary material for formal definitions and proofs of the results presented below as a first example let us look at when we have passive constant dispersal i e d i x i d i 0 1 for all x i 0 as e α x i 1 for x i 0 i 1 2 it can be seen that a x a 0 for all x r 2 it follows that for any x 0 r 2 x t a x t 1 a x 0 x 0 a 0 t x 0 so we have that if ρ a 0 1 then a 0 t 0 as t thus the extinction equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable this gives a sufficient condition for ensuring patch extinction as is shown in smith and thieme 2011 for general nonlinear matrix models in the context of pest management we are primarily interested in how the presence absence of dispersal influences persistence over time and what drives the population on either patch to extinction eradication we are also interested in knowing if on either patch both assumed to differ in nutritional quality whether the subpopulations persist even at low densities this is a major concern in agricultural management namely small numbers of individuals persisting on ephemeral low quality habitat and then exhibiting rapid growth when favorable conditions arise reigada et al 2018 it is well known that for any induced matrix norm the spectral radius of b satisfies ρ b b horn and johnson 2012 as the l 1 induced matrix norm is given by the maximum of the column sums of a matrix it follows that ρ a 0 1 if all column sums of a 0 are less than unity this implies that a sufficient condition for ρ a 0 1 is r i f i s i 1 this could be interpreted as each patch having either low survival proportion and fertility high fertility but low survival probability or vice versa which intuitively will lead to the eventual decline of the population in the long run for the remainder of this section we consider what happens when ρ a 0 1 so local asymptotic stability of the extinction equilibrium is not guaranteed the results presented below will show that dispersal can lead to patch persistence when its absence could result in extinction on one of patches this is akin to dispersal driven growth or turing instability neubert at al 2002 guiver et al 2017 whereby allowing dispersal prevents a previously declining and isolated population from going extinct a somewhat similar concept to the so called rescue effect in metapopulation theory hanski and gaggiotti 2004 we will first note that g x a x x with a x given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 is strongly positive here the notation x 0 means that all components of the vector x are positive lemma 1 positivity let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 then for any x r 2 0 g x 0 lemma 1 also implies that r 2 0 is forward invariant under g i e trajectories that begin inside the positive orthant remain there for all time in our next result we note that when the spectral radius of a 0 is greater than 1 there exists a positive patch coexistence equilibrium of 2 satisfying g x x proposition 1 patch coexistence let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 suppose that ρ a 0 1 then there exists some x 0 with g x x in the following lemma we show that for a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 the system 2 is point dissipative this simple fact is needed for the results on persistence that follow lemma 2 point dissipativity let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 then there exists some m 0 such that for any x 0 r 2 x t 1 m for all t 1 the previous lemma is needed to establish our first main result theorem 1 strong persistence let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics be given by 4 suppose that ρ a 0 1 then there exists some ϵ 0 such that x 0 1 0 lim inf t x t 1 ϵ for any solution with x 0 r 2 0 this means that when ρ a 0 1 system 2 with nonlinear projection matrix given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 is uniformly strongly persistent with respect to the total population size across the two patches we will next show that a stronger result than theorem 1 is possible as g x with a x given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 is strongly positive theorem 2 patch persistence let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 let η x min x 1 x 2 and suppose that ρ a 0 1 then there exists some ϵ 0 such that lim inf t η x t ϵ for any solution with x 0 r 2 0 this means that when ρ a 0 1 system 2 with nonlinear projection matrix given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 is uniformly strongly persistent with respect to the minimum population size across the two patches as a second example let us look at the scenario when r 1 f 1 s 1 1 and r 2 f 2 s 2 1 so on patch 1 the population goes extinct and on patch 2 there is high survival and fertility for d i 0 0 1 and d i 0 1 d i 0 we have that a 0 d 1 0 r 1 f 1 s 1 d 2 0 r 2 f 2 s 2 d 1 0 r 1 f 1 s 1 d 2 0 r 2 f 2 s 2 and so for r 2 f 2 s 2 sufficiently large one can ensure that both uniform strong persistence and patch persistence occur for example this can be easily seen if we let r 1 f 1 s 1 0 9 r 2 f 2 s 2 50 d 1 0 5 and d 2 0 7 meaning that ρ a 0 16 01 1 by theorem 2 this implies that even though on one patch extinction may be inevitable by allowing dispersal one cannot only rescue the declining patch from extinction but also ensures that each individual patch population persists locally a sink population may become extinct in the absence of immigration or source patches but dispersal can allow the overall population the opportunity to persist for fast growing species with short life cycles and for those that exhibit irruptive dynamics like for example insect species populations can reach and exceed their carrying capacity very quickly likely leading to high intraspecific competition and density dependent dispersal powell and bentz 2014 goodsman et al 2017 low quality habitat sinks that are distributed among higher quality habitat sources can limit the movement of organisms in space and so identifying the mechanisms that limit growth can vary between habitat types heinrichs et al 2016 our simple modelling approach suggests that dispersal and demographic effects are potential drivers of population persistence it is for this reason that modelling population dynamics within a spatial framework can provide qualitative insights into the mechanisms that drive source sink dynamics see fig 3 4 experimental results 4 1 total fecundity oviposition period and proportion of viable eggs the daily oviposition rates per female over time are shown in fig 4 the interaction between generation and host significantly affected the total number of eggs f 1 32 11 05 p 0 0023 the number of eggs laid by females was higher in raspberry than in strawberry for f1 and f2 generations and the number of eggs laid in strawberry was higher in generation f2 than in f1 table 1 when setting adults of f1 generation in first host shift fig 2 available eggs were insufficient to have adults and to set up the second host shift as performed with raspberry the interaction between host and generation did not significantly affect the total oviposition period lr 0 54 p 0 4606 the global test for risk proportionality suggested that the model well fitted the data χ 2 test statistic 3 16 d f 4 p 0 5316 thus analysing the marginal means indicated that the mean period of oviposition did not differ between generations lr 0 10 d f 1 p 0 7473 but did differ between hosts lr 31 77 d f 1 p 0 0001 hence females spent more time ovipositing in raspberry than in strawberry table s1 in supplementary material fig 5 the interaction between generation and host did not significantly affect the proportion of offspring that reached the adult stage f 1 18 0 07 p 0 8004 however there were significant main effects of host f 1 19 6 88 p 0 0172 and generation f 1 20 25 77 p 0 0001 even though more eggs were laid in raspberry than in strawberry see table 2 the offspring were significantly more viable in strawberry table s2 in supplementary material 4 2 fecundity survival time relationship and analysis of macronutrients the results from the joint modelling of longitudinal oviposition and survival time indicated no significant effect of the three way interaction between time generation and host lr 0 81 d f 1 p 0 3678 nor of the two way interactions between generation and time lr 1 54 d f 1 p 0 2145 or host and time lr 2 4 d f 1 p 0 1210 however the interaction between generation and host was significant lr 6 53 d f 1 p 0 0106 as was the main effect of time wald test p 0 0001 since the time estimate was negative 0 0197 with a standard error of 0 0043 we concluded that the oviposition rate decreased over time for the survival part of the model the interaction between generation and host was not significant lr 0 17 d f 1 p 0 6777 nor was the main effect of generation lr 1 04 d f 1 p 0 3073 however the main effect of host was significant lr 6 82 d f 1 p 0 0090 which suggests that insects reared on raspberry survived longer we conclude that high fecundity is associated with a lower mortality risk i e a longer survival time on the fruit given the negative estimate of the association parameter 0 5608 with a standard error of 0 1476 wald test p 0 0001 the analysis of macronutrients shows us concentrations of lipid f3 8 1 11 p 0 4010 protein f 3 8 2 32 p 0 1520 carbohydrate f 3 8 0 19 p 0 8950 and glycogen f 3 8 0 51 p 0 6880 did not differ significantly amongst individuals of the f1 f2 and f3 generations table s3 in supplementary material 5 bifurcation diagrams and numerical simulations in order to parametrize our model we obtained the survival proportion and fertility parameter estimates from the laboratory experimental data by calculating the average number of eggs laid per female individual f i and the average proportion of individuals surviving from one generation to the next s i our parameter estimates can be seen in table 2 for the purpose of simulating model 1 with g i x i given by 4 we must specify a form for d i x i as otherwise this is an arbitrary function taking values in 0 1 for our application we let density dependent dispersal from patch i be given by 6 d i x i 1 r i e μ i x i here μ i could be interpreted as the strength of density dependence on dispersal from patch i with a large negative effect occurring once the density on either patch becomes too large we call r i 0 1 a dispersal scaling factor that can be interpreted as being the minimum amount of dispersal that is allowed due to suppression via pest control by a manager for example another interpretation of μ i can be given as follows if we let the number of individuals that remain on patch i follow a poisson distribution with mean μ i then e μ i is the probability of obtaining a zero i e the probability of no dispersal hence 1 e μ i x i may be interpreted as the probability of dispersing from patch i which decreases faster with a growing patch density an estimate for α was obtained from prout and mcchesney 1985 who used a density dependent term of 0 0064 in their demographic model the sum of f and s the sensitivity parameters for fertility and survival respectively we also set r 1 r 2 0 9 which corresponds to permitting a minimum of 10 dispersal between both patches this choice was arbitrary but allows us to investigate what occurs if patches are not prohibited from mixing another perspective one could take is to vary this parameter over time or allow it to be a function that controls dispersal between each patch for the dispersal function 5 and local dynamics given by 4 we simulated our model for 75 generations for various combination of μ i using the experimentally derived demographic parameters see fig 3 we assumed a sex ratio of a half as this accurately reflects the ratio in the models of prout and mcchesney 1985 we can see that after initial increases in both patch densities trajectories either settle on a stable equilibrium or oscillate around this equilibrium indefinitely we extended the total number of generations to 500 and these oscillations did not cease but increased in magnitude even though both patch populations exhibited oscillatory dynamics they seem to persist in the long run although trajectories approach 0 and then increase rapidly to high densities these boom bust type dynamics are common among insect population models goodsman et al 2017 strayer et al 2017 different methods have been proposed to analyze the parameter sensitivity in population growth models among the approaches used for sensitivity analysis bifurcation analysis stands out bifurcation analysis aims to evaluate the stability properties of equilibria under parameter variations this is particularly useful for investigating the association of ecological patterns of population oscillations with changing values of demographic parameters allowing one to quantify this contribution to changes in model outputs van voorn and kooi 2017 we conducted a bifurcation analysis to test our model s stability in the r i f i s i and μ i parameter spaces see fig 6 bifurcation diagrams emerge from relationships between parameter values and population sizes dercole and rinaldi 2012 usually the parametric space on one axis determines significant changes on the other axis expressing long term population behaviour as a result of this relationship it is possible to observe stable trajectories limit cycles with fixed maximum and minimum limiting values and chaos a regime characterized by total unpredictability that is by the absolute absence of fixed cycles luque et al 2011 we chose to use the product of the demographic parameters in our bifurcation analysis as they play an important role in determining conditions for persistence and the presence of a positive equilibrium for the r i f i s i bifurcation diagram fig 6 we set μ 1 0 2 and μ 2 0 3 to reflect low to moderate density dependence we then simulated trajectories for 4 different points that correspond to varying limit cycle periodicities see fig 7 in fig 6 we see that at low values of r i s i f i we have stabile equilibria as we allow demographic parameters to reach values roughly above 10 trajectories are quite unpredictable in that the period of these limit cycles begin to become greater than 32 many discrete models exhibit similar complex dynamic behaviour like that seen in figs 6 and 7 hassell et al 1991 geritz and kisdi 2004 trajectories may seem predictable for some parameter ranges either stabilising or fluctuating after initial increases but outside these ranges deterministic chaos is generally observed note that empirical parameter estimates give r i f i s i within the stable region of the parameter space for the μ i bifurcation diagram we set r 1 f 1 s 1 20 and r 2 f 2 s 2 24 as the products obtained from empirical estimates showed stable trajectories for all values of μ i thus we were interested to explore what happens when both patches exhibit high survival and fertility the narrow range within the μ 1 μ 2 parameter space see fig 6 where trajectories seem to approach a stable fixed point the uniqueness of which is undetermined show how sensitive density dependent dispersal can be as we increase both parameter values more complex dynamical behaviour occurs which may allude to increased density dependent effects on individuals who remain on each patch this may be because r i f i s i is sufficiently greater than 0 meaning subpopulations have higher survival proportions or increased fertility on their respective patches which can lead to increasing competitive interactions each patch also has a nonzero influx outflow of individuals to from it and this may permit sufficient genetic mixing with dispersal being one of the main drivers of genetic variation in insect species raymond et al 2013 the demographic parameters considered in table 2 determine the conditions for the existence of a patch coexistence equilibrium for values of μ i within the narrow band in fig 6 one can observe that we always have ρ a 0 1 proposition 2 then implies that we have existence of a positive equilibrium and by theorems 1 and 2 we have persistence we have not mathematically explored the stability and uniqueness of this positive fixed point but instead have derived conditions for our nonlinear population projection matrix that ensures both uniform strong persistence and patch persistence 6 discussion the dispersal model employed in this study arose from a classical metapopulation perspective proposed to analyse the dispersal of insects between finitely many patches hanski and gaggiotti 2008 moretti et al 2013 dey and joshi 2018 mathematical models of population growth coupled by migration or dispersal have often been used to analyse population stability by employing the use of bifurcation diagrams ruxton 1996 moretti et al 2013 pal et al 2018 values of demographic parameters and dispersal rates generally have a strong association with the stability of population equilibria moretti et al 2013 pal et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 dispersal has been suggested as a possible stabilising mechanism for populations that inhabit local sinks through what has been termed dispersal driven growth ddg guiver et al 2017 our model results further support this hypothesis for spatially structured populations by showing that dispersal may rescue a species from extinction within a two patch environment even when fertility and survival proportions are low on one of the patches i e one of subpopulations have low local fitness in model simulations we found that including density dependent dispersal and intraspecific competition trajectories exhibit a range of behaviour and are highly sensitive to changes in parameter values it must be kept in mind that these simulations excluded demographic or environmental stochasticity and so although our final deterministic model skeleton seems to approach a positive fixed point after some time these somewhat smooth dynamics might oscillate significantly and may even get arbitrarily close to the basin of attraction of the extinction equilibrium hastings et al 2021 it is important to quantify the stability of these ecological patterns according to different parameter values since they define potential stable states taking account of their nonlinear and highly stochastic nature clark et al 2021 in our model we took account of such nonlinearities through allowing both local growth and dispersal to be nonlinear density dependent functions in the context of pest control the opposite of ddg is usually desired mazzi and dorn 2012 and so our results show that the disruption of common dispersal events could be a mechanism to prevent long term population persistence ddg is an important means for preventing extinction especially for populations that are dispersing in the absence of external immigration from matrix habitat or marginal source patches like for example in agricultural landscapes duelli and obrist 2003 ephemeral patch dynamics whereby patches are sequentially restored and destroyed play a significant role in allowing pest populations that undergo pulsed dispersal to persist reigada et al 2015 even in the presence of control strategies such as the use of pesticides or the introduction of natural enemies pests may exhibit what is referred to as the hydra effect whereby increasing their mortality rate results in a positive contribution to population growth mcintire and juliano 2018 costa and dos anjos 2018 we have not considered habitat destruction or inter species interactions extending our work to incorporate these scenarios may prove important along with increasing the number of patches above the simple case of two knowing the potential consequences that host shift and biocontrol have on the persistence of crop pests is then vital for food security and for understanding mechanisms of controlling invasions bernal and medina 2018 by including spatial structure in models of herbivore pest dynamics managers may have the opportunity to determine what series of patches contribute to overall decline growth of a population james et al 2015 not only does this afford one to know the direct effects of dispersal on a focal host plant but it also could help one understand the indirect role that pest control could have on adjacent natural matrix habitats rand et al 2006 our models demonstrate that in the absence of dispersal and under certain parameter constraints subpopulations on both patches may go extinct but when connectivity between patches is allowed we have shown that both uniform strong persistence and patch persistence can arise given that the spectral radius of a 0 is greater than unity when this occurs we have also found the existence of a positive steady state the stability properties of this fixed point are not known but simulations suggest that populations can either asymptotically approach this seemingly unique fixed point following transient oscillations around it or oscillate around it indefinitely for brevity we have excluded an analysis to determine equilibria stability as persistence is known as a more robust condition that is commonly used to understand a model s qualitative properties jansen and sigmund 1998 ultimately our models suggest that density dependent dispersal is a vital mechanism by which populations can persevere in a spatial context and inhibiting dispersal even between two patches the simplest spatial case could have significant consequences for the longevity of populations in a patchy landscape the bifurcation analysis performed in this study showed regions of stability and instability in the parametric spaces of both the demographic and dispersal parameters the limit of the values investigated in the bifurcation diagrams are compatible with real values obtained in our experiments the instability of both populations of d suzukii in general can tend to occur with higher values of the parameters with exceptions narrow ranges that allow for stable trajectories show the importance of parametrising models with experimental data to see what regions in the parameter space these values lie in parameter sensitivity is a vital method of determining model indicators of variability from a mathematical view bifurcation analyses are useful ways to test parameter sensitivity from a statistical perspective capturing non linear interactions using parameter sensitivity analysis could be achieved by global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua one can use this analysis to see how much variability is contained in inputs given the variability of model outputs pianosi et al 2016 thus incorporating stochasticity in our model is an avenue for further work where one could extend our model formulation along with performing gsua in order to evaluate model uncertainty and sensitivity among the many factors capable of changing the population stability in drosophilids density competition food quality fecundity and migration stand out tung et al 2019 as demonstrated using our theoretical and empirical findings it must be kept in mind that these simulations excluded demographic or environmental stochasticity and so although our final deterministic model skeleton seems to approach a positive fixed point after some time these somewhat smooth dynamics might oscillate significantly and may even get arbitrarily close to the basin of attraction of the extinction equilibrium hastings et al 2021 studies that emphasise the relationship of demographic parameters with the stability of equilibria has long been discussed ruxton 1996 moretti et al 2013 pal et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 there are compensatory mechanisms that can explain the relationship between life history and the demographic parameters involved in the growth rate and carrying capacity which suggests possible compensations for populations in low and high densities as already investigated in d melanogaster mueller and ayala 1981 the availability of food resources can determine the formation of high densities per unit of food substrate in insects and consequently trigger intraspecific competition for food hardin et al 2015 which negatively influences the magnitude of demographic parameters associated with population growth and equilibrium klomp 1964 johst berryman and lima 2008 high survival and fecundity values are generally associated with limit cycles and can even produce deterministic chaos johst et al 2008 polyphagous insects such as d suzukii can resort to fruit exchange because of the fly density on the fruit that has been initially exploited hardin et al 2015 olazcuaga et al 2019 and the changing conditions of a food source can thus enhance competition between flies on a per patch level as revised in dey and joshi 2018 migration associated with food source can also interfere with the population stability they studied different numbers of adults migrating between patches and concluded that the effect on persistence and constancy of the population can be altered by food quality and the immigration rate between patches considered in an applied scenario the movement of pests between different patches can result in damaging economic losses in pest control programs the aim is to present actions that maintain the density of pests in an equilibrium level below damaging economic thresholds zhang et al 2018 wieser et al 2019 bryant et al 2020 so the analysis of parameter values that lead to the loss of stability resulting in unpredictable population outbreaks has an unquestionable utility for integrated pest management strategies costa and faria 2010 in our laboratory experiments the results of the no choice change of fruits showed that the quality of the food source impacted fecundity period of oviposition and proportion of viable populations for d suzukii when exploiting resources in crop edges with different host plants insects in extensive monocultures have little resource choice in these circumstances knowledge of the performance and adaptive potential of invading species is desirable because successful invaders can become major pests at high densities the response of the biological parameters to this host shift showed that disturbances mainly affect the proportion of nutrients necessary to allow immature individuals to develop as already shown for other drosophila species lee et al 2008 matavelli et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2015 the change in this nutrient proportion even evaluated indirectly as in the present study helps to understand the changes in ecological viability of a species the results for the joint modelling for d suzukii considering the association parameter indicate that fecundity can be related to the risk of mortality interest in joint models has recently increased especially for studying the association between longitudinal and time to event processes alsefri et al 2020 in the present study the high number of eggs of d suzukii found in the second generation for insects reared on strawberry may reflect their parental nutritional conditions as insects of one generation that feed on good quality host plants are likely to successfully produce subsequent filial generations matzkin et al 2013 the negative impact of biological parameters could not be explained by the intake of macronutrients a possible explanation is the diversity of the microbiota associated with these insects since symbiotic bacteria can help their insect host to assimilate nutrients shin et al 2011 sommer and newell 2018 su et al 2013 the diversity of symbionts can drastically affect nutrient assimilation which changes with environmental conditions and with corresponding changes to the host food source obadia et al 2018 yun et al 2014 guidolin and cônsoli 2017 even at optimal nutrient ingestion therefore the development of polyphagous insects may be affected by synergistic factors including endosymbiosis as shown for d melanogaster shin et al 2011 and d suzukii bing et al 2018 7 conclusion the theoretical and empirical results obtained in this study furthers the understanding of plant host shift its possible ecological mechanism and biological consequences for insect pests one possible idea that we did not explore but is important to consider is to include stage structure such as in the well known lpa model dennis et al 2001 to deduce what developmental stages may affect plant host shift and population growth in order to understand the dispersal dynamics of insect populations important factors to consider are spatiality and resource availability a limitation of our study is that spatially explicit data is not available for application using our dispersal model although the theoretical model does incorporate such spatial aspects an opportunity that could aid the investigation of ecosystem dynamics lies in the use of spatial networks li and convertino 2021 these could explain extra variability by incorporating additional spatial dependencies explicitly in the modelling framework such network type models would also be useful when comparing model results and simulations to study the eco environmental mechanisms that govern a nonlinear system such as the one presented in this paper and investigate phenomena such as ecological emergence gillaranz 2020 recognizing the explicit movement and within population interactions of insect species will prove to

24295,assessing the effects of a plant host shift is important for monitoring insect populations over long time periods and for interventions in a conservation or pest management framework in a heterogeneous environment individuals may disperse between sources and sinks in order to persist here we propose a single species two patch model that aims to capture the generational movement of an insect that exhibits density dependent dispersal to see how shifting between hosts could alter its viability and asymptotic dynamics we then analyse the stability and persistence properties of the model and further validate it using parameter estimates derived from laboratory experiments in order to evaluate the potential of this model we applied it to drosophila suzukii diptera drosophilidae which has become a harmful pest in several countries around the world although many studies have investigated the preference and attractiveness of potential hosts on this invasive drosophilid no studies thus far have investigated whether a shift of fruit host could affect such a species ecological viability or spatiotemporal persistence the model results show that a shift in host choice can significantly affect the growth potential and fecundity of a species such as d suzukii which ultimately could aid such invasive populations in their ability to persist within a changing environment keywords structured population model stability dispersal plant host shift invasion persistence data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the adaptation of non native species to new environments is essential for biological invasion processes which involve colonization establishment and local or regional dispersal events hengeveld 1989 many invader populations have polyphagous habits usually exploiting different host plants which can result in these species becoming pervasive agricultural pests kennedy and storer 2000 studies that focus on plant host shifts are important to elucidate patterns of movement in insects so as to understand their dispersal dynamics and to provide vital information for integrated pest management ipm programs jian 2019 mathematical models are simple tools commonly used to understand ecological patterns of the movement and population dynamics of invader species shigesada and kawasaki 1997 in recent years additional structure be it spatial or demographic has been incorporated into mathematical and computational models as a first attempt to explain how insects move at different spatiotemporal scales and what various life stages contribute to their growth coutinho et al 2012 malaquias et al 2017 models that include spatial structure can offer a new perspective when investigating the movement of insects in patchy environments okubo and levin 2001 moretti et al 2013 models of population growth combined with laboratory experiments can allow the dynamics of such organisms to be simulated over many successive generations based on empirical parameter estimates longer than what is feasible in vivo heaps et al 2016 dey and joshi 2018 structural models that have been proposed in the past have tried to model the dynamics of insect species by incorporating for example probability of occurrence ørsted and ørsted 2019 and the influence of abiotic factors langille et al 2016 reyes and lira noriega 2020 winkler et al 2020 however to our knowledge no model has tried to assess the effects of a host shift on a species persistence in the present study we investigated how host shift may affect the local establishment equilibrium dynamics and persistence of such a species by combining a laboratory experiment using the newly invasive pest d suzukii and a mathematical model of dispersal this multidisciplinary approach is useful to understand how insects may respond to variations in host availability which for example may promote or hinder the ability of such animals to persist in new multi crop landscapes our main objectives were to 1 assess the possible effects of host shift on the equilibrium dynamics and persistence of an insect population using a two patch dispersal model and to 2 parameterise the model via experimentally validated estimates of survival and fecundity for d suzukii 2 methods 2 1 the model and local patch dynamics to assess the possible effects that shifting between hosts can have on a population s abundance we first propose a two patch mathematical model that incorporates density dependent dispersal and resource heterogeneity dispersal is in general an asymmetric process and may have significant consequences for population persistence rinnan 2018 especially when assessing the impacts of climate change and monitoring species range shifts zhou and kot 2011 when introducing explicit spatiality into population models a phenomenon known as turing instability may arise whereby the extinction equilibrium in the absence of dispersal is asymptotically stable but by allowing dispersal it becomes unstable neubert et al 2002 thus including spatial structure in population models may reveal how such instabilities arise and indicate the mechanisms that drive dispersal consider a polyphagous single species population that inhabits two nonidentical patches and denote the patch population densities in generation t z by x 1 t and x 2 t respectively following reproduction on a patch we assume both subpopulations disperse between patches which in turn depends continuously on their respective densities fig 1 our aim is to qualitatively understand the potential effects of dispersal or host shift between two differing patches on the overall population dynamics to do this we will consider a discrete time model class that incorporates density dependent dispersal and resource heterogeneity a general form for such a model is thus given by the system of difference equations 1 x 1 t 1 p 1 x 1 t x 1 t q 2 x 2 t x 2 t x 2 t 1 p 2 x 2 t x 2 t q 1 x 1 t x 1 t p i x 1 d i x g i x q i x d j x g j x i j 1 2 this formulation considers two continuously differentiable functions g i r r and d i r 0 1 that respectively describe local growth on patch i and density dependent dispersal from patch i we assume dispersal is asymmetric d i d j for i j and bidirectional d i 0 1 later we will briefly discuss the case when dispersal is not permitted in either direction i e each patch is isolated a similar model form to 1 was considered by vortkamp et al 2020 who considered a constant symmetric dispersal rate d and local ricker recruitment subject to an allee effect with threshold a they found that on a local per patch scale populations exhibited either eventual extinction or nontrivial bistability existence of two positive stable equilibria when dispersal was permitted they found that within certain parameter ranges dispersal gave rise to persistence of the population and stabilized the dynamics through the appearance and disappearance of what they call asymmetric attractors where on one patch the population approach periodic orbits above a and on the other they approach periodic orbits below a we can rewrite 1 in nonlinear matrix model form 2 x t 1 a x t x t x 0 x 0 where x x 1 x 2 is a state vector in r 2 x r 2 x 0 the cone of 2 dimensional real vectors with nonnegative components and a r 2 r 2 2 is a continuous function that maps nonnegative vectors into nonnegative square matrices commonly written in matrix form cushing 1998 our nonlinear population projection matrix is thus given by 3 a x p 1 x 1 q 2 x 2 q 1 x 1 p 2 x 2 where p i x q i x are as in 1 for i 1 2 typically matrix projection models are often considered when populations show clear stage or age structure smith and thieme 2011 for example when using leslie matrix models leslie 1945 but we will use them to partition our population into two patches each patch with its own vital rates before analyzing model 2 with a x given by 3 we will recall some key mathematical definitions needed for the results described later for more detail on these and related results the reader should consult the supplementary material we say an equilibrium x of 2 a solution of x a x x is globally asymptotically stable if all trajectories converge to the that equilibrium for all initial conditions on the other hand we can also study what is known as persistence which we will now recall persistence characterizes another situation where populations are maintained at or above some positive threshold asymptotically and thus do not necessarily have to converge to an equilibrium persistence is usually measured by a positive function η r n r known as a persistence function this is typically some quantitative measure of population abundance such as the total or site specific population size for example informally a nonlinear matrix model of the form 2 with state space r n is weakly uniformly persistent with respect to a persistence function η if there exists some ϵ 0 such that for any time t 0 there is some larger time t t where η x t ϵ strong uniform persistence means that there is some t 0 such that the persistence function exceeds the threshold ϵ 0 for all times t t we refer the reader to the supplementary material for the formal definitions of stability and persistence for the rest of this paper we assume that the growth function on patch i is given by 4 g i x i r i s i f i e α x i where f i 0 s i 0 r i 0 1 and α 0 for i 1 2 see fig 1 we also refer to 4 as the recruitment or fitness function chesson 2012 eager at al 2012 the growth function 4 is similar in form to the well known ricker equation ricker 1954 x t 1 x t e r 1 x t k where r is the population growth rate and k the carrying capacity in many applications of this map death is implicit as the model is applied to non overlapping generations and describes the evolution from each generation to the next for our application we are not assuming non overlapping generations as this would not be appropriate for d suzukii however it is important to note here that deaths and outward migrations from each patch can be readily incorporated in a growth function of the general form 4 on patch i if r i s i f i e α x i t x i t describes new additions at time t births that survive to the next census the population at time t 1 will then consist of these surviving individuals plus the remainder of the previous population after deaths and migration during the time step t t 1 if we assume that the death and migration rates are also density dependent with the same constant α this can be modelled with a simple term of the form r i e α x i x i for some r i 0 we can then find some constant p i such that r i p i f i r i this then leads to the following equation describing the population evolution on patch i x i t 1 r i s i p i f i e α x i x i which has the same form of growth function 4 with s i s i p i thus for the remainder of the paper we will assume that the parameter s i implicitly incorporates deaths and migrations as well as newborn survivals in vortkamp et al 2020 they assumed local growth was governed by a ricker map with an allee effect but assumed that it took an identical form for each patch we on the other hand assume growth can be different for each patch and do not explicitly include carrying capacities as these are known to be difficult to calculate and interpret in some contexts zhang et al 2021 we took local growth to be parametrized as in 4 which was inspired by prout and mcchesney 1985 who used a difference equation to describe intraspecific competition among an immature d melanogaster population and ultimately how this affected adult fertility and survival in our model we use demographic parameters f i s i and r i which can be interpreted as respectively being the fecundity survival proportion and sex ratio on patch i density dependence is introduced using a decreasing exponential function e α x i with α capturing the population sensitivity to resource limitations i e as population abundance increases the exponent of our density dependence term decreases this is a simple way of incorporating intra specific competition into discrete time models note that the difference in each patch is also determined by the effects of nutrition and fecundity as expressed through s i and f i being different for each patch i e resource heterogeneity these factors ultimately determine if each generation successfully reproduces and survives on a local scale when both patches are isolated the dynamics on patch i is given by 5 x i t 1 g i x i t x i t f i x i t this local model is unimodal meaning it attains a unique highest value or global maximum see fig 1 this occurs at x i α 1 the maximum possible population size is thus given by f i α 1 g i α 1 α 1 r i f i s i e α 1 and so each patch population is prohibited from reaching arbitrarily large values in isolation this maximum can differ for both patches through local differences in survival and fecundity it can also be seen from 4 and 5 that if r i f i s i 1 then x i t 0 as t for i 1 2 there also exists a unique positive equilibrium for patch i x i ln r i f i s i α 1 0 r i f i s i 1 as the function f i is smooth the local stability of an equilibrium can be determined using lyapunov s indirect method linearisation via taylor expansion about x i the local stability of x i is then determined by whether or not the magnitude of f i x i is greater than or less than 1 for details see elaydi 2005 and theorem 3 3 52 in hinrichsen and pritchard 2005 thus local asymptotic stability is guaranteed once f i x i 1 and so x i is locally asymptotically stable when f i x i 1 ln r i f i s i 1 1 r i f i s i e 2 the threshold behaviour that we observe here where stability is determined by whether the parameter r i f i s i is less than or greater than unity is what logofet and ulanova 2022 call the indicator property in a simple model such as 5 we either get convergence to an equilibrium or unbounded growth in the rest of our analysis we will see that this indicator property appears again when we turn to the stability and persistence of our dispersal model 2 2 the assay we reared a population of d suzukii from colonies maintained in the entomology laboratory of the federal university of pelotas rio grande do sul state brazil the flies used for the assays were kept in cages 30 21 17 cm in climate chambers fitotron at 25 1 c relative humidity 70 5 and 14 10 h photoperiod d suzukii was chosen as a model insect in the present work because it is a continental invasive species of high relevance for fruit growing worldwide and especially in brazil the flies received fresh raspberries cultivated without insecticides obtained from farms in southeastern brazil to obtain the first generation fruits with eggs were removed and incubated under the same conditions until emergence raspberries were chosen as hosts as they are subject to high fruit fly infestations in brazil klesener et al 2018 flies that emerged in raspberry generation f1 were placed on either raspberry or strawberry with five replicates in a completely randomised design fig 2 each replicate consisted of one test tube 7 8 cm height 3 8 cm diameter with one strawberry or two raspberries and ten couples of d suzukii after the adults of the next f2 generation emerged they were placed in another test tube containing raspberries or a strawberry this step was repeated in a completely randomised design but now with three replicates each consisting of a test tube with five females and three males of d suzukii from the f2 generation fig 2 then we repeated the entire assay using the same protocols with the only difference being the number of replicates for the f2 generation which was five for the second assay fig 2 the fruits were replaced daily and the number of eggs and daily mortality of adults were recorded over the f1 and f2 generations we observed the total number of eggs laid in each replicate egg adult viability total oviposition period in days and survival time of the adults in days since we only observed up to the f2 generation in our experiment we will use our mathematical model of host shift to simulate the potential long term behaviour of d suzukii based on estimates of fecundity and survival obtained from the laboratory experimental data see table 2 2 3 analysis of macronutrient concentrations three randomly selected adults from each generation f1 f2 and f3 fig 1 were placed individually in eppendorf tubes containing 100 ethanol four macronutrients protein lipid carbohydrate and glycogen were extracted from each fly following lorenz s 2003 protocol and prepared separately for quantification in a spectrophotometer epoch microplate spectrophotometer biotek protein was quantified using 300 µl of coomassie reagent coomassie plus protein pierce biotechnology inc rockford il usa and 10 µl of each sample in triplicate five standard curves were prepared based on concentrations from 0 µg ml to 2000 µg ml following the manufacturer s protocol the absorbance used was 595 nm for lipid quantification we used vanillin as the reagent in a sulfuric acid solution and 10 µl of each sample in triplicate we used commercial vegetable oil to obtain the five standard curves concentrations of 0 mg dl to 2500 mg dl at an absorbance of 525 nm van handel 1985 carbohydrates and glycogen were quantified using anthrone reagent roe 1955 for the carbohydrate aliquots we prepared a 50 µl solution of each sample individually containing 100 µl of sulfuric acid and 200 µl of anthrone the glycogen aliquots were prepared with a solution containing 25 µl of the sample 50 µl of sulfuric acid and 100 µl of anthrone the five standard curves were constructed with glucose used as default concentrations of 0 mg dl to 100 mg l and an absorbance of 620 nm 2 4 statistical analyses quasi poisson models demétrio et al 2014 were fitted to the data for total number of eggs including the effects of assay to reflect the experimental design generation host and the interaction between generation and host in the linear predictor and the natural logarithm of the number of females as an offset term ftests were performed to assess the significance of the effects and multiple comparisons were performed by obtaining the 95 confidence intervals for the linear predictors goodness of fit was assessed using half normal plots with simulation envelopes moral et al 2017 to study the association between oviposition behaviour over time and survival times of the insects a joint model for longitudinal outcomes oviposition and time until event outcomes survival times was fitted to the data rizopoulos 2010 for the longitudinal part of the model we log transformed the count data and included the effects of the assay to reflect the experimental design generation host time all two way interactions between generation host and time and the three way interaction amongst these factors in the linear predictor as fixed effects we also included a random intercept per female given that the number of eggs laid by the same female is correlated over time for the survival part of the model we used a cox proportional hazards model and included the effects of the assay generation and host and the interaction between generation and host in the linear predictor this modelling strategy allows for the estimation of an association parameter which in this study measures the effect of fecundity on the mortality risk rizopoulos 2010 we performed likelihood ratio lr tests to assess the significance of the fixed effects for both parts of the model and a wald test to assess the significance of the association parameter the quantitative data for metabolised macronutrients were analysed by fitting linear models including the effect of treatment f1 raspberry f2 raspberry f3 raspberry and f3 strawberry in the linear predictor the significance of the treatment effect was assessed using f tests 3 stability and persistence results we will now consider model 1 rewritten as a nonlinear matrix model 2 with a x given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 we assume that dispersal is bidirectional asymmetric and a density dependent process in the rest of the paper ρ b denotes the spectral radius of a square matrix b again we refer the reader to the supplementary material for formal definitions and proofs of the results presented below as a first example let us look at when we have passive constant dispersal i e d i x i d i 0 1 for all x i 0 as e α x i 1 for x i 0 i 1 2 it can be seen that a x a 0 for all x r 2 it follows that for any x 0 r 2 x t a x t 1 a x 0 x 0 a 0 t x 0 so we have that if ρ a 0 1 then a 0 t 0 as t thus the extinction equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable this gives a sufficient condition for ensuring patch extinction as is shown in smith and thieme 2011 for general nonlinear matrix models in the context of pest management we are primarily interested in how the presence absence of dispersal influences persistence over time and what drives the population on either patch to extinction eradication we are also interested in knowing if on either patch both assumed to differ in nutritional quality whether the subpopulations persist even at low densities this is a major concern in agricultural management namely small numbers of individuals persisting on ephemeral low quality habitat and then exhibiting rapid growth when favorable conditions arise reigada et al 2018 it is well known that for any induced matrix norm the spectral radius of b satisfies ρ b b horn and johnson 2012 as the l 1 induced matrix norm is given by the maximum of the column sums of a matrix it follows that ρ a 0 1 if all column sums of a 0 are less than unity this implies that a sufficient condition for ρ a 0 1 is r i f i s i 1 this could be interpreted as each patch having either low survival proportion and fertility high fertility but low survival probability or vice versa which intuitively will lead to the eventual decline of the population in the long run for the remainder of this section we consider what happens when ρ a 0 1 so local asymptotic stability of the extinction equilibrium is not guaranteed the results presented below will show that dispersal can lead to patch persistence when its absence could result in extinction on one of patches this is akin to dispersal driven growth or turing instability neubert at al 2002 guiver et al 2017 whereby allowing dispersal prevents a previously declining and isolated population from going extinct a somewhat similar concept to the so called rescue effect in metapopulation theory hanski and gaggiotti 2004 we will first note that g x a x x with a x given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 is strongly positive here the notation x 0 means that all components of the vector x are positive lemma 1 positivity let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 then for any x r 2 0 g x 0 lemma 1 also implies that r 2 0 is forward invariant under g i e trajectories that begin inside the positive orthant remain there for all time in our next result we note that when the spectral radius of a 0 is greater than 1 there exists a positive patch coexistence equilibrium of 2 satisfying g x x proposition 1 patch coexistence let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 suppose that ρ a 0 1 then there exists some x 0 with g x x in the following lemma we show that for a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 the system 2 is point dissipative this simple fact is needed for the results on persistence that follow lemma 2 point dissipativity let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 then there exists some m 0 such that for any x 0 r 2 x t 1 m for all t 1 the previous lemma is needed to establish our first main result theorem 1 strong persistence let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics be given by 4 suppose that ρ a 0 1 then there exists some ϵ 0 such that x 0 1 0 lim inf t x t 1 ϵ for any solution with x 0 r 2 0 this means that when ρ a 0 1 system 2 with nonlinear projection matrix given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 is uniformly strongly persistent with respect to the total population size across the two patches we will next show that a stronger result than theorem 1 is possible as g x with a x given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 is strongly positive theorem 2 patch persistence let a x be given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 let η x min x 1 x 2 and suppose that ρ a 0 1 then there exists some ϵ 0 such that lim inf t η x t ϵ for any solution with x 0 r 2 0 this means that when ρ a 0 1 system 2 with nonlinear projection matrix given by 3 and local patch dynamics given by 4 is uniformly strongly persistent with respect to the minimum population size across the two patches as a second example let us look at the scenario when r 1 f 1 s 1 1 and r 2 f 2 s 2 1 so on patch 1 the population goes extinct and on patch 2 there is high survival and fertility for d i 0 0 1 and d i 0 1 d i 0 we have that a 0 d 1 0 r 1 f 1 s 1 d 2 0 r 2 f 2 s 2 d 1 0 r 1 f 1 s 1 d 2 0 r 2 f 2 s 2 and so for r 2 f 2 s 2 sufficiently large one can ensure that both uniform strong persistence and patch persistence occur for example this can be easily seen if we let r 1 f 1 s 1 0 9 r 2 f 2 s 2 50 d 1 0 5 and d 2 0 7 meaning that ρ a 0 16 01 1 by theorem 2 this implies that even though on one patch extinction may be inevitable by allowing dispersal one cannot only rescue the declining patch from extinction but also ensures that each individual patch population persists locally a sink population may become extinct in the absence of immigration or source patches but dispersal can allow the overall population the opportunity to persist for fast growing species with short life cycles and for those that exhibit irruptive dynamics like for example insect species populations can reach and exceed their carrying capacity very quickly likely leading to high intraspecific competition and density dependent dispersal powell and bentz 2014 goodsman et al 2017 low quality habitat sinks that are distributed among higher quality habitat sources can limit the movement of organisms in space and so identifying the mechanisms that limit growth can vary between habitat types heinrichs et al 2016 our simple modelling approach suggests that dispersal and demographic effects are potential drivers of population persistence it is for this reason that modelling population dynamics within a spatial framework can provide qualitative insights into the mechanisms that drive source sink dynamics see fig 3 4 experimental results 4 1 total fecundity oviposition period and proportion of viable eggs the daily oviposition rates per female over time are shown in fig 4 the interaction between generation and host significantly affected the total number of eggs f 1 32 11 05 p 0 0023 the number of eggs laid by females was higher in raspberry than in strawberry for f1 and f2 generations and the number of eggs laid in strawberry was higher in generation f2 than in f1 table 1 when setting adults of f1 generation in first host shift fig 2 available eggs were insufficient to have adults and to set up the second host shift as performed with raspberry the interaction between host and generation did not significantly affect the total oviposition period lr 0 54 p 0 4606 the global test for risk proportionality suggested that the model well fitted the data χ 2 test statistic 3 16 d f 4 p 0 5316 thus analysing the marginal means indicated that the mean period of oviposition did not differ between generations lr 0 10 d f 1 p 0 7473 but did differ between hosts lr 31 77 d f 1 p 0 0001 hence females spent more time ovipositing in raspberry than in strawberry table s1 in supplementary material fig 5 the interaction between generation and host did not significantly affect the proportion of offspring that reached the adult stage f 1 18 0 07 p 0 8004 however there were significant main effects of host f 1 19 6 88 p 0 0172 and generation f 1 20 25 77 p 0 0001 even though more eggs were laid in raspberry than in strawberry see table 2 the offspring were significantly more viable in strawberry table s2 in supplementary material 4 2 fecundity survival time relationship and analysis of macronutrients the results from the joint modelling of longitudinal oviposition and survival time indicated no significant effect of the three way interaction between time generation and host lr 0 81 d f 1 p 0 3678 nor of the two way interactions between generation and time lr 1 54 d f 1 p 0 2145 or host and time lr 2 4 d f 1 p 0 1210 however the interaction between generation and host was significant lr 6 53 d f 1 p 0 0106 as was the main effect of time wald test p 0 0001 since the time estimate was negative 0 0197 with a standard error of 0 0043 we concluded that the oviposition rate decreased over time for the survival part of the model the interaction between generation and host was not significant lr 0 17 d f 1 p 0 6777 nor was the main effect of generation lr 1 04 d f 1 p 0 3073 however the main effect of host was significant lr 6 82 d f 1 p 0 0090 which suggests that insects reared on raspberry survived longer we conclude that high fecundity is associated with a lower mortality risk i e a longer survival time on the fruit given the negative estimate of the association parameter 0 5608 with a standard error of 0 1476 wald test p 0 0001 the analysis of macronutrients shows us concentrations of lipid f3 8 1 11 p 0 4010 protein f 3 8 2 32 p 0 1520 carbohydrate f 3 8 0 19 p 0 8950 and glycogen f 3 8 0 51 p 0 6880 did not differ significantly amongst individuals of the f1 f2 and f3 generations table s3 in supplementary material 5 bifurcation diagrams and numerical simulations in order to parametrize our model we obtained the survival proportion and fertility parameter estimates from the laboratory experimental data by calculating the average number of eggs laid per female individual f i and the average proportion of individuals surviving from one generation to the next s i our parameter estimates can be seen in table 2 for the purpose of simulating model 1 with g i x i given by 4 we must specify a form for d i x i as otherwise this is an arbitrary function taking values in 0 1 for our application we let density dependent dispersal from patch i be given by 6 d i x i 1 r i e μ i x i here μ i could be interpreted as the strength of density dependence on dispersal from patch i with a large negative effect occurring once the density on either patch becomes too large we call r i 0 1 a dispersal scaling factor that can be interpreted as being the minimum amount of dispersal that is allowed due to suppression via pest control by a manager for example another interpretation of μ i can be given as follows if we let the number of individuals that remain on patch i follow a poisson distribution with mean μ i then e μ i is the probability of obtaining a zero i e the probability of no dispersal hence 1 e μ i x i may be interpreted as the probability of dispersing from patch i which decreases faster with a growing patch density an estimate for α was obtained from prout and mcchesney 1985 who used a density dependent term of 0 0064 in their demographic model the sum of f and s the sensitivity parameters for fertility and survival respectively we also set r 1 r 2 0 9 which corresponds to permitting a minimum of 10 dispersal between both patches this choice was arbitrary but allows us to investigate what occurs if patches are not prohibited from mixing another perspective one could take is to vary this parameter over time or allow it to be a function that controls dispersal between each patch for the dispersal function 5 and local dynamics given by 4 we simulated our model for 75 generations for various combination of μ i using the experimentally derived demographic parameters see fig 3 we assumed a sex ratio of a half as this accurately reflects the ratio in the models of prout and mcchesney 1985 we can see that after initial increases in both patch densities trajectories either settle on a stable equilibrium or oscillate around this equilibrium indefinitely we extended the total number of generations to 500 and these oscillations did not cease but increased in magnitude even though both patch populations exhibited oscillatory dynamics they seem to persist in the long run although trajectories approach 0 and then increase rapidly to high densities these boom bust type dynamics are common among insect population models goodsman et al 2017 strayer et al 2017 different methods have been proposed to analyze the parameter sensitivity in population growth models among the approaches used for sensitivity analysis bifurcation analysis stands out bifurcation analysis aims to evaluate the stability properties of equilibria under parameter variations this is particularly useful for investigating the association of ecological patterns of population oscillations with changing values of demographic parameters allowing one to quantify this contribution to changes in model outputs van voorn and kooi 2017 we conducted a bifurcation analysis to test our model s stability in the r i f i s i and μ i parameter spaces see fig 6 bifurcation diagrams emerge from relationships between parameter values and population sizes dercole and rinaldi 2012 usually the parametric space on one axis determines significant changes on the other axis expressing long term population behaviour as a result of this relationship it is possible to observe stable trajectories limit cycles with fixed maximum and minimum limiting values and chaos a regime characterized by total unpredictability that is by the absolute absence of fixed cycles luque et al 2011 we chose to use the product of the demographic parameters in our bifurcation analysis as they play an important role in determining conditions for persistence and the presence of a positive equilibrium for the r i f i s i bifurcation diagram fig 6 we set μ 1 0 2 and μ 2 0 3 to reflect low to moderate density dependence we then simulated trajectories for 4 different points that correspond to varying limit cycle periodicities see fig 7 in fig 6 we see that at low values of r i s i f i we have stabile equilibria as we allow demographic parameters to reach values roughly above 10 trajectories are quite unpredictable in that the period of these limit cycles begin to become greater than 32 many discrete models exhibit similar complex dynamic behaviour like that seen in figs 6 and 7 hassell et al 1991 geritz and kisdi 2004 trajectories may seem predictable for some parameter ranges either stabilising or fluctuating after initial increases but outside these ranges deterministic chaos is generally observed note that empirical parameter estimates give r i f i s i within the stable region of the parameter space for the μ i bifurcation diagram we set r 1 f 1 s 1 20 and r 2 f 2 s 2 24 as the products obtained from empirical estimates showed stable trajectories for all values of μ i thus we were interested to explore what happens when both patches exhibit high survival and fertility the narrow range within the μ 1 μ 2 parameter space see fig 6 where trajectories seem to approach a stable fixed point the uniqueness of which is undetermined show how sensitive density dependent dispersal can be as we increase both parameter values more complex dynamical behaviour occurs which may allude to increased density dependent effects on individuals who remain on each patch this may be because r i f i s i is sufficiently greater than 0 meaning subpopulations have higher survival proportions or increased fertility on their respective patches which can lead to increasing competitive interactions each patch also has a nonzero influx outflow of individuals to from it and this may permit sufficient genetic mixing with dispersal being one of the main drivers of genetic variation in insect species raymond et al 2013 the demographic parameters considered in table 2 determine the conditions for the existence of a patch coexistence equilibrium for values of μ i within the narrow band in fig 6 one can observe that we always have ρ a 0 1 proposition 2 then implies that we have existence of a positive equilibrium and by theorems 1 and 2 we have persistence we have not mathematically explored the stability and uniqueness of this positive fixed point but instead have derived conditions for our nonlinear population projection matrix that ensures both uniform strong persistence and patch persistence 6 discussion the dispersal model employed in this study arose from a classical metapopulation perspective proposed to analyse the dispersal of insects between finitely many patches hanski and gaggiotti 2008 moretti et al 2013 dey and joshi 2018 mathematical models of population growth coupled by migration or dispersal have often been used to analyse population stability by employing the use of bifurcation diagrams ruxton 1996 moretti et al 2013 pal et al 2018 values of demographic parameters and dispersal rates generally have a strong association with the stability of population equilibria moretti et al 2013 pal et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 dispersal has been suggested as a possible stabilising mechanism for populations that inhabit local sinks through what has been termed dispersal driven growth ddg guiver et al 2017 our model results further support this hypothesis for spatially structured populations by showing that dispersal may rescue a species from extinction within a two patch environment even when fertility and survival proportions are low on one of the patches i e one of subpopulations have low local fitness in model simulations we found that including density dependent dispersal and intraspecific competition trajectories exhibit a range of behaviour and are highly sensitive to changes in parameter values it must be kept in mind that these simulations excluded demographic or environmental stochasticity and so although our final deterministic model skeleton seems to approach a positive fixed point after some time these somewhat smooth dynamics might oscillate significantly and may even get arbitrarily close to the basin of attraction of the extinction equilibrium hastings et al 2021 it is important to quantify the stability of these ecological patterns according to different parameter values since they define potential stable states taking account of their nonlinear and highly stochastic nature clark et al 2021 in our model we took account of such nonlinearities through allowing both local growth and dispersal to be nonlinear density dependent functions in the context of pest control the opposite of ddg is usually desired mazzi and dorn 2012 and so our results show that the disruption of common dispersal events could be a mechanism to prevent long term population persistence ddg is an important means for preventing extinction especially for populations that are dispersing in the absence of external immigration from matrix habitat or marginal source patches like for example in agricultural landscapes duelli and obrist 2003 ephemeral patch dynamics whereby patches are sequentially restored and destroyed play a significant role in allowing pest populations that undergo pulsed dispersal to persist reigada et al 2015 even in the presence of control strategies such as the use of pesticides or the introduction of natural enemies pests may exhibit what is referred to as the hydra effect whereby increasing their mortality rate results in a positive contribution to population growth mcintire and juliano 2018 costa and dos anjos 2018 we have not considered habitat destruction or inter species interactions extending our work to incorporate these scenarios may prove important along with increasing the number of patches above the simple case of two knowing the potential consequences that host shift and biocontrol have on the persistence of crop pests is then vital for food security and for understanding mechanisms of controlling invasions bernal and medina 2018 by including spatial structure in models of herbivore pest dynamics managers may have the opportunity to determine what series of patches contribute to overall decline growth of a population james et al 2015 not only does this afford one to know the direct effects of dispersal on a focal host plant but it also could help one understand the indirect role that pest control could have on adjacent natural matrix habitats rand et al 2006 our models demonstrate that in the absence of dispersal and under certain parameter constraints subpopulations on both patches may go extinct but when connectivity between patches is allowed we have shown that both uniform strong persistence and patch persistence can arise given that the spectral radius of a 0 is greater than unity when this occurs we have also found the existence of a positive steady state the stability properties of this fixed point are not known but simulations suggest that populations can either asymptotically approach this seemingly unique fixed point following transient oscillations around it or oscillate around it indefinitely for brevity we have excluded an analysis to determine equilibria stability as persistence is known as a more robust condition that is commonly used to understand a model s qualitative properties jansen and sigmund 1998 ultimately our models suggest that density dependent dispersal is a vital mechanism by which populations can persevere in a spatial context and inhibiting dispersal even between two patches the simplest spatial case could have significant consequences for the longevity of populations in a patchy landscape the bifurcation analysis performed in this study showed regions of stability and instability in the parametric spaces of both the demographic and dispersal parameters the limit of the values investigated in the bifurcation diagrams are compatible with real values obtained in our experiments the instability of both populations of d suzukii in general can tend to occur with higher values of the parameters with exceptions narrow ranges that allow for stable trajectories show the importance of parametrising models with experimental data to see what regions in the parameter space these values lie in parameter sensitivity is a vital method of determining model indicators of variability from a mathematical view bifurcation analyses are useful ways to test parameter sensitivity from a statistical perspective capturing non linear interactions using parameter sensitivity analysis could be achieved by global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua one can use this analysis to see how much variability is contained in inputs given the variability of model outputs pianosi et al 2016 thus incorporating stochasticity in our model is an avenue for further work where one could extend our model formulation along with performing gsua in order to evaluate model uncertainty and sensitivity among the many factors capable of changing the population stability in drosophilids density competition food quality fecundity and migration stand out tung et al 2019 as demonstrated using our theoretical and empirical findings it must be kept in mind that these simulations excluded demographic or environmental stochasticity and so although our final deterministic model skeleton seems to approach a positive fixed point after some time these somewhat smooth dynamics might oscillate significantly and may even get arbitrarily close to the basin of attraction of the extinction equilibrium hastings et al 2021 studies that emphasise the relationship of demographic parameters with the stability of equilibria has long been discussed ruxton 1996 moretti et al 2013 pal et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 there are compensatory mechanisms that can explain the relationship between life history and the demographic parameters involved in the growth rate and carrying capacity which suggests possible compensations for populations in low and high densities as already investigated in d melanogaster mueller and ayala 1981 the availability of food resources can determine the formation of high densities per unit of food substrate in insects and consequently trigger intraspecific competition for food hardin et al 2015 which negatively influences the magnitude of demographic parameters associated with population growth and equilibrium klomp 1964 johst berryman and lima 2008 high survival and fecundity values are generally associated with limit cycles and can even produce deterministic chaos johst et al 2008 polyphagous insects such as d suzukii can resort to fruit exchange because of the fly density on the fruit that has been initially exploited hardin et al 2015 olazcuaga et al 2019 and the changing conditions of a food source can thus enhance competition between flies on a per patch level as revised in dey and joshi 2018 migration associated with food source can also interfere with the population stability they studied different numbers of adults migrating between patches and concluded that the effect on persistence and constancy of the population can be altered by food quality and the immigration rate between patches considered in an applied scenario the movement of pests between different patches can result in damaging economic losses in pest control programs the aim is to present actions that maintain the density of pests in an equilibrium level below damaging economic thresholds zhang et al 2018 wieser et al 2019 bryant et al 2020 so the analysis of parameter values that lead to the loss of stability resulting in unpredictable population outbreaks has an unquestionable utility for integrated pest management strategies costa and faria 2010 in our laboratory experiments the results of the no choice change of fruits showed that the quality of the food source impacted fecundity period of oviposition and proportion of viable populations for d suzukii when exploiting resources in crop edges with different host plants insects in extensive monocultures have little resource choice in these circumstances knowledge of the performance and adaptive potential of invading species is desirable because successful invaders can become major pests at high densities the response of the biological parameters to this host shift showed that disturbances mainly affect the proportion of nutrients necessary to allow immature individuals to develop as already shown for other drosophila species lee et al 2008 matavelli et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2015 the change in this nutrient proportion even evaluated indirectly as in the present study helps to understand the changes in ecological viability of a species the results for the joint modelling for d suzukii considering the association parameter indicate that fecundity can be related to the risk of mortality interest in joint models has recently increased especially for studying the association between longitudinal and time to event processes alsefri et al 2020 in the present study the high number of eggs of d suzukii found in the second generation for insects reared on strawberry may reflect their parental nutritional conditions as insects of one generation that feed on good quality host plants are likely to successfully produce subsequent filial generations matzkin et al 2013 the negative impact of biological parameters could not be explained by the intake of macronutrients a possible explanation is the diversity of the microbiota associated with these insects since symbiotic bacteria can help their insect host to assimilate nutrients shin et al 2011 sommer and newell 2018 su et al 2013 the diversity of symbionts can drastically affect nutrient assimilation which changes with environmental conditions and with corresponding changes to the host food source obadia et al 2018 yun et al 2014 guidolin and cônsoli 2017 even at optimal nutrient ingestion therefore the development of polyphagous insects may be affected by synergistic factors including endosymbiosis as shown for d melanogaster shin et al 2011 and d suzukii bing et al 2018 7 conclusion the theoretical and empirical results obtained in this study furthers the understanding of plant host shift its possible ecological mechanism and biological consequences for insect pests one possible idea that we did not explore but is important to consider is to include stage structure such as in the well known lpa model dennis et al 2001 to deduce what developmental stages may affect plant host shift and population growth in order to understand the dispersal dynamics of insect populations important factors to consider are spatiality and resource availability a limitation of our study is that spatially explicit data is not available for application using our dispersal model although the theoretical model does incorporate such spatial aspects an opportunity that could aid the investigation of ecosystem dynamics lies in the use of spatial networks li and convertino 2021 these could explain extra variability by incorporating additional spatial dependencies explicitly in the modelling framework such network type models would also be useful when comparing model results and simulations to study the eco environmental mechanisms that govern a nonlinear system such as the one presented in this paper and investigate phenomena such as ecological emergence gillaranz 2020 recognizing the explicit movement and within population interactions of insect species will prove to be important for both natural and invading species who inhabit patchy landscapes data accessibility statement the reproducible r code and datasets used throughout this paper are available at https

24296,amphibians naturally occur in metapopulations characterized by spatially separated breeding habitats connected by dispersing individuals the rate at which individuals grow to maturity size of the metapopulation and movement behavior varies widely across amphibian species and their compounding interactions play a large role in population dynamics and viability when populations in a connected network exhibit cyclic behavior the level of synchrony between populations is important for assessing extinction risk in addition the qualitative behavior of fluctuations provides insight into the patterns of the population cycles and can be used to predict forward trajectories in time chaotic oscillations characterized by aperiodic cycles and sensitivity to initial conditions are known to amplify noise thus lowering population synchrony however other oscillation types invariant cycles k cycles have not been explicitly explored in relation to synchrony in this paper we investigate the relationship between synchrony and oscillation type for a two patch system of a species with 1 2 and 3 life history stages using dynamical systems analysis we determine the mechanisms that induce the different oscillation types and relate them with dispersal rates and synchrony we find that dispersal has a greater effect on population dynamics of a species with 1 life history stage compared to the subtle changes in dynamics found for species with 2 and 3 life history stages for low levels of dispersal oscillating populations are driven to equilibrium as synchrony increases under medium to high levels of dispersal oscillations may be created from equilibrium with low levels of synchrony in general chaos does not have noticeably lower synchrony than other oscillation types but has synchrony levels comparable to the oscillation types surrounding chaos in this study we cover a broad range of dispersal probabilities and life histories intended for general amphibian systems the variety of results found in our analysis emphasizes the importance of determining model parameters and life history assumptions when studying specific amphibian species to ensure that the resulting dynamics accurately reflect the system keywords metapopulation dynamics chaos metapopulation synchrony dispersal data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction many species live in isolated habitats as part of a spatially structured population or metapopulation in these systems organisms within the habitats or patches experience demographic processes fecundity growth etc independent of proximal patches while dispersal allows for interpatch interactions the consequences of these interactions vary and can range from inducing rescue effects in low quality patches to increasing global extinction risk through hyper synchronization abbott 2011 hudson and cattadori 1999 ylikarjula et al 2000 additionally dispersal may induce changes to the global metapopulation including qualitative shifts in population dynamics e g oscillating versus non oscillating populations and synchrony abbott 2011 doebeli 1995 gyllenberg et al 1992 hastings 2004 ives et al 2003 wang and loreau 2014 ylikarjula et al 2000 the relationship between dispersal population dynamics and synchrony play an important role in assessing population viability for both local and global populations the degree to which populations fluctuate in the same direction i e synchrony has important implications for population persistence highly synchronous populations pose a greater risk for global extinction whereas asynchronous populations are more robust to negative environmental effects allen et al 1993 heino et al 1997 two well known drivers of population synchrony are dispersal and environmental variability abbott 2011 hudson and cattadori 1999 in other words subpopulations within a connected network may fluctuate in the same direction when the connection between them is strong or for less connected systems fluctuations may be driven by changes in the environment i e the moran effect moran 1953 it is generally assumed that dispersal is the main cause for synchrony on a local scale but the moran effect has a greater impact on synchrony when patches are far apart and dispersal between them is limited hudson and cattadori 1999 many studies have focused on the relationship between dispersal synchrony and oscillating populations defined by their variance abbott 2011 allen et al 1993 jansen 1999 wang et al 2015 generally low levels of dispersal may initially synchronize populations while reducing variance whereas moderate to high levels of dispersal may desynchronize populations while increasing variance abbott 2011 bjørnstad et al 1999 dey et al 2014 jansen 1999 kendall and fox 1998 in these studies variance is used to measure population dynamics however the qualitative behavior of oscillations are largely ignored oscillation types reveal patterns in the population that can be used to predict expected dynamics and the mechanisms driving that behavior where many oscillation types have smooth curves and predictable trajectories chaotic oscillations are of particular interest due to their seemingly random dynamics and robustness to negative environmental impacts allen et al 1993 heino et al 1997 ranta et al 1998 chaos is generally associated with low synchrony populations under minimal dispersal allen et al 1993 heino et al 1997 ranta et al 1998 however other studies have observed high synchrony chaos under intermediate levels of dispersal udwadia and raju 1998 ylikarjula et al 2000 understanding synchrony in relation to chaos and other oscillation types can elucidate some of the mechanisms that affect synchrony and subsequently persistence in fluctuating populations pond breeding amphibians are excellent for studying metapopulation dynamics they begin their lives as fully aquatic larvae with waterbody specific survival larvae quickly develop into juveniles within the first year and may reach sexual maturity anywhere from one to six years of age bull 2005 halley et al 1996 mccaffery et al 2012 patla and

al 2019 buxton and sperry 2017 cayuela et al 2018 gamble et al 2007 tournier et al 2017 due to the difficulty in reliably tracking individuals movement behavior is largely unknown but could be driven by factors such as landscape type social behavior and proximity to other breeding sites bowler and benton 2005 bull 2005 cayuela et al 2020 ross et al 1999 semlitsch 2010 amphibians are not known to be long distance dispersers but evidence shows that they may travel multiple kilometers to seek new habitat cayuela et al 2020 funk et al 2005 the consequences of amphibian dispersal vary and include population rescue through colonization increased genetic variation and complex dynamics induced by eco evolutionary feedback loops cayuela et al 2020 mathematical models are used to understand amphibian life histories growth rates dispersal and processes driving population dynamics because of the discrete nature of amphibian life cycles matrix models are used with body sizes discretized

and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 in this paper we explore the effects of dispersal on the dynamics of a two patch model of a species with 1 2 or 3 life history stages we investigate the relationship between oscillation type synchrony and dispersal while identifying the mechanisms driving oscillations our models are parameterized using amphibian literature characterized by discrete life history stage development high fecundity and low larval survival mccaffery et al 2014 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson and hopkins 2013 this work offers a new perspective on the relationship between synchrony and population fluctuations by explicitly identifying the different oscillation types induced by dispersal under a broad range of dispersal probabilites and life history demographics although posed as a general model for amphibian systems the methods used in this paper can be used to motivate model development and analysis for specific amphibian systems 2 methods 2 1 the one patch model local patches without dispersal are used to understand how populations behave independent of all other patches we define models of a species with 1 2 and 3 life history stages models with one life history stage assume that individuals develop into breeding adults within the first year halley et al 1996 models with two life history stages assume that individuals develop into non breeding juveniles before reaching maturation hellriegel 2000 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 models with three life history stages assume an intermediate subadult stage where individuals are non breeding but have demographies similar to breeding adults mccaffery et al 2012 2014 for a species with n life history stages population vectors are defined as 1a u 1 a when n 1 1b u 2 j m a when n 2 1c u 3 j s a when n

3 b 2 s j 1 p ja f h a s j p ja s a with corresponding population vector u 2 defined in 1b pja is the probability of transitioning from the juvenile to adult stage and sj is the survival probability of juveniles finally a 3 stage population assumes an intermediate non breeding stage subadults s with survival probabilities similar to adults we assume that individuals may only transition to latter stages in single stage increments the demographic matrix is defined as 4 b 3 s j 1 p js 0 f h a s j p js s s 1 p sa 0 0 s s p sa s a with corresponding population vector u 3 defined in 1c pjs and psa are transition probabilities from juvenile to subadult and subadult to adult and ss is the survival probability of subadults local populations are projected forward in time by multiplying the demographic matrix with the population vector 5 u n t 1 b n u n t 2 1 1 nonlinear larval survival in each patch we assume negative density dependent survival in first year individuals to represent larval competition we use the hassell competition model to define first year survival based on the number of breeding adults in the same year halley et al 1996 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 willson and hopkins 2013 6 h a l 1 fa k γ where l is the maximum first year survival k is the carrying capacity and γ is the densitydependent exponent other forms of density dependent survival have been used in amphibian models including the ricker model hellriegel 2000 and gompertz model ba ncila et al 2016 bendik and dries 2018 we choose the hassell competition model because of its realism and use in multiple amphibian studies halley et al 1996 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 willson and hopkins 2013 competition in the hassell equation depends on the density dependent exponent γ where γ is inversely proportional to patch size anazawa 2019 for smaller values of γ individuals undergo contest competition while for large values of γ individuals undergo scramble competition hassell 1975 in contest competition some proportion of the individuals receive sufficient resources for survival while the rest do not survive in scramble competition all resources are shared such that individuals either all die out or all survive for extreme cases ideal contest competition γ 1 defines the ricker model while ideal scramble competition γ defines the beverton holt model anazawa 2019 2 2 the two patch model given a metapopulation with two patches and n life history stages we define a patch based population vector u n t r2 n as 7 u n t u 1 n t u 2 n t where u xn t r n x 1 2 is a subvector of length n and represents population distributions for n life history stages in patch x at time t we define a two patch n stage model where each patch experiences demographic processes independent of the other patch and interactions between them occur through a dispersal mechanism the projection matrix a n r2 n 2 n is defined as 8 a n 1 σ 1 n b 1 n σ 2 n b 2 n σ 1 n b 1 n 1 σ 2 n b 2 n where σ xn r n n is a diagonal matrix with entries that represent dispersal probabilities for n life history stages from patch x 1 2 and b xn r n n is the demographic matrix for patch x 1 2 the diagonal submatrices in a n 1 σxn b xn represent demographic processes of individuals who remain in patch x while the off diagonal submatrices σ xn b xn represent demographic and dispersal processes of individuals dispersing from patch x with the notations above the two patch model with multiple life history stages is expressed as 9 u n t 1 a n u n t 2 3 eigenvalue analysis and population stability we use linearization techniques evaluated at equilibrium to determine local stability of fixed points and identify oscillation types using lyapunov exponents fixed points are found by setting j t 1 j t j s t 1 s t s and a t 1 a t a for the appropriate model and stability is determined by analyzing the dominant eigenvalue λ of the jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point the magnitude of the dominant eigenvalue determines whether the fixed point is stable λ 1 or unstable λ 1 for stable fixed points λ 1 asymptotic behavior of populations that start near the fixed point will converge to the fixed point additionally convergence to an equilibrium may occur monotically when the dominant eigenvalue is real node or non monotically when the dominant eigenvalue contains a nonzero imaginary part spiral for unstable fixed points λ 1 nearby trajectories are repelled from the fixed point and will converge to the nearest attractor oscillations occur when the dominant eigenvalue does not have an imaginary part and is less than 1 or the imaginary part of the dominant eigenvalue is nonzero and λ 1 we classify oscillations into three attractor types invariant cycles k cycles and chaos based on the calculated lyapunov exponent see section 2 5 2 4 the jacobian matrix we define jacobians for any time t to allow for temporal analyses because the only density dependent term is in the larval stage all jacobians have the following density dependent larval survival term 10 h t r h 1 fa t k γ γ f r h k 1 fa t k γ 1 a t where r h f l represents yearly recruitment rate the jacobians are then defined as for the 1 stage model 11 j 1 t s a h t for the 2 stage model 12 j 2 t s j 1 p ja h t s j p ja s a and for the 3 stage model 13 j 3 t s j 1 p js 0 h t s j p s s s 1 p sa 0 0 s s p sa s a when evaluated at equilibrium these jacobians are used for local stability analysis otherwise long term temporal averages over the jacobian are used for attractor identification see section 2 5 the jacobian for the two patch model is defined by 14 j n t 1 σ 1 n j 1 n t σ 2 n j 2 n t σ 1 n j 1 n t 1 σ 2 n j 2 n t where j xn is the n stage jacobian for patch x with corresponding two patch population vector u xn 2 5 attractor types we classify oscillating populations into three attractor types invariant cycles k cycles and chaos invariant cycles have quasi periodic dynamics characterized by iterative cycles around a smooth curve with slightly shifting rotations around a closed loop k cycles are classified by the number of points that occur in each period chaos is deterministic but has seemingly random dynamics that are sensitive to initial conditions attractor types are quantified using the lyapunov exponent defined for matrix population models caswell 2001 15 λ e lim t 1 t ln j n t 1 j n 0 u n 0 here j n t is the n stage jacobian matrix at time t u n 0 is the initial population vector and is the vector magnitude note that λe depends on u n 0 but results remain the same with vectors in the same basin of attraction caswell 2001 gyllenberg et al 1992 strogatz 2015 see the appendix for a demonstration of systems with fractal basins of attraction oscillations are classified based on the lyapunov exponent value where λe 0 are k cycles λe 0 are invariant cycles and λe 0 are chaos caswell 2001 examples of each attractor type are summarized in fig 1 because numerical simulations introduce calculation error we identify invariant cycles if λe is sufficiently close to 0 i e λe 0 01 identifying unstable dynamics without closed form eigenvalue analyses is a nontrivial task and even graphical representations of different oscillations may be ambiguous we visually inspect selected results and find that the tolerance above sufficiently distinguishes invariant cycles from chaos and k cycles intuitively the lyapunov exponent measures the averaged progression of two nearby trajectories in time if the two trajectories approach an equilibrium the difference between them approaches 0 for oscillating populations the difference between the two trajectories approaches 0 for in phase k cycles λe 0 or reaches some constant value for invariant cycles λe 0 with chaos λe 0 the trajectories never converge so the difference between them increases as time moves forward the jacobian matrix represents the dynamics of the deviation vector hence the product of all temporal jacobian matrices describes total deviation in time 2 6 dispersal symmetry we measure dispersal symmetry in two ways 1 compare the proportion of dispersing individuals in one patch to the total proportion of dispersing individuals and 2 partition the dispersal probability plane into zones we use populations averaged over the final time steps u xn 1 500 τ 1 500 u xn τ to define the asymmetry in per capita dispersal from each patch 16 α n σ 1 n 1 n σ 1 n 1 n σ 2 n 2 where n σ x n σ xn u xn is the number of individuals dispersing from patch x 1 2 and n 1 n u 1 n is the total population size of patch 1 dispersal is symmetric when α 0 5 and asymmetric when α 0 mostly dispersing from patch 2 and α 1 mostly dispersing from patch 1 we group the dispersal plane into 5 zones that represent different dispersal probabilities and symmetries as shown in fig 2 they are low symmetric dispersal zone 1 intermediate symmetric dispersal zone 2 high symmetric dispersal zone 3 low asymmetric dispersal zone 4 and high asymmetric dispersal zone 5 partitioning dispersal regions into different zones provides insight into expected system dynamics based on dispersal symmetry and degree note that the number of simulations in each zone differs based on cover area zones 1 and 3 have 210 simulations zone 2 has 3260 simulations and zones 4 and 5 have 3160 simulations 2 7 patch synchrony we measure population synchrony between the two patches using patch population sizes in the final 500 time steps this method sums over all entries in the temporal covariance matrix and divides by the square of the sum over the standard deviations loreau and mazancourt 2008 17 β i k cov u i u k i cov u i u i 2 for i 1 2 and k 1 2 the vector u i is defined by 18 u i u i t 499 u i t 498 u i t where u i t n u in t are patch i population sizes and cov u i u k are the temporal covariance measures between u i and u k this method measures the variance of population sizes across all patches and is standardized between 0 and 1 β 1 indicates that the populations are strongly positively correlated high synchrony while β 0 indicates that the populations are strongly negatively correlated low synchrony systems with at least one stable population have perfect synchrony only found with zero dispersal hence even small dispersal probabilities produce cycles across all populations additionally this method is robust to population magnitudes i e vertical shifts in population abundances and measures near perfect synchrony for populations with large amplitude differences 2 8 one patch simulations we investigate dynamics in the one patch model of species with 1 2 and 3 life history stages by varying the range of pairwise parameter sets with all other parameters fixed parameters are based on estimates used in amphibian literature and we try to maintain consistent total populations across the different life history stage models table 1 for each parameter combination we first determine stability using eigenvalue analysis of the jacobian matrix at the nontrivial fixed points when oscillations occur we classify the oscillation type using the lyapunov exponent by initializing each life history stage with 20 individuals and run simulations for t 10000 time steps to ensure convergence to asymptotic behavior the lyapunov exponent is calculated using the final 9000 time steps to identify attractor type note that the carrying capacity ranges from 40000 to 80000 but time series simulations typically have populations with less than 200 individuals although carrying capacities seem high the ratio between fecundity and carrying capacity f k is similar to equivalent coefficients estimated in other studies vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 2 9 two patch simulations we analyze local stability of numerically solved fixed points in the two patch model using eigenvalue analysis and steady state behavior using lyapunov exponents and population synchrony because of multiple fixed points that occur in the two patch model we analyze asymptotic behavior of only one trajectory using initial conditions defined in the following paragraph note that this does not find all alternate steady states as that requires extensive analysis of localized parameters to account for this we analyze a select few scenarios using bifurcation and eigenvalue analysis under multiple initial conditions to understand some of the different dynamics found in our results to analyze the effects of dispersal on the two patch model we select pairwise sa values that initialize the model with a variety of dynamics without dispersal see table 2 attractor and synchrony planes allow us to understand general system behavior while bifurcation and stability plots of fixed points for select parameter ranges provide additional information on some of the bifurcation types and alternate steady states that exist each simulation is initialized with steady states from the corresponding one patch simulation for example in the 1 stage model if adult survival in patch 1 is 0 1 sa 1 0 1 and adult survival in patch 2 is 0 7 sa 2 0 7 then patch 1 is initialized with one of the points on the local k cycle while patch 2 is initialized with approximately 50 individuals corresponding to the stable equilibrium we identify oscillations by running our models for t 10000 time steps and analyzing the range of the final 50 time steps a steady state is classified as an oscillation if the range of any population is greater than 0 01 otherwise the steady state is an equilibrium attractor type is determined by calculating the lyapunov exponent λe in eq 15 using the final 9000 time steps and the two patch jacobian defined by eq 14 finally we calculate population synchrony using patch population sizes in the final 500 time steps see section 2 7 for each pair of adult survival values we test 100 dispersal probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 for each life history stage with 15 pairwise adult survival probabilities and 10000 pairwise dispersal probabilities for each life history stage we have a total of 150 000 simulations for the 1 stage model 300 000 simulations for the 2 stage model and 450 000 simulations for the 3 stage model all attractor synchrony and eigenvalue simulations are in the appendix 3 results 3 1 stability analysis of the one patch model we vary the yearly recruitment rate rh the density dependent exponent γ and adult survival sa to understand how small parameter changes affect system dynamics fig 3 shows contour plots of the calculated dominant eigenvalues for each model the bold lines denote where bifurcations of the nontrivial steady state occur λ 1 the 1 stage model experiences flip bifurcations causing the birth of k cycles while the 2 and 3 stage models experience hopf bifurcations creating invariant cycles additionally in the 3 stage model a transcritical bifurcation occurs for low adult survival and yearly recruitment where the population experiences global extinction this is the only region in the one patch model where the trivial fixed point is stable fig 4 shows where different attractor types occur under the different parameter ranges equilibrium regions are white while oscillating regions are colored based on attractor type and k cycle period the number of points in a k cycle are numerically estimated by finding the last point in the cycle within 0 001 of the final point we identify all 2 4 8 and 16 point k cycles as well as k cycles with periods greater than 16 16 and less than 16 that were not already identified other cycles in general increasing the number of stages simplifies the dynamics i e chaos is most prevalent in the 1 stage model a d a mix of dynamics are found in the 2 stage model b e and invariant cycles are most prevalent in the 3 stage model c f in the 1 stage model k cycles occur through flip bifurcations that undergo period doubling routes to chaos among the chaos regions periodic windows appear as lowpoint k cycles in the 2 and 3 stage models hopf bifurcations create invariant cycles that become phase locked to varying degrees specifically the 2 stage model has large windows of low point cycles high point cycles and chaos while the 3 stage model has fewer phase locked regions of low point k cycles 3 2 bifurcation analysis of the one patch model close inspection of bifurcation diagrams with calculated lyapunov exponents allow us to verify results found in the eigenvalue and attractor plots bifurcation plots fig 5 a c are created by plotting patch 1 adults in the final 50 time steps vertically for each sa value and the lyapunov exponents fig 5d f are calculated using the final 9000 time steps we analyze a range of adult survival values and find that a flip bifurcation occurs at sa 0 58 in the 1 stage model creating k cycles that lead to chaos through a period doubling route the 2 and 3 stage models experience hopf bifurcations at sa 0 2 in the 3 stage model and sa 0 6 in the 2 and 3 stage models additionally low point phase locked k cycles form for a few small regions in the 2 stage model marked by negative λe 3 3 stability and synchrony results of the two patch model we find that dynamics are preserved under small vital rate perturbations and dispersal may induce oscillations even if both local populations are at equilibrium for example the homogeneous systems in the 1 stage model sa 1 sa 2 contain oscillating regions in the scenarios where both patches are at equilibrium in the absence of dispersal b c and appear in similar dispersal regions as the scenario with slightly lower adult survival a fig 6 we also find evidence of dispersal induced oscillations for one heterogeneous scenario in the 1 stage model sa 1 0 7 sa 2 0 9 three scenarios in the 2 stage model sa 1 sa 2 0 7 sa 1 0 7 sa 2 0 9 sa 1 sa 2 0 9 and two scenarios in the 3 stage model sa 1 0 1 sa 2 0 7 sa 1 0 1 sa 2 0 9 see appendix note that dispersal induced oscillations have only been observed under adult dispersal presumably because of the direct effects of adults on larval stage survival fig 7 a c shows the relative frequency of per capita symmetric dispersal α for each attractor type for the 1 2 and 3 stage models and fig 7d shows the proportion that each attractor type appears in each zone in the 1 stage model chaotic results red occur most frequently under symmetric dispersal zones 1 2 and 3 k cycles black occur almost uniformly across different symmetries and zones and invariant cycles blue occur under high dispersal zones 3 and 5 in the 2 stage model oscillations mostly occur under symmetric dispersal with the majority of k cycles appearing under highly symmetric dispersal zone 3 in the 3 stage model invariant cycles occur under symmetric dispersal while the few instances of chaos are found in the extremes i e full dispersal from one patch to the other equilibria purple generally have a more uniform distribution in all three models showing little correlation with dispersal symmetry note that the number of chaos events in the 2and 3 stage models are sparse compared to the number of invariant and k cycles to summarize population synchrony β we plot synchrony histograms for each attractor type in each zone fig 8 for example of the 2498 1 stage simulations with low symmetric dispersal top left panel in fig 8 20 exhibited invariant cycles with 80 being perfectly synchronized blue 1824 exhibited k cycles with 70 being perfectly synchronized black and 654 exhibited chaos with synchrony being mostly between 0 8 and 1 red across all three life history stage models zone 1 has the most mixed results due to low dispersal probabilities from local populations first row as dispersal increases we find more consistency within each zone for the 1 stage model higher dispersal regions zones 2 3 and 5 have consistently lower synchrony than lower dispersal zones zones 1 and 4 for the 2 stage model invariant cycles maintain near perfect synchrony across all zones the few instances of chaos either have perfect or intermediate synchrony β 0 5 and k cycles occur with very low synchrony in zone 3 and high synchrony in all other zones for the 3 stage model we find consistently high synchrony for all unstable points including a few instances of chaos overall low and high symmetric dispersal zones 1 and 3 produce the most variety in synchrony and attractor type especially for the 1 and 2 stage models the variety in zone 1 can be expected since they are reflective of local population dynamics without dispersal however high symmetric dispersal zone 3 may cause rapid shifts to oscillations producing a relatively high number of chaos events in the 1 stage model and low synchrony k cycles in the 2 stage model the latter result is especially interesting since these are the only instances that we see such low synchrony 3 4 bifurcation analysis of the two patch model the results in the previous section only capture trajectories of one steady state even though multiple steady states may exist we use bifurcation and eigenvalue plots of select dispersal probabilities to analyze some of the alternate attractors and fixed points that appear in the two patch model figs 9 and 10 for each σa 1 value we find all nontrivial fixed points by numerically solving for u n a n u n using trust region root finding techniques with 200 randomly selected start conditions coleman and li 1996 see the appendix for details we use these fixed points to numerically compute eigenvalues for local stability analysis to identify all attractors for each σa 1 value we initialize simulations with 100 random initial conditions and run the two patch model for 1000 time steps this ensures that populations start within the basins of attraction for each unique attractor in plots a c we represent attractors at chosen σa 1 values by plotting the population size of adults in patch 1 for the final 50 time steps black dots additionally we plot all numerically solved fixed points for each σa 1 red circles for each fixed point we plot the real part black circles and magnitude blue dots of the dominant eigenvalue in plots d f trajectories near unstable fixed points λ 1 will converge to one of the attractors and we identify local bifurcations and alternate steady states by closely inspecting the bifurcation and eigenvalue plots note that we do not attempt to identify unstable limit cycles as it requires systematic analysis of global dynamics and bifurcations we select 3 scenarios in the two patch 1 stage model 2 scenarios in the 2 stage model and 1 scenario in the 3stage model to show some of the different bifurcations that occur in our simulations all parameters are fixed except for σa 2 which may either be fixed or equal to σa 1 in fig 9a d a 2 cycle begins for low σa 1 that experiences a period doubling route to chaos at σa 1 0 25 this persists until it undergoes a crisis at σa 1 0 8 creating a sudden shift to a stable equilibrium the stable fixed point undergoes a hopf bifurcation creating an invariant cycle at σa 1 0 9 in plots b e a stable equilibrium persists throughout the σa 1 range and coexists with a k cycle that is produced through a 2 cycle saddle node bifurcation at σa 1 0 7 the k cycle experiences a period doubling route to chaos that is suddenly destroyed at σa 1 0 87 via a crisis here a new fixed point is created that quickly experiences a flip bifurcation creating a stable equilibrium the fixed point then undergoes a hopf bifurcation causing the birth of an invariant cycle that appears for a small window finally in plots c f chaos induced by period doubling routes persist for 0 15 σa 1 0 9 an unstable fixed point appears at σa 1 0 6 λ 5 and a pitchfork bifurcation occurs at σa 1 0 75 creating two unstable fixed points as σa 1 increases the unstable fixed points gain stability for a brief window before hopf bifurcations cause the two stable equilibria to lose stability creating invariant cycles that quickly become chaotic attractors the qualitative behavior of the attractors in columns 2 and 3 are verified with phase planes and iteration maps for select σa 1 in the appendix fig 10 shows bifurcation plots and dominant eigenvalues for the 2 stage model columns 1 and 2 and the 3 stage model column 3 in plots a d we find that an invariant cycle with constant amplitude persists until σa 1 0 9 where the dominant eigenvalue loses its imaginary component while the real component is less than 1 this creates a sudden shift from invariant cycles to 2 point k cycles with increasing amplitude as σa 1 increases plots b e show a small window of invariant cycles occurring for 0 3 σj 1 0 4 and another destruction of the imaginary component of the dominant eigenvalue occurring at σj 1 0 65 shifting the fixed point from a stable spiral to a stable node finally in plots c f a stable equilibrium persists for all σs 1 while a saddle node bifurcation occurs at σs 1 0 8 creating asymptotically stable and unstable fixed points 4 discussion in this paper we used stage structured matrix models with density dependent first year survival to analyze the effects of dispersal in a two patch system of a species with 1 2 and 3 life history stages we used eigenvalue bifurcation and lyapunov exponent analyses to identify qualitative shifts in dynamics and the bifurcations surrounding these shifts we observed a variety of bifurcation types and routes to chaos including period doubling phase locking and crisis where previous studies have investigated the relationship between synchrony and population variance abbott 2011 allen et al 1993 jansen 1999 wang et al 2015 or the effects of dispersal on shifts in dynamics abbott 2011 amarasekare 1998 ives et al 2003 wang et al 2015 wang and loreau 2014 ylikarjula et al 2000 analyzing the relationship between oscillation type and synchrony has not been done before our result that populations experiencing chaotic fluctuations are not necessarily less synchronized than other oscillation types challenges previous studies that assume chaos is associated with low population synchrony we assumed constant dispersal probabilities though different dynamics may result under different dispersal rules amarasekare 1998 kendall and fox 1998 ruxton 1996 ylikarjula et al 2000 for example ylikarjula et al 2000 found a variety of results when testing both density dependent and density independent dispersal however they did not find any general differences between the two dispersal types on population variance on the other hand amarasekare 1998 found that strong density dependent dispersal increased the tendency towards complex dynamics the consequences of dispersal strategies are seemingly sensitive to model characteristics including density dependent dispersal type dispersal mortality demographic density dependence type and growth rates amarasekare 1998 ripa 2000 ylikarjula et al 2000 even with simple dispersal assumptions we found complicated dynamics in our results but these are expected to change under different dispersal behavior and rules we found that constant dispersal had a nonlinear effect on population synchrony specifically low dispersal probabilities initially synchronized populations while moderate to high dispersal may rapidly desynchronize populations this was found for high asymmetric dispersal in the one stage model and high symmetric dispersal in the two stage model asymmetric dispersal has been shown to decrease synchrony in especially one directional dispersal patterns doebeli 1995 dispersal type and the number of patches in a metapopulation seemingly play a large role on synchrony kendall and fox 1998 ylikarjula et al 2000 ylikarjula et al 2000 found that different dispersal rules produce a variety of results in the two patch model but have less of an effect on population synchrony when the number of patches is increased therefore care should be taken when extrapolating our results to metapopulations with a higher number of patches we assumed that population fluctuations were driven by density dependent demographic processes however fluctuations and consequently synchrony could be influenced by environmental processes ranta et al 1997 in fact ripa 2000 argues that the moran effect is ever present and should not be discounted when analyzing the synchrony dispersal relationship the effects of dispersal on population synchrony then depend on the degree of correlated stochasticity and fluctuations induced by intrinsic dynamics ripa 2000 because of the nature of cycles induced by demographic processes it is much easier to maintain synchrony among populations with intrinsically induced cycles than a system where population fluctuations are driven by uncorrelated stochasticity ripa 2000 therefore we may expect different results under stochastically driven fluctuations than fluctuations driven by demographic processes although we did not explicitly define landscape geography distances between patches can play an important role in metapopulation dynamics holland and hastings 2008 patches further from each other can create more complex dynamics while decreasing synchrony kaneko 1985 kendall and fox 1998 ripa 2000 bjørnstad et al 1999 the negative relationship between synchrony and distance agrees with populations driven by environmental change as weather patterns are less correlated at greater distances ranta et al 1999 similarly oscillations are more prevalent as distance increases since less dispersal is expected across greater distances although outside the scope of this study it would be interesting to explore the effects of dispersal on different network structures and dispersal strategies chaotic oscillations are typically considered to enhance viability due to naturally noisy dynamics and low synchrony however this may only be true for chaos induced by environmental variation with low dispersal rates allen et al 1993 heino et al 1997 ylikarjula et al 2000 we found that chaos was not necessarily less synchronous than other attractor types specifically chaos was created through one of three mechanisms period doubling phase locking and crisis and synchrony did not experience any sudden shifts throughout these routes to chaos this means that chaos did not have any desynchronizing effects on population synchrony in our models and consequently may not necessarily have the effects on population rescue as previously thought allen et al 1993 that being said it is not certain that all routes to chaos preserve synchrony and it would be interesting to explore other routes to chaos to determine whether or not chaos has any desynchronizing effects in deterministic models the purpose of this research was to investigate the dynamics of matrix population models relevant for amphibian research halley et al 1996 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 willson and hopkins 2013 although we did not focus on any one species in particular our results demonstrate that the interactions between dispersal and demography play key roles in determining population dynamics amphibian species with rapid maturation may experience more complicated dynamics at varying levels of dispersal as indicated by our models with one life history stage conversely the dynamics of species with slower development two to three life history stages are less impacted by dispersal resulting in a higher frequency of equilibrium states and less chaos we present this information to encourage further research using these types of models on a particular species of interest noting the importance of accurately identifying amphibian life histories and dispersal processes this helps facilitate effective strategies that can be used for

24296,amphibians naturally occur in metapopulations characterized by spatially separated breeding habitats connected by dispersing individuals the rate at which individuals grow to maturity size of the metapopulation and movement behavior varies widely across amphibian species and their compounding interactions play a large role in population dynamics and viability when populations in a connected network exhibit cyclic behavior the level of synchrony between populations is important for assessing extinction risk in addition the qualitative behavior of fluctuations provides insight into the patterns of the population cycles and can be used to predict forward trajectories in time chaotic oscillations characterized by aperiodic cycles and sensitivity to initial conditions are known to amplify noise thus lowering population synchrony however other oscillation types invariant cycles k cycles have not been explicitly explored in relation to synchrony in this paper we investigate the relationship between synchrony and oscillation type for a two patch system of a species with 1 2 and 3 life history stages using dynamical systems analysis we determine the mechanisms that induce the different oscillation types and relate them with dispersal rates and synchrony we find that dispersal has a greater effect on population dynamics of a species with 1 life history stage compared to the subtle changes in dynamics found for species with 2 and 3 life history stages for low levels of dispersal oscillating populations are driven to equilibrium as synchrony increases under medium to high levels of dispersal oscillations may be created from equilibrium with low levels of synchrony in general chaos does not have noticeably lower synchrony than other oscillation types but has synchrony levels comparable to the oscillation types surrounding chaos in this study we cover a broad range of dispersal probabilities and life histories intended for general amphibian systems the variety of results found in our analysis emphasizes the importance of determining model parameters and life history assumptions when studying specific amphibian species to ensure that the resulting dynamics accurately reflect the system keywords metapopulation dynamics chaos metapopulation synchrony dispersal data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction many species live in isolated habitats as part of a spatially structured population or metapopulation in these systems organisms within the habitats or patches experience demographic processes fecundity growth etc independent of proximal patches while dispersal allows for interpatch interactions the consequences of these interactions vary and can range from inducing rescue effects in low quality patches to increasing global extinction risk through hyper synchronization abbott 2011 hudson and cattadori 1999 ylikarjula et al 2000 additionally dispersal may induce changes to the global metapopulation including qualitative shifts in population dynamics e g oscillating versus non oscillating populations and synchrony abbott 2011 doebeli 1995 gyllenberg et al 1992 hastings 2004 ives et al 2003 wang and loreau 2014 ylikarjula et al 2000 the relationship between dispersal population dynamics and synchrony play an important role in assessing population viability for both local and global populations the degree to which populations fluctuate in the same direction i e synchrony has important implications for population persistence highly synchronous populations pose a greater risk for global extinction whereas asynchronous populations are more robust to negative environmental effects allen et al 1993 heino et al 1997 two well known drivers of population synchrony are dispersal and environmental variability abbott 2011 hudson and cattadori 1999 in other words subpopulations within a connected network may fluctuate in the same direction when the connection between them is strong or for less connected systems fluctuations may be driven by changes in the environment i e the moran effect moran 1953 it is generally assumed that dispersal is the main cause for synchrony on a local scale but the moran effect has a greater impact on synchrony when patches are far apart and dispersal between them is limited hudson and cattadori 1999 many studies have focused on the relationship between dispersal synchrony and oscillating populations defined by their variance abbott 2011 allen et al 1993 jansen 1999 wang et al 2015 generally low levels of dispersal may initially synchronize populations while reducing variance whereas moderate to high levels of dispersal may desynchronize populations while increasing variance abbott 2011 bjørnstad et al 1999 dey et al 2014 jansen 1999 kendall and fox 1998 in these studies variance is used to measure population dynamics however the qualitative behavior of oscillations are largely ignored oscillation types reveal patterns in the population that can be used to predict expected dynamics and the mechanisms driving that behavior where many oscillation types have smooth curves and predictable trajectories chaotic oscillations are of particular interest due to their seemingly random dynamics and robustness to negative environmental impacts allen et al 1993 heino et al 1997 ranta et al 1998 chaos is generally associated with low synchrony populations under minimal dispersal allen et al 1993 heino et al 1997 ranta et al 1998 however other studies have observed high synchrony chaos under intermediate levels of dispersal udwadia and raju 1998 ylikarjula et al 2000 understanding synchrony in relation to chaos and other oscillation types can elucidate some of the mechanisms that affect synchrony and subsequently persistence in fluctuating populations pond breeding amphibians are excellent for studying metapopulation dynamics they begin their lives as fully aquatic larvae with waterbody specific survival larvae quickly develop into juveniles within the first year and may reach sexual maturity anywhere from one to six years of age bull 2005 halley et al 1996 mccaffery et al 2012 patla and keinath 2005 reaser 2000 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 in post larval stages individuals are capable of dispersing between patches for breeding seeking favorable habitats or escaping predation boualit et al 2019 buxton and sperry 2017 cayuela et al 2018 gamble et al 2007 tournier et al 2017 due to the difficulty in reliably tracking individuals movement behavior is largely unknown but could be driven by factors such as landscape type social behavior and proximity to other breeding sites bowler and benton 2005 bull 2005 cayuela et al 2020 ross et al 1999 semlitsch 2010 amphibians are not known to be long distance dispersers but evidence shows that they may travel multiple kilometers to seek new habitat cayuela et al 2020 funk et al 2005 the consequences of amphibian dispersal vary and include population rescue through colonization increased genetic variation and complex dynamics induced by eco evolutionary feedback loops cayuela et al 2020 mathematical models are used to understand amphibian life histories growth rates dispersal and processes driving population dynamics because of the discrete nature of amphibian life cycles matrix models are used with body sizes discretized into multiple life history stages biek et al 2002 halley et al 1996 hellriegel 2000 mccaffery and maxell 2010 mccaffery et al 2012 2014 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 the number of life history stages used differ between species and describe the time required for newborns to reach sexual maturity individuals may develop into breeding adults after the first year of survival or undergo intermediate life history changes as terrestrial yet non breeding individuals halley et al 1996 hellriegel 2000 mccaffery et al 2012 2014 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 willson and hopkins 2013 breeding waterbodies are discretely defined to describe site specific larval survival with resource regulation that allows for complex dynamics in the system halley et al 1996 hellriegel 2000 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 in this paper we explore the effects of dispersal on the dynamics of a two patch model of a species with 1 2 or 3 life history stages we investigate the relationship between oscillation type synchrony and dispersal while identifying the mechanisms driving oscillations our models are parameterized using amphibian literature characterized by discrete life history stage development high fecundity and low larval survival mccaffery et al 2014 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson and hopkins 2013 this work offers a new perspective on the relationship between synchrony and population fluctuations by explicitly identifying the different oscillation types induced by dispersal under a broad range of dispersal probabilites and life history demographics although posed as a general model for amphibian systems the methods used in this paper can be used to motivate model development and analysis for specific amphibian systems 2 methods 2 1 the one patch model local patches without dispersal are used to understand how populations behave independent of all other patches we define models of a species with 1 2 and 3 life history stages models with one life history stage assume that individuals develop into breeding adults within the first year halley et al 1996 models with two life history stages assume that individuals develop into non breeding juveniles before reaching maturation hellriegel 2000 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 models with three life history stages assume an intermediate subadult stage where individuals are non breeding but have demographies similar to breeding adults mccaffery et al 2012 2014 for a species with n life history stages population vectors are defined as 1a u 1 a when n 1 1b u 2 j m a when n 2 1c u 3 j s a when n 3 where j s and a are the juvenile subadult and adult densities local patch demographics are defined using n n matrices that describe interactions between individuals for a single stage population new recruits mature into breeding adults a after surviving their first year the demographic matrix is defined as 2 b 1 s a f h a with corresponding population vector u 1 defined in 1a sa is the survival probability of adults f is the fecundity rate and ha is the density dependent first year survival see section 2 1 1 the fecundity term includes adult breeding probability clutch size and egg survival for a 2 stage population new recruits grow into juveniles j in their first year then have some probability of transitioning to breeding adults in subsequent years the demographic matrix is defined as 3 b 2 s j 1 p ja f h a s j p ja s a with corresponding population vector u 2 defined in 1b pja is the probability of transitioning from the juvenile to adult stage and sj is the survival probability of juveniles finally a 3 stage population assumes an intermediate non breeding stage subadults s with survival probabilities similar to adults we assume that individuals may only transition to latter stages in single stage increments the demographic matrix is defined as 4 b 3 s j 1 p js 0 f h a s j p js s s 1 p sa 0 0 s s p sa s a with corresponding population vector u 3 defined in 1c pjs and psa are transition probabilities from juvenile to subadult and subadult to adult and ss is the survival probability of subadults local populations are projected forward in time by multiplying the demographic matrix with the population vector 5 u n t 1 b n u n t 2 1 1 nonlinear larval survival in each patch we assume negative density dependent survival in first year individuals to represent larval competition we use the hassell competition model to define first year survival based on the number of breeding adults in the same year halley et al 1996 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 willson and hopkins 2013 6 h a l 1 fa k γ where l is the maximum first year survival k is the carrying capacity and γ is the densitydependent exponent other forms of density dependent survival have been used in amphibian models including the ricker model hellriegel 2000 and gompertz model ba ncila et al 2016 bendik and dries 2018 we choose the hassell competition model because of its realism and use in multiple amphibian studies halley et al 1996 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 willson and hopkins 2013 competition in the hassell equation depends on the density dependent exponent γ where γ is inversely proportional to patch size anazawa 2019 for smaller values of γ individuals undergo contest competition while for large values of γ individuals undergo scramble competition hassell 1975 in contest competition some proportion of the individuals receive sufficient resources for survival while the rest do not survive in scramble competition all resources are shared such that individuals either all die out or all survive for extreme cases ideal contest competition γ 1 defines the ricker model while ideal scramble competition γ defines the beverton holt model anazawa 2019 2 2 the two patch model given a metapopulation with two patches and n life history stages we define a patch based population vector u n t r2 n as 7 u n t u 1 n t u 2 n t where u xn t r n x 1 2 is a subvector of length n and represents population distributions for n life history stages in patch x at time t we define a two patch n stage model where each patch experiences demographic processes independent of the other patch and interactions between them occur through a dispersal mechanism the projection matrix a n r2 n 2 n is defined as 8 a n 1 σ 1 n b 1 n σ 2 n b 2 n σ 1 n b 1 n 1 σ 2 n b 2 n where σ xn r n n is a diagonal matrix with entries that represent dispersal probabilities for n life history stages from patch x 1 2 and b xn r n n is the demographic matrix for patch x 1 2 the diagonal submatrices in a n 1 σxn b xn represent demographic processes of individuals who remain in patch x while the off diagonal submatrices σ xn b xn represent demographic and dispersal processes of individuals dispersing from patch x with the notations above the two patch model with multiple life history stages is expressed as 9 u n t 1 a n u n t 2 3 eigenvalue analysis and population stability we use linearization techniques evaluated at equilibrium to determine local stability of fixed points and identify oscillation types using lyapunov exponents fixed points are found by setting j t 1 j t j s t 1 s t s and a t 1 a t a for the appropriate model and stability is determined by analyzing the dominant eigenvalue λ of the jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point the magnitude of the dominant eigenvalue determines whether the fixed point is stable λ 1 or unstable λ 1 for stable fixed points λ 1 asymptotic behavior of populations that start near the fixed point will converge to the fixed point additionally convergence to an equilibrium may occur monotically when the dominant eigenvalue is real node or non monotically when the dominant eigenvalue contains a nonzero imaginary part spiral for unstable fixed points λ 1 nearby trajectories are repelled from the fixed point and will converge to the nearest attractor oscillations occur when the dominant eigenvalue does not have an imaginary part and is less than 1 or the imaginary part of the dominant eigenvalue is nonzero and λ 1 we classify oscillations into three attractor types invariant cycles k cycles and chaos based on the calculated lyapunov exponent see section 2 5 2 4 the jacobian matrix we define jacobians for any time t to allow for temporal analyses because the only density dependent term is in the larval stage all jacobians have the following density dependent larval survival term 10 h t r h 1 fa t k γ γ f r h k 1 fa t k γ 1 a t where r h f l represents yearly recruitment rate the jacobians are then defined as for the 1 stage model 11 j 1 t s a h t for the 2 stage model 12 j 2 t s j 1 p ja h t s j p ja s a and for the 3 stage model 13 j 3 t s j 1 p js 0 h t s j p s s s 1 p sa 0 0 s s p sa s a when evaluated at equilibrium these jacobians are used for local stability analysis otherwise long term temporal averages over the jacobian are used for attractor identification see section 2 5 the jacobian for the two patch model is defined by 14 j n t 1 σ 1 n j 1 n t σ 2 n j 2 n t σ 1 n j 1 n t 1 σ 2 n j 2 n t where j xn is the n stage jacobian for patch x with corresponding two patch population vector u xn 2 5 attractor types we classify oscillating populations into three attractor types invariant cycles k cycles and chaos invariant cycles have quasi periodic dynamics characterized by iterative cycles around a smooth curve with slightly shifting rotations around a closed loop k cycles are classified by the number of points that occur in each period chaos is deterministic but has seemingly random dynamics that are sensitive to initial conditions attractor types are quantified using the lyapunov exponent defined for matrix population models caswell 2001 15 λ e lim t 1 t ln j n t 1 j n 0 u n 0 here j n t is the n stage jacobian matrix at time t u n 0 is the initial population vector and is the vector magnitude note that λe depends on u n 0 but results remain the same with vectors in the same basin of attraction caswell 2001 gyllenberg et al 1992 strogatz 2015 see the appendix for a demonstration of systems with fractal basins of attraction oscillations are classified based on the lyapunov exponent value where λe 0 are k cycles λe 0 are invariant cycles and λe 0 are chaos caswell 2001 examples of each attractor type are summarized in fig 1 because numerical simulations introduce calculation error we identify invariant cycles if λe is sufficiently close to 0 i e λe 0 01 identifying unstable dynamics without closed form eigenvalue analyses is a nontrivial task and even graphical representations of different oscillations may be ambiguous we visually inspect selected results and find that the tolerance above sufficiently distinguishes invariant cycles from chaos and k cycles intuitively the lyapunov exponent measures the averaged progression of two nearby trajectories in time if the two trajectories approach an equilibrium the difference between them approaches 0 for oscillating populations the difference between the two trajectories approaches 0 for in phase k cycles λe 0 or reaches some constant value for invariant cycles λe 0 with chaos λe 0 the trajectories never converge so the difference between them increases as time moves forward the jacobian matrix represents the dynamics of the deviation vector hence the product of all temporal jacobian matrices describes total deviation in time 2 6 dispersal symmetry we measure dispersal symmetry in two ways 1 compare the proportion of dispersing individuals in one patch to the total proportion of dispersing individuals and 2 partition the dispersal probability plane into zones we use populations averaged over the final time steps u xn 1 500 τ 1 500 u xn τ to define the asymmetry in per capita dispersal from each patch 16 α n σ 1 n 1 n σ 1 n 1 n σ 2 n 2 where n σ x n σ xn u xn is the number of individuals dispersing from patch x 1 2 and n 1 n u 1 n is the total population size of patch 1 dispersal is symmetric when α 0 5 and asymmetric when α 0 mostly dispersing from patch 2 and α 1 mostly dispersing from patch 1 we group the dispersal plane into 5 zones that represent different dispersal probabilities and symmetries as shown in fig 2 they are low symmetric dispersal zone 1 intermediate symmetric dispersal zone 2 high symmetric dispersal zone 3 low asymmetric dispersal zone 4 and high asymmetric dispersal zone 5 partitioning dispersal regions into different zones provides insight into expected system dynamics based on dispersal symmetry and degree note that the number of simulations in each zone differs based on cover area zones 1 and 3 have 210 simulations zone 2 has 3260 simulations and zones 4 and 5 have 3160 simulations 2 7 patch synchrony we measure population synchrony between the two patches using patch population sizes in the final 500 time steps this method sums over all entries in the temporal covariance matrix and divides by the square of the sum over the standard deviations loreau and mazancourt 2008 17 β i k cov u i u k i cov u i u i 2 for i 1 2 and k 1 2 the vector u i is defined by 18 u i u i t 499 u i t 498 u i t where u i t n u in t are patch i population sizes and cov u i u k are the temporal covariance measures between u i and u k this method measures the variance of population sizes across all patches and is standardized between 0 and 1 β 1 indicates that the populations are strongly positively correlated high synchrony while β 0 indicates that the populations are strongly negatively correlated low synchrony systems with at least one stable population have perfect synchrony only found with zero dispersal hence even small dispersal probabilities produce cycles across all populations additionally this method is robust to population magnitudes i e vertical shifts in population abundances and measures near perfect synchrony for populations with large amplitude differences 2 8 one patch simulations we investigate dynamics in the one patch model of species with 1 2 and 3 life history stages by varying the range of pairwise parameter sets with all other parameters fixed parameters are based on estimates used in amphibian literature and we try to maintain consistent total populations across the different life history stage models table 1 for each parameter combination we first determine stability using eigenvalue analysis of the jacobian matrix at the nontrivial fixed points when oscillations occur we classify the oscillation type using the lyapunov exponent by initializing each life history stage with 20 individuals and run simulations for t 10000 time steps to ensure convergence to asymptotic behavior the lyapunov exponent is calculated using the final 9000 time steps to identify attractor type note that the carrying capacity ranges from 40000 to 80000 but time series simulations typically have populations with less than 200 individuals although carrying capacities seem high the ratio between fecundity and carrying capacity f k is similar to equivalent coefficients estimated in other studies vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 2 9 two patch simulations we analyze local stability of numerically solved fixed points in the two patch model using eigenvalue analysis and steady state behavior using lyapunov exponents and population synchrony because of multiple fixed points that occur in the two patch model we analyze asymptotic behavior of only one trajectory using initial conditions defined in the following paragraph note that this does not find all alternate steady states as that requires extensive analysis of localized parameters to account for this we analyze a select few scenarios using bifurcation and eigenvalue analysis under multiple initial conditions to understand some of the different dynamics found in our results to analyze the effects of dispersal on the two patch model we select pairwise sa values that initialize the model with a variety of dynamics without dispersal see table 2 attractor and synchrony planes allow us to understand general system behavior while bifurcation and stability plots of fixed points for select parameter ranges provide additional information on some of the bifurcation types and alternate steady states that exist each simulation is initialized with steady states from the corresponding one patch simulation for example in the 1 stage model if adult survival in patch 1 is 0 1 sa 1 0 1 and adult survival in patch 2 is 0 7 sa 2 0 7 then patch 1 is initialized with one of the points on the local k cycle while patch 2 is initialized with approximately 50 individuals corresponding to the stable equilibrium we identify oscillations by running our models for t 10000 time steps and analyzing the range of the final 50 time steps a steady state is classified as an oscillation if the range of any population is greater than 0 01 otherwise the steady state is an equilibrium attractor type is determined by calculating the lyapunov exponent λe in eq 15 using the final 9000 time steps and the two patch jacobian defined by eq 14 finally we calculate population synchrony using patch population sizes in the final 500 time steps see section 2 7 for each pair of adult survival values we test 100 dispersal probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 for each life history stage with 15 pairwise adult survival probabilities and 10000 pairwise dispersal probabilities for each life history stage we have a total of 150 000 simulations for the 1 stage model 300 000 simulations for the 2 stage model and 450 000 simulations for the 3 stage model all attractor synchrony and eigenvalue simulations are in the appendix 3 results 3 1 stability analysis of the one patch model we vary the yearly recruitment rate rh the density dependent exponent γ and adult survival sa to understand how small parameter changes affect system dynamics fig 3 shows contour plots of the calculated dominant eigenvalues for each model the bold lines denote where bifurcations of the nontrivial steady state occur λ 1 the 1 stage model experiences flip bifurcations causing the birth of k cycles while the 2 and 3 stage models experience hopf bifurcations creating invariant cycles additionally in the 3 stage model a transcritical bifurcation occurs for low adult survival and yearly recruitment where the population experiences global extinction this is the only region in the one patch model where the trivial fixed point is stable fig 4 shows where different attractor types occur under the different parameter ranges equilibrium regions are white while oscillating regions are colored based on attractor type and k cycle period the number of points in a k cycle are numerically estimated by finding the last point in the cycle within 0 001 of the final point we identify all 2 4 8 and 16 point k cycles as well as k cycles with periods greater than 16 16 and less than 16 that were not already identified other cycles in general increasing the number of stages simplifies the dynamics i e chaos is most prevalent in the 1 stage model a d a mix of dynamics are found in the 2 stage model b e and invariant cycles are most prevalent in the 3 stage model c f in the 1 stage model k cycles occur through flip bifurcations that undergo period doubling routes to chaos among the chaos regions periodic windows appear as lowpoint k cycles in the 2 and 3 stage models hopf bifurcations create invariant cycles that become phase locked to varying degrees specifically the 2 stage model has large windows of low point cycles high point cycles and chaos while the 3 stage model has fewer phase locked regions of low point k cycles 3 2 bifurcation analysis of the one patch model close inspection of bifurcation diagrams with calculated lyapunov exponents allow us to verify results found in the eigenvalue and attractor plots bifurcation plots fig 5 a c are created by plotting patch 1 adults in the final 50 time steps vertically for each sa value and the lyapunov exponents fig 5d f are calculated using the final 9000 time steps we analyze a range of adult survival values and find that a flip bifurcation occurs at sa 0 58 in the 1 stage model creating k cycles that lead to chaos through a period doubling route the 2 and 3 stage models experience hopf bifurcations at sa 0 2 in the 3 stage model and sa 0 6 in the 2 and 3 stage models additionally low point phase locked k cycles form for a few small regions in the 2 stage model marked by negative λe 3 3 stability and synchrony results of the two patch model we find that dynamics are preserved under small vital rate perturbations and dispersal may induce oscillations even if both local populations are at equilibrium for example the homogeneous systems in the 1 stage model sa 1 sa 2 contain oscillating regions in the scenarios where both patches are at equilibrium in the absence of dispersal b c and appear in similar dispersal regions as the scenario with slightly lower adult survival a fig 6 we also find evidence of dispersal induced oscillations for one heterogeneous scenario in the 1 stage model sa 1 0 7 sa 2 0 9 three scenarios in the 2 stage model sa 1 sa 2 0 7 sa 1 0 7 sa 2 0 9 sa 1 sa 2 0 9 and two scenarios in the 3 stage model sa 1 0 1 sa 2 0 7 sa 1 0 1 sa 2 0 9 see appendix note that dispersal induced oscillations have only been observed under adult dispersal presumably because of the direct effects of adults on larval stage survival fig 7 a c shows the relative frequency of per capita symmetric dispersal α for each attractor type for the 1 2 and 3 stage models and fig 7d shows the proportion that each attractor type appears in each zone in the 1 stage model chaotic results red occur most frequently under symmetric dispersal zones 1 2 and 3 k cycles black occur almost uniformly across different symmetries and zones and invariant cycles blue occur under high dispersal zones 3 and 5 in the 2 stage model oscillations mostly occur under symmetric dispersal with the majority of k cycles appearing under highly symmetric dispersal zone 3 in the 3 stage model invariant cycles occur under symmetric dispersal while the few instances of chaos are found in the extremes i e full dispersal from one patch to the other equilibria purple generally have a more uniform distribution in all three models showing little correlation with dispersal symmetry note that the number of chaos events in the 2and 3 stage models are sparse compared to the number of invariant and k cycles to summarize population synchrony β we plot synchrony histograms for each attractor type in each zone fig 8 for example of the 2498 1 stage simulations with low symmetric dispersal top left panel in fig 8 20 exhibited invariant cycles with 80 being perfectly synchronized blue 1824 exhibited k cycles with 70 being perfectly synchronized black and 654 exhibited chaos with synchrony being mostly between 0 8 and 1 red across all three life history stage models zone 1 has the most mixed results due to low dispersal probabilities from local populations first row as dispersal increases we find more consistency within each zone for the 1 stage model higher dispersal regions zones 2 3 and 5 have consistently lower synchrony than lower dispersal zones zones 1 and 4 for the 2 stage model invariant cycles maintain near perfect synchrony across all zones the few instances of chaos either have perfect or intermediate synchrony β 0 5 and k cycles occur with very low synchrony in zone 3 and high synchrony in all other zones for the 3 stage model we find consistently high synchrony for all unstable points including a few instances of chaos overall low and high symmetric dispersal zones 1 and 3 produce the most variety in synchrony and attractor type especially for the 1 and 2 stage models the variety in zone 1 can be expected since they are reflective of local population dynamics without dispersal however high symmetric dispersal zone 3 may cause rapid shifts to oscillations producing a relatively high number of chaos events in the 1 stage model and low synchrony k cycles in the 2 stage model the latter result is especially interesting since these are the only instances that we see such low synchrony 3 4 bifurcation analysis of the two patch model the results in the previous section only capture trajectories of one steady state even though multiple steady states may exist we use bifurcation and eigenvalue plots of select dispersal probabilities to analyze some of the alternate attractors and fixed points that appear in the two patch model figs 9 and 10 for each σa 1 value we find all nontrivial fixed points by numerically solving for u n a n u n using trust region root finding techniques with 200 randomly selected start conditions coleman and li 1996 see the appendix for details we use these fixed points to numerically compute eigenvalues for local stability analysis to identify all attractors for each σa 1 value we initialize simulations with 100 random initial conditions and run the two patch model for 1000 time steps this ensures that populations start within the basins of attraction for each unique attractor in plots a c we represent attractors at chosen σa 1 values by plotting the population size of adults in patch 1 for the final 50 time steps black dots additionally we plot all numerically solved fixed points for each σa 1 red circles for each fixed point we plot the real part black circles and magnitude blue dots of the dominant eigenvalue in plots d f trajectories near unstable fixed points λ 1 will converge to one of the attractors and we identify local bifurcations and alternate steady states by closely inspecting the bifurcation and eigenvalue plots note that we do not attempt to identify unstable limit cycles as it requires systematic analysis of global dynamics and bifurcations we select 3 scenarios in the two patch 1 stage model 2 scenarios in the 2 stage model and 1 scenario in the 3stage model to show some of the different bifurcations that occur in our simulations all parameters are fixed except for σa 2 which may either be fixed or equal to σa 1 in fig 9a d a 2 cycle begins for low σa 1 that experiences a period doubling route to chaos at σa 1 0 25 this persists until it undergoes a crisis at σa 1 0 8 creating a sudden shift to a stable equilibrium the stable fixed point undergoes a hopf bifurcation creating an invariant cycle at σa 1 0 9 in plots b e a stable equilibrium persists throughout the σa 1 range and coexists with a k cycle that is produced through a 2 cycle saddle node bifurcation at σa 1 0 7 the k cycle experiences a period doubling route to chaos that is suddenly destroyed at σa 1 0 87 via a crisis here a new fixed point is created that quickly experiences a flip bifurcation creating a stable equilibrium the fixed point then undergoes a hopf bifurcation causing the birth of an invariant cycle that appears for a small window finally in plots c f chaos induced by period doubling routes persist for 0 15 σa 1 0 9 an unstable fixed point appears at σa 1 0 6 λ 5 and a pitchfork bifurcation occurs at σa 1 0 75 creating two unstable fixed points as σa 1 increases the unstable fixed points gain stability for a brief window before hopf bifurcations cause the two stable equilibria to lose stability creating invariant cycles that quickly become chaotic attractors the qualitative behavior of the attractors in columns 2 and 3 are verified with phase planes and iteration maps for select σa 1 in the appendix fig 10 shows bifurcation plots and dominant eigenvalues for the 2 stage model columns 1 and 2 and the 3 stage model column 3 in plots a d we find that an invariant cycle with constant amplitude persists until σa 1 0 9 where the dominant eigenvalue loses its imaginary component while the real component is less than 1 this creates a sudden shift from invariant cycles to 2 point k cycles with increasing amplitude as σa 1 increases plots b e show a small window of invariant cycles occurring for 0 3 σj 1 0 4 and another destruction of the imaginary component of the dominant eigenvalue occurring at σj 1 0 65 shifting the fixed point from a stable spiral to a stable node finally in plots c f a stable equilibrium persists for all σs 1 while a saddle node bifurcation occurs at σs 1 0 8 creating asymptotically stable and unstable fixed points 4 discussion in this paper we used stage structured matrix models with density dependent first year survival to analyze the effects of dispersal in a two patch system of a species with 1 2 and 3 life history stages we used eigenvalue bifurcation and lyapunov exponent analyses to identify qualitative shifts in dynamics and the bifurcations surrounding these shifts we observed a variety of bifurcation types and routes to chaos including period doubling phase locking and crisis where previous studies have investigated the relationship between synchrony and population variance abbott 2011 allen et al 1993 jansen 1999 wang et al 2015 or the effects of dispersal on shifts in dynamics abbott 2011 amarasekare 1998 ives et al 2003 wang et al 2015 wang and loreau 2014 ylikarjula et al 2000 analyzing the relationship between oscillation type and synchrony has not been done before our result that populations experiencing chaotic fluctuations are not necessarily less synchronized than other oscillation types challenges previous studies that assume chaos is associated with low population synchrony we assumed constant dispersal probabilities though different dynamics may result under different dispersal rules amarasekare 1998 kendall and fox 1998 ruxton 1996 ylikarjula et al 2000 for example ylikarjula et al 2000 found a variety of results when testing both density dependent and density independent dispersal however they did not find any general differences between the two dispersal types on population variance on the other hand amarasekare 1998 found that strong density dependent dispersal increased the tendency towards complex dynamics the consequences of dispersal strategies are seemingly sensitive to model characteristics including density dependent dispersal type dispersal mortality demographic density dependence type and growth rates amarasekare 1998 ripa 2000 ylikarjula et al 2000 even with simple dispersal assumptions we found complicated dynamics in our results but these are expected to change under different dispersal behavior and rules we found that constant dispersal had a nonlinear effect on population synchrony specifically low dispersal probabilities initially synchronized populations while moderate to high dispersal may rapidly desynchronize populations this was found for high asymmetric dispersal in the one stage model and high symmetric dispersal in the two stage model asymmetric dispersal has been shown to decrease synchrony in especially one directional dispersal patterns doebeli 1995 dispersal type and the number of patches in a metapopulation seemingly play a large role on synchrony kendall and fox 1998 ylikarjula et al 2000 ylikarjula et al 2000 found that different dispersal rules produce a variety of results in the two patch model but have less of an effect on population synchrony when the number of patches is increased therefore care should be taken when extrapolating our results to metapopulations with a higher number of patches we assumed that population fluctuations were driven by density dependent demographic processes however fluctuations and consequently synchrony could be influenced by environmental processes ranta et al 1997 in fact ripa 2000 argues that the moran effect is ever present and should not be discounted when analyzing the synchrony dispersal relationship the effects of dispersal on population synchrony then depend on the degree of correlated stochasticity and fluctuations induced by intrinsic dynamics ripa 2000 because of the nature of cycles induced by demographic processes it is much easier to maintain synchrony among populations with intrinsically induced cycles than a system where population fluctuations are driven by uncorrelated stochasticity ripa 2000 therefore we may expect different results under stochastically driven fluctuations than fluctuations driven by demographic processes although we did not explicitly define landscape geography distances between patches can play an important role in metapopulation dynamics holland and hastings 2008 patches further from each other can create more complex dynamics while decreasing synchrony kaneko 1985 kendall and fox 1998 ripa 2000 bjørnstad et al 1999 the negative relationship between synchrony and distance agrees with populations driven by environmental change as weather patterns are less correlated at greater distances ranta et al 1999 similarly oscillations are more prevalent as distance increases since less dispersal is expected across greater distances although outside the scope of this study it would be interesting to explore the effects of dispersal on different network structures and dispersal strategies chaotic oscillations are typically considered to enhance viability due to naturally noisy dynamics and low synchrony however this may only be true for chaos induced by environmental variation with low dispersal rates allen et al 1993 heino et al 1997 ylikarjula et al 2000 we found that chaos was not necessarily less synchronous than other attractor types specifically chaos was created through one of three mechanisms period doubling phase locking and crisis and synchrony did not experience any sudden shifts throughout these routes to chaos this means that chaos did not have any desynchronizing effects on population synchrony in our models and consequently may not necessarily have the effects on population rescue as previously thought allen et al 1993 that being said it is not certain that all routes to chaos preserve synchrony and it would be interesting to explore other routes to chaos to determine whether or not chaos has any desynchronizing effects in deterministic models the purpose of this research was to investigate the dynamics of matrix population models relevant for amphibian research halley et al 1996 vonesh and de la cruz 2002 willson et al 2012 willson and hopkins 2013 although we did not focus on any one species in particular our results demonstrate that the interactions between dispersal and demography play key roles in determining population dynamics amphibian species with rapid maturation may experience more complicated dynamics at varying levels of dispersal as indicated by our models with one life history stage conversely the dynamics of species with slower development two to three life history stages are less impacted by dispersal resulting in a higher frequency of equilibrium states and less chaos we present this information to encourage further research using these types of models on a particular species of interest noting the importance of accurately identifying amphibian life histories and dispersal processes this helps facilitate effective strategies that can be used for

to the changing climate the present study aims to simulate forest carbon fluxes in two major plant functional types pfts of northwest himalayan nwh foothills of india by integrating time series remote sensing rs data into biome biogeochemical cycle biome bgc a process based model and to study the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes the parameterization of the biome bgc model was carried out using the data from two eddy covariance ec flux tower sites located in the nwh foothills of india an analysis was carried out to identify the sensitive parameters and their calibration was

to counterbalance a significant amount of the atmospheric co2 by the process of photosynthesis through which the plants take up co2 from the atmosphere and convert it to organic carbon cox and jones 2008 anav et al 2015 le quéré et al 2018 they serve as the largest sinks of atmospheric co2 and offset more than one fourth of the fossil fuel emissions friedlingstein et al 2019 2020 and also contribute to counter global warming shevliakova et al 2013 the terrestrial carbon sink is considered to be the most uncertain component of the global carbon budget by far ballantyne et al 2012 keenan and williams 2018 piao et al 2020 the long term estimates of terrestrial gross primary productivity gpp and associated carbon fluxes including ecosystem respiration re and net ecosystem exchange nee at regional to global scales can provide a better understanding of the interaction between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere in context to the changes in global climate cox and jones 2008 cox et al 2013 however accurate information on the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes arising due to their diverse functional behaviour and their carbon sinking capability is lacking for indian forests for the estimation of gpp empirical and semi empirical or physical based approaches have been widely used potter et al 1993 landsberg and waring 1997 peng et al 2013 watham et al 2017a sun et

lst sims et al 2008 peng et al 2013 srinet et al 2020a the physical based modelling approaches like the light use efficiency lue based models use a strong physical basis for modelling and can leverage rs data to present a balance between simplicity and precision in the predictions cai et al 2014a jin et al 2020 srinet et al 2021 these models are simple and their parametrization is based upon the observational data the relationships and the conditions these observations represent are from past to present since these relationships and conditions are transient such models cannot be used for the projection of future conditions keenan et al 2012 anav et al 2015 they have a limited capacity to extrapolate the fluxes in different environmental conditions beer et al 2010 the process based models take into account the procedure by which the behaviour of a system is derived from a set of functional components and their interactions with each other and the environment through physical and

a and b kondo et al 2013 2015 han et al 2018 chen and xiao 2019 mangroves luo et al 2010 and alpine meadows of china yan et al 2016a li et al 2020 and tropical moist deciduous forests of india behera

williams et al 2009 bonan et al 2012 these models are driven by climate soil land cover and land use and atmospheric conditions and they simulate various internal biogeochemical processes the simulations from these models rely on abundant information including meteorological edaphic and physiological parameters and the accurate calibration of these parameters yan et al 2016a acquiring the field based information for parametrization and calibration of these models when being implemented in the spatial domain is difficult rs data in combination with climate data provide a consistent array of spatial input for various models the process based models can utilize the information provided by rs data to quantify carbon fluxes boisvenue and white 2019 the rs data integration and assimilation into various models is increasingly being used to provide input for critical variables update relevant variables initialization and parametrization of the models williams et al 2005 yan et al 2016b ma et al 2017 2019 li et al 2021 the northwest himalayan nwh foothills of india have a distinctive climatic and topographic setting navalgund et al 2019 the presence of diverse forests provides it with a huge carbon sinking potential nandy et al 2019 various modelling approaches have been used to report the gpp of these forests however accurate information on the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes including gpp re and nee in nwh foothills is still lacking the integration of remote sensing data into process based models may help in the accurate quantification of carbon exchange process of these forests hence the present study aims to simulate forest carbon fluxes in two major plant functional types pfts of nwh foothills of india by integrating time series rs data into biome bgc a process based model and to study the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the study area is located in the nwh foothills of india which is spread across uttarakhand uttar pradesh himachal pradesh punjab and jammu and kashmir fig 1 the area has a tropical to subtropical humid climate the mean annual temperature ranges from 20 c to 25 c the area experiences most of its rainfall from the southwest monsoon from june end to september srinet et al 2020b the nwh foothills comprise flat to undulating terrain with hills and valleys the elevation in the study area ranges from 187 to 1300 m above mean sea level the forest in the study area can be classified into moist and dry deciduous pfts srinet et al 2020b which differ based on climate and topographic characteristics in the foothills the radiation and moisture regimes vary in the opposite slopes which has resulted in variation in pfts the northern aspects of the foothills which experience cooler temperatures and retain more soil moisture have denser vegetation of moist deciduous type whereas the southern aspects with comparatively lower moisture and higher temperatures comprise of dry deciduous type srinet et al 2020b the major tree species found in moist deciduous type are shorea robusta anogeissus latifolia adina cordifolia terminalia tomentosa t bellirica lagerstroemia parviflora syzygium cumini and mallotus philippensis whereas the dry deciduous type covering typically the southern aspects of the nwh foothills largely consist of acacia catechu a latifolia boswellia serrata lannea coromandelica mitragyna parviflora t tomentosa t bellirica dalbergia sissoo and holoptelea integrifolia champion and seth 1968 two ec flux towers are located in the nwh foothills of india in the moist deciduous pft at barkot flux site bfs dehradun forest division and in the dry deciduous pft at haldwani flux site hfs tarai central forest division in uttarakhand watham et al 2020 2 2 data used 2 2 1 eddy covariance tower data ec based measurements of carbon fluxes and meteorological data from bfs and hfs sites for three years 2016 2018 were used in this study

quality control burba 2013 the processed data was filtered and gap filled using the reddyproc package wutzler et al 2018 in the r environment the partitioning of obtained net ecosystem exchange nee values was carried out to calculate the ecosystem respiration re falge et al 2002 and the gpp was calculated as the sum of nee and re the carbon flux estimates from these sites for two years 2016 2017 were used to calibrate the model whereas for the validation purpose the carbon flux estimates for year 2018 were used various meteorological variables from ec towers including daily minimum and maximum air temperature tair average daytime tair daily precipitation vapour pressure deficit vpd incoming solar radiation or global radiation rg and day length were used to run the biome bgc model at site scale over ec flux tower sites 2 2 2 field data and sample collection to characterise the vegetation the field data was collected from two ec flux tower sites which represented moist and dry deciduous types the collected data included the lai and leaf extinction coefficient values the leaf wood and litter samples were collected for the analysis of carbon and nitrogen ratio the fresh sun lit leaves of different sizes were also collected for the calculation of specific leaf area sla 2 2 3 global land surface satellite glass lai data the global land surface satellite glass lai data xiao

reflectance of the benchmark land multisite analysis and intercomparison of products belmanip sites during the period 2001 03 glass lai data available for 2001 to 2018 http www glass umd edu lai modis 1km was integrated into the biome bgc model for the estimation of forest carbon fluxes 2 2 4 climate reanalysis data the data of various meteorological variables essential to run the biome bgc model

maximum and average daytime temperatures total precipitation to characterize the daily precipitation values surface solar radiation downwards data to represent rg and for day length calculation the vpd was calculated using the 2 m dewpoint temperature the data for a period spanning over 40 years from 1981 to 2020 was downloaded and processed and the database for model spin up and normal runs was prepared 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 biome bgc model biome bgc is a widely used biogeochemical model developed by the numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg university of montana https www ntsg umt edu project biome bgc php the model simulates the storage and flux of water carbon and nitrogen between the ecosystem and the atmosphere and within the components of the terrestrial ecosystems thornton 2000 for the present study biome bgc version 4 2 referred as biome bgc model henceforth was used the model has been developed from the forest bgc model running and gower 1991 the carbon budget simulated by biome bgc includes various forest production output variables including gpp re and nee the model relies on the farquhar photosynthesis routine farquhar et al 1980 to calculate gpp for the sunlit and shaded foliage in the model gpp is defined as a function of temperature vpd soil water content solar radiation atmospheric co2 concentration lai and leaf nitrogen concentration chukrina and rinning 1998 the model can be run in two modes i spin up simulation to achieve a steady state condition of soil carbon and nitrogen pools under given climatic and site conditions and ii normal simulation to run the biome bgc using specific periods of meteorological data in the present study firstly the spin up simulation of the biome bgc model was performed to get a quasi equilibrium condition with the local environment then the normal simulation was carried out the model was run for a period of 18 years from 2001 to 2018 2 3 2 model inputs the required model driving data in the biome bgc model has been categorized into three categories i general information about the simulation including the site characteristics ii meteorological data maximum and minimum temperatures average daytime temperature precipitation vpd solar radiation and day length iii ecophysiological parameters defined as constants for the characterization of vegetation at the site the ecophysiological parameters for the vegetation present at both the ec flux tower sites were used to characterize the vegetation of two pfts of nwh foothills 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the biome bgc model was performed to quantify the effect of various ecophysiological parameters on the model outputs the sensitive parameters may vary with change in location or species tested raj et al 2014 hence sensitivity analysis is essential to calibrate the model for the study area the sensitivity analysis of the biome bgc model was performed for the tower sites following tatarinov and cienciala 2006 kumar and raghubanshi 2011 yan et al 2016a and pillai et al 2019 the effects of various eco physiological parameters on the modelled gpp were tested by varying the independent default parameters by 10 in both directions yan et al 2016a pillai et al 2019 the 2 year gpp values from the ec flux tower locations were used in the sensitivity analysis as the output variable then the sensitivity of gpp y to the eco physiological parameters x was calculated as the ratio of output variable change δy to parameter change δx both in percent kumar and raghubanshi 2011 2 3 4 model calibration and gpp estimation to implement the complicated process based models in specific regions model calibration is required raj et al 2014 the detailed methodology is shown in fig 2 the model calibration was carried out at site scale for two ec flux tower sites representing two major pfts of nwh foothills of india the calibration of the sensitive parameters of biome bgc was carried out by comparing the agreement between the modelled gpp and ec flux tower obtained gpp for 2016 and 2017 once a good agreement was achieved the model was considered to be calibrated and carbon fluxes for the study period were estimated 2 3 5 integration of remote sensing data into biome bgc model for gpp estimation in the biome bgc model for modelling the carbon storages and fluxes lai is considered as a key variable that influences vegetation growth and development in the model it is calculated as eq 1 1 lai c leaf sla where c leaf is the leaf carbon kg m 2 c and sla is the specific leaf area m2 kg 1 c however the lack of gridded observations of c leaf and sla values for proper parameterization of the model may lead to the uncertainties in the model projected lai values which in turn may lead to uncertainties in the simulated carbon fluxes to overcome this issue the glass lai product was integrated into the biome bgc model the model source code was modified to read gridded glass lai values for each grid of calibrated biome bgc model for the simulation of carbon fluxes instead of the modelled lai values and the model was re run 2 3 6 spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes the results from the calibrated biome bgc model and glass lai integrated biome bgc model were then compared with the ec flux tower estimated carbon fluxes using the model with higher accuracy in comparison to the ec tower data the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes was mapped generally for their implementation at larger scales the simulation models have to be coupled with climate or soil datasets that representatively cover the study area fodor et al 2021 in the present study to spatially interpolate the calibrated model gridded model inputs of meteorological forcing were used the simulations were carried out for each grid point using the corresponding inputs and the carbon fluxes were modelled for 2001 to 2018 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity index si obtained by the sensitivity analysis is presented in figure s1 the default parameter setting of the biome bgc model for evergreen broadleaf forest ebf and deciduous broadleaf forest dbf biomes are listed in table 1 the si were classified into three categories namely parameter with strong effect δy δx 0 2 parameter with moderate effect 0 1 δy δx 0 2 and parameter with low effect δy δx 0 1 the parameters with high sensitivity or strong effect on model predictions included canopy average specific leaf area sla annual leaf and fine root turnover fraction lfrtf maximum stomatal conductance new fine root c new leaf c cfr leaf fraction of leaf n in rubisco flnr and c n of leaves c nleaf the changes in the values of sla were found to have the strongest effect on the modelled gpp 3 2 model calibration and gpp estimation the biome bgc model was calibrated by adjusting the daily gpp outputs to fit the daily gpp obtained from the ec towers one each in moist and dry deciduous pft to achieve the best agreement for the calibration process the sensitive parameters were varied by 10 in both directions from the default value the default and calibrated values of various ecophysiological parameters used in the study have been tabulated in table 1 a good degree of agreement was observed between the ec tower obtained gpp and calibrated biome bgc model for moist r2 0 79 rmse 16 62 and dry deciduous r2 0 77 rmse 16 97 pfts 3 3 integration of remote sensing data into biome bgc model for gpp estimation the field observed range of seasonal lai at ec tower sites was found to be 1 16 to 3 85 at the moist deciduous site and from 0 55 to 3 34 at the dry deciduous site whereas for the ec tower grid point the biome bgc simulated lai ranged from 0 20 to 3 19 for the moist deciduous pft and 0 003 to 2 89 for the dry deciduous pft which was found to be underestimated figure s2 the glass lai values for the same ec tower grid points ranged from 0 79 to 3 91 in moist deciduous pft and from 0 45 to 3 56 in dry deciduous pft figure s2 the biome bgc model uses lai as a key variable for simulating the carbon fluxes hence glass lai was then integrated into the calibrated biome bgc model and the carbon fluxes were estimated at 8 day intervals 3 4 spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes the 8 day gpp from ec tower calibrated biome bgc model and glass lai integrated biome bgc models were plotted in comparison to the calibrated biome bgc model glass lai integrated biome bgc model was found to be closer to the ec tower obtained gpp in both moist and dry deciduous pfts fig 3 on site scale validation with ec tower calculated gpp the gpp simulated by the calibrated biome bgc model showed r2 0 80 with rmse of 13 24 for moist deciduous fig 4 a and r2 0 79 with rmse of 13 85 for dry deciduous pfts fig 4 b however the glass lai integrated biome bgc model showed an r2 0 87 and rmse 11 12 for moist deciduous fig 4 c and r2 0 86 and rmse 10 38 for dry deciduous pfts fig 4 d based upon the r2 and rmse values the glass lai integrated biome bgc model was selected to map the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes from 2001 to 2018 in the moist and dry deciduous pfts of nwh foothills of india the annual gpp was plotted from 2001 to 2018 which ranged from 231 78 gc m 2 year 1 to 3922 56 gc m 2 year 1 fig 5 from 2001 to 2018 the spatially averaged annual gpp ranged from 1863 to 3100 54 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 2739 30 gc m 2 year 1 in moist deciduous pft and from 1495 89 to 2304 92 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 2112 35 gc m 2 year 1 in dry deciduous pft the spatial pattern of gpp revealed that the moist deciduous pft had a higher gpp in comparison to dry deciduous pft the mean monthly gpp was calculated from 2001 to 2018 and intra annual variability of gpp was mapped fig 6 for moist deciduous pft gpp ranged from 0 97 gc m 2 day 1 to 15 89 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 7 45 gc m 2 day 1 whereas for dry deciduous pft it ranged between 0 89 gc m 2 day 1 and 12 57 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 5 64 gc m 2 day 1 the gpp in both the pfts of nwh foothills showed similar trends the minimum gpp was observed during january february which started increasing from march and peaked during august september and started reducing after october the annual re was plotted from 2001 to 2018 which ranged from 205 78 gc m 2 year 1 to 3219 31 gc m 2 year 1 fig s3 from 2001 to 2018 the spatially averaged annual re ranged from 1638 91 to 2638 16 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 2242 27 gc m 2 year 1 in moist deciduous pft and from 1287 45 to 2164 14 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 1857 64 gc m 2 year 1 in dry deciduous pft the mean monthly re was also calculated from 2001 to 2018 and intra annual variability of re was mapped fig s4 for moist deciduous pft re ranged from 0 68 gc m 2 day 1 to 12 38 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 5 98 gc m 2 day 1 whereas for dry deciduous pft it ranged between 0 54 gc m 2 day 1 and 9 38 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 4 68 gc m 2 day 1 the re in both the pfts of nwh foothills showed similar trends the minimum re was observed during january february which started increasing from march and peaked during the monsoon season in august september and started reducing after october the annual nee was plotted from 2001 to 2018 which ranged from 26 37 gc m 2 year 1 to 705 18 gc m 2 year 1 the negative sign represents the sink nature of the forests figure s5 from 2001 to 2018 the spatially averaged annual nee ranged from 301 67 to 704 66 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 655 34 gc m 2 year 1 in moist deciduous pft and from 116 97 to 450 39 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 350 41 gc m 2 year 1 in dry deciduous pft the mean monthly nee from 2001 to 2018 figure s6 for moist deciduous pft ranged from 0 64 gc m 2 day 1 to 2 58 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 1 64 gc m 2 day 1 whereas for dry deciduous pft it ranged between 0 11 gc m 2 day 1 and 1 28 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 0 89 gc m 2 day 1 the nee values in both the pfts of nwh foothills had a slight variation in trends in dry deciduous pft the minimum nee was observed during january february which peaked during the monsoon season in august september and started reducing after october whereas the minimum nee in moist deciduous pft was observed in july which demarcates the onset of monsoon season in the study area on site scale validation with the ec tower obtained re at bfs and hfs with corresponding grid for 2018 it was found that the re simulated by glass lai integrated biome bgc model showed r2 0 84 with rmse of 11 67 for moist deciduous fig 7 a and r2 0 83 with rmse of 11 97 for dry deciduous pfts fig 7 b similarly the nee values were also validated it was observed that glass lai integrated biome bgc model was able to predict the nee with an r2 of 0 79 and rmse of 16 89 for moist deciduous fig 7 c and r2 of 0 77 and rmse of 17 02 for dry deciduous pfts fig 70 d on comparing the annual carbon budget observed at ec tower sites for 2016 to 2018 with the modelled annual carbon budget it was observed that the model was able to predict the gpp re and nee with rmse of 8 16 7 76 and 9 65 respectively for moist deciduous pft whereas with rmse of 10 88 9 27 and 9 50 for dry deciduous pft table 2 it reflected that the model showed a good agreement with the ec tower observations as observed by the ec tower data the model also showed that the gpp re and nee of moist deciduous pft was higher than that of dry deciduous pft both the pfts acted as the sink of carbon but with varying magnitudes 4 discussion biome bgc model has been widely used to estimate and analyse the variability of carbon and water fluxes across various forests the model requires a certain set of ecophysiological parameters for its implementation in various pfts these ecophysiological parameters play an important role in the model simulation the sensitivity analysis provides an idea about the most important contributors hence presenting an efficient way to reduce the complexity of the calibration process is by considering only the crucial parameters obtained from the sensitivity analysis yan et al 2016b the sensitivity analysis revealed that the sla showed the highest effect on the modelled gpp being the most sensitive variable the improper representation of sla in spatial and temporal domains can affect the simulated carbon fluxes the calibrated biome bgc model underestimated the gpp for both the pfts this underestimation can be attributed to the underestimated lai values the range of lai values observed in the field at ec tower sites was higher than the range of lai values simulated by the calibrated biome bgc model however the glass lai values were found to show a more field representative range for the two ec tower sites as per the internal structure of the biome bgc model it uses lai as a key variable for simulating the carbon fluxes the lai values in the model structure depend upon the sla and leaf carbon values which also is a highly sensitive parameter to adequately represent the lai in the spatio temporal range glass lai was integrated with the calibrated biome bgc model glass lai was preferred for model integration because in contrast to the erratic fluctuations of modis lai the glass lai product is more temporally continuous and spatially complete it has more realistic and reasonable trajectories representing seasonal variations especially for forested areas li and xiao 2020 liang and wang 2020 the integration of glass lai resulted in better agreement between the ec tower gpp and simulated gpp the results obtained in the present study were consistent with a study carried out in northern china yan et al 2016b they demonstrated that assimilation of glass lai into the biome bgc model improved the model predictions r2 0 92 in comparison to the gpp obtained from calibrated biome bgc model r2 0 87 the gpp observed in moist deciduous pft was comparatively higher than that in dry deciduous pft the intra annual variation of gpp within the types revealed that phenology and climate had a strong influence on the gpp of both the pfts in moist deciduous type the leaf fall occurs in february and the new leaves start coming from the end of march to april hence the gpp shows an increasing trend from march onwards in the august september months gpp reached the maximum and starts reducing after october as the winter approaches in dry deciduous type the leaf fall starts from december end january hence the lowest gpp was observed during that period the study area experiences monsoon rainfall during the july september months the higher gpp observed during the monsoon season can be attributed to the favourable environmental conditions i e temperature moisture and lai ahongshangbam et al 2016 watham et al 2017b the seasonal dynamics of re observed in the study area were very similar to that of gpp similar observations have been reported across various sites and pfts across the world falge et al 2002 in their study of different vegetation functional types have reported that the gpp and re follow a parallel seasonal variation gpp and re co vary spatially due to their analogous responses to vegetation and climatic factors chen et al 2015 analysing a similar observation han et al 2020 found that the factors affecting the spatial variations in the seasonal parameters of gpp and re were similar hence similar trends in gpp and re were observed in various ecoregions of china krishnan et al 2008 thomas et al 2009 and migliavacca et al 2011 have also reported that the seasonal patterns in gpp and re were closely coupled differences in the trends of nee in moist and dry deciduous pfts were a result of the difference in their phenology in combination with the hot and humid conditions prevailing during the monsoon season the dry deciduous pft showing true deciduous nature experiences leaf fall during december to february whereas the moist deciduous type maintains the foliage during this season the dry season april may results in the accumulation of litter in both the pfts which starts decomposing in the presence of moisture after the onset of monsoon season leading to higher re the resultant nee reduces during this period the trends observed in the monthly variability of carbon fluxes were in agreement with the trends observed at the ec tower sites reported in watham et al 2020 pillai et al 2019 reported the nee of 526 87 gc m 2 year 1 for the part of the present study area for year 2015 which consisted of only moist deciduous pft these values were found to be close to the nee values estimated in the present study 598 60 gc m 2 year 1 from the present study it can be concluded that biome bgc a process based model with calibration and integration of rs based data can give accurate estimates of forest carbon fluxes another benefit of using the process based models like biome bgc is that it can provide the estimates of carbon fluxes including gpp re and nee at various temporal scales varying from daily to yearly earlier studies carried out in similar areas behera et al 2019 pillai et al 2019 focussed on the parameterization and calibration of the process based models using various field measurements however the present study with proper model parametrization and calibration provides an alternative of circumventing the problem of scarce field data describing the highly sensitive parameter i e sla which is crucial to various forest processes using reliable rs data 5 conclusions in the present study biome bgc a process based model was used with the integration of rs based input to obtain the spatio temporal distribution of forest carbon fluxes of two major pfts of nwh foothills of india a sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the sensitive parameters for model calibration sla was found to have the highest sensitivity on the modelled gpp followed by annual leaf and fine root turnover fraction maximum stomatal conductance new fine root c new leaf c fraction of leaf n in rubisco and c n of leaves based on the sensitivity analysis the calibration of highly sensitive parameters was carried out for two pfts as the biome bgc model uses lai as a key variable for simulating the carbon fluxes the time series glass lai data was integrated into the calibrated biome bgc model the study highlighted that the integration of rs data into calibrated process based model increased the accuracy of model simulated forest carbon fluxes the results also showcased that in the long term the forests of nwh foothills continue to be the sink of carbon which highlights their potential to offset the anthropogenic co2 emissions and mitigate climate change however the impact of uncertainties in the input data from multiple sources and their influence on the calibrated model cannot be neglected therefore to improve the simulation of carbon fluxes and reduce the errors based on time series rs data data assimilation techniques can be

to counterbalance a significant amount of the atmospheric co2 by the process of photosynthesis through which the plants take up co2 from the atmosphere and convert it to organic carbon cox and jones 2008 anav et al 2015 le quéré et al 2018 they serve as the largest sinks of atmospheric co2 and offset more than one fourth of the fossil fuel emissions friedlingstein et al 2019 2020 and also contribute to counter global warming shevliakova et al 2013 the terrestrial carbon sink is considered to be the most uncertain component of the global carbon budget by far ballantyne et al 2012 keenan and williams 2018 piao et al 2020 the long term estimates of terrestrial gross primary productivity gpp and associated carbon fluxes including ecosystem respiration re and net ecosystem exchange nee at regional to global scales can provide a better understanding of the interaction between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere in context to the changes in global climate cox and jones 2008 cox et al 2013 however accurate information on the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes arising due to their diverse functional behaviour and their carbon sinking capability is lacking for indian forests for the estimation of gpp empirical and semi empirical or physical based approaches have been widely used potter et al 1993 landsberg and waring 1997 peng et al 2013 watham et al 2017a sun et

lst sims et al 2008 peng et al 2013 srinet et al 2020a the physical based modelling approaches like the light use efficiency lue based models use a strong physical basis for modelling and can leverage rs data to present a balance between simplicity and precision in the predictions cai et al 2014a jin et al 2020 srinet et al 2021 these models are simple and their parametrization is based upon the observational data the relationships and the conditions these observations represent are from past to present since these relationships and conditions are transient such models cannot be used for the projection of future conditions keenan et al 2012 anav et al 2015 they have a limited capacity to extrapolate the fluxes in different environmental conditions beer et al 2010 the process based models

a and b kondo et al 2013 2015 han et al 2018 chen and xiao 2019 mangroves luo et al 2010 and alpine meadows of china yan et al 2016a li et al 2020 and tropical moist deciduous forests of india behera

williams et al 2009 bonan et al 2012 these models are driven by climate soil land cover and land use and atmospheric conditions and they simulate various internal biogeochemical processes the simulations from these models rely on abundant information including meteorological edaphic and physiological parameters and the accurate calibration of these parameters yan et al 2016a acquiring the field based information for parametrization and calibration of these models when being implemented in the spatial domain is difficult rs data in combination with climate data provide a consistent array of spatial input for various models the process based models can utilize the information provided by rs data to quantify carbon fluxes boisvenue and white 2019 the rs data integration and assimilation into various models is increasingly being used to provide input for critical variables update relevant variables initialization and parametrization of the models williams et al 2005 yan et al 2016b ma et al 2017 2019 li et al 2021 the northwest himalayan nwh foothills of india have a distinctive climatic and topographic setting navalgund et al 2019 the presence of diverse forests provides it with a huge carbon sinking potential nandy et al 2019 various modelling approaches have been used to report the gpp of these forests however accurate information on the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes including gpp re and nee in nwh foothills is still lacking the integration of remote sensing data into process based models may help in the accurate quantification of carbon exchange process of these forests hence the present study aims to simulate forest carbon fluxes in two major plant functional types pfts of nwh foothills of india by integrating time series rs data into biome bgc a process based model and to study the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the study area is located in the nwh foothills of india which is spread across uttarakhand uttar pradesh himachal pradesh punjab and jammu and kashmir fig 1 the area has a tropical to subtropical humid climate the mean annual temperature ranges from 20 c to 25 c the area experiences most of its rainfall from the southwest monsoon from june end to september srinet et al 2020b the nwh foothills comprise flat to undulating terrain with hills and valleys the elevation in the study area ranges from 187 to 1300 m above mean sea level the forest in the study area can be classified into moist and dry deciduous pfts srinet et al 2020b which differ based on climate and topographic characteristics in the foothills the radiation and moisture regimes vary in the opposite slopes which has resulted in variation in pfts the northern aspects of the foothills which experience cooler temperatures and retain more soil moisture have denser vegetation of moist deciduous type whereas the southern aspects with comparatively lower moisture and higher temperatures comprise of dry deciduous type srinet et al 2020b the major tree species found in moist deciduous type are shorea robusta anogeissus latifolia adina cordifolia terminalia tomentosa t bellirica lagerstroemia parviflora syzygium cumini and mallotus philippensis whereas the dry deciduous type covering typically the southern aspects of the nwh foothills largely consist of acacia catechu a latifolia boswellia serrata lannea coromandelica mitragyna parviflora t tomentosa t bellirica dalbergia sissoo and holoptelea integrifolia champion and seth 1968 two ec flux towers are located in the nwh foothills of india in the moist deciduous pft at barkot flux site bfs dehradun forest division and in the dry deciduous pft at haldwani flux site hfs tarai central forest division in uttarakhand watham et al 2020 2 2 data used 2 2 1 eddy covariance tower data ec based measurements of carbon fluxes and meteorological data from bfs and hfs sites for three years 2016 2018 were used in this study

quality control burba 2013 the processed data was filtered and gap filled using the reddyproc package wutzler et al 2018 in the r environment the partitioning of obtained net ecosystem exchange nee values was carried out to calculate the ecosystem respiration re falge et al 2002 and the gpp was calculated as the sum of nee and re the carbon flux estimates from these sites for two years 2016 2017 were used to calibrate the model whereas for the validation purpose the carbon flux estimates for year 2018 were used various meteorological variables from ec towers including daily minimum and maximum air temperature tair average daytime tair daily precipitation vapour pressure deficit vpd incoming solar radiation or global radiation rg and day length were used to run the biome bgc model at site scale over ec flux tower sites 2 2 2 field data and sample collection to characterise the vegetation the field data was collected from two ec flux tower sites which represented moist and dry deciduous types the collected data included the lai and leaf extinction coefficient values the leaf wood and litter samples were collected for the analysis of carbon and nitrogen ratio the fresh sun lit leaves of different sizes were also collected for the calculation of specific leaf area sla 2 2 3 global land surface satellite glass lai data the global land surface satellite glass lai data xiao

reflectance of the benchmark land multisite analysis and intercomparison of products belmanip sites during the period 2001 03 glass lai data available for 2001 to 2018 http www glass umd edu lai modis 1km was integrated into the biome bgc model for the estimation of forest carbon fluxes 2 2 4 climate reanalysis data the data of various meteorological variables essential to run the biome bgc model

vpd was calculated using the 2 m dewpoint temperature the data for a period spanning over 40 years from 1981 to 2020 was downloaded and processed and the database for model spin up and normal runs was prepared 2 3 methodology 2 3 1 biome bgc model biome bgc is a widely used biogeochemical model developed by the numerical terradynamic simulation group ntsg university of montana https www ntsg umt edu project biome bgc php the model simulates the storage and flux of water carbon and nitrogen between the ecosystem and the atmosphere and within the components of the terrestrial ecosystems thornton 2000 for the present study biome bgc version 4 2 referred as biome bgc model henceforth was used the model has been developed from the forest bgc model running and gower 1991 the carbon budget simulated by biome bgc includes various forest production output variables including gpp re and nee the model relies on the farquhar photosynthesis routine farquhar et al 1980 to calculate gpp for the sunlit and shaded foliage in the model gpp is defined as a function of temperature vpd soil water content solar radiation atmospheric co2 concentration lai and leaf nitrogen concentration chukrina and rinning 1998 the model can be run in two modes i spin up simulation to achieve a steady state condition of soil carbon and nitrogen pools under given climatic and site conditions and ii normal simulation to run the biome bgc using specific periods of meteorological data in the present study firstly the spin up simulation of the biome bgc model was performed to get a quasi equilibrium condition with the local environment then the normal simulation was carried out the model was run for a period of 18 years from 2001 to 2018 2 3 2 model inputs the required model driving data in the biome bgc model has been categorized into three categories i general information about the simulation including the site characteristics ii meteorological data maximum and minimum temperatures average daytime temperature precipitation vpd solar radiation and day length iii ecophysiological parameters defined as constants for the characterization of vegetation at the site the ecophysiological parameters for the vegetation present at both the ec flux tower sites were used to characterize the vegetation of two pfts of nwh foothills 2 3 3 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis of the biome bgc model was performed to quantify the effect of various ecophysiological parameters on the model outputs the sensitive parameters may vary with change in location or species tested raj et al 2014 hence sensitivity analysis is essential to calibrate the model for the study area the sensitivity analysis of the biome bgc model was performed for the tower sites following tatarinov and cienciala 2006 kumar and raghubanshi 2011 yan et al 2016a and pillai et al 2019 the effects of various eco physiological parameters on the modelled gpp were tested by varying the independent default parameters by 10 in both directions yan et al 2016a pillai et al 2019 the 2 year gpp values from the ec flux tower locations were used in the sensitivity analysis as the output variable then the sensitivity of gpp y to the eco physiological parameters x was calculated as the ratio of output variable change δy to parameter change δx both in percent kumar and raghubanshi 2011 2 3 4 model calibration and gpp estimation to implement the complicated process based models in specific regions model calibration is required raj et al 2014 the detailed methodology is shown in fig 2 the model calibration was carried out at site scale for two ec flux tower sites representing two major pfts of nwh foothills of india the calibration of the sensitive parameters of biome bgc was carried out by comparing the agreement between the modelled gpp and ec flux tower obtained gpp for 2016 and 2017 once a good agreement was achieved the model was considered to be calibrated and carbon fluxes for the study period were estimated 2 3 5 integration of remote sensing data into biome bgc model for gpp estimation in the biome bgc model for modelling the carbon storages and fluxes lai is considered as a key variable that influences vegetation growth and development in the model it is calculated as eq 1 1 lai c leaf sla where c leaf is the leaf carbon kg m 2 c and sla is the specific leaf area m2 kg 1 c however the lack of gridded observations of c leaf and sla values for proper parameterization of the model may lead to the uncertainties in the model projected lai values which in turn may lead to uncertainties in the simulated carbon fluxes to overcome this issue the glass lai product was integrated into the biome bgc model the model source code was modified to read gridded glass lai values for each grid of calibrated biome bgc model for the simulation of carbon fluxes instead of the modelled lai values and the model was re run 2 3 6 spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes the results from the calibrated biome bgc model and glass lai integrated biome bgc model were then compared with the ec flux tower estimated carbon fluxes using the model with higher accuracy in comparison to the ec tower data the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes was mapped generally for their implementation at larger scales the simulation models have to be coupled with climate or soil datasets that representatively cover the study area fodor et al 2021 in the present study to spatially interpolate the calibrated model gridded model inputs of meteorological forcing were used the simulations were carried out for each grid point using the corresponding inputs and the carbon fluxes were modelled for 2001 to 2018 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity index si obtained by the sensitivity analysis is presented in figure s1 the default parameter setting of the biome bgc model for evergreen broadleaf forest ebf and deciduous broadleaf forest dbf biomes are listed in table 1 the si were classified into three categories namely parameter with strong effect δy δx 0 2 parameter with moderate effect 0 1 δy δx 0 2 and parameter with low effect δy δx 0 1 the parameters with high sensitivity or strong effect on model predictions included canopy average specific leaf area sla annual leaf and fine root turnover fraction lfrtf maximum stomatal conductance new fine root c new leaf c cfr leaf fraction of leaf n in rubisco flnr and c n of leaves c nleaf the changes in the values of sla were found to have the strongest effect on the modelled gpp 3 2 model calibration and gpp estimation the biome bgc model was calibrated by adjusting the daily gpp outputs to fit the daily gpp obtained from the ec towers one each in moist and dry deciduous pft to achieve the best agreement for the calibration process the sensitive parameters were varied by 10 in both directions from the default value the default and calibrated values of various ecophysiological parameters used in the study have been tabulated in table 1 a good degree of agreement was observed between the ec tower obtained gpp and calibrated biome bgc model for moist r2 0 79 rmse 16 62 and dry deciduous r2 0 77 rmse 16 97 pfts 3 3 integration of remote sensing data into biome bgc model for gpp estimation the field observed range of seasonal lai at ec tower sites was found to be 1 16 to 3 85 at the moist deciduous site and from 0 55 to 3 34 at the dry deciduous site whereas for the ec tower grid point the biome bgc simulated lai ranged from 0 20 to 3 19 for the moist deciduous pft and 0 003 to 2 89 for the dry deciduous pft which was found to be underestimated figure s2 the glass lai values for the same ec tower grid points ranged from 0 79 to 3 91 in moist deciduous pft and from 0 45 to 3 56 in dry deciduous pft figure s2 the biome bgc model uses lai as a key variable for simulating the carbon fluxes hence glass lai was then integrated into the calibrated biome bgc model and the carbon fluxes were estimated at 8 day intervals 3 4 spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes the 8 day gpp from ec tower calibrated biome bgc model and glass lai integrated biome bgc models were plotted in comparison to the calibrated biome bgc model glass lai integrated biome bgc model was found to be closer to the ec tower obtained gpp in both moist and dry deciduous pfts fig 3 on site scale validation with ec tower calculated gpp the gpp simulated by the calibrated biome bgc model showed r2 0 80 with rmse of 13 24 for moist deciduous fig 4 a and r2 0 79 with rmse of 13 85 for dry deciduous pfts fig 4 b however the glass lai integrated biome bgc model showed an r2 0 87 and rmse 11 12 for moist deciduous fig 4 c and r2 0 86 and rmse 10 38 for dry deciduous pfts fig 4 d based upon the r2 and rmse values the glass lai integrated biome bgc model was selected to map the spatio temporal variability of carbon fluxes from 2001 to 2018 in the moist and dry deciduous pfts of nwh foothills of india the annual gpp was plotted from 2001 to 2018 which ranged from 231 78 gc m 2 year 1 to 3922 56 gc m 2 year 1 fig 5 from 2001 to 2018 the spatially averaged annual gpp ranged from 1863 to 3100 54 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 2739 30 gc m 2 year 1 in moist deciduous pft and from 1495 89 to 2304 92 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 2112 35 gc m 2 year 1 in dry deciduous pft the spatial pattern of gpp revealed that the moist deciduous pft had a higher gpp in comparison to dry deciduous pft the mean monthly gpp was calculated from 2001 to 2018 and intra annual variability of gpp was mapped fig 6 for moist deciduous pft gpp ranged from 0 97 gc m 2 day 1 to 15 89 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 7 45 gc m 2 day 1 whereas for dry deciduous pft it ranged between 0 89 gc m 2 day 1 and 12 57 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 5 64 gc m 2 day 1 the gpp in both the pfts of nwh foothills showed similar trends the minimum gpp was observed during january february which started increasing from march and peaked during august september and started reducing after october the annual re was plotted from 2001 to 2018 which ranged from 205 78 gc m 2 year 1 to 3219 31 gc m 2 year 1 fig s3 from 2001 to 2018 the spatially averaged annual re ranged from 1638 91 to 2638 16 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 2242 27 gc m 2 year 1 in moist deciduous pft and from 1287 45 to 2164 14 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 1857 64 gc m 2 year 1 in dry deciduous pft the mean monthly re was also calculated from 2001 to 2018 and intra annual variability of re was mapped fig s4 for moist deciduous pft re ranged from 0 68 gc m 2 day 1 to 12 38 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 5 98 gc m 2 day 1 whereas for dry deciduous pft it ranged between 0 54 gc m 2 day 1 and 9 38 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 4 68 gc m 2 day 1 the re in both the pfts of nwh foothills showed similar trends the minimum re was observed during january february which started increasing from march and peaked during the monsoon season in august september and started reducing after october the annual nee was plotted from 2001 to 2018 which ranged from 26 37 gc m 2 year 1 to 705 18 gc m 2 year 1 the negative sign represents the sink nature of the forests figure s5 from 2001 to 2018 the spatially averaged annual nee ranged from 301 67 to 704 66 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 655 34 gc m 2 year 1 in moist deciduous pft and from 116 97 to 450 39 gc m 2 year 1 with a mean of 350 41 gc m 2 year 1 in dry deciduous pft the mean monthly nee from 2001 to 2018 figure s6 for moist deciduous pft ranged from 0 64 gc m 2 day 1 to 2 58 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 1 64 gc m 2 day 1 whereas for dry deciduous pft it ranged between 0 11 gc m 2 day 1 and 1 28 gc m 2 day 1 with a mean of 0 89 gc m 2 day 1 the nee values in both the pfts of nwh foothills had a slight variation in trends in dry deciduous pft the minimum nee was observed during january february which peaked during the monsoon season in august september and started reducing after october whereas the minimum nee in moist deciduous pft was observed in july which demarcates the onset of monsoon season in the study area on site scale validation with the ec tower obtained re at bfs and hfs with corresponding grid for 2018 it was found that the re simulated by glass lai integrated biome bgc model showed r2 0 84 with rmse of 11 67 for moist deciduous fig 7 a and r2 0 83 with rmse of 11 97 for dry deciduous pfts fig 7 b similarly the nee values were also validated it was observed that glass lai integrated biome bgc model was able to predict the nee with an r2 of 0 79 and rmse of 16 89 for moist deciduous fig 7 c and r2 of 0 77 and rmse of 17 02 for dry deciduous pfts fig 70 d on comparing the annual carbon budget observed at ec tower sites for 2016 to 2018 with the modelled annual carbon budget it was observed that the model was able to predict the gpp re and nee with rmse of 8 16 7 76 and 9 65 respectively for moist deciduous pft whereas with rmse of 10 88 9 27 and 9 50 for dry deciduous pft table 2 it reflected that the model showed a good agreement with the ec tower observations as observed by the ec tower data the model also showed that the gpp re and nee of moist deciduous pft was higher than that of dry deciduous pft both the pfts acted as the sink of carbon but with varying magnitudes 4 discussion biome bgc model has been widely used to estimate and analyse the variability of carbon and water fluxes across various forests the model requires a certain set of ecophysiological parameters for its implementation in various pfts these ecophysiological parameters play an important role in the model simulation the sensitivity analysis provides an idea about the most important contributors hence presenting an efficient way to reduce the complexity of the calibration process is by considering only the crucial parameters obtained from the sensitivity analysis yan et al 2016b the sensitivity analysis revealed that the sla showed the highest effect on the modelled gpp being the most sensitive variable the improper representation of sla in spatial and temporal domains can affect the simulated carbon fluxes the calibrated biome bgc model underestimated the gpp for both the pfts this underestimation can be attributed to the underestimated lai values the range of lai values observed in the field at ec tower sites was higher than the range of lai values simulated by the calibrated biome bgc model however the glass lai values were found to show a more field representative range for the two ec tower sites as per the internal structure of the biome bgc model it uses lai as a key variable for simulating the carbon fluxes the lai values in the model structure depend upon the sla and leaf carbon values which also is a highly sensitive parameter to adequately represent the lai in the spatio temporal range glass lai was integrated with the calibrated biome bgc model glass lai was preferred for model integration because in contrast to the erratic fluctuations of modis lai the glass lai product is more temporally continuous and spatially complete it has more realistic and reasonable trajectories representing seasonal variations especially for forested areas li and xiao 2020 liang and wang 2020 the integration of glass lai resulted in better agreement between the ec tower gpp and simulated gpp the results obtained in the present study were consistent with a study carried out in northern china yan et al 2016b they demonstrated that assimilation of glass lai into the biome bgc model improved the model predictions r2 0 92 in comparison to the gpp obtained from calibrated biome bgc model r2 0 87 the gpp observed in moist deciduous pft was comparatively higher than that in dry deciduous pft the intra annual variation of gpp within the types revealed that phenology and climate had a strong influence on the gpp of both the pfts in moist deciduous type the leaf fall occurs in february and the new leaves start coming from the end of march to april hence the gpp shows an increasing trend from march onwards in the august september months gpp reached the maximum and starts reducing after october as the winter approaches in dry deciduous type the leaf fall starts from december end january hence the lowest gpp was observed during that period the study area experiences monsoon rainfall during the july september months the higher gpp observed during the monsoon season can be attributed to the favourable environmental conditions i e temperature moisture and lai ahongshangbam et al 2016 watham et al 2017b the seasonal dynamics of re observed in the study area were very similar to that of gpp similar observations have been reported across various sites and pfts across the world falge et al 2002 in their study of different vegetation functional types have reported that the gpp and re follow a parallel seasonal variation gpp and re co vary spatially due to their analogous responses to vegetation and climatic factors chen et al 2015 analysing a similar observation han et al 2020 found that the factors affecting the spatial variations in the seasonal parameters of gpp and re were similar hence similar trends in gpp and re were observed in various ecoregions of china krishnan et al 2008 thomas et al 2009 and migliavacca et al 2011 have also reported that the seasonal patterns in gpp and re were closely coupled differences in the trends of nee in moist and dry deciduous pfts were a result of the difference in their phenology in combination with the hot and humid conditions prevailing during the monsoon season the dry deciduous pft showing true deciduous nature experiences leaf fall during december to february whereas the moist deciduous type maintains the foliage during this season the dry season april may results in the accumulation of litter in both the pfts which starts decomposing in the presence of moisture after the onset of monsoon season leading to higher re the resultant nee reduces during this period the trends observed in the monthly variability of carbon fluxes were in agreement with the trends observed at the ec tower sites reported in watham et al 2020 pillai et al 2019 reported the nee of 526 87 gc m 2 year 1 for the part of the present study area for year 2015 which consisted of only moist deciduous pft these values were found to be close to the nee values estimated in the present study 598 60 gc m 2 year 1 from the present study it can be concluded that biome bgc a process based model with calibration and integration of rs based data can give accurate estimates of forest carbon fluxes another benefit of using the process based models like biome bgc is that it can provide the estimates of carbon fluxes including gpp re and nee at various temporal scales varying from daily to yearly earlier studies carried out in similar areas behera et al 2019 pillai et al 2019 focussed on the parameterization and calibration of the process based models using various field measurements however the present study with proper model parametrization and calibration provides an alternative of circumventing the problem of scarce field data describing the highly sensitive parameter i e sla which is crucial to various forest processes using reliable rs data 5 conclusions in the present study biome bgc a process based model was used with the integration of rs based input to obtain the spatio temporal distribution of forest carbon fluxes of two major pfts of nwh foothills of india a sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the sensitive parameters for model calibration sla was found to have the highest sensitivity on the modelled gpp followed by annual leaf and fine root turnover fraction maximum stomatal conductance new fine root c new leaf c fraction of leaf n in rubisco and c n of leaves based on the sensitivity analysis the calibration of highly sensitive parameters was carried out for two pfts as the biome bgc model uses lai as a key variable for simulating the carbon fluxes the time series glass lai data was integrated into the calibrated biome bgc model the study highlighted that the integration of rs data into calibrated process based model increased the accuracy of model simulated forest carbon fluxes the results also showcased that in the long term the forests of nwh foothills continue to be the sink of carbon which highlights their potential to offset the anthropogenic co2 emissions and mitigate climate change however the impact of uncertainties in the input data from multiple sources and their influence on the calibrated model cannot be neglected therefore to improve the simulation of carbon fluxes and reduce the errors based on time series rs data data assimilation techniques can be

24298,there exists considerable uncertainty about the most appropriate functional form to describe mortality at the highest trophic level the closure problem although linear and quadratic formulations predict strongly different dynamics it is unclear which of these formulations is more realistic we introduce an implicit predator population feeding on the highest trophic level parameterized through a holling type ii functional response and empirically observed predator prey scaling relations thus we arrive at a hyperbolic mortality formulation that is a hybrid between the linear and quadratic forms subsequently we investigate the impact of this formulation on the modeled population dynamics in particular we compare the stability properties of simple food chain models with a hyperbolic mortality and a linear mortality contrary to classical theory the model with a hyperbolic mortality does not exhibit destabilization due to nutrient enrichment for this model we find that limit cycles are rather associated with a top heavy ecosystem structure high predator low prey densities the weak response to enrichment emerges because populations of both the predator and prey increase with nutrient supply consistent with observations we discuss the mechanism behind the relationship between top heaviness and instability from an ecological and a mathematical perspective keywords ecosystem model paradox of enrichment npz limit cycle data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction an accurate representation of ecosystems in dynamic models is crucial to predict the impacts of climate change and other stressors on these ecosystems and to advance our understanding of the ocean carbon cycle to improve the accuracy much effort has been put into resolving larger numbers of ecological interactions and more physiological detail in both terrestrial and marine ecosystem models butenschön et al 2016 dutkiewicz et al 2020 fisher and koven 2020 wright et al 2021 however there remain fundamental unresolved questions with regard to how the different processes represented by the models should be formulated mathematically in fact the behavior of dynamic models strongly depends on the specifics of the mathematical formulation scheffer and de boer 1995 vos et al 2004 roy and chattopadhyay 2007 gentleman and neuheimer 2008 behrenfeld and boss 2014 can we choose between different formulations based on mechanisms and empirical observations in this study we will focus in particular on the formulation of mortality at the highest trophic level and its impact on modeled population dynamics one model element for which there exists a large body of observational support across systems is saturating functional responses houde and schekter 1980 moore 1988 o brien et al 2001 altwegg et al 2006 moss and beauchamp 2007 hunt and swift 2010 murray et al 2013 that is feeding generally increases with increasing resource or prey density until a maximum level is reached several such functional responses have been formulated a simple saturating functional response is holling type ii it is mechanistically derived by describing the feeding process which involves a finite encounter or attack rate and handling time holling 1959 therefore it appears logical to build ecosystem models using a collection of holling type ii terms to describe trophic interactions moving up the trophic chain one eventually encounters the so called closure problem steele and henderson 1981 caswell and neubert 1998 murray and parslow 1999 franks 2002 neubert et al 2004 mitra 2009 kloosterman et al 2014 how should predation on the highest explicitly modeled trophic level be described in trophic models see e g piltz et al 2014 2018 araujo and moura 2022 tay et al 2022 for recent examples this has typically been formulated as a linear loss rate m z with m a constant and z the population density of the highest explicitly represented trophic level however predation at higher trophic levels may lead to an increase in the mortality rate toward higher population densities in recent ocean biogeochemical models see e g aumont et al 2015 baird et al 2020 pahlow et al 2020 for recent examples this has often been represented by a quadratic mortality m z 2 of the highest explicitly represented trophic level typically large zooplankton furthermore a hyperbolic formulation m z 2 z k z was used in some early ocean ecosystem models frost 1987 1993 hofmann and ambler 1988 fasham 1993 this is far from a trivial matter as the closure formulation has a strong impact on the model behavior a quadratic mortality at the highest trophic level leads to correlated increases in predator and prey biomass with increasing enrichment gleeson 1994 in contrast with the linear formulation gatto 1991 in addition steele and henderson 1992 showed that a quadratic zooplankton mortality tends to stabilize the temporal dynamics of nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton npz models subsequently it was demonstrated that models with a linear closure term and with a quadratic closure can both have stable steady states but these exist in a larger region of parameter space for the quadratic closure models edwards and brindley 1996 1999 edwards and yool 2000 since models are in many cases used to make predictions about the steady state of a system a quadratic mortality appears more practical to use than a linear mortality term that said the enhanced stability does not imply that a quadratic mortality is more realistic than linear mortality which of these closure formulations may be the most realistic to make progress on this question we have searched for systematic relationships between predator and prey biomass recent compilations of paired predator prey abundance observations hatton et al 2015 wigington et al 2016 yuan and pollard 2018 suggest that such systematic relationships indeed exist in this paper we leverage these empirical relationships to parameterize an implicit predator population feeding on the zooplankton combining this with the commonly used holling type ii predation we arrive at a hyperbolic closure what is the impact of this particular closure formulation on modeled population dynamics linear closure models generally exhibit a shift from stability to predator prey cycles due to nutrient enrichment rosenzweig 1971 as the system becomes more enriched the minima of the cycles reach such low values that the predator and prey effectively become extinct rosenzweig 1971 termed this effect the paradox of enrichment since nutrient enrichment would intuitively seem beneficial for the predator and prey however little empirical evidence has been found in support of ecosystem destabilization by enrichment jensen and ginzburg 2005 much theoretical research about resolving this paradox has focused on the impacts of behavioral interactions among predators and between predators and prey ruxton 1995 huisman and de boer 1997 van voorn et al 2008 přibylová and berec 2015 toyokawa 2017 we instead focus on the role of the model closure comparing the enrichment response between linear and hyperbolic formulations 2 models and methods in section 2 1 we formulate a npz model that is kept as simple as possible while maintaining key elements to allow for a transparent analysis subsequently we discuss the choice of parameter values as well as the use of auto to test the sensitivity of the model predictions to these parameter values section 2 2 2 1 model formulation the model includes the processes of nutrient uptake and associated phytoplankton growth zooplankton grazing and growth zooplankton mortality and maintenance losses for phytoplankton and zooplankton a holling type ii functional response is used for nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and for zooplankton grazing although sloppy feeding is not included trophic conversion inefficiencies are represented through linear maintenance loss terms for phytoplankton and zooplankton putting these processes together leads to the following set of equations 1a d n d t μ p m a x n n k n p i n t o t 1b d p d t μ p m a x n n k n p m p p μ z m a x p p k p z 1c d z d t μ z m a x p p k p z m z z d z z z in these equations n indicates the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration in μ m n p the phytoplankton concentration μ m n and z the zooplankton concentration μ m n although nitrogen serves as the central currency of our model the analysis and argumentation do not change fundamentally if another nutrient e g phosphorus is chosen for that role i n t o t is the total din input μ p m a x and μ z m a x are the maximum uptake rates for phytoplankton and zooplankton d 1 k n and k p are the half saturation constants for nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and grazing by zooplankton μ m n m p and m z are maintenance loss rates of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass d 1 the per capita death rate of zooplankton or closure term is indicated by d z z here we only have two trophic levels p and z but the same structure can be used for a model with any number of trophic levels the closure term is then imposed on the highest explicitly resolved trophic level for the mortality we consider two formulations linear d z is constant and hyperbolic for the hyperbolic formulation we assume that the zooplankton is being preyed upon by a fish or other predator population f with a holling type ii functional response d z μ f m a x f z k z here μ f m a x is the maximum uptake rate for the predator and k z is a half saturation constant the predator population is not modeled explicitly but instead parameterized in terms of the zooplankton concentration using an empirical predator prey scaling relationship hatton et al 2015 wigington et al 2016 2 f c z γ with c a proportionality constant and γ a scaling exponent the number of model parameters can be reduced by one by combining c and μ f m a x into a single parameter the maximum zooplankton death rate d z m a x μ f m a x c hatton et al 2015 generally reported slightly sublinear scaling relationships between the predator and prey densities γ 0 7 however these sublinear scalings have recently been brought into question because an accurate determination of such relationships from environmental data with significant scatter is not straightforward several different methods are in use which one is the most appropriate depends on the specifics of the data at hand mcardle 1988 warton et al 2006 smith 2009 the ordinary least squares ols regression used by hatton et al 2015 and wigington et al 2016 optimizes the goodness of fit for the dependent y variable while implicitly assuming that errors in the predictor x variable are negligible this assumption is generally valid for data sets with clearly defined dependent and independent variables particularly results from controlled experiments sokal and rohlf 1995 warton et al 2006 in many environmental data sets however there is no meaningful distinction between dependent and independent variables for example both the predator y and prey x observations can have biological variability and are subjected to measurement and sampling errors for such data ols regression tends to bias the scaling relationship between x and y toward shallower slopes due to the variance in x mcardle 1988 reduced major axis rma regression avoids this bias by assuming that the x and y variables have the same error variances relative to their respective total variances mcardle 1988 re fitting the hatton et al 2015 predator prey data using rma regression we found scaling exponents around 1 rajakaruna et al 2023 therefore we will be using a linear relationship between fish and zooplankton biomass γ 1 with γ 1 the closure can be considered a true hybrid between linear and quadratic as it approaches the linear case at high zooplankton abundances and the quadratic case at low zooplankton finally we consider a version of our hyperbolic closure model with a dynamic n pool to investigate the impact of incomplete nutrient recycling in this model there is a constant external din input i n and predation on zooplankton is not converted back into the din pool therefore i n t o t i n m p p m z z 2 2 parameter values and sensitivity standard values for the parameters are listed in table 1 the phytoplankton growth parameters μ p m a x and k n are relatively well constrained by observations our chosen μ p m a x of 1 d 1 is close to the maximum phytoplankton growth rates that are typically observed in the ocean behrenfeld and boss 2014 although significantly higher growth rates have been observed in culture elrifi and turpin 1985 davidson et al 1999 bucciarelli and sunda 2003 we take k n equal to 0 5 μ m n a typical value found in culture experiments with marine phytoplankton eppley et al 1969 falkowski 1975 the zooplankton parameters appear to have a relatively large uncertainty which is why we varied these parameters in our bifurcation analyses laboratory studies indicate that maximum grazing rates μ z m a x range between 0 2 and 11 d 1 the maximum growth rate being significantly lower due to conversion loss and that half saturation constants for grazing k p are roughly between 0 05 and 50 μ m n hansen et al 1997 li et al 2011 mulder and hendriks 2014 we did not find literature values for the zooplankton maximum death rate d z m a x it has been suggested that k p and k z should be taken equal stock and dunne 2010 because there is no clear trend in the half saturation constant as a function of body size over 3 orders of magnitude for aquatic organisms hansen et al 1997 therefore we use k p k z 1 0 μ m n as standard values table 1 furthermore we use bifurcation analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the model predictions to the values of k p k z and d z m a x one way to investigate how the model predictions depend on variations in the parameter values is through extensive numerical simulations however there are limitations to this approach as each simulation corresponds to only one set of parameter values this makes it very difficult to locate tipping points or bifurcations where the system shifts from one type of behavior to a different one bifurcation analysis provides a powerful method to obtain a complete picture of the model behavior van voorn and kooi 2017 the bifurcation analysis package auto doedel and oldeman 2009 calculates the steady state solutions of the variables as a function of the parameters and assesses whether the steady state is stable for unstable steady states auto determines whether the system exhibits stable oscillations limit cycles or chaotic behavior moreover auto indicates the locations in parameter space of bifurcations where the behavior of the system changes qualitatively these bifurcations can then be mapped out as a function of two or more parameters 3 results we use bifurcation analysis as a tool to investigate how the behavior of our models depends on nutrient enrichment and model parameter values although bifurcations are mathematical concepts they have clear ecological interpretations within our model context the transcritical bifurcation corresponds to the point where zooplankton becomes extinct due to insufficient phytoplankton biomass at the hopf bifurcation the system transitions from a stable coexistence of phytoplankton and zooplankton to limit cycle oscillations we initially consider a system closed for mass in which biomass lost to respiration and dead zooplankton are instantaneously remineralized into the nutrient pool i n t o t m p p m z z d z z fig 1 shows the impact of nutrient enrichment for the linear and hyperbolic closure models for this system at standard parameter values table 1 in the linear closure case fig 1a there are three regimes separated by transcritical and hopf bifurcations at low n t o t up to the transcritical bifurcation there is a stable steady state with phytoplankton but without zooplankton there is stable co existence between the phytoplankton and zooplankton at intermediate n t o t until the hopf bifurcation where limit cycle oscillations emerge by contrast there is stable co existence between phytoplankton and zooplankton across almost the entire range of n t o t in the hyperbolic closure case fig 1b although we find a transcritical bifurcation at very low n t o t 0 26 μ m we do not encounter a hopf bifurcation in this analysis furthermore the predator prey biomass scaling predicted by the hyperbolic closure model appears quite consistent with both the power law scaling suggested by hatton et al 2015 and the linear scaling suggested by rajakaruna et al 2023 fig 2 we do find limit cycles with the hyperbolic closure model when we increase k z the half saturation constant for predation on zooplankton from its standard value of 1 μ m to 10 μ m fig 3 since both k z and k p are uncertain parameters we perform a systematic analysis of the sensitivity of the asymptotic behavior of the hyperbolic closure model to these two parameters in fig 4a b c we show bifurcation diagrams with k p and k z as bifurcation parameters at different concentrations of total n n t o t consistent with the bifurcation analysis in fig 1b the impact of nutrient enrichment appears relatively weak rather the limit cycle regime is associated with low values of k p and high values of k z across the different nutrient enrichments in fig 4d d z m a x and μ z m a x are the bifurcation parameters with the limit cycle regime occurring for high μ z m a x d z m a x ratios at high values of μ z m a x around 2 d 1 and higher there is again a stable steady state this state is top down controlled with much less biomass and a lower productivity than the stable state at lower values of μ z m a x in general high k z k p ratios and high μ z m a x d z m a x ratios are both associated with a high z p ratio or a top heavy ecosystem the reason is that high values of d z m a x and low values of k z increase the zooplankton loss rate whereas low values of k p and high values of μ z m a x increase the zooplankton growth rate and phytoplankton loss rate as a further sensitivity probe we perform the k p vs k z bifurcation analysis using different values of the maintenance loss rates of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass m p and m z within reasonable ranges these parameters do not appear to have a strong impact on the stability properties of the system finally we test the impact of incomplete nutrient recycling and a dynamic nutrient pool on the dynamics of the system for this purpose we set i n t o t i n m p p m z z there is an external input of din i n and dead zooplankton is no longer remineralized back into din this open system turns out to behave qualitatively similar to its closed system analogue as the n input into the system i n increases p and z increase together without destabilization fig 5 furthermore limit cycles are associated with a high k z k p ratio fig 5 or top heaviness the top down controlled state with low total biomass and low productivity that we found for high values of μ z m a x in the closed system does not appear in the open system 4 discussion we have derived a hyperbolic closure formulation using a modified holling type ii formulation for predation by an implicit predator population and an empirical predator prey scaling relationship to link the density of the implicit predator to the density of its prey furthermore we have investigated the impact of this closure on model dynamics comparing the behavior of our hyperbolic closure model with a linear closure analogue more specifically we asked under which conditions do our models exhibit a stable steady state or predator prey oscillations we believe that this question is particularly timely since sustained predator prey cycles involving phytoplankton and zooplankton have recently been observed in a microcosm blasius et al 2020 the linear closure model responded to nutrient enrichment in accord with classical theory rosenzweig 1971 kooi and boer 2001 it exhibits a stable steady state without zooplankton at low enrichment stable co existence between zooplankton and phytoplankton at intermediate enrichment and limit cycles at high enrichment by contrast we did not find a strong impact of nutrient enrichment on the asymptotic behavior of our hyperbolic closure model bifurcation analyses with our hyperbolic closure model did indicate that bottom heavy trophic chains tend to be more stable than top heavy trophic chains similar to predictions from linear closure models rip and mccann 2011 mccauley et al 2018 the ecological mechanism behind the stability of bottom heavy systems is that nutrient limitation provides a strong stabilizing feedback see the appendix for a more mathematical explanation in particular a too large phytoplankton population will decrease the nutrient concentration quickly leading to a rapid drop in its growth rate and a decline of the population toward the steady state this stabilizing effect tends to become weaker as the system becomes more top heavy for two reasons firstly the increased grazing pressure implies a higher phytoplankton mortality to balance this higher mortality the phytoplankton growth rate has to be closer to its maximum therefore a decrease or increase in the nutrient concentration will barely affect the population growth rate secondly a relatively large increase in the phytoplankton density will have relatively little impact on the nutrient concentration because the phytoplankton density is so low importantly nutrient enrichment does not necessarily alleviate nutrient limitation to a significant extent since the added nutrients are mostly converted into biomass a specific feature of the linear closure is that the added nutrients accumulate at the highest trophic level oksanen et al 1981 gatto 1991 as shown in fig 1a due to the associated increase in top heaviness the system becomes unstable according to our hyperbolic closure model the phytoplankton and zooplankton densities increase together with increasing nutrient enrichment fig 2 which is consistent with observations mccauley and kalff 1981 mccauley et al 1998 del giorgio and gasol 1995 hatton et al 2015 yuan and pollard 2018 as a result the stability of the system is not strongly affected by nutrient enrichment thus it appears that top heaviness is the characteristic responsible for instability across different closure formulations the specific formulation then determines under which conditions the system becomes top heavy all this said there is not a simple one to one relationship between top heaviness and instability in our model for example we found that if k p is high then the system can be stable with a high z p ratio this can be explained by the fact that a high value of k p decreases the grazing pressure on the phytoplankton that can therefore draw down the nutrients more effectively as a result the stabilization due to nutrient limitation becomes stronger in addition the stability is enhanced because a higher value of k p decreases the saturation effect in the grazing functional response we assumed linear scaling between the biomass of zooplankton and its predator γ 1 as suggested by rajakaruna et al 2023 to investigate the impact on the model behavior of sublinear scaling as suggested by hatton et al 2015 we performed several simulations using γ 0 7 the results were very similar to the γ 1 case depending on parameter values we found a stable steady state or limit cycles in particular limit cycles tended to be associated with high values of k z k p and μ z m a x d z m a x i e top heaviness as in the γ 1 case this said the sizes of the stable and unstable regions will depend on the specific model formulation and application for example the holling type ii functional response could be replaced by holling type iii to account for learning behavior flynn and mitra 2016 or by a functional response that accounts for feedbacks between satiation and prey encounter and capture pahlow 2005 smith and yamanaka 2007 it has been shown previously that the stable region of parameter space tends to be enlarged by holling type iii grazing truscott and brindley 1994 edwards and yool 2000 analyzed the stability properties of the fasham 1993 model which includes a hyperbolic closure and holling type iii grazing limit cycles were found in only a small region of parameter space probably as a result of the stabilizing impact of the grazing formulation nevertheless there is a similarity with the behavior of our model in that the small unstable region was associated with a high zooplankton to phytoplankton ratio see fig 11a in edwards and yool 2000 to test the prediction that top heavy systems exhibit more unstable dynamics than bottom heavy systems rip and mccann 2011 compared time series from aquatic terrestrial and wetland ecosystems they found that aquatic ecosystems are significantly more top heavy and exhibit a larger variability in time than wetlands and terrestrial ecosystems consistent with the predicted pattern however there are many potentially confounding factors when such different ecosystems are compared with each other for example large variations in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass may occur in aquatic ecosystems due to episodic upwelling of nutrients rather than as a result of the top heaviness of aquatic ecosystems in our view future studies could take two complementary approaches to resolve this issue 1 collecting more real world observational data to increase the statistical power for distinguishing between different potentially confounding factors 2 performing experiments in controlled environments such as microcosms see e g blasius et al 2020 to exclude confounding factors as much as possible even so we recognize that controlling the top heaviness of an experimental system would be far from trivial 5 conclusion we have presented a hyperbolic closure for ecosystem models we think that such a formulation is well founded because it is based on generally observed patterns predator prey scaling relationships and a saturating functional response a simple food chain model using this formulation predicts that instability is primarily associated with a high predator to prey ratio or top heaviness rather than with nutrient enrichment this prediction is rooted in the stabilizing impact of nutrient limitation which is stronger for bottom heavy than for top heavy systems credit authorship contribution statement anne willem omta

for inspiring discussions model code is available through https github com awo code npz appendix analysis a mathematical explanation for the instability of the top heavy regime in the following we will explain why the hyperbolic closure model s non trivial steady state is unstable in the top heavy regime z p 1 and stable in the bottom heavy regime z p 1 with p and z the steady state phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations respectively a system with two variables such as the one under consideration here is unstable when t r j 0 and d e t j 0 with t r j and d e t j the trace and determinant of the jacobian matrix at the non trivial steady state van voorn and kooi 2017 since d e t j is generally positive for our system we will focus our analysis on t r j j 11 j 22 with j 11 and j 22 the first and second diagonal elements of the steady state jacobian respectively to simplify the math we will consider the special case m p m z 0 but a similar argument applies if m p and m z are not equal to 0 let us first focus on j 22 by differentiating eq 1c for d z d t with respect to z we find a 1 j 22 μ z m a x p p k p d z m a x z 2 2 z k z z k z 2 μ z m a x p p k p d z m a x z z k z d z m a x z k z z k z 2 furthermore eq 1c gives μ z m a x p p k p d z m a x z z k z which then leads to a 2 j 22 d z m a x z k z z k z 2 in other words the second diagonal element of the jacobian j 22 is always negative which means that it stabilizes the system therefore we will need to take a look at the first diagonal element j 11 to understand under which conditions the system can become unstable for the non trivial steady state eq 1b for d p d t gives a 3 μ p m a x n t o t p z n t o t p z k n μ z m a x p k p z 0 which implies that a 4 z p k p μ p m a x n t o t p z μ z m a x n t o t p z k n in a top heavy system high z p ratio with a not too high value of k p z p k p is relatively large which means that μ p m a x n t o t p z μ z m a x n t o t p z k n must be close to its maximum value of μ p m a x μ z m a x and n t o t p z n k n therefore eq 1b can be simplified to a 5 d p d t μ p m a x p μ z m a x p p k p z by differentiating eq a 5 with respect to p we obtain the first diagonal element of the jacobian a 6 j 11 μ p m a x μ z m a x k p p k p 2 z furthermore since μ p m a x μ z m a x p k p z in this regime we obtain for the non trivial steady state a 7 j 11 μ z m a x p p k p 2 z which is always larger than 0 for p 0 z 0 thus the first diagonal element of the jacobian tends to destabilize the system if the system is either bottom heavy low z p ratio or k p is large then z p k p is small this means that μ p m a x n t o t p z μ z m a x n t o t p z k n must be small as well this can be achieved by having n t o t p z n k n and therefore eq 1b can be simplified to d p d t μ p m a x n t o t p z k n p μ z m a x p p k p z again we obtain the first diagonal element of the jacobian by differentiating eq with respect to p a 8 j 11 μ p m a x n t o t z k n μ p m a x 2 p k n μ z m a x k p p k p 2 z μ p m a x n t o t p z k n μ p m a x p k n μ z m a x k p p k p 2 z furthermore since μ p m a x n t o t p z k n μ z m a x p k p z in this regime we obtain for the non trivial steady state a 9 j 11 μ z m a x p p k p 2 z μ p m a x p k n with respect to the top heavy regime eq a 7 there is an additional negative term μ p m a x p k n which tends to stabilize the system 
24298,there exists considerable uncertainty about the most appropriate functional form to describe mortality at the highest trophic level the closure problem although linear and quadratic formulations predict strongly different dynamics it is unclear which of these formulations is more realistic we introduce an implicit predator population feeding on the highest trophic level parameterized through a holling type ii functional response and empirically observed predator prey scaling relations thus we arrive at a hyperbolic mortality formulation that is a hybrid between the linear and quadratic forms subsequently we investigate the impact of this formulation on the modeled population dynamics in particular we compare the stability properties of simple food chain models with a hyperbolic mortality and a linear mortality contrary to classical theory the model with a hyperbolic mortality does not exhibit destabilization due to nutrient enrichment for this model we find that limit cycles are rather associated with a top heavy ecosystem structure high predator low prey densities the weak response to enrichment emerges because populations of both the predator and prey increase with nutrient supply consistent with observations we discuss the mechanism behind the relationship between top heaviness and instability from an ecological and a mathematical perspective keywords ecosystem

trophic interactions moving up the trophic chain one eventually encounters the so called closure problem steele and henderson 1981 caswell and neubert 1998 murray and parslow 1999 franks 2002 neubert et al 2004 mitra 2009 kloosterman et al 2014 how should predation on the highest explicitly modeled trophic level be described in trophic models see e g piltz et al 2014 2018 araujo and moura 2022 tay et al 2022 for recent examples this has typically been formulated as a linear loss rate m z with m a constant and z the population density of the highest explicitly represented trophic level however predation at higher trophic levels may lead to an increase in the mortality rate toward higher population densities in recent ocean biogeochemical models see e g aumont et al 2015 baird et al 2020 pahlow et al 2020 for recent examples this has often been represented by a quadratic mortality m z 2 of the highest explicitly represented trophic level typically large zooplankton furthermore a hyperbolic formulation m z 2 z k z was used in some early ocean ecosystem models frost 1987 1993 hofmann and ambler 1988 fasham 1993 this is far from a trivial matter as the closure formulation has a strong impact on the model behavior a quadratic mortality at the highest trophic level leads to correlated increases in predator and prey biomass with increasing enrichment gleeson 1994 in contrast with the linear formulation gatto 1991 in addition steele and henderson 1992 showed that a quadratic zooplankton mortality tends to stabilize the temporal dynamics of nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton npz models subsequently it was demonstrated that models with a linear closure term and with a quadratic closure can both have stable steady states but these exist in a larger region of parameter space for the quadratic closure models edwards and brindley 1996 1999 edwards and yool 2000 since models are in many cases used to make predictions about the steady state of a system a quadratic mortality appears more practical to use than a linear mortality term that said the enhanced stability does not imply that a quadratic mortality is more realistic than linear mortality which of these closure formulations may be the most realistic to make progress on this question we have searched for systematic relationships between predator and prey biomass recent compilations of paired predator prey abundance observations hatton et al 2015 wigington et al 2016 yuan and pollard 2018 suggest that such systematic relationships indeed exist in this paper we leverage these empirical relationships to parameterize an implicit predator population feeding on the zooplankton combining this with the commonly used holling type ii predation we arrive at a hyperbolic closure what is the impact of this particular closure formulation on modeled population dynamics linear closure models generally exhibit a shift from stability to predator prey cycles due to nutrient enrichment rosenzweig 1971 as the system becomes more enriched the minima of the cycles reach such low values that the predator and prey effectively become extinct rosenzweig 1971 termed this effect the paradox of enrichment since nutrient enrichment would intuitively seem beneficial for the predator and prey however little empirical evidence has been found in support of ecosystem destabilization by enrichment jensen and ginzburg 2005 much theoretical research about resolving this paradox has focused on the impacts of behavioral interactions among predators and between predators and prey ruxton 1995 huisman and de boer 1997 van voorn et al 2008 přibylová and berec 2015 toyokawa 2017 we instead focus on the role of the model closure comparing the enrichment response between linear and hyperbolic formulations 2 models and methods in section 2 1 we formulate a npz model that is kept as simple as possible while maintaining key elements to allow for a transparent analysis subsequently we discuss the choice of parameter values as well as the use of auto to test the sensitivity of the model predictions to these parameter values section 2 2 2 1 model formulation the model includes the processes of nutrient uptake and associated phytoplankton growth zooplankton grazing and growth zooplankton mortality and maintenance losses for phytoplankton and zooplankton a holling type ii functional response is used for nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and for zooplankton grazing although sloppy feeding is not included trophic conversion inefficiencies are represented through linear maintenance loss terms for phytoplankton and zooplankton putting these processes together leads to the following set of equations 1a d n d t μ p m a x n n k n p i n t o t 1b d p d t μ p m a x n n k n p m p p μ z m a x p p k p z 1c d z d t μ z m a x p p k p z m z z d z z z in these equations n indicates the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din concentration in μ m n p the phytoplankton concentration μ m n and z the zooplankton concentration μ m n although nitrogen serves as the central currency of our model the analysis and argumentation do not change fundamentally if another nutrient e g phosphorus is chosen for that role i n t o t is the total din input μ p m a x and μ z m a x are the maximum uptake rates for phytoplankton and zooplankton d 1 k n and k p are the half saturation constants for nutrient uptake by phytoplankton and grazing by zooplankton μ m n m p and m z are maintenance loss rates of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass d 1 the per capita death rate of zooplankton or closure term is indicated by d z z here we only have two trophic levels p and z but the same structure can be used for a model with any number of trophic levels the closure term is then imposed on the highest explicitly resolved trophic level for the mortality we consider two formulations linear d z is constant and hyperbolic for the hyperbolic formulation we assume that the zooplankton is being preyed upon by a fish or other predator population f with a holling type ii functional response d z μ f m a x f z k z here μ f m a x is the maximum uptake rate for the predator and k z is a half saturation constant the predator population is not modeled explicitly but instead parameterized in terms of the zooplankton concentration using an empirical predator prey scaling relationship hatton et al 2015 wigington et al 2016 2 f c z γ with c a proportionality constant and γ a scaling exponent the number of model parameters can be reduced by one by combining c and μ f m a x into a single parameter the maximum zooplankton death rate d z m a x μ f m a x c hatton et al 2015 generally reported slightly sublinear scaling relationships between the predator and prey densities γ 0 7 however these sublinear scalings have recently been brought into question because an accurate determination of such relationships from environmental data with significant scatter is not straightforward several different methods are in use which one is the most appropriate depends on the specifics of the data at hand mcardle 1988 warton et al 2006 smith 2009 the ordinary least squares ols regression used by hatton et al 2015 and wigington et al 2016 optimizes the goodness of fit for the dependent y variable while implicitly assuming that errors in the predictor x variable are negligible this assumption is generally valid for data sets with clearly defined dependent and independent variables particularly results from controlled experiments sokal and rohlf 1995 warton et al 2006 in many environmental data sets however there is no meaningful distinction between dependent and independent variables for example both the predator y and prey x observations can have biological variability and are subjected to measurement and sampling errors for such data ols regression tends to bias the scaling relationship between x and y toward shallower slopes due to the variance in x mcardle 1988 reduced major axis rma regression avoids this bias by assuming that the x and y variables have the same error variances relative to their respective total variances mcardle 1988 re fitting the hatton et al 2015 predator prey data using rma regression we found scaling exponents around 1 rajakaruna et al 2023 therefore we will be using a linear relationship between fish and zooplankton biomass γ 1 with γ 1 the closure can be considered a true hybrid between linear and quadratic as it approaches the linear case at high zooplankton abundances and the quadratic case at low zooplankton finally we consider a version of our hyperbolic closure model with a dynamic n pool to investigate the impact of incomplete nutrient recycling in this model there is a constant external din input i n and predation on zooplankton is not converted back into the din pool therefore i n t o t i n m p p m z z 2 2 parameter values and sensitivity standard values for the parameters are listed in table 1 the phytoplankton growth parameters μ p m a x and k n are relatively well constrained by observations our chosen μ p m a x of 1 d 1 is close to the maximum phytoplankton growth rates that are typically observed in the ocean behrenfeld and boss 2014 although significantly higher growth rates have been observed in culture elrifi and turpin 1985 davidson et al 1999 bucciarelli and sunda 2003 we take k n equal to 0 5 μ m n a typical value found in culture experiments with marine phytoplankton eppley et al 1969 falkowski 1975 the zooplankton parameters appear to have a relatively large uncertainty which is why we varied these parameters in our bifurcation analyses laboratory studies indicate that maximum grazing rates μ z m a x range between 0 2 and 11 d 1 the maximum growth rate being significantly lower due to conversion loss and that half saturation constants for grazing k p are roughly between 0 05 and 50 μ m n hansen et al 1997 li et al 2011 mulder and hendriks 2014 we did not find literature values for the zooplankton maximum death rate d z m a x it has been suggested that k p and k z should be taken equal stock and dunne 2010 because there is no clear trend in the half saturation constant as a function of body size over 3 orders of magnitude for aquatic organisms hansen et al 1997 therefore we use k p k z 1 0 μ m n as standard values table 1 furthermore we use bifurcation analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the model predictions to the values of k p k z and d z m a x one way to investigate how the model predictions depend on variations in the parameter values is through extensive numerical simulations however there are limitations to this approach as each simulation corresponds to only one set of parameter values this makes it very difficult to locate tipping points or bifurcations where the system shifts from one type of behavior to a different one bifurcation analysis provides a powerful method to obtain a complete picture of the model behavior van voorn and kooi 2017 the bifurcation analysis package auto doedel and oldeman 2009 calculates the steady state solutions of the variables as a function of the parameters and assesses whether the steady state is stable for unstable steady states auto determines whether the system exhibits stable oscillations limit cycles or chaotic behavior moreover auto indicates the locations in parameter space of bifurcations where the behavior of the system changes qualitatively these bifurcations can then be mapped out as a function of two or more parameters 3 results we use bifurcation analysis as a tool to investigate how the behavior of our models depends on nutrient enrichment and model parameter values although bifurcations are mathematical concepts they have clear ecological interpretations within our model context the transcritical bifurcation corresponds to the point where zooplankton becomes extinct due to insufficient phytoplankton biomass at the hopf bifurcation the system transitions from a stable coexistence of phytoplankton and zooplankton to limit cycle oscillations we initially consider a system closed for mass in which biomass lost to respiration and dead zooplankton are instantaneously remineralized into the nutrient pool i n t o t m p p m z z d z z fig 1 shows the impact of nutrient enrichment for the linear and hyperbolic closure models for this system at standard parameter values table 1 in the linear closure case fig 1a there are three regimes separated by transcritical and hopf bifurcations at low n t o t up to the transcritical bifurcation there is a stable steady state with phytoplankton but without zooplankton there is stable co existence between the phytoplankton and zooplankton at intermediate n t o t until the hopf bifurcation where limit cycle oscillations emerge by contrast there is stable co existence between phytoplankton and zooplankton across almost the entire range of n t o t in the hyperbolic closure case fig 1b although we find a transcritical bifurcation at very low n t o t 0 26 μ m we do not encounter a hopf bifurcation in this analysis furthermore the predator prey biomass scaling predicted by the hyperbolic closure model appears quite consistent with both the power law scaling suggested by hatton et al 2015 and the linear scaling suggested by rajakaruna et al 2023 fig 2 we do find limit cycles with the hyperbolic closure model when we increase k z the half saturation constant for predation on zooplankton from its standard value of 1 μ m to 10 μ m fig 3 since both k z and k p are uncertain parameters we perform a systematic analysis of the sensitivity of the asymptotic behavior of the hyperbolic closure model to these two parameters in fig 4a b c we show bifurcation diagrams with k p and k z as bifurcation parameters at different concentrations of total n n t o t consistent with the bifurcation analysis in fig 1b the impact of nutrient enrichment appears relatively weak rather the limit cycle regime is associated with low values of k p and high values of k z across the different nutrient enrichments in fig 4d d z m a x and μ z m a x are the bifurcation parameters with the limit cycle regime occurring for high μ z m a x d z m a x ratios at high values of μ z m a x around 2 d 1 and higher there is again a stable steady state this state is top down controlled with much less biomass and a lower productivity than the stable state at lower values of μ z m a x in general high k z k p ratios and high μ z m a x d z m a x ratios are both associated with a high z p ratio or a top heavy ecosystem the reason is that high values of d z m a x and low values of k z increase the zooplankton loss rate whereas low values of k p and high values of μ z m a x increase the zooplankton growth rate and phytoplankton loss rate as a further sensitivity probe we perform the k p vs k z bifurcation analysis using different values of the maintenance loss rates of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass m p and m z within reasonable ranges these parameters do not appear to have a strong impact on the stability properties of the system finally we test the impact of incomplete nutrient recycling and a dynamic nutrient pool on the dynamics of the system for this purpose we set i n t o t i n m p p m z z there is an external input of din i n and dead zooplankton is no longer remineralized back into din this open system turns out to behave qualitatively similar to its closed system analogue as the n input into the system i n increases p and z increase together without destabilization fig 5 furthermore limit cycles are associated with a high k z k p ratio fig 5 or top heaviness the top down controlled state with low total biomass and low productivity that we found for high values of μ z m a x in the closed system does not appear in the open system 4 discussion we have derived a hyperbolic closure formulation using a modified holling type ii formulation for predation by an implicit predator population and an empirical predator prey scaling relationship to link the density of the implicit predator to the density of its prey furthermore we have investigated the impact of this closure on model dynamics comparing the behavior of our hyperbolic closure model with a linear closure analogue more specifically we asked under which conditions do our models exhibit a stable steady state or predator prey oscillations we believe that this question is particularly timely since sustained predator prey cycles involving phytoplankton and zooplankton have recently been observed in a microcosm blasius et al 2020 the linear closure model responded to nutrient enrichment in accord with classical theory rosenzweig 1971 kooi and boer 2001 it exhibits a stable steady state without zooplankton at low enrichment stable co existence between zooplankton and phytoplankton at intermediate enrichment and limit cycles at high enrichment by contrast we did not find a strong impact of nutrient enrichment on the asymptotic behavior of our hyperbolic closure model bifurcation analyses with our hyperbolic closure model did indicate that bottom heavy trophic chains tend to be more stable than top heavy trophic chains similar to predictions from linear closure models rip and mccann 2011 mccauley et al 2018 the ecological mechanism behind the stability of bottom heavy systems is that nutrient limitation provides a strong stabilizing feedback see the appendix for a more mathematical explanation in particular a too large phytoplankton population will decrease the nutrient concentration quickly leading to a rapid drop in its growth rate and a decline of the population toward the steady state this stabilizing effect tends to become weaker as the system becomes more top heavy for two reasons firstly the increased grazing pressure implies a higher phytoplankton mortality to balance this higher mortality the phytoplankton growth rate has to be closer to its maximum therefore a decrease or increase in the nutrient concentration will barely affect the population growth rate secondly a relatively large increase in the phytoplankton density will have relatively little impact on the nutrient concentration because the phytoplankton density is so low importantly nutrient enrichment does not necessarily alleviate nutrient limitation to a significant extent since the added nutrients are mostly converted into biomass a specific feature of the linear closure is that the added nutrients accumulate at the highest trophic level oksanen et al 1981 gatto 1991 as shown in fig 1a due to the associated increase in top heaviness the system becomes unstable according to our hyperbolic closure model the phytoplankton and zooplankton densities increase together with increasing nutrient enrichment fig 2 which is consistent with observations mccauley and kalff 1981 mccauley et al 1998 del giorgio and gasol 1995 hatton et al 2015 yuan and pollard 2018 as a result the stability of the system is not strongly affected by nutrient enrichment thus it appears that top heaviness is the characteristic responsible for instability across different closure formulations the specific formulation then determines under which conditions the system becomes top heavy all this said there is not a simple one to one relationship between top heaviness and instability in our model for example we found that if k p is high then the system can be stable with a high z p ratio this can be explained by the fact that a high value of k p decreases the grazing pressure on the phytoplankton that can therefore draw down the nutrients more effectively as a result the stabilization due to nutrient limitation becomes stronger in addition the stability is enhanced because a higher value of k p decreases the saturation effect in the grazing functional response we assumed linear scaling between the biomass of zooplankton and its predator γ 1 as suggested by rajakaruna et al 2023 to investigate the impact on the model behavior of sublinear scaling as suggested by hatton et al 2015 we performed several simulations using γ 0 7 the results were very similar to the γ 1 case depending on parameter values we found a stable steady state or limit cycles in particular limit cycles tended to be associated with high values of k z k p and μ z m a x d z m a x i e top heaviness as in the γ 1 case this said the sizes of the stable and unstable regions will depend on the specific model formulation and application for example the holling type ii functional response could be replaced by holling type iii to account for learning behavior flynn and mitra 2016 or by a functional response that accounts for feedbacks between satiation and prey encounter and capture pahlow 2005 smith and yamanaka 2007 it has been shown previously that the stable region of parameter space tends to be enlarged by holling type iii grazing truscott and brindley 1994 edwards and yool 2000 analyzed the stability properties of the fasham 1993 model which includes a hyperbolic closure and holling type iii grazing limit cycles were found in only a small region of parameter space probably as a result of the stabilizing impact of the grazing formulation nevertheless there is a similarity with the behavior of our model in that the small unstable region was associated with a high zooplankton to phytoplankton ratio see fig 11a in edwards and yool 2000 to test the prediction that top heavy systems exhibit more unstable dynamics than bottom heavy systems rip and mccann 2011 compared time series from aquatic terrestrial and wetland ecosystems they found that aquatic ecosystems are significantly more top heavy and exhibit a larger variability in time than wetlands and terrestrial ecosystems consistent with the predicted pattern however there are many potentially confounding factors when such different ecosystems are compared with each other for example large variations in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass may occur in aquatic ecosystems due to episodic upwelling of nutrients rather than as a result of the top heaviness of aquatic ecosystems in our view future studies could take two complementary approaches to resolve this issue 1 collecting more real world observational data to increase the statistical power for distinguishing between different potentially confounding factors 2 performing experiments in controlled environments such as microcosms see e g blasius et al 2020 to exclude confounding factors as much as possible even so we recognize that controlling the top heaviness of an experimental system would be far from trivial 5 conclusion we have presented a hyperbolic closure for ecosystem models we think that such a formulation is well founded because it is based on generally observed patterns predator prey scaling relationships and a saturating functional response a simple food chain model using this formulation predicts that instability is primarily associated with a high predator to prey ratio or top heaviness rather than with nutrient enrichment this prediction is rooted in the stabilizing impact of nutrient limitation which is stronger for bottom heavy than for top heavy systems credit authorship contribution statement anne willem omta

for inspiring discussions model code is available through https github com awo code npz appendix analysis a mathematical explanation for the instability of the top heavy regime in the following we will explain why the hyperbolic closure model s non trivial steady state is unstable in the top heavy regime z p 1 and stable in the bottom heavy regime z p 1 with p and z the steady state phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations respectively a system with two variables such as the one under consideration here is unstable when t r j 0 and d e t j 0 with t r j and d e t j the trace and determinant of the jacobian matrix at the non trivial steady state van voorn and kooi 2017 since d e t j is generally positive for our system we will focus our analysis on t r j j 11 j 22 with j 11 and j 22 the first and second diagonal elements of the steady state jacobian respectively to simplify the math we will consider the special case m p m z 0 but a similar argument applies if m p and m z are not equal to 0 let us first focus on j 22 by differentiating eq 1c for d z d t with respect to z we find a 1 j 22 μ z m a x p p k p d z m a x z 2 2 z k z z k z 2 μ z m a x p p k p d z m a x z z k z d z m a x z k z z k z 2 furthermore eq 1c gives μ z m a x p p k p d z m a x z z k z which then leads to a 2 j 22 d z m a x z k z z k z 2 in other words the second diagonal element of the jacobian j 22 is always negative which means that it stabilizes the system therefore we will need to take a look at the first diagonal element j 11 to understand under which conditions the system can become unstable for the non trivial steady state eq 1b for d p d t gives a 3 μ p m a x n t o t p z n t o t p z k n μ z m a x p k p z 0 which implies that a 4 z p k p μ p m a x n t o t p z μ z m a x n t o t p z k n in a top heavy system high z p ratio with a not too high value of k p z p k p is relatively large which means that μ p m a x n t o t p z μ z m a x n t o t p z k n must be close to its maximum value of μ p m a x μ z m a x and n t o t p z n k n therefore eq 1b can be simplified to a 5 d p d t μ p m a x p μ z m a x p p k p z by differentiating eq a 5 with respect to p we obtain the first diagonal element of the jacobian a 6 j 11 μ p m a x μ z m a x k p p k p 2 z furthermore since μ p m a x μ z m a x p k p z in this regime we obtain for the non trivial steady state a 7 j 11 μ z m a x p p k p 2 z which is always larger than 0 for p 0 z 0 thus the first diagonal element of the jacobian tends to destabilize the system if the system is either bottom heavy low z p ratio or k p is large then z p k p is small this means that μ p m a x n t o t p z μ z m a x n t o t p z k n must be small as well this can be achieved by having n t o t p z n k n and therefore eq 1b can be simplified to d p d t μ p m a x n t o t p z k n p μ z m a x p p k p z again we obtain the first diagonal element of the jacobian by differentiating eq with respect to p a 8 j 11 μ p m a x n t o t z k n μ p m a x 2 p k n μ z m a x k p p k p 2 z μ p m a x n t o t p z k n μ p m a x p k n μ z m a x k p p k p 2 z furthermore since μ p m a x n t o t p z k n μ z m a x p k p z in this regime we obtain for the non trivial steady state a 9 j 11 μ z m a x p p k p 2 z μ p m a x p k n with respect to the top heavy regime eq a 7 there is an additional negative term μ p m a x p k n which tends to stabilize the system

to identify how human and environmental factors influence distributions of plants and animals lack of high resolution climatic variables is one of the challenges for accurately predicting distributions of organisms at local or landscape scales this study used sdms to predict four dominant tree species distributions in northern iran temperate forests 400km2 area using high resolution sentinel 2 data 20 m and topographic variables we divided the explanatory variables into four datasets with increasing complexity of sentinel 2 data and modelled distributions using four statistical and machine learning algorithms random forest rf generalized boosting model gbm generalized linear model glm and generalized additive model gam our results suggested differences in the predictive performance of the four algorithms we found the most complex dataset including topographic variables sentinel 2 bands and vegetation and soil indices gave the best fit for the four tree species improving the accuracy of models for the different species between 5 and 16 we then selected the most complex dataset to produce an ensemble model of the modeling algorithms where evaluation criteria were varied for tree species our result showed that the performance of sdms improved using different satellite remote sensing data including raw bands topographic variables and indices in the hyrcanian forest northern iran elevation was a more significant variable than sentinel bands and sentinel vegetation indices variables for predicting the tree species distributions with the hyrcanian forest included in this study region of northern iran recently declared a unesco world heritage site a key result of our improved species distribution maps for these four dominant tree species is to support conservation management of forest biodiversity in this region keywords forest farming forest management remote sensing species distribution models machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global decline in biodiversity is mainly due to land or sea use change direct exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species díaz 2019 about 60 of the species became extinct in the last 50 years and given that about 25 of all species from red list assessed groups are threatened with extinction verdura et al 2019 much of the biodiversity is expected to be lost in the near future the decrease in biodiversity has changed ecosystem functions and services and has negative impacts on human well being cardinale et al 2012 given the growing concern about the loss of biodiversity it is necessary to use sound management and development strategies to reduce further losses and adverse effects on the environment and human society land cover datasets particularly vegetation maps are of primary importance for monitoring vegetation cover geographical distribution and dynamics such datasets provide systematic information which can be used in several fields of applied research baret and buis 2008 international mitigation programs have been used to analyze and observe species distribution spatial patterns schmeller et al 2015 in contemporary science species distribution models sdms have been widely used to identify biodiversity hotspots in general sdms use environmental factors to estimate the species niche and species distribution elith and leathwick 2009 besides sdm has been applied as an important tool in conservation planning and management elith et al 2008 guisan et al 2013 therefore it is essential to understand the tree species distribution for proper conservation and sustainable biodiversity management alavi et al 2019 to do so sufficient knowledge regarding the composition and abundances of tree species distribution is required for effective forest management environmental factors such as soil water temperature incident of solar radiation etc affect the growth distribution and abundance of tree species bourque et al 2000 gustafson et al 2003 if any changes occur among these environmental variables like climate and soil species and landscape ecology composition may change considerably the use of machine learning models in environmental sciences mohammadi 2021 moazenzadeh et al 2022 li et al 2022 mohammadi et al 2022 and especially remote sensing has made great progress in recent years hadadi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 tian et al 2019 2021 one of the important applications of these models is species distribution models mahmoodi et al 2022 in order to improve the accuracy of sdms a number of methods of have been advocated including ensemble approaches araújo and new 2007 grenouillet et al 2011 this approach often involves several individual model algorithms being fitted in order to generate an ensemble or consensus of predictions these individual models commonly are combined in ensemble models based on weights and or averages of evaluation criteria araújo and new 2007 although some studies suggest ensemble models perform better compared to individual models grenouillet et al 2011 guo et al 2015 kaky et al 2020 others show this is not necessarily the case crimmins et al 2013 zhu and peterson 2017 hao et al 2020 thus it is has been suggested that in addition to individual models the results of ensemble models be considered to reduce model uncertainty hao et al 2020 species distribution models can be implemented at different spatial and temporal scales sdms commonly require species occurrence records and relevant environmental data that 1 km resolution is a very commonly used resolution for sdms at broad spatial scales climatic variables often play a key role in determining the distribution of species but other factors can be more important at finer scales knowledge of factors preventing species from being present at finer scales can often inform conservation programs guisan and theurillat 2000 gustafson et al 2003 li et al 2021 2022 moreover the use of climatic variables in some areas without considering measurement errors and uncertainties can lead to biased results krömer et al 2013 a promising approach to address this issue is the use of remote sensing data where information is acquired about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object for example remote sensing data has been successfully used in ecological studies campos et al 2016 payacán et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 including predicting distributions of tree species cord et al 2013 a study by zimmermann et al 2007 showed that by incorporating predictors derived from remote sensing data significantly improved the accurcy of sdms remote sensing data has also been used in sdms for conservation purposes vila viçosa et al 2020 to identify tree species engler et al 2013 and to classify habitat types agrillo et al 2021 another way to using remote sensing data in sdms is by extracting topographic variables such as altitude and slope at where species are found then incorporating this information in models because topographic variables often have strong associations with climatic factors they can be used to increase the accuracy of the models when climate data is not available a recently developed type of remote sensing data are those from sentinel satellites acquired at high spatial resolution over land and sea the use using sentinel satellite data has allowed large forest areas to be monitored with high spatial accuracy 20 m ahmadi et al 2020b for example hościło and lewandowska 2019 used multi temporal sentinel 2a data to map forest type and tree species in a large mountain area in southern poland immitzer et al 2019 also used sentinel 2 data to map tree species in central europe although many studies have used sentinel 2 data for vegetation mapping and plant science ahmadi et al 2020b waśniewski et al 2020 tian et al 2021 it has not yet been widely used in sdms in this study we use remote sensing data to improve sdms for four dominant tree species in the hyrcanian forest of northern iran an important and valuable ecosystem which is listed as a united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco world heritage site ahmadi et al 2020a our main objective was to investigate improvements of predictive performance in sdms by varying topographic variables namely sentinel bands and vegetation indices sentinel 2a satellite image for four sdms algorithms i e random forests rf generalized additive model gam generalized linear model glm and generalized boosted model gbm finally we used an ensemble of the four sdms to produce habitat suitability maps for the four dominant tree species at the landscape scale in the hyrcanian forests of iran this proposed method also can be used in other small areas less than 500km2 and mountainous forest with high elevational variability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a part of hyrcanian forests in northern iran characterized by very high biodiversity the area covers part of forests in noor county mazandaran province with an elevation ranging from sea level to 1700 m and range of hillshade is from 0 to 253 fig 1 the mean precipitation of the region is about 997 mm per year with mean temperatures being about 16 4 c ahmadi et al 2020 2 2 tree species data there are about 80 tree species in the hyrcanian forests with the most important and abundant being fagus orientalis l oriental beech carpinus betulus l hornbeam parrotia persica c a mey persian ironwood and quercus castaneifolia c a mey chestnut leaved oak hornbeam is a native species in the caspian hyrcanian mixed forests ecoregion growing in mixed stands of oak and beech and in some areas with ironwood sagheb talebi et al 2014 hornbeam populations occurring at altitudes up to 1000 m above sea level abdi et al 2009 the oriental beech is economic hardwood species alavi et al 2020 with beech forests accounting for approximately 17 6 of the total forest area in iran s hyrcanian forests ahmadi et al 2015 parrotia persica is one of the native tree species of iran which is located in the northern highlands of the alborz mountains in the hyrcanian forests to the south and the southwest caspian sea distributed in middle and lowland areas up to altitudes from 150 to 1400 m sefidi et al 2011 quercus castaneifolia c a mey can be found in pure and mixed stands covering about 6 5 of hyrcanian forests panahi et al 2011 the main two important forest communities in the hyrcanian forests are querco buxetum in the caspian coastal plains and querco carpinetum in lowland areas up to 700 m panahi et al 2011 in this study we modeled these four tree species in hyrcanian forests with the distribution records used in the sdms from forest inventory data provided by iranian forests range and watershed management organization 2018 the total number of sample plots in the area was 5600 plots each with an area of 1000 m2 to model these four species distribution only plots in which these four species were predominant and more than other species were considered presence points and plots without these species as absence points 2 3 study workflow in the current study several methodological steps were followed out to fulfill the present objectives and the methodological flowchart is presented in fig 2 2 4 remote sensing we used freely available sentinel 2 images level 2a product bottom of atmosphere reflectance tile number t39sxa downloaded from the copernicus open access hub due to many sentinel 2 images in the hyrcanian forests having a high percentage of clouds we selected images that had a low cloud percentage initially 10 spectral bands ranging from visible wavelength 443 nm to short wave infra red 2190 nm were acquired from sentinel 2 data table 1 2 5 environmental variables we also used using elevation data with the spectral bands as this has previously been shown to be effective in forest applications hościło and lewandowska 2019 the elevation data was downloaded from the advanced land observation satellite alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar palsar digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m www asf alaska edu 2 6 preprocessing and remote sensing variables preparation the sentinel 2a satellite dataset of two top of atmosphere toa sentinel granules were first pre corrected radiometrically and geometrically at the sentinel hub of the european space agency esa we nest used an atmospheric dataset correction done by sen2cor l2a processor using the sentinel 2 snap toolkit which is hemispherical directional reflectance hdrf schaepman strub et al 2006 the corrected image of level 2a with bottom of atmosphere boa reflectance was for each of the sentinel granules the nearest neighbor method was used to resample the 20 m resolution bands i e 5 6 7 8a 11 and 12 to a 10 m resolution we then stacked the sentinel granules i e all bands namely 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8a 11 and 12 the granules were finally enhanced using two processes 1 elimination of high correlation found in the multispectral sensors dataset using a decorrelation stretch and 2 the minimum noise fraction mnf was used to increase the signal to noise ratio in the multispectral sensors dataset the radiometric geometric and terrain correction of alospalsar dem data was done by the asf mapready program from the geographical institute at the university of alaska fairbanks the radar backscattering coefficients were obtained by converting dn to sigma nought of this dem we applied a 5 5 window size medium filter to minimize this dem data speckle noise 2 7 feature computation extraction and selection 2 7 1 indices and band extraction we used a total of 19 explanatory variables 14 of which were derived from sentinel 2a satellite data and five from alos palsar dem data the 14 satellite based variables were difference vegetation index dvi pettorelli et al 2005 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi malik et al 2019 modified soil adjusted vegetation index msavi qi et al 1994 modified soil adjusted vegetation index 2 msavi2 qi et al 1994 green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi buschmann and nagel 1993 infrared percentage vegetation index ipvi crippen 1990 inverted red edge chlorophyll index ireci guyot and baret 1988 normalized difference index ndi45 delegido et al 2011 pigment specific simple ratio chlorophyll index pssra blackburn 1998 perpendicular vegetation index pvi pal et al 2018 ratio vegetation index rvi major et al 1990 soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 transformed normalized difference vegetation index tndvi senseman et al 1996 weighted difference vegetation index wdvi clevers 1988 table 2 shows the various indices and their respective band math equation the five dem based variables were elevation slope topographic radiation aspect trasp topographic wetness index twi and topographic position index tpi the environmental factors such as elevation and slope represent climatic and edaphic site conditions homeier et al 2010 furthermore these variables broadly influence tree richness and forest structural characteristics in the mountainous region lomolino 2001 thus patterns of tree diversity depend on elevation gradients along with other environmental factors aspect is a topographic feature that influences the flow pattern of rainfall and solar radiation on the slope surface therefore moisture condition and status of vegetation are dependent on the slope aspect it is a measurement of azimuth θ from the true north and measures through topographic radiation aspect trasp roberts and cooper 1989 the topographic wetness index twi is the indirect measure of soil moisture condition and has been considered an index for tree species diversity modeling topographic position index tpi is a method used to measure topographic slope position and landforms classification tpi is calculated as the mean difference between the elevation of a given cell and the elevation of cells located at a particular region around that cell mokarram et al 2015 the following equations were used to calculate trasp twi and tpi indices 1 t r a s p 1 c o s π 180 θ 30 2 2 t w i l o g e a s t a n β where a s is the area of a catchment in m2 and β is the gradient of the slope in radians hong et al 2018 3 t p i m 0 n 1 m n n where m 0 is an elevation of the model point m n is an elevation of the grid and n represent a total numbers of neighbourhood region 2 7 2 feature selection to select features we used a recursive feature elimination rfe which automatically filters the low weight variables and removes them from the model by repetitive modeling process this is an iterative process where features are ranked with the less important being removed the recursive method is essential to measure the relative importance of the features during the elimination process granitto et al 2006 table 3 shows the explanatory variables and their rfe process in four datasets 2 8 species distribution models sdms in the present study we used ensemble o four species distribution models including rf gbm gam and glm breiman first proposed the algorithm of rf in 2001 breiman 2001 this algorithm is a non parametric statistical technique capable of handling a big number of correlated variables in a dataset the function of rf is based on the ensemble of a binary decision tree with a combination of bagging and randomly selected variables l breiman 2001 the bagging approach is a function in which one sample has more priority than the others hastie and tibshirami developed the gam in 1990 hastie and tibshirani 1990 it is a modified version of logistic regression used for multivariate measurement between the dependent and independent variables the gam is efficient in complex non linearity analysis dominici et al 2002 the glm is extensively used in the field of earth observation and forest science in general this model is based on the logit link function of the statistical probability method i e logistic regression pourghasemi and rossi 2017 basically it is the modified function of a simple linear regression model in the ml algorithm methodology boosting has been widely used in several fields of study by many researchers in gbms using a flexible judgmental method the propensity score for the binary treatment can be estimated this model is combined with several regression trees to generate a constant function breiman 1996 the process of gbm estimation is based on multiple regression tree development mccaffrey et al 2004 the gbm process is also carried out by complex and nonlinear relationships among the events variables and non events covariates without overfitting the data friedman 2001 we used the ensemble forecasting methods in the r package biomod2 vs 3 3 7 1 thuiller et al 2016 for sdms validation and predictive accuracy are useful for statistical and ml models output results we also validated the ensemble model for four tree species models using the auc tss and kappa coefficient index analysis guisan et al 2017 3 result 3 1 model performance evaluation the statistical and machine learning approaches with various data splits datasets i to iv were initially used in this study we evaluated the performance of the four datasets dataset i to iv four sdms i e rf gam glm and gbm for the four tree species q castaneifolia p persica c betulus and f orientalis for auc results q castaneifolia had higher predictive capabilities than the other three species with all datasets and all sdms fig 3 the median auc of q castaneifolia ranged from 0 80 to 0 85 with the inter quartile range q3 q1 and the range of minimum and maximum values of auc very low compared to the other tree species the f orientalis had the lowest predictive capability with higher inter quartile and maximum minimum ranges of auc there are no such differences between the auc of the sdms for a tree species distribution model like f orientalis but the sdms are best for the q castaneifolia tree species classification followed by p persica c betulus and f orientalis respectively the results of auc has also shown the predictive capability of the partitioning datasets and the dataset iv was the best suitable variables for each sdms and tree species models fig 3 the median auc of the dataset iv ranged from 0 72 to 0 83 on the other hand dataset i was the worst resampling training data with bad predictive capability in all tree species prediction the tree species distribution model performance was also evaluated by the tss fig 4 the box plot of tss showed the same trend as the auc model evaluator of the sdms and the datasets for the four types of tree species box plot of tss has shown all the four models and four datasets have best predicted tree species of the q castaneifolia the tss model evaluator the dataset iii and iv methods did the best performance in the four models for the four mentioned tree species kappa index or kappa statistics is the most important model evaluator for sdms fig 5 from the four tree species kappa results it is clear that the q castaneifolia tree species models have the best accuracy according to the kappa index the datasets iv is the best method for the sdms in c betulus and the f orientalis tree species on the other side datasets ii and iii are the best methods in the p persica and q castaneifolia tree species from the model evaluator box plots it is clear that the four machine learning models performance is good but when the sdms are performing with the datasets iv it was performed as the best model it has also been observed that the q castaneifolia tree sdm is the robust model in all of them 3 2 evaluation criteria of ensemble sdms after evaluating the four datasets and four sdms we selected the dataset iv and the ensemble of the ml methods to find the most robust sdm table 4 shows the performance of ensemble sdm for the four species where the highest auc tss and kappa depict more robust sdms and conversely low auc tss and kappa index values indicate comparatively low accuracy of sdms the evaluation statistics showed for the four the tree species the sdms predicted the tree species properly by the ensemble approach as per the result the q castaneifolia sdm has the highest auc 0 86 tss 0 59 and kappa index 0 52 after the q castaneifolia the c betulus tree species are the best tree sdms and followed by f orientalis and p persica respectively the standard deviation sd of the model evaluator of each tree sdms indicated the f orientalis species have a good distribution of auc q castaneifolia is the good distribution of tss and the f orientalis species has the best distribution of kappa index 3 3 relative importance of sdms variables we initially investigated the use of 30 explanatory variables where the recursive feature elimination rfe automatically removes the low weight variables finally the sdms selected the 5 10 11 and 16 variables for the dataset i ii iii and iv respectively the dataset iv was chosen for the ensemble sdms in the model performance evaluation of the dataset iv was performed best and dataset iv has the sample variables from the topographic variables sentinel bands and sentinel vegetation indices table 5 shows the relative importance of the variable of dataset iv for the mentioned four species in ensemble sdms for f orientalis elevation is the most important variable followed by b11 slope b6 tpi and ireci the elevation is also the most influential factor of tree species distribution of c betulus followed by b6 ireci b11 ndi45 and slope the best six important factors for q castaneifolia were elevation followed by slope rvi gndvi ireci and b2 for p persica the relative importance of variables were elevation b11 ireci b5 b6 and gndvi the topographic factor elevation was a more significant variable than the sentinel bands and sentinel vegetation indices variables for predicting the distributions of the four tree species 3 4 species distribution maps for four tree species fig 6 shows the potential geographic distribution ensemble species distribution map of four tree species across the study area the probability of tree species distribution maps classified into five probability zones i e very high high moderate low and very low however the predictive areas of very high to high of the c betulus tree species have been predicted mainly in the east part but the distribution is scattered in most of the part of the study area the very low to low spatial constriction corresponds with low elevation areas in this study area the high f orientalis tree species predictive distribution is mainly found in the upper elevated area at the east to the west zone the maximum p persica has been distributed over the middle part of the study area as well as the medium elevated areas it is quite clear from the ensemble of the q castaneifolia distribution map that this tree species is strongly associated with the lower elevations because it has been predicted in the northern part of the study area a comparatively low elevation area the spatial distribution of predictive species distribution maps indicates the consistency of the ensemble sdms for this study area 4 discussion in diverse fields such as ecology biogeography and conservation sdms are increasingly used that relate occurrence records to environmental predictors to model distributions based on statistical and machine learning approaches guisan et al 2013 our study modelled distributions for the four tree species c betulus f orientails p persica and q castaneifolia in the temperate forests of northern iran the study tests the applicability of gam gbm glm rf and ensemble machine learning approaches for predicting the distribution of the tree species in four different datasets dataset i to iv the efficiency of species distribution models were validated through tss auc and the kappa coefficient index we found the model fit of rf had the highest index while gam ranked second the results of variable importance showed that for f orientalis elevation was the most important variable followed by b11 slope b6 tpi and ireci the elevation is also the most influential factor of tree species distribution of c betulus followed by b6 ireci b11 ndi45 and slope the best six important factors of q castaneifolia tree species are elevation followed by slope rvi gndvi ireci and b2 p persica distribution modeling effective causative factors are elevation b11 ireci b5 b6 and gndvi our results demonstrated the ability of sentinel 2a images and topographic variables derived from alos palsar dem to improve species distribution models the application of sdms with ensembles of machine learning methods has become a suitable and robust technique in ecology for the spatial prediction of the plant species liu et al 2018 various previous studies have also demonstrated the new approaches of the ensemble of machine learning methods to deal with the new challenge in species distribution ndlovu et al 2018 to validate the sdms on model performance evaluation the ensemble models performed well compared to the individuals models hao et al 2020 our results based on auc tss and kappa index all suggested differences in different modeling approaches generalization efficiency gam gbm glm and rf the use of remote sensing data to improve the performance of sdms has a long history especially in areas that are poor in environmental data the importance of this use has recently become more prominent due to climate change and forests are among the ecosystems that are most affected by climate change therefore understanding forest dynamics and quantitative methods for assessing climatic effects on species distribution is of great importance this study indicates the high potential of sentinel 2 data for classifying forest trees in mountainous areas in other studies the accuracy of sentinel data in plant classification has been proven bolyn et al 2018 grabska et al 2020 hościło and lewandowska 2019 various data and satellite images have been used in hyrcanian forests to classify species and tree cover in the past ahmadi et al 2020 used machine learning models and sentinel 2 data to model forest characteristics such as basal area stem volume and stem density and showed that sentinel 2 data is highly efficient in mountain forests characteristics mapping soleimannejad et al 2019 used sentinel 2 landsat and irs satellite images to classify tree species in hyrcanian forests their results showed that near ir spectral bands were more important in classifying tree species and sentinel 2 data is very useful in classifying tree species in hyrcanian forests one of the main aims of the present study was to indicate the best combination of remote sensing data to improve the species distribution models of trees in northern iran s hyrcanian forests for this purpose topographic data obtained from alos palsar dem raw bands and vegetation indices of sentinel 2 were divided into four different datasets the results showed the combination of topographic data obtained from alos palsar dem raw bands and vegetation indices of sentinel 2 improved the accuracy of species distribution models for all tree species one useful way to increase the efficiency of species distribution models is to add dem data to the model this study showed that the topographic data derived from alos palsar dem were very useful for modeling all four tree species in a study conducted by vafaei et al 2018 in hyrcanian forests to estimate the forest aboveground biomass the high efficiency of using alos palsar dem has been proven in this study the results showed that elevation and slope were the most important topographic variables that improved the performance of dominant tree species distribution models in the hyrcanian forests of northern iran these two variables have previously been shown to be important variables in tree species distribution models in mountainous areas because they determine the difference in height and the difference in exposure to solar radiation ren et al 2009 although the addition of topographic variables such as elevation and slope in different regions has improved the performance of the species distribution models grabska et al 2020 engler et al 2013 showed that the area is a very important factor and in small areas these variables have less impact on the accuracy of models our results are consistent with a recent study that classified trees in a large area of poland using sentinel 2 data and topographic variables which showed that topographic variables are of great importance in model performance grabska et al 2020 in the study of abdullahnejad et al 2017 conducted in the hyrcanian forests of northern iran elevation was also one of the most important variables affecting tree species distribution models abdollahnejad et al 2017 classified tree species in the hyrcanian forests using quickbird satellite data and primary and secondary topographic variables other studies have also pointed to the importance of elevation and variables derived from dem in tree cover classification dorren et al 2003 ren et al 2009 hościło and lewandowska 2019 altitude changes in mountainous areas can cause changes in ecological variables that control the distribution of plants such as light humidity temperature and absolute humidity abdollah nejad et al 2017 these changes are also able to change the structure of the tree species and their functional trait on the other hand liu et al 2018 and bolyn et al 2018 reported slope as the most important variable in forest type classification the results of our study did not correspond to the study of abdullahnejad et al because in their study most of the study area more than 80 was in the range of 0 to 30 slope but in the present study the slope variation in the study area is very high this study indicated the high efficiency of sentinel 2 data in improving the performance of tree species distribution models in northern iran noteworthy was the high importance of bands 6 and 11 in the classification of four dominant tree species the importance and usefulness of these bands have also been proven in other studies conducted in other parts of the world on broadleaf species bolyn et al 2018 immitzer et al 2019 persson et al 2018 one of the reasons for the high importance of these variables in modeling the distribution of tree species may be due to the usefulness of these bands in providing chlorophyll information gitelson et al 1996 masaitis et al 2013 in other studies the high importance of bands in tree classification has been stated as their high ability to differentiate lai delegido et al 2011 zarco tejada et al 2018 considering all vegetation and soil indices for this study the predictors efficiency and effectiveness still require further investigation examination and negotiation there was no considerable ranking of their significance for the accuracy and performance of any algorithm the lower contribution of the vegetation indices as data that is complementary to sentinel 2 was in agreement with the study by sothe et al 2017 knowing the dynamics of the forests and the distribution of tree species is helpful in management in recent years with the emergence of climatic effects on forests and species distribution the importance of this issue has become very high for this reason the use of tools such as remote sensing can help a lot in this study we showed that in mountainous regions that are very poor in climatic data we could use sentinel 2 data to model the distribution of dominant tree species in hyrcanian forests the results showed the high efficiency of this data which also filled the gap of lack of accurate climatic data however there are limitations to using this data for example using this data for rare species or species with limited distribution may have a high bias another point is the efficiency of this data in areas with very high diversity that may affect modeling accuracy for this reason it is suggested that for future studies additional data of a more ecological nature be used such as microclimate data extracted from remote sensing data the use of radar data can also increase the efficiency of species distribution models and provide valuable information for modeling the distribution of tree species in mountainous areas 5 conclusion this study applied the ensemble machine learning model with the cross validation resampling method for spatial prediction of the four tree species namely c betulus f orientalis p persica and q castaneifolia in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biome of the part of northern iran the sentinel spectral band vegetation indices and topographic data with different partitions were used for the sdms initially the four sdms named gam gbm glm and rf applied with four datasets of the training tree species data the recursive feature elimination rfe or backward selection algorithm has automatically removed the low weight variables of each dataset of the tree species the dataset iv was the best combination with each machine learning model evaluated from the model performance evaluation the ensembles methods with the 16 selective variables have applied to the mentioned spatial tree species prediction models q castaneifolia sdm has well predicted the distribution based on the auc tss and kappa model evaluator analysis the elevation was a relatively important variable for all tree species models during the variable importance the study result and the performance levels of the sdms support the accuracy of remote sensing data for the selection of topographical and vegetation indices based variables the study concerns the forest of northern iran the hyrcanian mountain forest is an unesco world heritage site so the foremost result of predictive tree species distribution maps is essential for planners scientists and the general public to conserve forest biodiversity credit author statement kourosh ahmadi shirin mahmoodi subodh chandra pal conceptualization software writing

to identify how human and environmental factors influence distributions of plants and animals lack of high resolution climatic variables is one of the challenges for accurately predicting distributions of organisms at local or landscape scales this study used sdms to predict four dominant tree species distributions in northern iran temperate forests 400km2 area using high resolution sentinel 2 data 20 m and topographic variables we divided the explanatory variables into four datasets with increasing complexity of sentinel 2 data and modelled distributions using four statistical and machine learning algorithms random forest rf generalized boosting model gbm generalized linear model glm and generalized additive model gam our results suggested differences in the predictive performance of the four algorithms we found the most complex dataset including topographic variables sentinel 2 bands and vegetation and soil indices gave the best fit for the four tree species improving the accuracy of models for the different species between 5 and 16 we then selected the most complex dataset to produce an ensemble model of the modeling algorithms where evaluation criteria were varied for tree species our result showed that the performance of sdms improved using different satellite remote sensing data including raw bands topographic variables and indices in the hyrcanian forest northern iran elevation was a more significant variable than sentinel bands and sentinel vegetation indices variables for predicting the tree species distributions with the hyrcanian forest included in this study region of northern iran recently declared a unesco world heritage site a key result of our improved species distribution maps for these four dominant tree species is to support conservation management of forest biodiversity in this region keywords forest farming forest management remote sensing species distribution models machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global decline in biodiversity is mainly due to land or sea use change direct exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species díaz 2019 about 60 of the species became extinct in the last 50 years and given that about 25 of all species from red list assessed groups are threatened with extinction verdura et al 2019 much of the biodiversity is expected to be lost in the near future the decrease in biodiversity has changed ecosystem functions and services and has negative impacts on human well being cardinale et al 2012 given the growing concern about the loss of biodiversity it is necessary to use sound management and development strategies to reduce further losses and adverse effects on the environment and human society land cover datasets particularly vegetation maps are of primary importance for monitoring vegetation cover geographical distribution and dynamics such datasets provide systematic information which can be used in several fields of applied research baret and buis 2008 international mitigation programs have been used to analyze and observe species distribution spatial patterns schmeller et al 2015 in contemporary science species distribution models sdms have been widely used to identify biodiversity hotspots in general sdms use environmental factors to estimate the species niche and species distribution elith and leathwick 2009 besides sdm has been applied as an important tool in conservation planning and management elith et al 2008 guisan et al 2013 therefore it is essential to understand the tree species distribution for proper conservation and sustainable biodiversity management alavi et al 2019 to do so sufficient knowledge regarding the composition and abundances of tree species distribution is required for effective forest management environmental factors such as soil water temperature incident of solar radiation etc affect the growth distribution and abundance of tree species bourque et al 2000 gustafson et al 2003 if any changes occur among these environmental variables like climate and soil species and landscape ecology composition may change considerably the use of machine learning models in environmental sciences mohammadi 2021 moazenzadeh et al 2022 li et al 2022 mohammadi et al 2022 and especially remote sensing has made great progress in recent years hadadi et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 tian et al 2019 2021 one of the important applications of these models is species distribution models mahmoodi et al 2022 in order to improve the accuracy of sdms a number of methods of have been advocated including ensemble approaches araújo and new 2007 grenouillet et al 2011 this approach often involves several individual model algorithms being fitted in order to generate an ensemble or consensus of predictions these individual models commonly are combined in ensemble models based on weights and or averages of evaluation criteria araújo and new 2007 although some studies suggest ensemble models perform better compared to individual models grenouillet et al 2011 guo et al 2015 kaky et al 2020 others show this is not necessarily the case crimmins et al 2013 zhu and peterson 2017 hao et al 2020 thus it is has been suggested that in addition to individual models the results of ensemble models be considered to reduce model uncertainty hao et al 2020 species distribution models can be implemented at different spatial and temporal scales sdms commonly require species occurrence records and relevant environmental data that 1 km resolution is a very commonly used resolution for sdms at broad spatial scales climatic variables often play a key role in determining the distribution of species but other factors can be more important at finer scales knowledge of factors preventing species from being present at finer scales can often inform conservation programs guisan and theurillat 2000 gustafson et al 2003 li et al 2021 2022 moreover the use of climatic variables in some areas without considering measurement errors and uncertainties can lead to biased results krömer et al 2013 a promising approach to address this issue is the use of remote sensing data where information is acquired about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object for example remote sensing data has been successfully used in ecological studies campos et al 2016 payacán et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 including predicting distributions of tree species cord et al 2013 a study by zimmermann et al 2007 showed that by incorporating predictors derived from remote sensing data significantly improved the accurcy of sdms remote sensing data has also been used in sdms for conservation purposes vila viçosa et al 2020 to identify tree species engler et al 2013 and to classify habitat types agrillo et al 2021 another way to using remote sensing data in sdms is by extracting topographic variables such as altitude and slope at where species are found then incorporating this information in models because topographic variables often have strong associations with climatic factors they can be used to increase the accuracy of the models when climate data is not available a recently developed type of remote sensing data are those from sentinel satellites acquired at high spatial resolution over land and sea the use using sentinel satellite data has allowed large forest areas to be monitored with high spatial accuracy 20 m ahmadi et al 2020b for example hościło and lewandowska 2019 used multi temporal sentinel 2a data to map forest type and tree species in a large mountain area in southern poland immitzer et al 2019 also used sentinel 2 data to map tree species in central europe although many studies have used sentinel 2 data for vegetation mapping and plant science ahmadi et al 2020b waśniewski et al 2020 tian et al 2021 it has not yet been widely used in sdms in this study we use remote sensing data to improve sdms for four dominant tree species in the hyrcanian forest of northern iran an important and valuable ecosystem which is listed as a united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco world heritage site ahmadi et al 2020a our main objective was to investigate improvements of predictive performance in sdms by varying topographic variables namely sentinel bands and vegetation indices sentinel 2a satellite image for four sdms algorithms i e random forests rf generalized additive model gam generalized linear model glm and generalized boosted model gbm finally we used an ensemble of the four sdms to produce habitat suitability maps for the four dominant tree species at the landscape scale in the hyrcanian forests of iran this proposed method also can be used in other small areas less than 500km2 and mountainous forest with high elevational variability 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in a part of hyrcanian forests in northern iran characterized by very high biodiversity the area covers part of forests in noor county mazandaran province with an elevation ranging from sea level to 1700 m and range of hillshade is from 0 to 253 fig 1 the mean precipitation of the region is about 997 mm per year with mean temperatures being about 16 4 c ahmadi et al 2020 2 2 tree species data there are about 80 tree species in the hyrcanian forests with the most important and abundant being fagus orientalis l oriental beech carpinus betulus l hornbeam parrotia persica c a mey persian ironwood and quercus castaneifolia c a mey chestnut leaved oak hornbeam is a native species in the caspian hyrcanian mixed forests ecoregion growing in mixed stands of oak and beech and in some areas with ironwood sagheb talebi et al 2014 hornbeam populations occurring at altitudes up to 1000 m above sea level abdi et al 2009 the oriental beech is economic hardwood species alavi et al 2020 with beech forests accounting for approximately 17 6 of the total forest area in iran s hyrcanian forests ahmadi et al 2015 parrotia persica is one of the native tree species of iran which is located in the northern highlands of the alborz mountains in the hyrcanian forests to the south and the southwest caspian sea distributed in middle and lowland areas up to altitudes from 150 to 1400 m sefidi et al 2011 quercus castaneifolia c a mey can be found in pure and mixed stands covering about 6 5 of hyrcanian forests panahi et al 2011 the main two important forest communities in the hyrcanian forests are querco buxetum in the caspian coastal plains and querco carpinetum in lowland areas up to 700 m panahi et al 2011 in this study we modeled these four tree species in hyrcanian forests with the distribution records used in the sdms from forest inventory data provided by iranian forests range and watershed management organization 2018 the total number of sample plots in the area was 5600 plots each with an area of 1000 m2 to model these four species distribution only plots in which these four species were predominant and more than other species were considered presence points and plots without these species as absence points 2 3 study workflow in the current study several methodological steps were followed out to fulfill the present objectives and the methodological flowchart is presented in fig 2 2 4 remote sensing we used freely available sentinel 2 images level 2a product bottom of atmosphere reflectance tile number t39sxa downloaded from the copernicus open access hub due to many sentinel 2 images in the hyrcanian forests having a high percentage of clouds we selected images that had a low cloud percentage initially 10 spectral bands ranging from visible wavelength 443 nm to short wave infra red 2190 nm were acquired from sentinel 2 data table 1 2 5 environmental variables we also used using elevation data with the spectral bands as this has previously been shown to be effective in forest applications hościło and lewandowska 2019 the elevation data was downloaded from the advanced land observation satellite alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar palsar digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 12 5 m www asf alaska edu 2 6 preprocessing and remote sensing variables preparation the sentinel 2a satellite dataset of two top of atmosphere toa sentinel granules were first pre corrected radiometrically and geometrically at the sentinel hub of the european space agency esa we nest used an atmospheric dataset correction done by sen2cor l2a processor using the sentinel 2 snap toolkit which is hemispherical directional reflectance hdrf schaepman strub et al 2006 the corrected image of level 2a with bottom of atmosphere boa reflectance was for each of the sentinel granules the nearest neighbor method was used to resample the 20 m resolution bands i e 5 6 7 8a 11 and 12 to a 10 m resolution we then stacked the sentinel granules i e all bands namely 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8a 11 and 12 the granules were finally enhanced using two processes 1 elimination of high correlation found in the multispectral sensors dataset using a decorrelation stretch and 2 the minimum noise fraction mnf was used to increase the signal to noise ratio in the multispectral sensors dataset the radiometric geometric and terrain correction of alospalsar dem data was done by the asf mapready program from the geographical institute at the university of alaska fairbanks the radar backscattering coefficients were obtained by converting dn to sigma nought of this dem we applied a 5 5 window size medium filter to minimize this dem data speckle noise 2 7 feature computation extraction and selection 2 7 1 indices and band extraction we used a total of 19 explanatory variables 14 of which were derived from sentinel 2a satellite data and five from alos palsar dem data the 14 satellite based variables were difference vegetation index dvi pettorelli et al 2005 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi malik et al 2019 modified soil adjusted vegetation index msavi qi et al 1994 modified soil adjusted vegetation index 2 msavi2 qi et al 1994 green normalized difference vegetation index gndvi buschmann and nagel 1993 infrared percentage vegetation index ipvi crippen 1990 inverted red edge chlorophyll index ireci guyot and baret 1988 normalized difference index ndi45 delegido et al 2011 pigment specific simple ratio chlorophyll index pssra blackburn 1998 perpendicular vegetation index pvi pal et al 2018 ratio vegetation index rvi major et al 1990 soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 transformed normalized difference vegetation index tndvi senseman et al 1996 weighted difference vegetation index wdvi clevers 1988 table 2 shows the various indices and their respective band math equation the five dem based variables were elevation slope topographic radiation aspect trasp topographic wetness index twi and topographic position index tpi the environmental factors such as elevation and slope represent climatic and edaphic site conditions homeier et al 2010 furthermore these variables broadly influence tree richness and forest structural characteristics in the mountainous region lomolino 2001 thus patterns of tree diversity depend on elevation gradients along with other environmental factors aspect is a topographic feature that influences the flow pattern of rainfall and solar radiation on the slope surface therefore moisture condition and status of vegetation are dependent on the slope aspect it is a measurement of azimuth θ from the true north and measures through topographic radiation aspect trasp roberts and cooper 1989 the topographic wetness index twi is the indirect measure of soil moisture condition and has been considered an index for tree species diversity modeling topographic position index tpi is a method used to measure topographic slope position and landforms classification tpi is calculated as the mean difference between the elevation of a given cell and the elevation of cells located at a particular region around that cell mokarram et al 2015 the following equations were used to calculate trasp twi and tpi indices 1 t r a s p 1 c o s π 180 θ 30 2 2 t w i l o g e a s t a n β where a s is the area of a catchment in m2 and β is the gradient of the slope in radians hong et al 2018 3 t p i m 0 n 1 m n n where m 0 is an elevation of the model point m n is an elevation of the grid and n represent a total numbers of neighbourhood region 2 7 2 feature selection to select features we used a recursive feature elimination rfe which automatically filters the low weight variables and removes them from the model by repetitive modeling process this is an iterative process where features are ranked with the less important being removed the recursive method is essential to measure the relative importance of the features during the elimination process granitto et al 2006 table 3 shows the explanatory variables and their rfe process in four datasets 2 8 species distribution models sdms in the present study we used ensemble o four species distribution models including rf gbm gam and glm breiman first proposed the algorithm of rf in 2001 breiman 2001 this algorithm is a non parametric statistical technique capable of handling a big number of correlated variables in a dataset the function of rf is based on the ensemble of a binary decision tree with a combination of bagging and randomly selected variables l breiman 2001 the bagging approach is a function in which one sample has more priority than the others hastie and tibshirami developed the gam in 1990 hastie and tibshirani 1990 it is a modified version of logistic regression used for multivariate measurement between the dependent and independent variables the gam is efficient in complex non linearity analysis dominici et al 2002 the glm is extensively used in the field of earth observation and forest science in general this model is based on the logit link function of the statistical probability method i e logistic regression pourghasemi and rossi 2017 basically it is the modified function of a simple linear regression model in the ml algorithm methodology boosting has been widely used in several fields of study by many researchers in gbms using a flexible judgmental method the propensity score for the binary treatment can be estimated this model is combined with several regression trees to generate a constant function breiman 1996 the process of gbm estimation is based on multiple regression tree development mccaffrey et al 2004 the gbm process is also carried out by complex and nonlinear relationships among the events variables and non events covariates without overfitting the data friedman 2001 we used the ensemble forecasting methods in the r package biomod2 vs 3 3 7 1 thuiller et al 2016 for sdms validation and predictive accuracy are useful for statistical and ml models output results we also validated the ensemble model for four tree species models using the auc tss and kappa coefficient index analysis guisan et al 2017 3 result 3 1 model performance evaluation the statistical and machine learning approaches with various data splits datasets i to iv were initially used in this study we evaluated the performance of the four datasets dataset i to iv four sdms i e rf gam glm and gbm for the four tree species q castaneifolia p persica c betulus and f orientalis for auc results q castaneifolia had higher predictive capabilities than the other three species with all datasets and all sdms fig 3 the median auc of q castaneifolia ranged from 0 80 to 0 85 with the inter quartile range q3 q1 and the range of minimum and maximum values of auc very low compared to the other tree species the f orientalis had the lowest predictive capability with higher inter quartile and maximum minimum ranges of auc there are no such differences between the auc of the sdms for a tree species distribution model like f orientalis but the sdms are best for the q castaneifolia tree species classification followed by p persica c betulus and f orientalis respectively the results of auc has also shown the predictive capability of the partitioning datasets and the dataset iv was the best suitable variables for each sdms and tree species models fig 3 the median auc of the dataset iv ranged from 0 72 to 0 83 on the other hand dataset i was the worst resampling training data with bad predictive capability in all tree species prediction the tree species distribution model performance was also evaluated by the tss fig 4 the box plot of tss showed the same trend as the auc model evaluator of the sdms and the datasets for the four types of tree species box plot of tss has shown all the four models and four datasets have best predicted tree species of the q castaneifolia the tss model evaluator the dataset iii and iv methods did the best performance in the four models for the four mentioned tree species kappa index or kappa statistics is the most important model evaluator for sdms fig 5 from the four tree species kappa results it is clear that the q castaneifolia tree species models have the best accuracy according to the kappa index the datasets iv is the best method for the sdms in c betulus and the f orientalis tree species on the other side datasets ii and iii are the best methods in the p persica and q castaneifolia tree species from the model evaluator box plots it is clear that the four machine learning models performance is good but when the sdms are performing with the datasets iv it was performed as the best model it has also been observed that the q castaneifolia tree sdm is the robust model in all of them 3 2 evaluation criteria of ensemble sdms after evaluating the four datasets and four sdms we selected the dataset iv and the ensemble of the ml methods to find the most robust sdm table 4 shows the performance of ensemble sdm for the four species where the highest auc tss and kappa depict more robust sdms and conversely low auc tss and kappa index values indicate comparatively low accuracy of sdms the evaluation statistics showed for the four the tree species the sdms predicted the tree species properly by the ensemble approach as per the result the q castaneifolia sdm has the highest auc 0 86 tss 0 59 and kappa index 0 52 after the q castaneifolia the c betulus tree species are the best tree sdms and followed by f orientalis and p persica respectively the standard deviation sd of the model evaluator of each tree sdms indicated the f orientalis species have a good distribution of auc q castaneifolia is the good distribution of tss and the f orientalis species has the best distribution of kappa index 3 3 relative importance of sdms variables we initially investigated the use of 30 explanatory variables where the recursive feature elimination rfe automatically removes the low weight variables finally the sdms selected the 5 10 11 and 16 variables for the dataset i ii iii and iv respectively the dataset iv was chosen for the ensemble sdms in the model performance evaluation of the dataset iv was performed best and dataset iv has the sample variables from the topographic variables sentinel bands and sentinel vegetation indices table 5 shows the relative importance of the variable of dataset iv for the mentioned four species in ensemble sdms for f orientalis elevation is the most important variable followed by b11 slope b6 tpi and ireci the elevation is also the most influential factor of tree species distribution of c betulus followed by b6 ireci b11 ndi45 and slope the best six important factors for q castaneifolia were elevation followed by slope rvi gndvi ireci and b2 for p persica the relative importance of variables were elevation b11 ireci b5 b6 and gndvi the topographic factor elevation was a more significant variable than the sentinel bands and sentinel vegetation indices variables for predicting the distributions of the four tree species 3 4 species distribution maps for four tree species fig 6 shows the potential geographic distribution ensemble species distribution map of four tree species across the study area the probability of tree species distribution maps classified into five probability zones i e very high high moderate low and very low however the predictive areas of very high to high of the c betulus tree species have been predicted mainly in the east part but the distribution is scattered in most of the part of the study area the very low to low spatial constriction corresponds with low elevation areas in this study area the high f orientalis tree species predictive distribution is mainly found in the upper elevated area at the east to the west zone the maximum p persica has been distributed over the middle part of the study area as well as the medium elevated areas it is quite clear from the ensemble of the q castaneifolia distribution map that this tree species is strongly associated with the lower elevations because it has been predicted in the northern part of the study area a comparatively low elevation area the spatial distribution of predictive species distribution maps indicates the consistency of the ensemble sdms for this study area 4 discussion in diverse fields such as ecology biogeography and conservation sdms are increasingly used that relate occurrence records to environmental predictors to model distributions based on statistical and machine learning approaches guisan et al 2013 our study modelled distributions for the four tree species c betulus f orientails p persica and q castaneifolia in the temperate forests of northern iran the study tests the applicability of gam gbm glm rf and ensemble machine learning approaches for predicting the distribution of the tree species in four different datasets dataset i to iv the efficiency of species distribution models were validated through tss auc and the kappa coefficient index we found the model fit of rf had the highest index while gam ranked second the results of variable importance showed that for f orientalis elevation was the most important variable followed by b11 slope b6 tpi and ireci the elevation is also the most influential factor of tree species distribution of c betulus followed by b6 ireci b11 ndi45 and slope the best six important factors of q castaneifolia tree species are elevation followed by slope rvi gndvi ireci and b2 p persica distribution modeling effective causative factors are elevation b11 ireci b5 b6 and gndvi our results demonstrated the ability of sentinel 2a images and topographic variables derived from alos palsar dem to improve species distribution models the application of sdms with ensembles of machine learning methods has become a suitable and robust technique in ecology for the spatial prediction of the plant species liu et al 2018 various previous studies have also demonstrated the new approaches of the ensemble of machine learning methods to deal with the new challenge in species distribution ndlovu et al 2018 to validate the sdms on model performance evaluation the ensemble models performed well compared to the individuals models hao et al 2020 our results based on auc tss and kappa index all suggested differences in different modeling approaches generalization efficiency gam gbm glm and rf the use of remote sensing data to improve the performance of sdms has a long history especially in areas that are poor in environmental data the importance of this use has recently become more prominent due to climate change and forests are among the ecosystems that are most affected by climate change therefore understanding forest dynamics and quantitative methods for assessing climatic effects on species distribution is of great importance this study indicates the high potential of sentinel 2 data for classifying forest trees in mountainous areas in other studies the accuracy of sentinel data in plant classification has been proven bolyn et al 2018 grabska et al 2020 hościło and lewandowska 2019 various data and satellite images have been used in hyrcanian forests to classify species and tree cover in the past ahmadi et al 2020 used machine learning models and sentinel 2 data to model forest characteristics such as basal area stem volume and stem density and showed that sentinel 2 data is highly efficient in mountain forests characteristics mapping soleimannejad et al 2019 used sentinel 2 landsat and irs satellite images to classify tree species in hyrcanian forests their results showed that near ir spectral bands were more important in classifying tree species and sentinel 2 data is very useful in classifying tree species in hyrcanian forests one of the main aims of the present study was to indicate the best combination of remote sensing data to improve the species distribution models of trees in northern iran s hyrcanian forests for this purpose topographic data obtained from alos palsar dem raw bands and vegetation indices of sentinel 2 were divided into four different datasets the results showed the combination of topographic data obtained from alos palsar dem raw bands and vegetation indices of sentinel 2 improved the accuracy of species distribution models for all tree species one useful way to increase the efficiency of species distribution models is to add dem data to the model this study showed that the topographic data derived from alos palsar dem were very useful for modeling all four tree species in a study conducted by vafaei et al 2018 in hyrcanian forests to estimate the forest aboveground biomass the high efficiency of using alos palsar dem has been proven in this study the results showed that elevation and slope were the most important topographic variables that improved the performance of dominant tree species distribution models in the hyrcanian forests of northern iran these two variables have previously been shown to be important variables in tree species distribution models in mountainous areas because they determine the difference in height and the difference in exposure to solar radiation ren et al 2009 although the addition of topographic variables such as elevation and slope in different regions has improved the performance of the species distribution models grabska et al 2020 engler et al 2013 showed that the area is a very important factor and in small areas these variables have less impact on the accuracy of models our results are consistent with a recent study that classified trees in a large area of poland using sentinel 2 data and topographic variables which showed that topographic variables are of great importance in model performance grabska et al 2020 in the study of abdullahnejad et al 2017 conducted in the hyrcanian forests of northern iran elevation was also one of the most important variables affecting tree species distribution models abdollahnejad et al 2017 classified tree species in the hyrcanian forests using quickbird satellite data and primary and secondary topographic variables other studies have also pointed to the importance of elevation and variables derived from dem in tree cover classification dorren et al 2003 ren et al 2009 hościło and lewandowska 2019 altitude changes in mountainous areas can cause changes in ecological variables that control the distribution of plants such as light humidity temperature and absolute humidity abdollah nejad et al 2017 these changes are also able to change the structure of the tree species and their functional trait on the other hand liu et al 2018 and bolyn et al 2018 reported slope as the most important variable in forest type classification the results of our study did not correspond to the study of abdullahnejad et al because in their study most of the study area more than 80 was in the range of 0 to 30 slope but in the present study the slope variation in the study area is very high this study indicated the high efficiency of sentinel 2 data in improving the performance of tree species distribution models in northern iran noteworthy was the high importance of bands 6 and 11 in the classification of four dominant tree species the importance and usefulness of these bands have also been proven in other studies conducted in other parts of the world on broadleaf species bolyn et al 2018 immitzer et al 2019 persson et al 2018 one of the reasons for the high importance of these variables in modeling the distribution of tree species may be due to the usefulness of these bands in providing chlorophyll information gitelson et al 1996 masaitis et al 2013 in other studies the high importance of bands in tree classification has been stated as their high ability to differentiate lai delegido et al 2011 zarco tejada et al 2018 considering all vegetation and soil indices for this study the predictors efficiency and effectiveness still require further investigation examination and negotiation there was no considerable ranking of their significance for the accuracy and performance of any algorithm the lower contribution of the vegetation indices as data that is complementary to sentinel 2 was in agreement with the study by sothe et al 2017 knowing the dynamics of the forests and the distribution of tree species is helpful in management in recent years with the emergence of climatic effects on forests and species distribution the importance of this issue has become very high for this reason the use of tools such as remote sensing can help a lot in this study we showed that in mountainous regions that are very poor in climatic data we could use sentinel 2 data to model the distribution of dominant tree species in hyrcanian forests the results showed the high efficiency of this data which also filled the gap of lack of accurate climatic data however there are limitations to using this data for example using this data for rare species or species with limited distribution may have a high bias another point is the efficiency of this data in areas with very high diversity that may affect modeling accuracy for this reason it is suggested that for future studies additional data of a more ecological nature be used such as microclimate data extracted from remote sensing data the use of radar data can also increase the efficiency of species distribution models and provide valuable information for modeling the distribution of tree species in mountainous areas 5 conclusion this study applied the ensemble machine learning model with the cross validation resampling method for spatial prediction of the four tree species namely c betulus f orientalis p persica and q castaneifolia in the temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biome of the part of northern iran the sentinel spectral band vegetation indices and topographic data with different partitions were used for the sdms initially the four sdms named gam gbm glm and rf applied with four datasets of the training tree species data the recursive feature elimination rfe or backward selection algorithm has automatically removed the low weight variables of each dataset of the tree species the dataset iv was the best combination with each machine learning model evaluated from the model performance evaluation the ensembles methods with the 16 selective variables have applied to the mentioned spatial tree species prediction models q castaneifolia sdm has well predicted the distribution based on the auc tss and kappa model evaluator analysis the elevation was a relatively important variable for all tree species models during the variable importance the study result and the performance levels of the sdms support the accuracy of remote sensing data for the selection of topographical and vegetation indices based variables the study concerns the forest of northern iran the hyrcanian mountain forest is an unesco world heritage site so the foremost result of predictive tree species distribution maps is essential for planners scientists and the general public to conserve forest biodiversity credit author statement kourosh ahmadi shirin mahmoodi subodh chandra pal conceptualization software writing
