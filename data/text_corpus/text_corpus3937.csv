19685,water utilities worldwide spend annually billions of dollars to control sulfide induced corrosion in sewers iron salts chemically oxidize and or precipitate dissolved sulfide in sewage and are especially used in medium and large size sewers iron salt dosing rates are defined ad hoc ignoring variation in sewage flows and sulfide levels this often results in iron overdosing or poor sulfide control online dosing control can adjust the chemical dosing rates to current and future state of the sewer system allowing high precision stable and cost effective sulfide control in this paper we report a novel and robust online control strategy for the dosing of ferrous salt in sewers the control considers the fluctuation of sewage flow ph sulfide levels and also the perturbation from rainfall sulfide production in the pipe is predicted using auto regressive models ar based on current flow measurements which in turn can be used to determine the dose of ferrous salt required for cost effective sulfide control following comprehensive model based assesment the control was successfully validated and its effectiveness demonstrated in a 3 week field trial the online control algorithm controlled sulfide below the target level 0 5 mg s l while reducing chemical dosing up to 30 graphical abstract image 1 keywords chemical dosing corrosion online control sewer systems

pikaar et al 2014 us epa 1992 the dosing of chemicals e g oxygen nitrate iron salt magnesium hydroxide among others is commonly applied to prevent sulfide formation remove it from solution or mitigate its negative effects werf 2007 among these chemicals the use of iron salt is widespread due to their cost effectiveness barjenbruch 2003 bertrán de lis et al 2007 jameel 1989 padival et al 1995 a recent industry survey conducted in australia highlighted the preferential use of iron salt dosing in medium to large sewer systems as its working principle makes it the best suited for sulfide control in such pipes ganigué et al 2011 various metal salts e g ferrous chloride ferric chloride and in some cases ferrous sulfate can react chemically with dissolved sulfide to form relatively insoluble metal sulfides thus decreasing the concentration of dissolved sulfide in sewage and subsequently h2s in sewer gas werf 2007 ferric ions fe3 oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur while being reduced into ferrous ions fe2 fe3 directly precipitate also with oh and phosphate but will eventually be available for sulfide removal zhang et al 2009 subsequently fe2 can combine with sulfide to form highly insoluble metallic precipitates dohnalek and fitzpatrick 1983 fes is the most common iron sulfur precipitate in aqueous solutions although other fe s precipitates such as fe2s2 and fe3s4 can also form rickard and luther 2007 equations 1 4 illustrate the hydrogen sulfide equilibria and the stoichiometries of sulfide oxidation by ferric ions and fes formation by ferrous ions 1 h 2 s h s

3 and 4 however real life fe s dosing ratios differ from those due to the fact that only the ionic sulfide species react directly with fe2 fe3 the formation of fes precipitates requires the presence in solution of both fe2 and s2 at concentrations sufficiently high so that the solubility product defined as fe2 s2 is higher than the solubility constant ksp thus higher ratios need to be applied to reach low total dissolved sulfide tds levels werf 2007 this results also in an increase of the concentration of residual iron in solution as an example in the los angeles sanitation district fecl2 was added to large diameter gravity sewers to control sulfide an fe s molar ratio of 1 76 1 was necessary to reach target tds levels above 0 4 mg s l while ratios of 3 77 1 and 25 4 1 were required to achieve sulfide levels of 0 1 0 4 mg s l and below 0 1 mg s l respectively padival et al 1995 besides the availability of s2 is governed by ph the lower the ph the less s2 in equilibrium in the liquid phase requiring higher fe3 fe2 concentrations to reach the fes supersaturation point ion product higher than the ksp according to firer and co workers sewage ph below neutrality may require fe s ratios much higher than the theoretical stoichiometry firer et al 2008 however this should have limited influence on iron dosing for sulfide control in domestic sewers as sewage ph is mostly in the ph range 7 5 8 5 nielsen et al 1998 houhou et al 2009 sharma et al 2013 sewers are very dynamic systems and sewage flow and characteristics show large variations throughout the day week and year sharma et al 2013 however in current practice iron salt dosing rates are defined ad hoc based on the typical sewage flow pattern of the system and sulfide levels at discharge de haas et al 2008 ganigué et al 2011 as a result generous chemical dosing safety factors need to be applied especially when targeting tight sulfide discharge limits overdosing can be more severe during wet weather conditions when sulfide production declines due to the shorter hydraulic retention time hrt of diluted sewage in the pipe as a consequence of the higher flow rates with the rainwater inflow or infiltration chen et al 2014 ganigué et al 2016 online dosing control can adjust the chemical dosing rates to current and future state of the sewer system allowing high precision stable and effective sulfide control with minimal chemical dosing sharma and yuan 2009 recently ganigué and co workers reported the successful development of the first on line chemical dosing controller for sulfide mitigation in sewers ganigué et al 2016 the algorithm controlled in real time the mg oh 2 dosing rate based on ph measurements and allowed improved sulfide control with reduced chemical consumption the sulfide control mechanism of iron salt relies on the chemical oxidation of sulfide by fe3 and or the precipitation of dissolved sulfide with fe2 into fes dohnalek and fitzpatrick 1983 and is fundamentally different from that of mg oh 2 elevation of the wastewater ph to minimise the fraction of sulfide as h2s to prevent its transfer from the liquid to the gas phase gutierrez et al 2009 therefore it requires a completely different control approach to date there are no studies focusing on the online control of iron salt dosing in sewers besides the real time prediction of sewer flow dynamics and sulfide production are yet to be achieved in the present work these issues are addressed by the development of an online algorithm that is able to predict in real time sewage flows several hours ahead this enables the control system to adjust the iron salt dosing rates based on the predicted hrt and sulfide production the flow predicting algorithm and online controller were tested by in depth simulation analysis and then validated in a full scale trial 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sewer site and trial 2 1 1 the bellambi pumping station and rising main field studies were conducted at bellambi sewage pumping station sps from sydney water corporation sydney australia the rising main which conveys wastewater from the sps to wollongong wastewater treatment plant wwtp has a total length of 9930 m and a pipe diameter ranging from 603 to 750 mm sewage is first collected in a 0 5 ml wet well and subsequently pumped into the main through one of the three primary pumps these are operated based on the water level the sewer system has an average dry weather flow of 21 ml d and an average hydraulic retention time of 4 h a flow meter is located at the inlet of the rising main and flow data is recorded every 15 min the existing fecl2 dosing unit includes a chemical storage tank variable speed drive vsd dosing pumps and a programmable logic controller plc an iron chloride solution 10 29 fecl2 orica chemicals australia is dosed through the vsd pump into the wet well to control tds at the discharge of the bellambi rising main below 0 5 mg s l the dosing rate kg fe2 d at which the fecl2 solution is added is adjusted on an hourly basis based on a pre defined daily profile with 24 set points fig a 1 chemical dosing is automatically turned off when sewage is not pumped into the main 2 1 2 field trials of on line control for ferrous salt dosing the field trial to validate the control algorithm consisted of three sequential periods carried out in the same bellambi pipeline i no chemical dosing 14 days ii fecl2 dosing according to the existing pre defined dosing profile 21 days and iii fecl2 dosing based on the control algorithm developed here 21 days weather was fairly constant throughout the three test periods mean temperatures were 23 1 c 20 6 c and 21 7 c respectively total accumulated rainfall during each period was 20 mm with no rainfall recorded during the validation of the online control the control algorithm which calculated the real time fecl2 dosing rate based on the readings from the sewage flow meter at bellambi sps was implemented by coding the existing plc considering that the ferrous salt is dosed into the wet well and assuming that tds in the wet well is negligible confirmed with data from a sampling campaign over a 24 h period the fecl2 dosing rate is thus dependent only on the sulfide production during the transport of the sewage in the rising main pipe section of 9930 m length the sulfide production rate was assumed uniform along the bellambi rising main it was determined during a period without chemical dosing for different hrts by dividing the sulfide produced by the respective hydraulic retention time the average value was used in both simulations and in the controller the hydraulic retention time of each sewage slug in the rising main pipe can be predicted by the arma model using data from the flowmeter as an input as described in section 3 1 2 after successful factory and site acceptance testings to identify and rectify any potential errors or compatibility issues the control algorithm was then brought into live for the control of the fecl2 dosing pump during the trial the chemical consumption was continuously monitored by recording the dosing rate and the levels of chemical in the storage tanks to estimate the savings the chemical dosing of the real time control was compared to the pre defined dosing profile whereas the effectiveness of sulfide control was assessed by online monitoring of tds levels with a s can unit dcm process control ltd new zealand at the discharge point of the bellambi rising main in addition offline grab samples of sewage were taken weekly for the determination of iron concentration in the wet well of the sps and the influent at the wwtp 2 2 desktop simulation studies 2 2 1 sewex model simulations studies were used to investigate the impact of rain infiltration on sulfate reducing bacteria srb activity see sub section 2 2 2 and to assess the effectiveness of the feedforward controller see sub section 2 2 3 for that the bellambi sps and rising main were modelled using sewex a dynamic mathematical model for the simulation of the physical chemical and biological processes in sewer systems sharma et al 2008 the model predicts the time and spatial variations of the main wastewater quality parameters in the liquid and gas phases by taking into account the biochemical processes carbon sulfur and nitrogen conversions under aerobic anaerobic and anoxic conditions occurring in sewer biofilms and in the bulk liquid chemical processes and equilibria e g sulfide oxidation precipitation reactions and acid base systems and physical processes such as liquid gas mass transfer the ph prediction is achieved based on charge balances sharma et al 2013 as its inputs the model requires the sewer system characteristics e g network layout pipe sizes lengths and slopes wastewater composition and hydraulic data i e measured wastewater flows or details on wet well dimensions pump flows and their operation the bellambi model used in this desktop simulation analysis had been calibrated in a previous study nguyen et al 2009 2 2 2 impact of run off on srb activity during heavy rain the dilution of sewage due to inflow and or infiltration i i result in a dramatic decrease in the concentration of sulfate and readily biodegradable organic matter both of which are substrates of srb to concentrations limiting srb activity thus i i flow should be taken into consideration when determining the iron dosing requirements it is virtually impossible to accurately quantify the impact of increasing levels of run off on srb activity in real sewer systems however mathematical models allow the systematic assessment of such effects this was investigated using the sewex model taking as a starting point a default scenario with constant flow 8 75 ml d long hrt 8 h and constant sewage composition table a 1 multiple scenarios with increasing levels of run off were simulated decreasing hrt and diluting sewage composition accordingly run off characteristics were assumed as in ganigué et al 2016 table a 1 in parallel the same model was used to run simulations at the same hrts by increasing the sewage flow but considering the default sewage composition the reduction in srb activity as a function of the dilution was calculated by comparing the sulfide produced in the run off scenario with that in dry weather conditions and same flow according to equation 5 5 s r b a c t i v i t y t d s r u n o f f t d s d r y w e a t h e r an exponential decay model was fitted to experimental data using sigmaplot 11 systat software germany obtaining the model parameters and standard errors 2 2 3 long term performance of the different tds control strategies the long term performance and benefits of the online control were investigated in a simulation study using the sewex model three different dosing control scenarios were tested including 1 no chemical dosing 2 current profiled dosing used at bellambi sps and 3 online control taking into account srb activity reduction during wet weather a concentration of 0 5 mg tds l at discharge was set as the control target for scenarios 2 and 3 for each scenario the system was simulated for a period of 200 days using real flow data from the sps as input for the sake of simplicity wastewater composition was assumed constant throughout the day except during rain events when sewage composition was diluted by rainwater infiltration run off was quantified by comparing the actual sps flow with the typical dry weather flow profile and sewage characteristics were corrected accordingly assuming the same run off composition as in ganigué et al 2016 table a 1 the performance of the different controls was evaluated based on the average sulfide discharge levels and the amount of fecl2 dosed 3 results and discussion 3 1 developed strategy for ferrous salt dosing control 3 1 1 control architecture iron salts oxidize and or precipitate dissolved sulfide present in sewage the time span of these reactions is in the range of seconds to minutes depending on sewage ph buffering capacity or organic matter content wei and osseo asare 1995 kiilerich et al 2017 thus sulfide control in sewers could be achieved by dosing iron salt at any locations before the discharge point for practical reasons dosing of iron salt is usually conducted in sewage pumping stations allowing to control sulfide along the entire pipe while in the absence of sulfide iron salts may initially react with some other anions e g phosphate and or hydroxide iron ions will be made available for sulfide precipitation when the latter is produced due to the lower solubility of fes in comparison to iron phosphate and iron hydroxide precipitates zhang et al 2009 a recent lab scale study also demonstrated that the addition of fe3 significantly inhibited srb activity of anaerobic sewer biofilms zhang et al 2009 an additional benefit of upstream dosing could be the reduction of sulfide production rate by sewer biofilms further decreasing the iron dosing requirement however controlling iron dosing in upstream locations becomes complex and challenging due to the plug flow nature of a sewer line as the control objective is typically to keep the tds below a certain discharge limit predictive control is needed so that the amount of iron added is adequate for precipitating sulfide while avoiding chemical overdosing assuming an ideal fe s ratio eqs 3 and 4 iron dosing requirements in mg fe l sewage will depend mainly on the amount of sulfide to be removed this can be calculated based on the tds target set point and the concentration of tds at the end of the pipe which encompasses the sulfide already present in sewage at the dosing location and the sulfide that will be produced during the transport of the sewage from the dosing point to end of the pipe the former can be determined using an online uv vis spectrometer probe and a ph sensor located just before the dosing point sutherland stacey et al 2008 however the increase in concentration due to the future production of sulfide during transport cannot be measured due to the plug flow nature of sewers and needs to be predicted under non limiting substrate conditions there is a linear relationship between the hrt of the sewage in the pipe and the amount of sulfide produced sharma et al 2008 therefore sulfide production along a pipe can be predicted if hrt is known yet the time a wastewater slug will spend in the pipe is unknown as it is governed by future wastewater flow that pushes the slug through the pipe the hrt of a slug can however be estimated using predictive mathematical tools for instance auto regressive moving average arma models chen et al 2014 the proposed control algorithm for the optimised dosing of fe2 fe3 salts comprises two components fig 1 a first feed forward ff controller predicts the future hrt of a wastewater slug entering the pipe based on current flow measurements using arma models and calculates the concentration of tds at the discharge point based on the tds concentration at the dosing point and the sulfide production during transport the ferrous salt dosing rate is set based on these tds concentrations and the sewage flow given the plug flow nature of sewer systems the dosing station relies on the feedforward controller to determine the dosing rate based on the measurement of perturbations in this case sulfide produced during the transport based on hrt in the pipe this model assumes non limiting substrate conditions see table a 2 for further information on sulfate concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the rising main the controller equation used in the ff loop is 6 q f e f f q s e w λ β γ h r t δ where qfe ff is the iron salt solution dosing rate into the wet well kg d qsew is the sewage flow into the rising main l d λ the srb activity factor see section 3 1 3 for further details β the sulfide production rate mg s tds l h γ the fes precipitation stoichiometry based on eq 4 mg fe mg s tds and δ the fe2 or fe3 content of the iron salt solution dosed into the wet well although effective and efficient feedforward controllers are subject to a certain degree of uncertainty due to for example modelling errors and or unknown disturbances stephanopoulos 1984 to prevent this an additional feedback fb loop can be included to correct control errors in this case a fb loop can adjust the dosing of the ff controller based on the overall long term performance of the control which can be calculated by a weighted weekly average of the total dissolved sulfide concentration at the discharge point this strategy has already been proven to allow the fine tuning of chemical dosing in sewers ganigué et al 2016 the combined ff and fb controller proposed here is 7 qfe ff fb qfe ff kfb tdssp tdsave qfe ff fb is the iron salt solution dosing rate into the wet well kg d kfb the feedback constant of the feedback loop kg d ph unit tdssp the tds control set point at the discharge point and tdsave the average tds calculated based on equation 8 8 t d s a v e n α t d s n 1 α t d s a v e n 1 where tdsave n is the weighted average tds at the present time tdsave n 1 is the weighted average tds at the previous sampling time tdsn is the measured tds at the present time and α is a weighting factor 0 α 1 to be tuned the weighting factor α is important since it determines whether the feedback signal relies more on the recent tds measurements or historical data 3 1 2 ar model development for hrt prediction calibration and validation during rain events rainwater can enter sewer systems due to i i increasing the sewage flow but also diluting the sewage an arma model for the prediction of future sewage flow into bellambi sps was developed following the methodology proposed by chen et al 2014 an iterative methodology similar to that described by sharma et al 2008 was applied to determine the hrt of a slug entering the rising main the algorithm predicts the flow incoming into the sewer at different time horizons until the cumulative volume pumped into the system is higher than the total volume of the sewer pipe at this time interval the slug has theoretically reached the end of the pipe and the total time required for that is defined as the future hrt of that slug in the pipe a resolution of 15 min was deemed sufficiently accurate for control purposes and yet not too computationally cumbersome an ar model was calibrated and validated based on more than a year of historical flow data from the bellambi main flowmeter following the methodology described in chen et al 2014 for this case a model order of three was found adequate with the following structure and parameter values 9 x t 0 5961 x t 1 0 2791 x t 2 0 1126 x t 3 v t results of 1 h 3 h and 6 h ahead predictions for dry weather and wet weather conditions are presented in fig 2 the bellambi ar model was able to predict the daily flow dynamics during dry weather conditions even when targeting the prediction of the future flow 6 h ahead the ar model also showed very good predictive performance in wet weather conditions although a slight delay in the prediction can be observed especially for longer prediction time horizons however long term predictions are rarely needed for chemical dosing control during wet weather periods due to the increased flow and reduced hrts these results demonstrate the good prediction capabilities of the ar model 3 1 3 srb activity correction due to sewage dilution the decrease of srb activity due to substrate limitation as a result of sewage dilution by stormwater runoff was investigated in a simulation study fig 3 depicts the reduction of srb activity as a function of the dilution factor ratio between actual flow and dry weather flow srb activity was only significantly reduced at dilution factors higher than 3 and the decrease in activity was non linear this behaviours was modelled using an exponential decay model this empiric expression allowed to describe the reduction of srb activity as a function of the sewage diluton factor in the pipe 3 2 desktop assessment of the on line control algorithm performance in order to test the control algorithm and assess its long term performance under different weather conditions simulations were conducted using the calibrated model of bellambi sps the online control was implemented in the model and simulated for 200 days for comparison simulations were also run for two other scenarios one with no addition of ferrous salt and a second one in which fecl2 was dosed according to a pre defined profile current dosing strategy at bellambi fig 4 depicts the tds concentration at discharge and table 1 summarizes the average tds at discharge and the average fe2 daily dosage for each scenario when no iron was dosed to the system tds levels at discharge ranged from 2 to 4 5 mg s l depending on the hrt of the sewage exception to that were the wet weather periods when sulfide concentration decreased to about 0 5 1 mg s l due to the shorter hrts and run off infiltration during the whole 200 day period both profiled dosing and online control were able to bring the tds concentration at discharge very close to the control goal 0 5 mg s l the average tds at discharge of the profiled and online control were 0 11 mg s l and 0 24 mg s l respectively the online control however allowed to reduce the chemical dosage by about 31 4 203 6 kg fe2 d vs 139 7 kg fe2 d while still meeting the tds discharge limits to gain a deeper insights on why the online control outperformed the profiled dosing the tds and dosing rates for the scenarios under dry weather and wet weather conditions are presented in fig 5 fig 5 c shows that under dry weather conditions both controls behaved in a comparable manner by controlling sulfide below the target concentration of 0 5 mg s l dosing levels calculated during the period 10 20 days were 175 6 kg fe2 d and 152 5 kg fe2 d respectively the online control adjusted the fe2 dosing rate to the sulfide production and allowed to reduce chemical dosing due to a lower dosing rate during early morning see fig a 2 for further details during wet weather conditions the infiltration of rainwater significantly reduced the amount of sulfide produced within the pipe e g days 141 145 the superior performance of the feed forward online control was accentuated under those conditions because it was capable of predicting the decrease in sulfide production and adjusting the iron dose reducing the overall chemical dosing fig 5f without significantly affecting sulfide control fig 5d the average dosing rate during the period 138 148 days was respectively 206 4 vs 158 0 kg fe2 d it is important to note that the change in sewage flow during transition from dry to wet weather and vice versa fig 5b led to a transient overdosage or underdosage respectively this can be clearly seen for the latter case in fig 5d day 145 the tds concentration spiked up to 1 44 mg s l because the fe2 dosing rate was not adjusted until this change in the flow regime was detected by the ar model 3 3 validation of the control in field trials the online control algorithm was tested at bellambi sps for a period of 3 weeks fig 6 depicts the concentration of total dissolved sulfide and sewage ph at the discharge of the bellambi rising main for three different dosing regimen no chemical dosing pre defined profiled dosing and online dosing control for a period of 2 days the average sulfide concentration and ferrous chloride dosing during the whole trial are summarized in table 2 and compared to the other two dosing regimen results show that when no ferrous chloride was dosed sulfide levels at discharge of the rising main would be around 1 65 mg s l ranging between 1 and 5 mg s l depending of the time of the day due to variations on sewage hrt average tds levels at discharge were decreased to 0 13 0 20 mg s l and 0 23 0 19 mg s l upon dosing of ferrous chloride based on a pre defined dosing profile or online control respectively the tds 90 percentile of both control strategies were also very similar 0 46 and 0 54 mg s l respectively however ferrous chloride dosage was on average 30 5 lower for the same level of sulfide control it is thus clear that the online control achieved comparable control of sulfide as the existing profiled dosing but with reduced chemical dosing this equals to an annual saving of about 100 000 l of fecl2 by comparing the dosing rate throughout the day for the profiled and online dosing strategies fig 7 the dosing rate of the profiled control was consistently higher than that of the online control especially during morning periods in accordance with the findings of the long term simulation study this extra dose of fecl2 resulted in an increase of the chemical use of 30 5 but did not translate in a significantly better sulfide control overall the improved dosing profile using online ar model achieved sulfide control with lower iron dosage it is important to highlight that no rain was registered during the trial and hence the superior performance of the online control can only be ensured in dry weather conditions 3 4 implications and future work this work presents the development and validation in a field test of an online algorithm for the control of ferrous salt dosing for sulfide mitigation in sewers the control relies on online measurements from affordable and robust online sensors and can be applied to already existing or new dosing station with minimum investment and potentially significant reduction in chemical dosing this is of special importance for iron salt as these are commonly used in large systems with relatively high daily flows ganigué et al 2011 in such systems the fine control of the dosing rates based on the real time state of the system can lead to significant savings in chemical usage and improved sulfide control this control was validated for the dosing of ferrous chloride through simulations and a field trial but can be easily implemented to control the dosing of ferric salts by adjusting the stoichiometry the methodology developed in this study is however not only constrained to iron salt oxygen injection and the addition of nitrate salts are also widely used methods for sulfide mitigation in sewers gutierrez et al 2008 jiang et al 2009 both oxygen and nitrate are oxidant of sulfide through biological and or chemical processes although these reactions proceed at a much slower rate than the removal of sulfide by precipitation with iron salt e g 30 60 min vs few seconds gutierrez et al 2008 auguet et al 2015 wei and osseo asare 1995 although the working principle of these chemicals is different from ferrous salts the present algorithm could be also applied with some modifications i e mainly the reaction stoichiometry to control in real time the dosing of oxygen or nitrate to sewers for improved control efficiency and chemical savings it is important to highlight that both oxygen and nitrate can be used as electron acceptors by facultative anaerobes in this respect dosing the chemicals close to the control point should be preferred to minimise their consumption due to side reactions making controller tuning easier dosing locations downstream of the pipe may allow also to measure the concentration of sulfide to be oxidized rather than predicting it also the use of real time hrt prediction can be of importance in mg oh 2 online control the reduction in chemical dosing achieved in this study is of a much higher magnitude than that achieved in ganigué et al 2016 for mg oh 2 only 10 15 chemical saving in respect to the existing profiled control this may be due to differences in the performance of the default controls with which the online controls were compared against but partly also to the improvement derived from the real time hrt prediction by the arma model further work in this area should aim at refining flow prediction during the early stage of a wet weather event or when rain stops to minimise over and under dosage delays or biases in the prediction under those conditions could be minimised by using autoregressive moving average with exogenous terms armax models ljung 1999 this would allow taking into consideration external information related to weather changes e g rainfall radar data or data from online weather stations into the flow prediction this approach has already been successfully applied to the prediction of traffic flow based on vehicle detection salehinia et al 2016 or air pollution based on solar irradiation wind speed and direction raimondi et al 1997 among others in the present work the influence of sewage ph on iron salt stoichiometry has been assumed to be negligible because sewage ph is usually above neutrality nielsen et al 1998 houhou et al 2009 sharma et al 2013 however this may only be true for sewers conveying purely domestic sewage certain sewer systems may receive the discharge of trade waste or industrial wastewater that can lead to more acidic ph conditions for instance sudarjanto et al observed a decrease in the ph of lab scale sewer systems from ph 7 to 6 when receiving the discharge of brewery wastewater sudarjanto et al 2011 in such conditions the fe s stoichiometry will need to be adjusted based on sewage ph in a similar way in this study we have controlled sulfide at discharge below 0 5 mg s l based on current practice of the water industry in australia however water utilities may decide to target more stringent sulfide levels which could affect the fe s ratios required to attain such sulfide concentrations at discharge thus this should be taken also into consideration when calculating the dose of iron salt last but not least this study did not consider the fact that rain and storm events may have a direct impact on the sulfide producing capacity of sewers by detaching part of the sewer biofilm or removing sewer sediments to date there is little knowledge on these phenomena but further research should elucidate whether or not they can lead to a significant decrease in sewer sulfide production and its duration finally corrosion control in sewers can be also targeted at a network level as recently shown by liu and co workers liu et al 2013 2016 magnesium hydroxide and iron salt are conserved chemicals and thus a single dosing point may allow the control of sulfide corrosion at multiple locations of the network this approach will result in fewer dosing stations decreasing the capital expenditure for sulfide control on the contrary control complexity will multiply as the size of the network grows network wide corrosion control is not incompatible but rather complementary to the online control of chemical dosing in single pipes if the number of corrosion and odour hot spots is limited and or these are geographically isolated dosing control should be preferably carried out at a single pipe level on the contrary if sulfide issues are widely distributed within a network and the hot spots are concentrated in a small area it would be more cost effective to address sulfide control on a network basis in this light the choice of strategy should be based on a preliminary analysis of the network and the needs for sulfide control 4 conclusions a novel and robust online dosing control strategy was established for ferrous salt delivering improved sulfide control in sewers and a reduction of chemical dosing the control considers the fluctuation of sewage flow ph sulfide levels and also the perturbation from rainfall arma models can predict sulfide production in sewers based on current flow measurements which in turn can be used to determine the dose of ferrous salt required for cost effective sulfide control the control strategy was evaluated using both a state of the art sewer model and in a real sewer site it achieved high level of sulfide control at 0 5 mg s l while reducing chemical dosing up to 30 the control strategy proposed here can be adopted or modified for the dosing control of other commonly used chemicals in sewers acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the australian research council and many members of the australian

insoluble metal sulfides thus decreasing the concentration of dissolved sulfide in sewage and subsequently h2s in sewer gas werf 2007 ferric ions fe3 oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur while being reduced into ferrous ions fe2 fe3 directly precipitate also with oh and phosphate but will eventually be available for sulfide removal zhang et al 2009 subsequently fe2 can combine with sulfide to form highly insoluble metallic precipitates dohnalek and fitzpatrick 1983 fes is the most common iron sulfur precipitate in aqueous solutions although other fe s precipitates such as fe2s2 and fe3s4 can also form rickard and luther 2007 equations 1 4 illustrate the hydrogen sulfide equilibria and the stoichiometries of sulfide oxidation by ferric ions and fes formation by ferrous ions 1 h 2 s h s

3 and 4 however real life fe s dosing ratios differ from those due to the fact that only the ionic sulfide species react directly with fe2 fe3 the formation of fes precipitates requires the presence in solution of both fe2 and s2 at concentrations sufficiently high so that the solubility product defined as fe2 s2 is higher than the solubility constant ksp thus higher ratios need to be applied to reach low total dissolved sulfide tds levels werf 2007 this results also in an increase of the concentration of residual iron in solution as an example in the los angeles sanitation district fecl2 was added to large diameter gravity sewers to control sulfide an fe s molar ratio of 1 76 1 was necessary to reach target tds levels above 0 4 mg s l while ratios of 3 77 1 and 25 4 1 were required to achieve sulfide levels of 0 1 0 4 mg s l and below 0 1 mg s l respectively padival et al 1995 besides the availability of s2 is governed by ph the lower the ph the less s2 in equilibrium in the liquid phase requiring higher fe3 fe2 concentrations to reach the fes supersaturation point ion product higher than the ksp according to firer and co workers sewage ph below neutrality may require fe s ratios much higher than the theoretical stoichiometry firer et al 2008 however this should have limited influence on iron dosing for sulfide control in domestic sewers as sewage ph is mostly in the ph range 7 5 8 5 nielsen et al 1998 houhou et al 2009 sharma et al 2013 sewers are very dynamic systems and sewage flow and characteristics show large variations throughout the day week and year sharma et al 2013 however in current practice iron salt dosing rates are defined ad hoc based on the typical sewage flow pattern of the system and sulfide levels at discharge de haas et al 2008 ganigué et al 2011 as a result generous chemical dosing safety factors need to be applied especially when targeting tight sulfide discharge limits overdosing can be more severe during wet weather conditions when sulfide production declines due to the shorter hydraulic retention time hrt of diluted sewage in the pipe as a consequence of the higher flow rates with the rainwater inflow or infiltration chen et al 2014 ganigué et al 2016 online dosing control can adjust the chemical dosing rates to current and future state of the sewer system allowing high precision stable and effective sulfide control with minimal chemical dosing sharma and yuan 2009 recently ganigué and co workers reported the successful development of the first on line chemical dosing controller for sulfide mitigation in sewers ganigué et al 2016 the algorithm controlled in real time the mg oh 2 dosing rate based on ph measurements and allowed improved sulfide control with reduced chemical consumption the sulfide control mechanism of iron salt relies on the chemical oxidation of sulfide by fe3 and or the precipitation of dissolved sulfide with fe2 into fes dohnalek and fitzpatrick 1983 and is fundamentally different from that of mg oh 2 elevation of the wastewater ph to minimise the fraction of sulfide as h2s to prevent its transfer from the liquid to the gas phase gutierrez et al 2009 therefore it requires a completely different control approach to date there are no studies focusing on the online control of iron salt dosing in sewers besides the real time prediction of sewer flow dynamics and sulfide production are yet to be achieved in the present work these issues are addressed by the development of an online algorithm that is able to predict in real time sewage flows several hours ahead this enables the control system to adjust the iron salt dosing rates based on the predicted hrt and sulfide production the flow predicting algorithm and online controller were tested by in depth simulation analysis and then validated in a full scale trial 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sewer site and trial 2 1 1 the bellambi pumping station and rising main field studies were conducted at bellambi sewage pumping station sps from sydney water corporation sydney australia the rising main which conveys wastewater from the sps to wollongong wastewater treatment plant wwtp has a total length of 9930 m and a pipe diameter ranging from 603 to 750 mm sewage is first collected in a 0 5 ml wet well and subsequently pumped into the main through one of the three primary pumps these are operated based on the water level the sewer system has an average dry weather flow of 21 ml d and an average hydraulic retention time of 4 h a flow meter is located at the inlet of the rising main and flow data is recorded every 15 min the existing fecl2 dosing unit includes a chemical storage tank variable speed drive vsd dosing pumps and a programmable logic controller plc an iron chloride solution 10 29 fecl2 orica chemicals australia is dosed through the vsd pump into the wet well to control tds at the discharge of the bellambi rising main below 0 5 mg s l the dosing rate kg fe2 d at which the fecl2 solution is added is adjusted on an hourly basis based on a pre defined daily profile with 24 set points fig a 1 chemical dosing is automatically turned off when sewage is not pumped into the main 2 1 2 field trials of on line control for ferrous salt dosing the field trial to validate the control algorithm consisted of three sequential periods carried out in the same bellambi pipeline i no chemical dosing 14 days ii fecl2 dosing according to the existing pre defined dosing profile 21 days and iii fecl2 dosing based on the control algorithm developed here 21 days weather was fairly constant throughout the three test periods mean temperatures were 23 1 c 20 6 c and 21 7 c respectively total accumulated rainfall during each period was 20 mm with no rainfall recorded during the validation of the online control the control algorithm which calculated the real time fecl2 dosing rate based on the readings from the sewage flow meter at bellambi sps was implemented by coding the existing plc considering that the ferrous salt is dosed into the wet well and assuming that tds in the wet well is negligible confirmed with data from a sampling campaign over a 24 h period the fecl2 dosing rate is thus dependent only on the sulfide production during the transport of the sewage in the rising main pipe section of 9930 m length the sulfide production rate was assumed uniform along the bellambi rising main it was determined during a period without chemical dosing for different hrts by dividing the sulfide produced by the respective hydraulic retention time the average value was used in both simulations and in the controller the hydraulic retention time of each sewage slug in the rising main pipe can be predicted by the arma model using data from the flowmeter as an input as described in section 3 1 2 after successful factory and site acceptance testings to identify and rectify any potential errors or compatibility issues the control algorithm was then brought into live for the control of the fecl2 dosing pump during the trial the chemical consumption was continuously monitored by recording the dosing rate and the levels of chemical in the storage tanks to estimate the savings the chemical dosing of the real time control was compared to the pre defined dosing profile whereas the effectiveness of sulfide control was assessed by online monitoring of tds levels with a s can unit dcm process control ltd new zealand at the discharge point of the bellambi rising main in addition offline grab samples of sewage were taken weekly for the determination of iron concentration in the wet well of the sps and the influent at the wwtp 2 2 desktop simulation studies 2 2 1 sewex model simulations studies were used to investigate the impact of rain infiltration on sulfate reducing bacteria srb activity see sub section 2 2 2 and to assess the effectiveness of the feedforward controller see sub section 2 2 3 for that the bellambi sps and rising main were modelled using sewex a dynamic mathematical model for the simulation of the physical chemical and biological processes in sewer systems sharma et al 2008 the model predicts the time and spatial variations of the main wastewater quality parameters in the liquid and gas phases by taking into account the biochemical processes carbon sulfur and nitrogen conversions under aerobic anaerobic and anoxic conditions occurring in sewer biofilms and in the bulk liquid chemical processes and equilibria e g sulfide oxidation precipitation reactions and acid base systems and physical processes such as liquid gas mass transfer the ph prediction is achieved based on charge balances sharma et al 2013 as its inputs the model requires the sewer system characteristics e g network layout pipe sizes lengths and slopes wastewater composition and hydraulic data i e measured wastewater flows or details on wet well dimensions pump flows and their operation the bellambi model used in this desktop simulation analysis had been calibrated in a previous study nguyen et al 2009 2 2 2 impact of run off on srb activity during heavy rain the dilution of sewage due to inflow and or infiltration i i result in a dramatic decrease in the concentration of sulfate and readily biodegradable organic matter both of which are substrates of srb to concentrations limiting srb activity thus i i flow should be taken into consideration when determining the iron dosing requirements it is virtually impossible to accurately quantify the impact of increasing levels of run off on srb activity in real sewer systems however mathematical models allow the systematic assessment of such effects this was investigated using the sewex model taking as a starting point a default scenario with constant flow 8 75 ml d long hrt 8 h and constant sewage composition table a 1 multiple scenarios with increasing levels of run off were simulated decreasing hrt and diluting sewage composition accordingly run off characteristics were assumed as in ganigué et al 2016 table a 1 in parallel the same model was used to run simulations at the same hrts by increasing the sewage flow but considering the default sewage composition the reduction in srb activity as a function of the dilution was calculated by comparing the sulfide produced in the run off scenario with that in dry weather conditions and same flow according to equation 5 5 s r b a c t i v i t y t d s r u n o f f t d s d r y w e a t h e r an exponential decay model was fitted to experimental data using sigmaplot 11 systat software germany obtaining the model parameters and standard errors 2 2 3 long term performance of the different tds control strategies the long term performance and benefits of the online control were investigated in a simulation study using the sewex model three different dosing control scenarios were tested including 1 no chemical dosing 2 current profiled dosing used at bellambi sps and 3 online control taking into account srb activity reduction during wet weather a concentration of 0 5 mg tds l at discharge was set as the control target for scenarios 2 and 3 for each scenario the system was simulated for a period of 200 days using real flow data from the sps as input for the sake of simplicity wastewater composition was assumed constant throughout the day except during rain events when sewage composition was diluted by rainwater infiltration run off was quantified by comparing the actual sps flow with the typical dry weather flow profile and sewage characteristics were corrected accordingly assuming the same run off composition as in ganigué et al 2016 table a 1 the performance of the different controls was evaluated based on the average sulfide discharge levels and the amount of fecl2 dosed 3 results and discussion 3 1 developed strategy for ferrous salt dosing control 3 1 1 control architecture iron salts oxidize and or precipitate dissolved sulfide present in sewage the time span of these reactions is in the range of seconds to minutes depending on sewage ph buffering capacity or organic matter content wei and osseo asare 1995 kiilerich et al 2017 thus sulfide control in sewers could be achieved by dosing iron salt at any locations before the discharge point for practical reasons dosing of iron salt is usually conducted in sewage pumping stations allowing to control sulfide along the entire pipe while in the absence of sulfide iron salts may initially react with some other anions e g phosphate and or hydroxide iron ions will be made available for sulfide precipitation when the latter is produced due to the lower solubility of fes in comparison to iron phosphate and iron hydroxide precipitates zhang et al 2009 a recent lab scale study also demonstrated that the addition of fe3 significantly inhibited srb activity of anaerobic sewer biofilms zhang et al 2009 an additional benefit of upstream dosing could be the reduction of sulfide production rate by sewer biofilms further decreasing the iron dosing requirement however controlling iron dosing in upstream locations becomes complex and challenging due to the plug flow nature of a sewer line as the control objective is typically to keep the tds below a certain discharge limit predictive control is needed so that the amount of iron added is adequate for precipitating sulfide while avoiding chemical overdosing assuming an ideal fe s ratio eqs 3 and 4 iron dosing requirements in mg fe l sewage will depend mainly on the amount of sulfide to be removed this can be calculated based on the tds target set point and the concentration of tds at the end of the pipe which encompasses the sulfide already present in sewage at the dosing location and the sulfide that will be produced during the transport of the sewage from the dosing point to end of the pipe the former can be determined using an online uv vis spectrometer probe and a ph sensor located just before the dosing point sutherland stacey et al 2008 however the increase in concentration due to the future production of sulfide during transport cannot be measured due to the plug flow nature of sewers and needs to be predicted under non limiting substrate conditions there is a linear relationship between the hrt of the sewage in the pipe and the amount of sulfide produced sharma et al 2008 therefore sulfide production along a pipe can be predicted if hrt is known yet the time a wastewater slug will spend in the pipe is unknown as it is governed by future wastewater flow that pushes the slug through the pipe the hrt of a slug can however be estimated using predictive mathematical tools for instance auto regressive moving average arma models chen et al 2014 the proposed control algorithm for the optimised dosing of fe2 fe3 salts comprises two components fig 1 a first feed forward ff controller predicts the future hrt of a wastewater slug entering the pipe based on current flow measurements using arma models and calculates the concentration of tds at the discharge point based on the tds concentration at the dosing point and the sulfide production during transport the ferrous salt dosing rate is set based on these tds concentrations and the sewage flow given the plug flow nature of sewer systems the dosing station relies on the feedforward controller to determine the dosing rate based on the measurement of perturbations in this case sulfide produced during the transport based on hrt in the pipe this model assumes non limiting substrate conditions see table a 2 for further information on sulfate concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the rising main the controller equation used in the ff loop is 6 q f e f f q s e w λ β γ h r t δ where qfe ff is the iron salt solution dosing rate into the wet well kg d qsew is the sewage flow into the rising main l d λ the srb activity factor see section 3 1 3 for further details β the sulfide production rate mg s tds l h γ the fes precipitation stoichiometry based on eq 4 mg fe mg s tds and δ the fe2 or fe3 content of the iron salt solution dosed into the wet well although effective and efficient feedforward controllers are subject to a certain degree of uncertainty due to for example modelling errors and or unknown disturbances stephanopoulos 1984 to prevent this an additional feedback fb loop can be included to correct control errors in this case a fb loop can adjust the dosing of the ff controller based on the overall long term performance of the control which can be calculated by a weighted weekly average of the total dissolved sulfide concentration at the discharge point this strategy has already been proven to allow the fine tuning of chemical dosing in sewers ganigué et al 2016 the combined ff and fb controller proposed here is 7 qfe ff fb qfe ff kfb tdssp tdsave qfe ff fb is the iron salt solution dosing rate into the wet well kg d kfb the feedback constant of the feedback loop kg d ph unit tdssp the tds control set point at the discharge point and tdsave the average tds calculated based on equation 8 8 t d s a v e n α t d s n 1 α t d s a v e n 1 where tdsave n is the weighted average tds at the present time tdsave n 1 is the weighted average tds at the previous sampling time tdsn is the measured tds at the present time and α is a weighting factor 0 α 1 to be tuned the weighting factor α is important since it determines whether the feedback signal relies more on the recent tds measurements or historical data 3 1 2 ar model development for hrt prediction calibration and validation during rain events rainwater can enter sewer systems due to i i increasing the sewage flow but also diluting the sewage an arma model for the prediction of future sewage flow into bellambi sps was developed following the methodology proposed by chen et al 2014 an iterative methodology similar to that described by sharma et al 2008 was applied to determine the hrt of a slug entering the rising main the algorithm predicts the flow incoming into the sewer at different time horizons until the cumulative volume pumped into the system is higher than the total volume of the sewer pipe at this time interval the slug has theoretically reached the end of the pipe and the total time required for that is defined as the future hrt of that slug in the pipe a resolution of 15 min was deemed sufficiently accurate for control purposes and yet not too computationally cumbersome an ar model was calibrated and validated based on more than a year of historical flow data from the bellambi main flowmeter following the methodology described in chen et al 2014 for this case a model order of three was found adequate with the following structure and parameter values 9 x t 0 5961 x t 1 0 2791 x t 2 0 1126 x t 3 v t results of 1 h 3 h and 6 h ahead predictions for dry weather and wet weather conditions are presented in fig 2 the bellambi ar model was able to predict the daily flow dynamics during dry weather conditions even when targeting the prediction of the future flow 6 h ahead the ar model also showed very good predictive performance in wet weather conditions although a slight delay in the prediction can be observed especially for longer prediction time horizons however long term predictions are rarely needed for chemical dosing control during wet weather periods due to the increased flow and reduced hrts these results demonstrate the good prediction capabilities of the ar model 3 1 3 srb activity correction due to sewage dilution the decrease of srb activity due to substrate limitation as a result of sewage dilution by stormwater runoff was investigated in a simulation study fig 3 depicts the reduction of srb activity as a function of the dilution factor ratio between actual flow and dry weather flow srb activity was only significantly reduced at dilution factors higher than 3 and the decrease in activity was non linear this behaviours was modelled using an exponential decay model this empiric expression allowed to describe the reduction of srb activity as a function of the sewage diluton factor in the pipe 3 2 desktop assessment of the on line control algorithm performance in order to test the control algorithm and assess its long term performance under different weather conditions simulations were conducted using the calibrated model of bellambi sps the online control was implemented in the model and simulated for 200 days for comparison simulations were also run for two other scenarios one with no addition of ferrous salt and a second one in which fecl2 was dosed according to a pre defined profile current dosing strategy at bellambi fig 4 depicts the tds concentration at discharge and table 1 summarizes the average tds at discharge and the average fe2 daily dosage for each scenario when no iron was dosed to the system tds levels at discharge ranged from 2 to 4 5 mg s l depending on the hrt of the sewage exception to that were the wet weather periods when sulfide concentration decreased to about 0 5 1 mg s l due to the shorter hrts and run off infiltration during the whole 200 day period both profiled dosing and online control were able to bring the tds concentration at discharge very close to the control goal 0 5 mg s l the average tds at discharge of the profiled and online control were 0 11 mg s l and 0 24 mg s l respectively the online control however allowed to reduce the chemical dosage by about 31 4 203 6 kg fe2 d vs 139 7 kg fe2 d while still meeting the tds discharge limits to gain a deeper insights on why the online control outperformed the profiled dosing the tds and dosing rates for the scenarios under dry weather and wet weather conditions are presented in fig 5 fig 5 c shows that under dry weather conditions both controls behaved in a comparable manner by controlling sulfide below the target concentration of 0 5 mg s l dosing levels calculated during the period 10 20 days were 175 6 kg fe2 d and 152 5 kg fe2 d respectively the online control adjusted the fe2 dosing rate to the sulfide production and allowed to reduce chemical dosing due to a lower dosing rate during early morning see fig a 2 for further details during wet weather conditions the infiltration of rainwater significantly reduced the amount of sulfide produced within the pipe e g days 141 145 the superior performance of the feed forward online control was accentuated under those conditions because it was capable of predicting the decrease in sulfide production and adjusting the iron dose reducing the overall chemical dosing fig 5f without significantly affecting sulfide control fig 5d the average dosing rate during the period 138 148 days was respectively 206 4 vs 158 0 kg fe2 d it is important to note that the change in sewage flow during transition from dry to wet weather and vice versa fig 5b led to a transient overdosage or underdosage respectively this can be clearly seen for the latter case in fig 5d day 145 the tds concentration spiked up to 1 44 mg s l because the fe2 dosing rate was not adjusted until this change in the flow regime was detected by the ar model 3 3 validation of the control in field trials the online control algorithm was tested at bellambi sps for a period of 3 weeks fig 6 depicts the concentration of total dissolved sulfide and sewage ph at the discharge of the bellambi rising main for three different dosing regimen no chemical dosing pre defined profiled dosing and online dosing control for a period of 2 days the average sulfide concentration and ferrous chloride dosing during the whole trial are summarized in table 2 and compared to the other two dosing regimen results show that when no ferrous chloride was dosed sulfide levels at discharge of the rising main would be around 1 65 mg s l ranging between 1 and 5 mg s l depending of the time of the day due to variations on sewage hrt average tds levels at discharge were decreased to 0 13 0 20 mg s l and 0 23 0 19 mg s l upon dosing of ferrous chloride based on a pre defined dosing profile or online control respectively the tds 90 percentile of both control strategies were also very similar 0 46 and 0 54 mg s l respectively however ferrous chloride dosage was on average 30 5 lower for the same level of sulfide control it is thus clear that the online control achieved comparable control of sulfide as the existing profiled dosing but with reduced chemical dosing this equals to an annual saving of about 100 000 l of fecl2 by comparing the dosing rate throughout the day for the profiled and online dosing strategies fig 7 the dosing rate of the profiled control was consistently higher than that of the online control especially during morning periods in accordance with the findings of the long term simulation study this extra dose of fecl2 resulted in an increase of the chemical use of 30 5 but did not translate in a significantly better sulfide control overall the improved dosing profile using online ar model achieved sulfide control with lower iron dosage it is important to highlight that no rain was registered during the trial and hence the superior performance of the online control can only be ensured in dry weather conditions 3 4 implications and future work this work presents the development and validation in a field test of an online algorithm for the control of ferrous salt dosing for sulfide mitigation in sewers the control relies on online measurements from affordable and robust online sensors and can be applied to already existing or new dosing station with minimum investment and potentially significant reduction in chemical dosing this is of special importance for iron salt as these are commonly used in large systems with relatively high daily flows ganigué et al 2011 in such systems the fine control of the dosing rates based on the real time state of the system can lead to significant savings in chemical usage and improved sulfide control this control was validated for the dosing of ferrous chloride through simulations and a field trial but can be easily implemented to control the dosing of ferric salts by adjusting the stoichiometry the methodology developed in this study is however not only constrained to iron salt oxygen injection and the addition of nitrate salts are also widely used methods for sulfide mitigation in sewers gutierrez et al 2008 jiang et al 2009 both oxygen and nitrate are oxidant of sulfide through biological and or chemical processes although these reactions proceed at a much slower rate than the removal of sulfide by precipitation with iron salt e g 30 60 min vs few seconds gutierrez et al 2008 auguet et al 2015 wei and osseo asare 1995 although the working principle of these chemicals is different from ferrous salts the present algorithm could be also applied with some modifications i e mainly the reaction stoichiometry to control in real time the dosing of oxygen or nitrate to sewers for improved control efficiency and chemical savings it is important to highlight that both oxygen and nitrate can be used as electron acceptors by facultative anaerobes in this respect dosing the chemicals close to the control point should be preferred to minimise their consumption due to side reactions making controller tuning easier dosing locations downstream of the pipe may allow also to measure the concentration of sulfide to be oxidized rather than predicting it also the use of real time hrt prediction can be of importance in mg oh 2 online control the reduction in chemical dosing achieved in this study is of a much higher magnitude than that achieved in ganigué et al 2016 for mg oh 2 only 10 15 chemical saving in respect to the existing profiled control this may be due to differences in the performance of the default controls with which the online controls were compared against but partly also to the improvement derived from the real time hrt prediction by the arma model further work in this area should aim at refining flow prediction during the early stage of a wet weather event or when rain stops to minimise over and under dosage delays or biases in the prediction under those conditions could be minimised by using autoregressive moving average with exogenous terms armax models ljung 1999 this would allow taking into consideration external information related to weather changes e g rainfall radar data or data from online weather stations into the flow prediction this approach has already been successfully applied to the prediction of traffic flow based on vehicle detection salehinia et al 2016 or air pollution based on solar irradiation wind speed and direction raimondi et al 1997 among others in the present work the influence of sewage ph on iron salt stoichiometry has been assumed to be negligible because sewage ph is usually above neutrality nielsen et al 1998 houhou et al 2009 sharma et al 2013 however this may only be true for sewers conveying purely domestic sewage certain sewer systems may receive the discharge of trade waste or industrial wastewater that can lead to more acidic ph conditions for instance sudarjanto et al observed a decrease in the ph of lab scale sewer systems from ph 7 to 6 when receiving the discharge of brewery wastewater sudarjanto et al 2011 in such conditions the fe s stoichiometry will need to be adjusted based on sewage ph in a similar way in this study we have controlled sulfide at discharge below 0 5 mg s l based on current practice of the water industry in australia however water utilities may decide to target more stringent sulfide levels which could affect the fe s ratios required to attain such sulfide concentrations at discharge thus this should be taken also into consideration when calculating the dose of iron salt last but not least this study did not consider the fact that rain and storm events may have a direct impact on the sulfide producing capacity of sewers by detaching part of the sewer biofilm or removing sewer sediments to date there is little knowledge on these phenomena but further research should elucidate whether or not they can lead to a significant decrease in sewer sulfide production and its duration finally corrosion control in sewers can be also targeted at a network level as recently shown by liu and co workers liu et al 2013 2016 magnesium hydroxide and iron salt are conserved chemicals and thus a single dosing point may allow the control of sulfide corrosion at multiple locations of the network this approach will result in fewer dosing stations decreasing the capital expenditure for sulfide control on the contrary control complexity will multiply as the size of the network grows network wide corrosion control is not incompatible but rather complementary to the online control of chemical dosing in single pipes if the number of corrosion and odour hot spots is limited and or these are geographically isolated dosing control should be preferably carried out at a single pipe level on the contrary if sulfide issues are widely distributed within a network and the hot spots are concentrated in a small area it would be more cost effective to address sulfide control on a network basis in this light the choice of strategy should be based on a preliminary analysis of the network and the needs for sulfide control 4 conclusions a novel and robust online dosing control strategy was established for ferrous salt delivering improved sulfide control in sewers and a reduction of chemical dosing the control considers the fluctuation of sewage flow ph sulfide levels and also the perturbation from rainfall arma models can predict sulfide production in sewers based on current flow measurements which in turn can be used to determine the dose of ferrous salt required for cost effective sulfide control the control strategy was evaluated using both a state of the art sewer model and in a real sewer site it achieved high level of sulfide control at 0 5 mg s l while reducing chemical dosing up to 30 the control strategy proposed here can be adopted or modified for the dosing control of other commonly used chemicals in sewers acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the australian research council and many members of the australian

19686,recent research on contaminant removal by zerovalent iron zvi has evolved from investigating simple model systems to systems that encompass increased dimensions of complexity sulfidation and aerobic conditions are two of the most broadly relevant complications combining these two this study investigated the dynamic interactions between sulfidated microscale zvi and dissolved o2 for removal of cr vi a model contaminant for metals and metalloids the results show that the coupling of sulfidation and oxygenation significantly improves cr removal which is attributed to enhanced fe ii production that resulted from accelerated corrosion of fe 0 the cr vi removal rate increased with increasing o2 saturation from 0 to 100 but showed a bimodal dependence on the s fe ratio at the optimal s fe ratio the zvi exhibits a highly porous surface morphology which according to prior literature on sulfur induced corrosion promotes corrosion in addition a novel time series correlation was developed between aqueous fe ii and cr vi based on data collected in the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline to probe for changes of reductants during the reaction time course the analysis indicated that fe 0 was responsible for the initial small amount of cr vi removal which then transitioned to a phase controlled by surface fe ii the slopes of the time series correlations during the latter phase of the reaction vary with experimental conditions but are mostly much higher than the theoretical stoichiometric ratio between cr vi and fe ii i e 0 33 indicating that fe ii regeneration contributes significantly to cr removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidation zerovalent iron aerobic reductive sequestration fe ii regeneration corrosion enhancement 1 introduction

2005 liang et al 2013 liu et al 2013b sun et al 2016 the primary aims of these new developments are to i explore improvements to enhance effectiveness of zvi for contaminant removal and ii overcome limitations that may impede the full scale applications of zvi e g passivation of fe 0 guan et al 2015 however these complexities can result in dynamic and transient behaviors involving reactive species in both aqueous and solid phases which can reveal new fundamental processes that were not evident in simpler model systems one emerging area that has recently attracted a great deal of interest is the sulfidation of zvi fan et al 2017 li et al 2017b mostly nzvi but recently expanded to include microscale zvi mzvi gu et al 2017 xu et al 2016a the process involves modification of zvi by a variety of lower valent sulfur compounds most commonly aqueous sulfide and dithionite to form iron sulfides either on the surface of fe 0 as mixed with the core material fan et al 2017 sulfidation was initially used to mimic naturally occurring microbial sulfate reduction which can be stimulated by emplacement of zvi in the subsurface gu et al 1999 kirschling et al 2010 phillips et al 2010 more recent studies showed that controlled sulfidation could be an effective strategy to tune the reactive properties of zvi in favor of a broad range of contaminant removal processes the benefits identified to date include selective metal sequestration as metal sulfides as opposed to labile metal oxides fan et al 2013 enhanced metal adsorption capacity su et al 2015 increasing reactivity and selectivity with organic contaminants e g tricholoroethene tce fan et al 2016 han and yan 2016 kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and enhanced reactivity with emerging contaminants that are recalcitrant to nzvi cao et al 2017 li et al 2016 2017a collectively these studies demonstrate the diverse and important roles of sulfidation in enhancing contaminant transformation and sequestration either directly or indirectly another prominent development is the expansion of zvi applications from anaerobic conditions which mainly apply to groundwater remediation to aerobic conditions in order to simulate industrial wastewater treatment for metals and organics liang et al 2015 xu et al 2016b xue et al 2013 although conventional wisdom predicts that dissolved oxygen inhibits reductive dehalogenation by zvi more recent studies have suggested oxygen can promote contaminant transformation sequestration by zvi under some circumstances for organic contaminants the activation of molecular oxygen by zvi has long been recognized as a primary mechanism joo et al 2005 keenan and sedlak 2008 lee 2015 mu et al 2017 whereas the beneficial effects for metals and metalloids mainly arise from aerobic corrosion of fe 0 which either generates additional fe ii that serves as a reductant or enhances contaminant sorption and subsequent interfacial electron transfer via iron oxides on the surface of fe 0 qin et al 2016 2017 yoon et al 2011 application of sulfidation for contaminant removal under aerobic conditions has received very little attention so far but it is expected to grow following the similar path as zvi for sulfidated zvi the effects of oxygen can bring additional complexity to the system because fes may also be oxidized in addition to all of the other reactions that could occur in the zvi system and the presence of fes may directly affect the corrosion of fe 0 and subsequently the production of secondary reductants such as fe ii zheng et al 2015 although oxidation of fes has been extensively studied and well understood the majority of the studies to date concern oxidative remobilization rather than sequestration of metals and metalloids that may result from the oxidation of fes bi and hayes 2014 bi et al 2013 jeong et al 2010a to date mixed results have been reported on the effects of sulfidated zvi for contaminant removal under aerobic conditions du et al 2016 showed that the presence of oxygen slightly inhibited the sequestration of chromate by sulfidated nzvi whereas xu et al 2016a reported fast decolorization of orange i by sulfidated zvi under aerobic conditions although they did not directly compare these results with anaerobic conditions nevertheless neither study has specifically examined the dynamic and transient oxidation processes of sulfidated zvi and their effects on contaminant transformation the goal of the present study is to fill this data gap by systematically characterizing contaminant removal by sulfidated zvi under aerobic conditions compared to prior sulfidation work that mostly used laboratory synthesized nzvi commercially available microscale zvi was selected here to further expand the family of sulfidated materials likewise for contaminant we selected the group of metals and metalloids as opposed to organics which have been less commonly studied in prior sulfidation research specifically chromate was chosen as a model contaminant because of i its prevalence and high toxicity gheju 2011 ponder et al 2000 and ii more importantly the relatively well understood redox behavior of cr vi and the slow negligible reoxidation of cr iii by dissolved oxygen gheju 2011 rai et al 1989 the latter ensures unambiguous analysis of the kinetics of contaminant sequestration in such a complex system that likely involves multiphase reductants in solid phase redox disequilibrium in aqueous phase and dynamic interactions between the two to achieve that we employed a suite of solution chemistry and solid phase characterization approaches and developed a novel time series correlation analysis method based on the 1 10 phenanthroline assay to examine reductive sequestration of cr vi by sulfidated zvi under aerobic conditions 2 experimental section 2 1 chemical reagents analytical grade sodium sulfide na2s sodium sulfate na2so4 and

were collected by vacuum filtration and the filtered particles were freeze dried at 50 c for 2 h to differentiate the zvi and sulfidated zvi we designated the latter as s zvi in consistency with the recent terminology proposed for zvi sulfidated by aqueous solid approach fan et al 2017 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments of cr vi removal by zvi and s zvi were performed in 1 l beakers open to

bruker ger the samples were prepared by dispersing onto black phosphorus nano sheets in ethanol and drop casting over cleaned si substrates 3 results and discussion 3 1 cr removal by s zvi under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the kinetics of cr vi removal by zvi and s zvi was examined under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions fig 1 with untreated zvi little or no cr vi removal was observed under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions these results suggest the high degree of surface passivation of the type of zvi used in this study which is mainly due to the indigenous iron oxide surface layer on this material as indicated by the xps data fig s1 but may also be due to precipitation of cr iii in the early stages of reaction which would further passivate zvi using sulfidated zvi higher cr removal was achieved which is consistent with the favorable effects of sulfidation reported by prior literature on metal removal by sulfidated nzvi under anaerobic conditions du et al 2016 fan et al 2013 su et al 2015 in addition the presence of oxygen greatly improved cr vi removal compared to anaerobic conditions complete removal of 5 mg l cr vi was achieved within 40 min in the presence of oxygen similar results were observed for the beijing zvi although the improvement by sulfidation under aerobic conditions was not as significant as with alfa zvi fig s2 enhanced cr vi removal by zvi under oxic condition has been reported by several prior studies feng et al 2015 qin et al 2016 yoon et al 2011 the enhancement was attributed to the formation of fe iii and cr iii precipitates under oxic conditions which are less passivating than the one formed under anaerobic conditions yoon et al 2011 or enhanced fe 0 corrosion by oxygen qin et al 2016 which produces additional fe ii it has been reported that the presence of oxygen does not affect cr vi reduction by fe ii under a wide range of phs fendorf and li 1996 the significant difference in cr vi removal between anaerobic and aerobic conditions observed in this study seems to indicate that a large quantity of additional reductant was generated from s zvi under aerobic conditions which aligns more closely with the second explanation however the most compelling evidence that usually is used to support the latter argument the absence of measurable aqueous fe ii until aqueous cr vi concentration approached zero was not observed here fig s3a shows that for s zvi both the presence and absence of cr vi gave little production of fe ii up to 1 mg l parallel ph measurements showed a rapid increase from 5 to circumneutral range fig s3c suggesting that little aqueous fe ii measured might be due to fe ii oxidation or formation of sorbed fe ii both favored at high ph to verify the effects of ph on release of aqueous fe ii additional experiments were conducted at ph 5 buffered by naac hac at constant ph of 5 little aqueous fe ii was produced until cr vi removal approached completion t 20 min in this case fig 2 which is similar to fe ii profiles reported by several prior studies feng et al 2015 the rate of cr removal was faster than in the unbuffered treatment which is consistent with many previous studies showing that lower ph accelerates cr vi removal in zvi system due to faster corrosion of fe 0 alowitz and scherer 2002 gheju 2011 gheju and iovi 2006 to further examine and quantify the role of fe ii in cr vi removal we added 1 10 phenanthroline into the reaction which is an fe ii complexing ligand due to stronger complexation with fe ii than fe iii 1 10 phenanthroline increases the redox potential of fe ii fe iii couple galicia et al 1990 thus making fe ii unavailable for cr vi reduction buerge and hug 1998 this protocol has been used in a couple of recent studies to prove significant contribution of fe ii to cr vi removal in zvi relevant systems under anaerobic conditions du et al 2016 mu et al 2015 zhou et al 2008 consistent with those studies our data shows that the addition of 1 10 phenanthroline caused significant inhibition of cr vi removal but fe ii production was not inhibited initially fig 2 comparing the two cases it appears that the amount of fe ii complexed by 1 10 phenanthroline is responsible for the difference in cr vi removal between aerobic and anaerobic conditions the difference in fe ii production at 20 min with and without 1 10 phenanthroline 0 095 mm however only accounts for 40 of cr vi removal difference observed at that time point 0 075 mm according to the reaction stoichiometry between fe ii and cr vi a control experiment showed that the fe ii phenanthroline complex is stable under our experimental conditions i e ph 5 buffered and aerobic fig s4 so underestimation of fe ii in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline due to oxidation is unlikely it has also been reported that 1 10 phenantroline might act as a corrosion inhibitor for steel thus lowering fe ii production banerjee and misra 1989 however measurement of fe ii evolution during oxidation of s zvi in the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline showed negligible differences fig s5 these results indicate that unaccounted reductants must be responsible for cr vi reduction in our system possible reductants other than fe ii include primary reductants such as fe 0 fes and secondary reductants such as atomic hydrogen and s ii that result from reaction or decomposition of the primary reductants however the primary reductants are subject to oxidation by o2 and therefore may not provide continuous removal of cr vi the contributions of the secondary reductants other than fe ii should not be affected by the addition of 1 10 phenanthroline as a result the only possibility left is regeneration of surface fe ii from fe iii by fe 0 scherer et al 1998 the regenerated fe ii may not be detected by the phenanthroline assay because fe iii would not be produced for regeneration due to complexation of fe ii phenanthroline surface fe ii has been proposed to play a major role in cr vi removal by oxide coated nzvi under anoxic conditions mu et al 2015 or by fe ii sorbed minerals buerge and hug 1999 reduction of surface fe2o3 by the fe 0 core was suggested as one of the two major routes for producing surface fe ii mu et al 2015 given higher electron conductivity of fes than oxides similar electron transfer process from core to surface is highly plausible in our system conceptually the contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal is controlled by the relative rates of three processes that proceed concurrently i production of fe ii from fe 0 eq 1 and eq 2 ii oxidation of fe ii by cr vi or o2 to form fe iii eq 3 and eq 4 and iii reduction of fe iii by fe 0 that regenerates fe ii eq 5 therefore a qualitative hypothesis can be made that enhanced rates of fe ii production may reduce the contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal the contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi reduction may also be affected by the dynamic characteristics of surface fes layer upon oxidation because the phases on the material surface affect both fe ii production and regeneration as both processes involve transfer of reactive species across the surface layer to further test these hypotheses experiments were conducted to examine the effects of oxygen concentration and s fe ratio on cr vi removal 1 3 f e 0 2 c r o 4 2 10 h 3 f e 2 2 c r o h 3 2 h 2 o 2 2 f e 0 2 h 2 o o 2 2 f e 2 4 o h 3 3 f e 2 c r o 4 2 8 h 2 o 3 f e o h 3 c r o h 3 4 h 4 2 f e 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 f e o h 3 2 h 5 f e 0 2 f e i i i 3 f e i i 3 2 effects of oxygen concentration on cr vi removal the effects of oxygen concentration on cr vi removal were evaluated for s fe ratio of 0 056 in unbuffered solution fig 3 a shows that increasing o2 concentration from 0 to 100 enhanced the rate of cr vi removal in the absence of 1 10 phenanthroline in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline increasing o2 concentration led to faster and greater fe ii production fig 3b again supporting that cr vi removal rate is largely dependent on the fe ii availability to further quantify the relationship between the rate of fe ii production and the rate of cr vi reduction aqueous cr vi concentrations in the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline were plotted against aqueous fe ii concentration measured in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline fig 3c this kind of binary time series correlation analysis is derived from our previous work which has been proven to be diagnostic in identifying and distinguishing dominant controlling processes for contaminant removal liang et al 2014a xu et al 2016a xu et al 2016b the correlation analysis in fig 3c clearly shows that the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline produced two distinct groups of time series data in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline all of the data regardless of o2 concentration appear to fall on a single curve that has two segments the first segment accounts for majority of the cr vi reduction since fe ii complexed by 1 10 phenanthroline is unavailable to reduce cr vi this initial reduction of cr vi must be caused by the primary reductants fe 0 and or fes this conclusion is additionally supported by solution chemistry data shown in fig s3 for s zvi both in the presence and absence of cr vi aqueous fe ii rapidly increased to slightly less than 1 mg l at the 2 min sampling point fig s3a suggesting that fe ii was generated by fe 0 oxidation eqs 1 and 2 however the presence of cr vi results in less decrease in do than in the absence of cr vi fig s3b suggesting that cr vi reduction competes with o2 reduction for fe 0 in the absence of 1 10 phenanthroline close inspection of the data shows that correlation between cr vi and fe ii has three distinct segments for all o2 concentrations the initial phase appears to have similar slopes for all o2 concentrations as represented by the linear fitting for 0 o2 data which is similar to the effect of o2 seen in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline again suggesting that the primary reductants control the initial reduction of cr vi the fact that the initial phase in the absence of 1 10 phenanthroline produced more cr vi reduction than in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline is likely because additional fe ii generated by cr vi reduction by fe 0 eq 2 can further reduce cr vi without 1 10 phenanthroline eq 3 compared to the first segment in the time series correlations for data without phenanthroline the slope of the second segment shows a subtle but clear divergence with increasing oxygen concentration fig 3c the transistion between these segments indicates that the dominant reductant has switched to fe ii the slopes of the second segments for all o2 concentrations are much greater than the theoretical stoichiometric ratio between cr vi and fe ii suggesting that fe ii regeneration is an important contributor to cr vi reduction the slope becomes less steep with increasing o2 concentration indicating less contributions from regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal due to faster fe ii production at high o2 concentration fig 3b however one potential limitation to the this analysis on this particular dataset is that there was a ph difference between the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline in unbuffered system the addition of 1 10 phenanthroline stabilized ph around 5 data not shown whereas without adding 1 10 phenanthroline the ph rose to circumneutral range as high ph typically lowers the oxidation rate of fe 0 and favors formation of sorbed fe ii sedlak and chan 1997 the aqueous fe ii measured in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline may overestimate the actual fe ii concentration in the absence of 1 10 phenanthroline nevertheless this should not change the qualitative conclusion that increasing o2 concentration enhances fe ii production and therefore decreases the contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal the transition from the second segment to the tail phase likely indicates decreasing contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi reduction as the slope becomes significantly less steep 3 3 effects of s fe ratio on cr vi removal a bimodal pattern was observed for cr vi removal with increasing s fe ratio fig 4 which is similar to what has been reported in several prior sulfidation studies fan et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 in this case the maximum removal kinetics was achieved at s fe 0 056 and the removal capacity followed the same trend three intermediate s fe ratios 0 042 0 056 and 0 070 resulted in nearly 100 removal after 120 min reaction but both low and high s fe ratios showed significant tailing and incomplete cr removal by 120 min subsequent measurement of aqueous fe ii in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline at various s fe ratios also showed a bimodal pattern that is consistent with the cr removal data fig 4b lower fe ii production at high s fe ratios provides strong evidence that the main source of fe ii is not from oxidative dissolution of fes but instead is supplied by the dynamic corrosion process of the fe 0 core the variability of fe ii production and cr vi removal with s fe ratio indicates that surface iron sulfide plays a significant role in affecting the corrosion rate of the underlying fe 0 the above interpretation supports one of the key themes in our recent review on sulfidation fan et al 2017 although the existing environmental literature generally concludes that sulfidation inhibits corrosion of fe 0 fan et al 2016 han and yan 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 extensive prior work on sulfur induced corrosion has shown both inhibitory and promoting effects and suggested the transition between the two is finely controlled by environmental variables bai et al 2016 enning and garrelfs 2014 newman et al 1992 for example it has been shown that increasing sulfide concentration could change the effects on corrosion rate of steel from inhibition to promotion then back to inhibition sun and nešic 2009 zheng et al 2015 the inhibition at low sulfide concentration is due to the formation of a dense base layer of fes at very low sulfide concentration as sulfide concentration increases the transition from inhibition to promotion arises because from precipitation of secondary fes that is highly porous which compromises the dense base layer and induces localized corrosion the second inhibition phase at higher sulfide concentration is attributed to the sealing of open pores by further formation of fes the transition from the second to the third phases seen in previous studies of corrosion under sulfidic conditions is consistent with the kinetic data in this study and is further supported by scanning electron micrographs sems of s zvi with different s fe ratios fig 5 the s zvi prepared at s fe 0 056 shows a highly porous surface morphology that is distinct from the materials prepared at both lower and higher s fe ratios despite eds showing higher s content at s fe of 0 084 fig s6 its sem shows fewer and smaller pores than that of s fe of 0 056 fig 5 suggesting that additional fes filled the open pore space additional measurements of surface roughness and surface area showed the same bimodal patterns with s fe ratio fig 5e and table s1 all of which are consistent with the rates of fe ii production and cr vi removal this confirms that the surface morphology of s zvi controls the corrosion of underlying fe 0 and this affects the production of fe ii and subsequent reduction of cr vi a time series correlation similar to fig 3c was also performed on data collected with different s fe ratios to eliminate the ph effects discussed in fig 3c an additional set of experiments was conducted in buffered solution comparison between the time series correlations in buffered fig 6 a and unbuffered fig 6b systems showed that buffering did not change the bimodal dependence of cr vi removal on s fe ratio observed in unbuffered system but buffering gave faster or more complete cr vi removal at all s fe ratios fig 6 this is probably due to the lower ph maintained in the buffered systems which results in more fe ii production e g fe ii production for s fe of 0 056 reached nearly 25 mg l in buffered system fig s7b in general the slopes of the correlations in the presence of buffer are less steep compared to those in the absence of buffer consistent with higher fe ii production in the presence of buffer indicative of less contribution of regenerated fe ii however within each dataset the time series correlations between aqueous cr vi and fe ii appear to not differ by much in terms of the respective slopes of each segment which is in contrast with the correlations obtained for the effect of oxygen which showed the differences in the slopes of the second segment discussed above fig 3c the opposite effects of s fe ratio and oxygen level on these correlations are difficult to explain with our existing data but possibly reflects how internal i e s fe ratios and external i e oxygen levels variables may influence the system dynamics differently an example showing how different oxygen levels affect surface morphology of s zvi is shown in fig s8 for s fe ratio of 0 056 it can be seen that in the absence of oxygen the porous surface feature of the unreacted s zvi completely disappeared after reaction with cr vi for 120 min but the morphology preserved at oxygen level of 20 thus it is plausible that the morphological changes at different oxygen levels may affect the relative ratio between fe ii production and regeneration on the other hand the ratio between the two may be less sensitive to the material properties determined by s fe ratios than to oxygen further testing and validation of this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this work but might be done using electrochemical methods to provide high resolution temporal characterization of changes in the surface layers and the redox properties of these phases turcio ortega et al 2012 4 conclusions the combination of sulfidation and aerobic conditions used in this study provides new insights into the effects of both these factors and the first data on their interactions the approach taken in this study also expands both the scope of zvi type and contaminant probe compound which to date have mostly focused on nzvi and organics most importantly the results of this study expands the diversity of the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for the benefits of sulfidation which previously included only the formation of metal sulfides for metals and metalloids and improved reactivity and selectivity due to inhibited corrosion of fe 0 for organics the enhanced removal of cr vi shows that benefits of sulfidation can be achieved for metals or metalloids that do not form stable sulfide phases the enhanced corrosion by sulfidation although opposite the effect that is usually seen with nzvi which involves enhance dechlorination by inhibiting corrosion actually reflect a broad spectrum of the dynamic and complex effects of sulfur on corrosion of fe 0 the correlation between surface morphology and the rates of fe ii production and cr vi removal at different s fe ratios provides strong evidence for the fundamental linkage between corrosion of fe 0 and contaminant removal processes in addition the present work further develops the methods of i correlation analysis using time series data in this case of fe ii and cr vi and ii controlling availability of fe ii by addition of 1 10 phenanthroline while multiple parallel reactions make it impossible to quantify all of the individual reactions in our system the combination of method innovations used in this study allowed qualitative identification of the three phases where cr reduction are controlled by different reducing species in addition deviation of the slope of the correlation from the theoretical stoichiometric ratio between fe ii and cr vi provides a diagnostic indicator to evaluate the relative contributions of aqueous fe ii and regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal this approach is expected to be applicable to other metals and metalloids for which fe ii is expected to play a major role in contaminant sequestration acknowledgments the primary support of this research was the natural science

19686,recent research on contaminant removal by zerovalent iron zvi has evolved from investigating simple model systems to systems that encompass increased dimensions of complexity sulfidation and aerobic conditions are two of the most broadly relevant complications combining these two this study investigated the dynamic interactions between sulfidated microscale zvi and dissolved o2 for removal of cr vi a model contaminant for metals and metalloids the results show that the coupling of sulfidation and oxygenation significantly improves cr removal which is attributed to enhanced fe ii production that resulted from accelerated corrosion of fe 0 the cr vi removal rate increased with increasing o2 saturation from 0 to 100 but showed a bimodal dependence on the s fe ratio at the optimal s fe ratio the zvi exhibits a highly porous surface morphology which according to prior literature on sulfur induced corrosion promotes corrosion in addition a novel time series correlation was developed between aqueous fe ii and cr vi based on data collected in the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline to probe for changes of reductants during the reaction time course the analysis indicated that fe 0 was responsible for the initial small amount of cr vi removal which then transitioned to a phase controlled by surface fe ii the slopes of the time series correlations during the latter phase of the reaction vary with experimental conditions but are mostly much higher than the theoretical stoichiometric ratio between cr vi and fe ii i e 0 33 indicating that fe ii regeneration contributes significantly to cr removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfidation zerovalent iron aerobic reductive sequestration fe ii regeneration corrosion enhancement 1 introduction

interest is the sulfidation of zvi fan et al 2017 li et al 2017b mostly nzvi but recently expanded to include microscale zvi mzvi gu et al 2017 xu et al 2016a the process involves modification of zvi by a variety of lower valent sulfur compounds most commonly aqueous sulfide and dithionite to form iron sulfides either on the surface of fe 0 as mixed with the core material fan et al 2017 sulfidation was initially used to mimic naturally occurring microbial sulfate reduction which can be stimulated by emplacement of zvi in the subsurface gu et al 1999 kirschling et al 2010 phillips et al 2010 more recent studies showed that controlled sulfidation could be an effective strategy to tune the reactive properties of zvi in favor of a broad range of contaminant removal processes the benefits identified to date include selective metal sequestration as metal sulfides as opposed to labile metal oxides fan et al 2013 enhanced metal adsorption capacity su et al 2015 increasing reactivity and selectivity with organic contaminants e g tricholoroethene tce fan et al 2016 han and yan 2016 kim et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 and enhanced reactivity with emerging contaminants that are recalcitrant to nzvi cao et al 2017 li et al 2016 2017a collectively these studies demonstrate the diverse and important roles of sulfidation in enhancing contaminant transformation and sequestration either directly or indirectly another prominent development is the expansion of zvi applications from anaerobic conditions which mainly apply to groundwater remediation to aerobic conditions in order to simulate industrial wastewater treatment for metals and organics liang et al 2015 xu et al 2016b xue et al 2013 although conventional wisdom predicts that dissolved oxygen inhibits reductive dehalogenation by zvi more recent studies have suggested oxygen can promote contaminant transformation sequestration by zvi under some circumstances for organic contaminants the activation of molecular oxygen by zvi has long been recognized as a primary mechanism joo et al 2005 keenan and sedlak 2008 lee 2015 mu et al 2017 whereas the beneficial effects for metals and metalloids mainly arise from aerobic corrosion of fe 0 which either generates additional fe ii that serves as a reductant or enhances contaminant sorption and subsequent interfacial electron transfer via iron oxides on the surface of fe 0 qin et al 2016 2017 yoon et al 2011 application of sulfidation for contaminant removal under aerobic conditions has received very little attention so far but it is expected to grow following the similar path as zvi for sulfidated zvi the effects of oxygen can bring additional complexity to the system because fes may also be oxidized in addition to all of the other reactions that could occur in the zvi system and the presence of fes may directly affect the corrosion of fe 0 and subsequently the production of secondary reductants such as fe ii zheng et al 2015 although oxidation of fes has been extensively studied and well understood the majority of the studies to date concern oxidative remobilization rather than sequestration of metals and metalloids that may result from the oxidation of fes bi and hayes 2014 bi et al 2013 jeong et al 2010a to date mixed results have been reported on the effects of sulfidated zvi for contaminant removal under aerobic conditions du et al 2016 showed that the presence of oxygen slightly inhibited the sequestration of chromate by sulfidated nzvi whereas xu et al 2016a reported fast decolorization of orange i by sulfidated zvi under aerobic conditions although they did not directly compare these results with anaerobic conditions nevertheless neither study has specifically examined the dynamic and transient oxidation processes of sulfidated zvi and their effects on contaminant transformation the goal of the present study is to fill this data gap by systematically characterizing contaminant removal by sulfidated zvi under aerobic conditions compared to prior sulfidation work that mostly used laboratory synthesized nzvi commercially available microscale zvi was selected here to further expand the family of sulfidated materials likewise for contaminant we selected the group of metals and metalloids as opposed to organics which have been less commonly studied in prior sulfidation research specifically chromate was chosen as a model contaminant because of i its prevalence and high toxicity gheju 2011 ponder et al 2000 and ii more importantly the relatively well understood redox behavior of cr vi and the slow negligible reoxidation of cr iii by dissolved oxygen gheju 2011 rai et al 1989 the latter ensures unambiguous analysis of the kinetics of contaminant sequestration in such a complex system that likely involves multiphase reductants in solid phase redox disequilibrium in aqueous phase and dynamic interactions between the two to achieve that we employed a suite of solution chemistry and solid phase characterization approaches and developed a novel time series correlation analysis method based on the 1 10 phenanthroline assay to examine reductive sequestration of cr vi by sulfidated zvi under aerobic conditions 2 experimental section 2 1 chemical reagents analytical grade sodium sulfide na2s sodium sulfate na2so4 and

were collected by vacuum filtration and the filtered particles were freeze dried at 50 c for 2 h to differentiate the zvi and sulfidated zvi we designated the latter as s zvi in consistency with the recent terminology proposed for zvi sulfidated by aqueous solid approach fan et al 2017 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments of cr vi removal by zvi and s zvi were performed in 1 l beakers open to

bruker ger the samples were prepared by dispersing onto black phosphorus nano sheets in ethanol and drop casting over cleaned si substrates 3 results and discussion 3 1 cr removal by s zvi under aerobic and anaerobic conditions the kinetics of cr vi removal by zvi and s zvi was examined under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions fig 1 with untreated zvi little or no cr vi removal was observed under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions these results suggest the high degree of surface passivation of the type of zvi used in this study which is mainly due to the indigenous iron oxide surface layer on this material as indicated by the xps data fig s1 but may also be due to precipitation of cr iii in the early stages of reaction which would further passivate zvi using sulfidated zvi higher cr removal was achieved which is consistent with the favorable effects of sulfidation reported by prior literature on metal removal by sulfidated nzvi under anaerobic conditions du et al 2016 fan et al 2013 su et al 2015 in addition the presence of oxygen greatly improved cr vi removal compared to anaerobic conditions complete removal of 5 mg l cr vi was achieved within 40 min in the presence of oxygen similar results were observed for the beijing zvi although the improvement by sulfidation under aerobic conditions was not as significant as with alfa zvi fig s2 enhanced cr vi removal by zvi under oxic condition has been reported by several prior studies feng et al 2015 qin et al 2016 yoon et al 2011 the enhancement was attributed to the formation of fe iii and cr iii precipitates under oxic conditions which are less passivating than the one formed under anaerobic conditions yoon et al 2011 or enhanced fe 0 corrosion by oxygen qin et al 2016 which produces additional fe ii it has been reported that the presence of oxygen does not affect cr vi reduction by fe ii under a wide range of phs fendorf and li 1996 the significant difference in cr vi removal between anaerobic and aerobic conditions observed in this study seems to indicate that a large quantity of additional reductant was generated from s zvi under aerobic conditions which aligns more closely with the second explanation however the most compelling evidence that usually is used to support the latter argument the absence of measurable aqueous fe ii until aqueous cr vi concentration approached zero was not observed here fig s3a shows that for s zvi both the presence and absence of cr vi gave little production of fe ii up to 1 mg l parallel ph measurements showed a rapid increase from 5 to circumneutral range fig s3c suggesting that little aqueous fe ii measured might be due to fe ii oxidation or formation of sorbed fe ii both favored at high ph to verify the effects of ph on release of aqueous fe ii additional experiments were conducted at ph 5 buffered by naac hac at constant ph of 5 little aqueous fe ii was produced until cr vi removal approached completion t 20 min in this case fig 2 which is similar to fe ii profiles reported by several prior studies feng et al 2015 the rate of cr removal was faster than in the unbuffered treatment which is consistent with many previous studies showing that lower ph accelerates cr vi removal in zvi system due to faster corrosion of fe 0 alowitz and scherer 2002 gheju 2011 gheju and iovi 2006 to further examine and quantify the role of fe ii in cr vi removal we added 1 10 phenanthroline into the reaction which is an fe ii complexing ligand due to stronger complexation with fe ii than fe iii 1 10 phenanthroline increases the redox potential of fe ii fe iii couple galicia et al 1990 thus making fe ii unavailable for cr vi reduction buerge and hug 1998 this protocol has been used in a couple of recent studies to prove significant contribution of fe ii to cr vi removal in zvi relevant systems under anaerobic conditions du et al 2016 mu et al 2015 zhou et al 2008 consistent with those studies our data shows that the addition of 1 10 phenanthroline caused significant inhibition of cr vi removal but fe ii production was not inhibited initially fig 2 comparing the two cases it appears that the amount of fe ii complexed by 1 10 phenanthroline is responsible for the difference in cr vi removal between aerobic and anaerobic conditions the difference in fe ii production at 20 min with and without 1 10 phenanthroline 0 095 mm however only accounts for 40 of cr vi removal difference observed at that time point 0 075 mm according to the reaction stoichiometry between fe ii and cr vi a control experiment showed that the fe ii phenanthroline complex is stable under our experimental conditions i e ph 5 buffered and aerobic fig s4 so underestimation of fe ii in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline due to oxidation is unlikely it has also been reported that 1 10 phenantroline might act as a corrosion inhibitor for steel thus lowering fe ii production banerjee and misra 1989 however measurement of fe ii evolution during oxidation of s zvi in the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline showed negligible differences fig s5 these results indicate that unaccounted reductants must be responsible for cr vi reduction in our system possible reductants other than fe ii include primary reductants such as fe 0 fes and secondary reductants such as atomic hydrogen and s ii that result from reaction or decomposition of the primary reductants however the primary reductants are subject to oxidation by o2 and therefore may not provide continuous removal of cr vi the contributions of the secondary reductants other than fe ii should not be affected by the addition of 1 10 phenanthroline as a result the only possibility left is regeneration of surface fe ii from fe iii by fe 0 scherer et al 1998 the regenerated fe ii may not be detected by the phenanthroline assay because fe iii would not be produced for regeneration due to complexation of fe ii phenanthroline surface fe ii has been proposed to play a major role in cr vi removal by oxide coated nzvi under anoxic conditions mu et al 2015 or by fe ii sorbed minerals buerge and hug 1999 reduction of surface fe2o3 by the fe 0 core was suggested as one of the two major routes for producing surface fe ii mu et al 2015 given higher electron conductivity of fes than oxides similar electron transfer process from core to surface is highly plausible in our system conceptually the contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal is controlled by the relative rates of three processes that proceed concurrently i production of fe ii from fe 0 eq 1 and eq 2 ii oxidation of fe ii by cr vi or o2 to form fe iii eq 3 and eq 4 and iii reduction of fe iii by fe 0 that regenerates fe ii eq 5 therefore a qualitative hypothesis can be made that enhanced rates of fe ii production may reduce the contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal the contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi reduction may also be affected by the dynamic characteristics of surface fes layer upon oxidation because the phases on the material surface affect both fe ii production and regeneration as both processes involve transfer of reactive species across the surface layer to further test these hypotheses experiments were conducted to examine the effects of oxygen concentration and s fe ratio on cr vi removal 1 3 f e 0 2 c r o 4 2 10 h 3 f e 2 2 c r o h 3 2 h 2 o 2 2 f e 0 2 h 2 o o 2 2 f e 2 4 o h 3 3 f e 2 c r o 4 2 8 h 2 o 3 f e o h 3 c r o h 3 4 h 4 2 f e 2 o 2 4 h 2 o 2 f e o h 3 2 h 5 f e 0 2 f e i i i 3 f e i i 3 2 effects of oxygen concentration on cr vi removal the effects of oxygen concentration on cr vi removal were evaluated for s fe ratio of 0 056 in unbuffered solution fig 3 a shows that increasing o2 concentration from 0 to 100 enhanced the rate of cr vi removal in the absence of 1 10 phenanthroline in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline increasing o2 concentration led to faster and greater fe ii production fig 3b again supporting that cr vi removal rate is largely dependent on the fe ii availability to further quantify the relationship between the rate of fe ii production and the rate of cr vi reduction aqueous cr vi concentrations in the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline were plotted against aqueous fe ii concentration measured in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline fig 3c this kind of binary time series correlation analysis is derived from our previous work which has been proven to be diagnostic in identifying and distinguishing dominant controlling processes for contaminant removal liang et al 2014a xu et al 2016a xu et al 2016b the correlation analysis in fig 3c clearly shows that the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline produced two distinct groups of time series data in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline all of the data regardless of o2 concentration appear to fall on a single curve that has two segments the first segment accounts for majority of the cr vi reduction since fe ii complexed by 1 10 phenanthroline is unavailable to reduce cr vi this initial reduction of cr vi must be caused by the primary reductants fe 0 and or fes this conclusion is additionally supported by solution chemistry data shown in fig s3 for s zvi both in the presence and absence of cr vi aqueous fe ii rapidly increased to slightly less than 1 mg l at the 2 min sampling point fig s3a suggesting that fe ii was generated by fe 0 oxidation eqs 1 and 2 however the presence of cr vi results in less decrease in do than in the absence of cr vi fig s3b suggesting that cr vi reduction competes with o2 reduction for fe 0 in the absence of 1 10 phenanthroline close inspection of the data shows that correlation between cr vi and fe ii has three distinct segments for all o2 concentrations the initial phase appears to have similar slopes for all o2 concentrations as represented by the linear fitting for 0 o2 data which is similar to the effect of o2 seen in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline again suggesting that the primary reductants control the initial reduction of cr vi the fact that the initial phase in the absence of 1 10 phenanthroline produced more cr vi reduction than in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline is likely because additional fe ii generated by cr vi reduction by fe 0 eq 2 can further reduce cr vi without 1 10 phenanthroline eq 3 compared to the first segment in the time series correlations for data without phenanthroline the slope of the second segment shows a subtle but clear divergence with increasing oxygen concentration fig 3c the transistion between these segments indicates that the dominant reductant has switched to fe ii the slopes of the second segments for all o2 concentrations are much greater than the theoretical stoichiometric ratio between cr vi and fe ii suggesting that fe ii regeneration is an important contributor to cr vi reduction the slope becomes less steep with increasing o2 concentration indicating less contributions from regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal due to faster fe ii production at high o2 concentration fig 3b however one potential limitation to the this analysis on this particular dataset is that there was a ph difference between the presence and absence of 1 10 phenanthroline in unbuffered system the addition of 1 10 phenanthroline stabilized ph around 5 data not shown whereas without adding 1 10 phenanthroline the ph rose to circumneutral range as high ph typically lowers the oxidation rate of fe 0 and favors formation of sorbed fe ii sedlak and chan 1997 the aqueous fe ii measured in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline may overestimate the actual fe ii concentration in the absence of 1 10 phenanthroline nevertheless this should not change the qualitative conclusion that increasing o2 concentration enhances fe ii production and therefore decreases the contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal the transition from the second segment to the tail phase likely indicates decreasing contribution of regenerated fe ii to cr vi reduction as the slope becomes significantly less steep 3 3 effects of s fe ratio on cr vi removal a bimodal pattern was observed for cr vi removal with increasing s fe ratio fig 4 which is similar to what has been reported in several prior sulfidation studies fan et al 2013 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 in this case the maximum removal kinetics was achieved at s fe 0 056 and the removal capacity followed the same trend three intermediate s fe ratios 0 042 0 056 and 0 070 resulted in nearly 100 removal after 120 min reaction but both low and high s fe ratios showed significant tailing and incomplete cr removal by 120 min subsequent measurement of aqueous fe ii in the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline at various s fe ratios also showed a bimodal pattern that is consistent with the cr removal data fig 4b lower fe ii production at high s fe ratios provides strong evidence that the main source of fe ii is not from oxidative dissolution of fes but instead is supplied by the dynamic corrosion process of the fe 0 core the variability of fe ii production and cr vi removal with s fe ratio indicates that surface iron sulfide plays a significant role in affecting the corrosion rate of the underlying fe 0 the above interpretation supports one of the key themes in our recent review on sulfidation fan et al 2017 although the existing environmental literature generally concludes that sulfidation inhibits corrosion of fe 0 fan et al 2016 han and yan 2016 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 extensive prior work on sulfur induced corrosion has shown both inhibitory and promoting effects and suggested the transition between the two is finely controlled by environmental variables bai et al 2016 enning and garrelfs 2014 newman et al 1992 for example it has been shown that increasing sulfide concentration could change the effects on corrosion rate of steel from inhibition to promotion then back to inhibition sun and nešic 2009 zheng et al 2015 the inhibition at low sulfide concentration is due to the formation of a dense base layer of fes at very low sulfide concentration as sulfide concentration increases the transition from inhibition to promotion arises because from precipitation of secondary fes that is highly porous which compromises the dense base layer and induces localized corrosion the second inhibition phase at higher sulfide concentration is attributed to the sealing of open pores by further formation of fes the transition from the second to the third phases seen in previous studies of corrosion under sulfidic conditions is consistent with the kinetic data in this study and is further supported by scanning electron micrographs sems of s zvi with different s fe ratios fig 5 the s zvi prepared at s fe 0 056 shows a highly porous surface morphology that is distinct from the materials prepared at both lower and higher s fe ratios despite eds showing higher s content at s fe of 0 084 fig s6 its sem shows fewer and smaller pores than that of s fe of 0 056 fig 5 suggesting that additional fes filled the open pore space additional measurements of surface roughness and surface area showed the same bimodal patterns with s fe ratio fig 5e and table s1 all of which are consistent with the rates of fe ii production and cr vi removal this confirms that the surface morphology of s zvi controls the corrosion of underlying fe 0 and this affects the production of fe ii and subsequent reduction of cr vi a time series correlation similar to fig 3c was also performed on data collected with different s fe ratios to eliminate the ph effects discussed in fig 3c an additional set of experiments was conducted in buffered solution comparison between the time series correlations in buffered fig 6 a and unbuffered fig 6b systems showed that buffering did not change the bimodal dependence of cr vi removal on s fe ratio observed in unbuffered system but buffering gave faster or more complete cr vi removal at all s fe ratios fig 6 this is probably due to the lower ph maintained in the buffered systems which results in more fe ii production e g fe ii production for s fe of 0 056 reached nearly 25 mg l in buffered system fig s7b in general the slopes of the correlations in the presence of buffer are less steep compared to those in the absence of buffer consistent with higher fe ii production in the presence of buffer indicative of less contribution of regenerated fe ii however within each dataset the time series correlations between aqueous cr vi and fe ii appear to not differ by much in terms of the respective slopes of each segment which is in contrast with the correlations obtained for the effect of oxygen which showed the differences in the slopes of the second segment discussed above fig 3c the opposite effects of s fe ratio and oxygen level on these correlations are difficult to explain with our existing data but possibly reflects how internal i e s fe ratios and external i e oxygen levels variables may influence the system dynamics differently an example showing how different oxygen levels affect surface morphology of s zvi is shown in fig s8 for s fe ratio of 0 056 it can be seen that in the absence of oxygen the porous surface feature of the unreacted s zvi completely disappeared after reaction with cr vi for 120 min but the morphology preserved at oxygen level of 20 thus it is plausible that the morphological changes at different oxygen levels may affect the relative ratio between fe ii production and regeneration on the other hand the ratio between the two may be less sensitive to the material properties determined by s fe ratios than to oxygen further testing and validation of this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this work but might be done using electrochemical methods to provide high resolution temporal characterization of changes in the surface layers and the redox properties of these phases turcio ortega et al 2012 4 conclusions the combination of sulfidation and aerobic conditions used in this study provides new insights into the effects of both these factors and the first data on their interactions the approach taken in this study also expands both the scope of zvi type and contaminant probe compound which to date have mostly focused on nzvi and organics most importantly the results of this study expands the diversity of the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for the benefits of sulfidation which previously included only the formation of metal sulfides for metals and metalloids and improved reactivity and selectivity due to inhibited corrosion of fe 0 for organics the enhanced removal of cr vi shows that benefits of sulfidation can be achieved for metals or metalloids that do not form stable sulfide phases the enhanced corrosion by sulfidation although opposite the effect that is usually seen with nzvi which involves enhance dechlorination by inhibiting corrosion actually reflect a broad spectrum of the dynamic and complex effects of sulfur on corrosion of fe 0 the correlation between surface morphology and the rates of fe ii production and cr vi removal at different s fe ratios provides strong evidence for the fundamental linkage between corrosion of fe 0 and contaminant removal processes in addition the present work further develops the methods of i correlation analysis using time series data in this case of fe ii and cr vi and ii controlling availability of fe ii by addition of 1 10 phenanthroline while multiple parallel reactions make it impossible to quantify all of the individual reactions in our system the combination of method innovations used in this study allowed qualitative identification of the three phases where cr reduction are controlled by different reducing species in addition deviation of the slope of the correlation from the theoretical stoichiometric ratio between fe ii and cr vi provides a diagnostic indicator to evaluate the relative contributions of aqueous fe ii and regenerated fe ii to cr vi removal this approach is expected to be applicable to other metals and metalloids for which fe ii is expected to play a major role in contaminant sequestration acknowledgments the primary support of this research was the natural science

19687,microbial induced concrete corrosion micc is recognized as one of the main degradation mechanisms of subsurface infrastructure worldwide raising the demand for sustainable construction materials in corrosive environments this review aims to summarize the key research progress acquired during the last decade regarding the understanding of micc reaction mechanisms and the development of durable materials from an interdisciplinary perspective special focus was laid on aspects governing concrete micoorganisms interaction since being the central process steering biogenic acid corrosion the insufficient knowledge regarding the latter is proposed as a central reason for insufficient progress in tailored material development for aggressive wastewater systems to date no cement based material exists suitable to withstand the aggressive conditions related to micc over its entire service life research is in particular needed on the impact of physiochemical material parameters on microbial community structure growth characteristics and limitations within individual concrete speciation herein an interdisciplinary approach is presented by combining results from material sciences microbiology mineralogy and hydrochemistry to stimulate the development of novel and sustainable materials and mitigation strategies for micc for instance the application of antibacteriostatic agents is introduced as an effective instrument to limit microbial growth on concrete surfaces in aggressive sewer environments additionally geopolymer concretes are introduced as highly resistent in acid

aggressive and corrosive sewer environments extensive laboratory research and in situ testing have shown that significant durability variations exist between different types of concrete subjected to micc nevertheless none of the so far tested materials can entirely resist this biogenic acid attack all materials failed to reach their projected operating life time alexander et al 2013 de belie et al 2004 girardi et al 2010 goyns and alexander 2014 herisson et al 2013 reasons for this failure may originate from insufficient knowledge on the initial processes leading to microbial colonization of construction materials in heterogenous wastewater environments while li et al 2017 have recently summarized the existing knowledge on microbial community structures of acidophilic bacteria associated with micc little is known about initial microbial colonization of concrete structures in sewer systems moreover it is lagerly unknown how biofilms develop which organisms typically compose these communities how dynamic they are over time and how they interact with the applied concretes vise versa the role of specific physical and chemical concrete properties on microbial growth subsequent corrosion initiation and propagation still needs further research a general description of biofilm characteristics together with the central physiochemical aspects of concrete are described in fig 2 to gain a better overview on the multifacetted phenomenona of micc this review aims to compile the key research findings in the field of micc during the last decade from an interdisciplinary perspective intertwining advances in concrete materials with microbiological and hydro geo chemical related aspects this contribution emphasizes the central role of specific physical and chemical concrete properties on micc initiation and propagation allowing adhesion of microbial cells microbial growth and subsequent biofilm development these properties are likely key factors for micc and are central for further research advances and the development of durable materials moreover we summarize potential additives such as antimicrobial agents applicable in micc environments in addition possible advantages of geopolymer concretes being cement free alternatives compared to conventional cement based building materials such as portland cement opc and calcium aluminate cement cac based concretes are discussed due to their acid resistance pacheco torgal et al 2014 innovative geopolymer technology could represent a significant step towards the development of sustainable materials for micc endangered environments 2 characteristics of wastewater environments inducing micc micc can be described as a sequence of biogenic controlled sulfate reduction and re oxidation initial sulfide production occurs within the sludge and sediment layers deposited along the inner surfaces of the piping system favoring corners and turns areas with long retention times of the wastewater and low abrasive forces with decreasing oxygen and nitrate concentrations due to ongoing fermentation processes dissimilatory sulfate respiration is initiated by different strains of sulfate reducing bacteria srb e g desulfovibrio and desulfomaculum barton and fauque 2009 fig 3 accordingly sulfides are formed as a side product of anaerobic oxidation of organic carbon whereas sulfate is used as an external electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen and nitrate jensen 2009 jensen et al 2011 the concentration and chemical speciation of the produced sulfides is controlled by i temperature ii ph of the wastewater iii concentration of oxidized sulfur compounds in the wastewater iv the biodegradability and composition of the organic matter present e g complex or small organic molecules and v the multiphase i e gas liquid and solid flow characteristics and retention times of the wastewater hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 2002 gaseous hydrogen sulfide h2s is formed together with carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and other vocs and is partly degassing into the atmosphere of the wastewater piping system wastewater treatment plants and or pumping stations the liberation of those volatile components is governed by changes in the surrounding gas pressure ph temperature and wastewater turbulences intensified gas liberation is favored by transition chutes after power mains and gravity wastewater system sections with turns and hydraulic drops grengg et al 2016 2015 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 hvitved jacobsen and vollertsen 2005 via gaseous diffusion h2s and co2 dissolve and accumulate in the moist pore space of the concrete yuan et al 2015 islander at al 1991 first summarized the fundamental processes within the aerobic sequence of micc proposing a 3 step corrosion model fig 4 since concrete is an initially strongly alkaline porous and multiphase material with an initial pore solution of around ph 13 alexander et al 2013 vollpracht et al 2015 the first stage of corrosion is dominated by abiotic acid base reactions thereby the ph reduction of concrete occurs due to carbonation and simultaneous attack of thiosulfuric and polythionic acids produced by chemical oxidation of h2s roberts et al 2002 described ph reduction is potentially controlled by physiochemical material properties steering abiotic oxidation of reduced sulfur species and associated precipitation of the latter oxidation products formed such as elemental sulfur s0 or thiosulfate s2o3 provide the energy source for successive biotic acid production within the latter stages of corrosion grandclerc et al 2017 sun et al 2013 to what extend microbial activity contributes towards the initial ph neutralization of concrete is still under debate commonly it is considered that due to strongly alkaline conditions present in concrete the microbial occurrence within this stage is limited joseph et al 2012 nevertheless okabe et al 2007 reported four times higher ph declining rates on the surface of concrete specimen than calculated considering purely chemical neutralization reactions such a strong ph reduction was consequently related to diverse bacterial species mainly heterotrophic halotolerant and neutrophilic found on the concretes surface generally no loss of material occurs during this first stage but similar to conventional sulfate attack the diffusion of sulfate rich pore fluids is triggering initial leaching of calcium rich hydroxides and isochronal precipitation of expansive sulfate salts such as gypsum gp or ettringite ett especially within the cement rich interfacial transition zones close to the aggregates associated increase in pore pressure results in structural destabilization and crack formation grengg et al 2015 jiang et al 2014b mittermayr et al 2015 scrivener et al 2004 the transition to the second stage of corrosion is marked by the colonization of various strains of neutrophilic sulfur oxidizing bacteria nsob which adopt the moist concrete surface and pore structure at ph around 9 to 9 5 islander et al 1991 joseph et al 2012 satoh et al 2009 vincke et al 2000 a succession of at least 4 phylotypes of nsob with decreasing ph is reported fig 4 nsob possess the ability to utilize different sulfur compounds to form sulfuric acid h2so4 under moist conditions gomez alvarez et al 2012 okabe et al 2007 continued bacterial activity associated with biogenic h2so4 production and corresponding acidification is causing dissolution of the cementitious matrix and if present carbonatic aggregates together with neo formation of sulfate salts and consequent mass loss of material the newly formed mineral phases precipitating from strongly oversaturated interstitial concrete pore solutions are dominated by expansive gypsum bassanite bas and anhydrite anh grengg et al 2015 jiang et al 2014b the formation of secondary ettringite and associated internal cracking as reported in conventional sulfate attack on concrete is unlikely within the surface near low ph areas due to its instability below ph 10 7 gabrisova et al 1991 mittermayr et al 2015 additionally concrete standard regulations e g en 206 1 stipulate tri calcium aluminate c3a free opc cement for concretes used in such aggressive environments thereby limiting the aluminum source central for ettringite formation nevertheless ettringite appearance is reported in various studies jiang et al 2015 peyre lavigne et al 2016 2015a b presumably secondary ettringite could form within the transition zone between non corroded and strongly affected concrete layers where alkaline conditions still dominate but sulfate rich pore fluids are already present there ettringite formation could trigger initial crack formation thereby actively enhancing concrete degradation depending on the concrete chemistry the formation of iron oxyhydroxides e g lepidocrocite γ feo oh and goethite α feo oh and iron hydrosulfates such as parabutlerite fe so4 oh 2h2o within the deterioration layers are possible grengg et al 2017 jiang et al 2014b the third corrosion stage begins once a ph of 4 is reached as acidophil bacteria are starting to dominate the biofilm with acidithiobacillus thiooxidans being the most common one jiang et al 2016 li et al 2017 okabe et al 2007 satoh et al 2009 while the central role of a thiooxidans is well described little information exists regarding the contribution of other bacterial species especially the impact of acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans a chemoautotrophic asob well known from acid mine drainage environments osorio et al 2013 sugio et al 1992 valdés et al 2008 on corrosion which is often found within strongly deteriorated systems is under debate maeda et al 1999 yamanaka et al 2002 while okabe et al 2007 reported low abundances of the latter ones and consequently low impact on corrosion processes within their sampling campaign other studies emphasized their possible impact under suitable conditions grengg et al 2017 2015 jiang et al 2016 this last stage of micc is associated with massive loss of material as reported by corrosion rates of 10 mm year grengg et al 2015 mori et al 1992 fig 4 during the biotic cycle of micc the appearance and dominance of single sob both nsob and asob is controlled by ph trophic properties and the ability to utilize different sulfur compounds e g h2s s0 s2o3 islander et al 1991 li et al 2017 besides sob heterotrophic bacteria and fungi have been found in biofilms observed in various deteriorated wastewater systems cho and mori 1995 davis et al 1998 peyre lavigne et al 2015a b nica et al 2000 vincke et al 2001 okabe et al 2007 the importance of fungi algae and lichens in colonization of stone and concrete buildings especially under extreme environmental conditions is well documented and they are important in biofilm formation and stabilization flemming et al 2016 if and how heterotrophs contribute to the corrosion process in wastewater systems still remains uncertain however peyre lavigne et al 2015a b outlined the impact of heterotrophs on o2 mass transfer and their capability to produce co2 locally alternatively they could limit the self inhibition of growth of autotrophic bacteria by consumption of organic cell material of the latter both processes would stimulate autotrophic metabolic activities and associated acid production thus representing important aspects regarding the microbial cycle during micc progress scrutinizing of metabolic processes as well as characterization of microbial communities contributing to biofilm structure is required to better understand the biotic stages of micc therefore it is essential to quantify functional capabilities of heterotroph bacteria and fungi especially since the contribution of the latter is still under debate valix and shanmugarajah 2015 detailed knowledge on the metabolic interaction of these microorganisms is crucial to decipher reactions between such biofilms and cementitious materials associated gaps in knowledge have to be bridged by complementary research activities in order to develop sustainable materials and efficient mitigation strategies for micc environments gomez alvarez et al 2012 okabe et al 2007 satoh et al 2009 3 effect of concrete characteristics on micc to date no concrete product exists withstanding the aggressive micc environments over its entire service life but also there is no standard regulation for concrete which recognizes the processes responsible for this specific type of sulfate attack contrarily to the conventional form of sulfate attack where concrete degradation proceeds due to the interaction between sulfate rich fluids and the concrete micc is controlled via the emission and transport of hazardous gases therefore conventional exposition classes defined by critical sulfate acid concentrations within the interacting fluids cannot address the requirements on the other hand researchers have described temperature relative humidity rh h2s and co2 concentrations as the key environmental parameters in micc pomeroy and parkhurst 1977 jensen 2009 jiang et al 2015 nielsen et al 2006 okabe et al 2007 satoh et al 2009 vollertsen et al 2008 however variations in single parameters show relatively small effect on durability of investigated concretes jiang et al 2015 for example observed a corrosion difference of only 10 months for an individually fixed corrosion level surface precipitation of 1gs m2 to be reached between specimens exposed to 50 and 5 ppm h2s the expected service life for concrete based wastewater systems is up to 100 years thus 10 months in durability variation appears insignificantly small in contrast large durability variations are known to exist between different types of concretes subjected to micc alexander et al 2013 de belie et al 2004 girardi et al 2010 goyns and alexander 2014 lors et al 2017 herisson et al 2013 for instance calcium aluminate cements cac with carbonate aggregates have shown to perform up to 6 times more effective than ordinary portland cement opc based concretes within the same aggressive environments goyns and alexander 2014 kiliswa 2016 hence it can be concluded that the specific interaction of microorganism with certain materials rather than different levels of other environmental parameters are steering the degradation rates of concrete based construction materials in wastewater applications accordingly the prevention of the catalytic microbial growth within concrete is crucial for micc mitigation in depth knowledge of the physiochemical concrete parameters and their impact regarding biofilm adhesion biofilm development and microstructure form the basis for future development of suitable concrete technology for sustainable wastewater systems an overview of chemical and physical concrete parameters controlling micc is summarized in fig 5 to date no systematic study exists focusing on the latter subject matter from a combined microbiological and material sciences perspective the impact of certain physicochemical concrete parameters on micc initiation and propagation have been recognized from a material sciences perspective de belie et al 2004 girardi et al 2010 goyns and alexander 2014 herisson et al 2014a 2014b cement concrete chemistry water binder w b ratio or pore size and distribution could be attributed to process relevant aspects such as diffusion rates of h2s and co2 water saturation and acid neutralization capacity and were subsequently assigned to corrosion rates and material sustainability fig 5 especially the pore size distribution and connectivity is central within all types of diffusion based transport processes vincke et al 2002 accordingly new concrete formulations were designed which account for those parameters thereby achieving significant durability improvements herisson et al 2017 peyre lavigne et al 2015a b in this context the application of cac cements has provided significant advantages compared to conventional opc based concretes according to standard regulations e g en 206 1 alexander et al 2008 this is attributed to i cacs higher acid neutralization capacity kiliswa 2016 ii the formation of an aluminum hydroxide gel under acid attack which is stable above ph 4 and decreases porosity and associated ingress of aggressive species and iii possibly antibacteriostatic characteristics due to higher al content herisson et al 2017 2014a valix et al 2014 nevertheless to date a complete inhibition of corrosion could not be achieved one reason for this is that hardly any concrete parameter has been considered for its characteristics regarding biofilm adhesion composition and development for example the impact of total porosity and pore size distribution on diffusion of aggressive species and water saturation capacity has been extensively studied in various applications page and page 2007 at the same time in order to characterize its effect on biofilm development extended research is needed also little is known about the impact of cement chemistry on microbial growth characteristics in this context especially the role of ca for the metabolic cycle of sob is seen as fruitful avenue for future research kierek and watnick 2003 showed the ca2 dependency of biofilm development in seawater containing mainly gram negative proteobacteria accordingly ca could also occupy a key position regarding the metabolism of phylogenetically similar sob additionally the influence of surface conditions like surface roughness and texture controlled by chemical composition of mortar admixtures as well as the type of curing applied on bio adhesion should be investigated in more details in future studies the application of possible surface treatments and sealing methods with focus on applicability in micc environments should be substance of further research to date a variety of organic polymer based sealers are applied to prevent the access of aggressive substances in wastewater networks valix and shanmugarajah 2015 kaempfer and berndt 1998 for instance the patch repair no dig method is widely used for rehabilitation of the concrete pipes where organic polymer binders allow for rapid repair without pipe excavation or shrinkage problems the most widely used water repellent is silane and its derivatives e g silane siloxane while the use of polymer modified mortars and linings could potentially improve the durability of concrete sewer pipes in the latter aggressive environments beeldens et al 2001 its impact and interaction on and with microorganisms and on associated transformation of harmful gaseous species is unknown presumably the application of sealing methods described would potentially contribute towards increased accumulations of toxic and odorous substances e g h2s and vocs in the pipe atmospheres eventually representing a potential harmful source for continuing operations of wastewater networks 4 geopolymer technology for wastewater applications geopolymer concretes gpc possibly have a great potential as a new multi functional material for the wastewater infrastructure pacheco torgal et al 2014 due to their geopolymer characteristics they potentially combine positive properties of vitreous ceramic pipes acid permeability and abrasion resistance with advanced performance of concrete pipes low temperature molding no dig repair any pipe diameter possible while overcoming their individual specific limitations at the same time ceramic brittle small diameters dig renewal higher cost concrete low durability compared to existing concepts for concrete durability based on neutralization by an inevitable dissolution of a sacrificial layer thickness of about 3 10 mm year kiliswa 2016 gpc exhibit high acid resistance davidovits 2015 pacheco torgal et al 2014 provis et al 2015 especially in combination with potential antimicrobial properties see section 5 they may provide a much longer stable barrier against micc while acting as an implicit pipe protection traditional opc cement based materials are formed via the cement hydration reactions to form mainly calcium hydroxide portlandite and calcium silicate hydrates c s h phases whereas gpc is produced by polycondensation of alumino silicates thereby alumina silicate materials calcined clays volcanic rocks blast furnace slag bfs fly ash fa are mixed with an alkaline reagent solutions e g sodium or potassium soluble silicates water and stone aggregates to form a hardened concrete like texture with similar strength properties davidovits 2013 gpc technology avoids the formation of ca rich acid dissolvable hydration products as so far present in all cement based materials as well as in alkali activated ca rich binders thereby exhibiting high acid resistant properties provis and van deventer 2009 geopolymer binders gpb build a three dimensional network of sio4 4 and alo4 5 tetrahedrons linked randomly by sharing oxygen atoms fig 6 thereby the negative charge of the alo4 5 tetrahedron is balanced by additional framework cations na k etc possible chemical and mineralogical reactions of geopolymer binders gpbs compared to different cement based materials in aggressive biotic controlled acidic environments are summarized in table 1 while the chemical resistance of cement based concretes is based on the acid buffer capacity of their constituents and associated dissolution of the cementitious matrix and carbonate aggregates gpb resistance is governed by ion exchange reactions absorption leaching de alumination and zeolite crystallization and permeability table 1 gpbs are considered as analogues of zeolites due to their nano structural similarity but packed in an amorphous microstructure pacheco torgal et al 2014 which enables them to have analogous applications some examples include embodiment of antimicrobial cation additives to sharply reduce bacterial colonization hashimoto et al 2015 as well as for toxic waste immobilization andrejkovicova et al 2016 pacheco torgal et al 2014 although significant research efforts have already been done so far on gpbs there is no record of research evaluating the performance of gpb related to micc environments which considers both the cause and the resulting bio chemical degradation from a combined material and microbiological perspective therefore it should be emphasized here that gpc performance has not yet been proven in micc environments research so far covered only empirical gpc tests on acid resistance gao et al 2013 pacheco torgal et al 2014 in this context acid degradation of gpc depends on the concentration of the acid and can be described as follows fig 6 table 1 1 ion exchange reaction between the penetrating acid protons h and the charge compensating cations na or k of the geopolymer framework škvára et al 2012 ukrainczyk et al 2016 along with 2 dissolution of tetrahedral al from the aluminosilicate framework by breaking of si o al bonds and formation of water as a by product resulting in an increase in solution ph neutralization capacity as well as 3 crystallization of zeolites causing some additional strength loss the framework vacancies formed by al dissolution are mostly re occupied by si resulting in the formation of an imperfect amorphous highly siliceous framework that is relatively hard but brittle such an undissolved corroded layer could effectively inhibit the process of corrosion by acting as a barrier to the transport of acid protons as well as dissolved constituents if the shrinkage cracks due to the leaching of soluble constituents can be minimized thus compared to the neutralization capacity achieved by dissolution of hydration products the permeability of the acidified gpc layers governs the rate of further ingress of acids many studies have demonstrated that geopolymers exhibit better acid attack resistance than portland cement kwasny et al 2016 pacheco torgal et al 2014 provis et al 2015 bakaharev 2005 the low initial permeability of alkali activated slag specimens along with the low ca si ratio typical in ca rich geopolymer binders results in a sound layer of aluminosilicate gel even after decalcification provis et al 2015 lloyd et al 2012 gao et al 2013 investigated acid resistance of metakaolin i e very low calcium based gpb exposed to 0 01m hcl ph 2 for 28 days high content of potassium was leached out exchanged by h but the xrd electron microscopy and mechanical tests showed that the binder network structure remained practically intact still showing excellent binding properties in this context in depth knowledge of gpb solubility is central to evaluate the permeability and acid resistance of gpb based materials however predicting the extent of dissolution reactions of zeolites and even more so of gpb has so far been impeded by insufficient thermodynamic data which could not entirely consider the large variations in si al proportions and h2o and cation contents another aspect controlling the chemical resistance of gpcs in aggressive environments is the intrinsic ordering present within aluminosilicate gel gao et al 2013 pacheco torgal et al 2014 accordingly additional aluminum in metakaolin based geopolymer cements might favor their resistance against acid attack cross linking gel property as well as presumably the biological anergic state the nano structural similarity of gpb with zeolites enables gpb to have analogous applications as a carrier of antimicrobial cations see in detail section 5 particularly due to their cation exchange properties the potential mechanism of metal ions me interaction with gpb is proposed in the following equations 1 si o al o k me si o al o me k 2 si o al o me h si o al o h me the incorporation of me within the geopolymer gp network according to cation exchange reaction equation 1 can be performed in two ways hashimoto et al 2015 pacheco torgal et al 2014 1 during gp synthesis by addition of metal salts during mixing in a fresh state and or 2 impregnation of hardened gp with a solution of metal cations upon acid attack the me will be gradually released according to the cation exchange reaction equation 2 keeping them enclosed minimizing leaching and therefore environmental problems but allowing the interaction with microorganisms another mechanism for metal incorporation in gp structures considers the amphoteric behavior of metals which in alkaline environments creates hydroxide aquocomplexes e g zn oh 4 2 that are potentially strongly covalently incorporated in the geopolymer structure additionally gpc can add to the pressing need for innovative green construction materials which contributes towards a reduction of the co2 footprint associated with cement production gpb raw material production metakaolin mk and water glass cradle to gate co2 embodiment is about 70 davidovits 2015 of opc based binders and 82 of raw material extraction kwasny et al 2016 moreover the mk production requires much less capital investment in plant and equipment than cement production co2 emissions for mk production depend on clay purity and crystallinity calcination and transport to the production site recent developments include optimized k based waterglass for improved workability and efflorescence over na based ones mk substitutions and alternative cost effective waterglass production from reuse of sf silica fume and rha rice husk ash tchakouté et al 2016 partial replacement of mk by reuse of waste materials e g fly ash fa waste fcc catalyst mk from paper sludge waste ash kaolin sludge waste may enable further decrease of gpc co2 embodiment and cost reduction as well as improvement in workability and thus reduction in waterglass requirement while maintaining optimal mechanical properties and durability moreover expected increased durability of gp based products for micc resistant infrastructure or durable repair mortars will lower maintenance cost and result in decreasing overall co2 embodiment for the concrete structure described properties clearly demonstrate the general applicability potential of gpc for wastewater applications additionally the incorporation of antimicrobial agents into the gpc structure could contribute towards further increase in its micc resistance hashimoto et al 2015 nevertheless more research especially regarding gpc biofilm interaction is needed in order to verify gpc long term performance to characterize possible limitations and to validate suitable antimicrobial additives although having a high potential gpc applications are not a common practice yet lack of data on durability performances and standardization makes the field use of gpc difficult provis et al 2015 cation exchange property of geopolymers have also a negative effect e g alkalies leach out from geopolymer materials and form alkali carbonates and alkali sulfides in micc environments on the concrete surface known as efflorescence škvára et al 2012 pacheco torgal et al 2014 the leaching of alkalis is also lowering the ph inside the geopolymer eventually posing threats to initiate corrosion of steel reinforcement alkali hydroxide solutions and soluble silicate solutions with sio2 na2o molar ratios smaller than 1 45 are considered hazardous which limits the field application of geopolymer mixes using such solutions as the superplasticizer concept for cement dispersion and reducing water content in mix designs does not work on geopolymers new design strategies are needed to lower the amounts of activator solutions as well as water content for producing denser microstructures without impairing fresh concrete rheological properties the guarantee for no alkali silica reaction degradation requires again a low calcium content pacheco torgal et al 2014 shrinkage and creep of geopolymer materials is yet particularly under explored but an important topic to be studied as well 5 antimicrobial agents the successful use of antimicrobial agents has been documented in various applications ranging from environmental studies investigating the tolerance of heavy metals on fe iii reducing microbial communities in soils burkhardt et al 2011 to the antimicrobial function of copper coatings in the public sectors wei et al 2014 within recent years antimicrobial additives have also been increasingly used in conventional concretes vincke et al 2001 for instance alum et al 2008 studied different antimicrobial formulations containing fa silica fume sf zno cu slag ammonium and bromide they demonstrated by field and laboratory tests that concrete mixtures containing 10 zno had comparable antimicrobial properties similar to commercial biocides accordingly bacteriostatic characteristics of heavy metal ions could provide novel sustainable and economic answers to many aspects of biodeterioration but especially for micc environments gu et al 2011 a summary of the relevant studies on the effects of potential antimicrobial agents in micc relevant settings is presented in table 2 the toxic effect of heavy metal ions me on bacteria is based on me reactions with the negatively charged cell walls of bacteria and associated formation of complex compounds within the bacterial membrane these reactions are suggested to inhibit life essential activity of sensitive enzymes as well as to disturb the osmotic stability of the cell resulting in the leakage of intracellular constituents nies 1999 the inhibitory efficiency and applicability of me on microbial growth in micc environments is based on their solubility and or ion exchange function under acid attack conditions their affinity to sulfur their interaction with microbiological populations as well as on their geochemical abundances nies 1999 therefore the range of me possibly eligible as antimicrobial agents for wastewater networks can be limited to al fe mo mn zn ni cu v co w and cr since fe and mn are always present in significant concentrations within concrete admixtures they are not seen as decisive for achieving the desired bacteriostatic effects contrarily higher fe concentration could be positively correlated to bacterial activity of a ferrooxidans and associated acid production grengg et al 2017 2015 maeda et al 1999 diverse studies have already demonstrated the bacteriostatic effects of different heavy metal ions described on the growth of relevant sobs in various environments ezaka and anyanwu 2011 navarro et al 2013 orell et al 2013 table 2 for instance navarro et al 2013 determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of cu as zn cd and ni for different strains of acidophilic bacteria associated with a certain relevance regarding biomining including two strains of a caldus and a ferrooxidans at the same time orell et al 2013 investigated the tolerance of thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon used in high temperature bioleaching processes regarding cd and cu concentrations negishi et al 2005 were able to inhibit the growth of five strains of sob including a thiooxidans completely by the addition of 50 μm of sodium tungstate to the nutrient solution in the process tungsten was bound to the cell structure thereby inhibiting the activity of the sulfur oxidase of the bacteria and co depending cell growth in a further step 0 075 wt calcium tungstate was added to portland cement bars and outsourced to a wastewater system with mean h2s concentrations of 28 ppm significant decrease in weight loss for the calcium tungstate bearing mortars could be observed demonstrating the inhibitory effect of w on the growth of sobs present at the same time a bacteriostatic impact of al on microbial growth is proposed as one of the reasons for higher durability of cac based materials observed in micc environments herisson et al 2017 2013 alternatively the application of zeolites exchanged with me could provide a promising substitute for concretes suitable for aggressive wastewater systems inoue et al 2002 kaali et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 kaali et al 2011 investigated the influence of ag zn2 and cu2 exchanged zeolite on antimicrobial and long term in vitro stability of medical grade polyether polyurethane finding that the binary cu zn system had the same bacteriostatic efficiency as the single silver systems the synergetic effect was explained by different toxic mechanisms within the cell initiated by the individual metal cation accordingly they concluded that zeolites exchanged with metal cations exhibit a high potential technology to enhance antimicrobial properties of materials alternatively hashimoto et al 2015 have shown that the antimicrobial activity of metakaolin gp s against fungi hyphae could be significantly increased by the incorporation of copper ions into the gp structure due to immersing the latter in a 0 1 m copper chloride solution for 24 h in both contexts the antimicrobial mechanism of metal cation loaded zeolites is based on cation exchange reactions during which the inorganic molecular sieves trap the antibacterial metals keeping them enclosed and thus minimizing leaching and associated environmental problems but allowing the interaction with microorganisms as explained in detail within the section on geopolymers the above mentioned studies indicate the enormous potential of heavy metal ions as anti microbial agents in materials suited for aggressive wastewater environments however since the me resistance of acidophilic bacteria is generally magnitudes higher than those of neutrophilic bacteria the most promising approach should focus on the inhibition of nsob dopson et al 2003 since the nsob are mainly responsible for the ph reduction from 9 5 to around 4 during micc propagation a discontinuity of the succession of nsob must inevitable constrain the growth of asob in this regard additional research has to focus on advanced knowledge on the dynamically changing microbial community structure in micc environments in order to quantify the possible impact of antimicrobial agents during different corrosion stages additionally the potential impact of me addition on structural and mechanical concrete properties together with their environmental compatibility has to be considered 6 conclusions and outlook microbial induced concrete corrosion represents one of the main degradation mechanisms of subsurface infrastructure thereby raising high economic expenses as well as severe health related concerns while the overall process mechanisms and environmental parameters responsible for micc are fairly well understood to date no commercially available concrete can satisfactorily withstand the adverse conditions in such aggressive environments over its projected operating life as long as concrete surface conditions support microbial growth biogenic acid production will be initiated which is accompanied by subsequent autocatalytic intensification and degradation of cement based construction materials accordingly further research should focus on how to constrain concrete microorganism interactions on one hand physical and chemical concrete parameters have to be characterized in details regarding their impact on microbial growth on the other hand a better understanding of the microbial ecology supporting micc must be attained including metabolic process reactions a holistic characterization of the microbial communities involved biofilm structure and distribution as well as the functional capabilities of heterotrophs and fungi involved in this context geopolymer technology could represent promising construction materials suitable for micc environments due to properties such as low permeability caused by its fine pore structure cation exchange properties and chemical stability at low ph due to a lack of highly soluble ca hydration products as so far present in all cement based materials

19687,microbial induced concrete corrosion micc is recognized as one of the main degradation mechanisms of subsurface infrastructure worldwide raising the demand for sustainable construction materials in corrosive environments this review aims to summarize the key research progress acquired during the last decade regarding the understanding of micc reaction mechanisms and the development of durable materials from an interdisciplinary perspective special focus was laid on aspects governing concrete micoorganisms interaction since being the central process steering biogenic acid corrosion the insufficient knowledge regarding the latter is proposed as a central reason for insufficient progress in tailored material development for aggressive wastewater systems to date no cement based material exists suitable to withstand the aggressive conditions related to micc over its entire service life research is in particular needed on the impact of physiochemical material parameters on microbial community structure growth characteristics and limitations within individual concrete speciation herein an interdisciplinary approach is presented by combining results from material sciences microbiology mineralogy and hydrochemistry to stimulate the development of novel and sustainable materials and mitigation strategies for micc for instance the application of antibacteriostatic agents is introduced as an effective instrument to limit microbial growth on concrete surfaces in aggressive sewer environments additionally geopolymer concretes are introduced as highly resistent in acid environments thus representing a possible green alternative to conventional cement based construction materials graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainable construction microbiological corrosion

infectious diseases and the contamination of drinking water hvitved jacobsen et al 2002 microbial induced concrete corrosion micc has been recognized as one of the main processes for degradation of concrete based wastewater networks worldwide increasingly triggering high economic expenses as well as severe health and environmental concerns herisson et al 2017 islander et al 1991 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2017 o connell et al 2010 peyre lavigne et al 2016 typical damages of concrete elements from different sewer systems caused by micc are shown in fig 1 annual rehabilitation costs were estimated to reach over 450 million in germany berger et al 2016 and 85 million in the uk while the usa needs to spend around 390 billion within the next 20 years in order to keep the existing wastewater infrastructure operational gutiérrez padilla et al 2010 additionally hazardous gas production of mainly hydrogen sulfide h2s and carbon dioxide co2 but also methane ch4 ammonia nh3 and other volatile organic compounds vocs associated with micc represent a severe health risk for community workers and wastewater system operators gutierrez et al 2014 2008 world health organisation 2000 micc is a complex process to efficiently study micc an interdisciplinary approach that brings together the fields of civil and chemical engineering material scientists microbiology mineralogy hydro geo chemistry as well as environmental sciences is desired intensive research within segregate research areas has produced a wide spectrum of data and hypothesis to further promote the emergance of innovations for sustainable building material design in wastewater infrastructure efficient cooperation between scientist from the before mentioned areas is required while the fundamental corrosion processes have been intensly investigated islander et al 1991 jiang et al 2014a ling et al 2015 to date no sustainable product is available which meets the long term requirements in such extremely aggressive and corrosive sewer environments extensive laboratory research and in situ testing have shown that significant durability variations exist between different types of concrete subjected to micc nevertheless none of the so far tested materials can entirely resist this biogenic acid attack all materials failed to reach their projected operating life time alexander et al 2013 de belie et al 2004 girardi et al 2010 goyns and alexander 2014 herisson et al 2013 reasons for this failure may originate from insufficient knowledge on the initial processes leading to microbial colonization of construction materials in heterogenous wastewater environments while li et al 2017 have recently summarized the existing knowledge on microbial community structures of acidophilic bacteria associated with micc little is known about initial microbial colonization of concrete structures in sewer systems moreover it is lagerly unknown how biofilms develop which organisms typically compose these communities how dynamic they are over time and how they interact with the applied concretes vise versa the role of specific physical and chemical concrete properties on microbial growth subsequent corrosion initiation and propagation still needs further research a general description of biofilm characteristics together with the central physiochemical aspects of concrete are described in fig 2 to gain a better overview on the multifacetted phenomenona of micc this review aims to compile the key research findings in the field of micc during the last decade from an interdisciplinary perspective intertwining advances in concrete materials with microbiological and hydro geo chemical related aspects this contribution emphasizes the central role of specific physical and chemical concrete properties on micc initiation and propagation allowing adhesion of microbial cells microbial growth and subsequent biofilm development these properties are likely key factors for micc and are central for further research advances and the development of durable materials moreover we summarize potential additives such as antimicrobial agents applicable in micc environments in addition possible advantages of geopolymer concretes being cement free alternatives compared to conventional cement based building materials such as portland cement opc and calcium aluminate cement cac based concretes are discussed due to their acid resistance pacheco torgal et al 2014 innovative geopolymer technology could represent a significant step towards the development of sustainable materials for micc endangered environments 2 characteristics of wastewater environments inducing micc micc can be described as a sequence of biogenic controlled sulfate reduction and re oxidation initial sulfide production occurs within the sludge and sediment layers deposited along the inner surfaces of the piping system favoring corners and turns areas with long retention times of the wastewater and low abrasive forces with decreasing oxygen and nitrate concentrations due to ongoing fermentation processes dissimilatory sulfate respiration is initiated by different strains of sulfate reducing bacteria srb e g desulfovibrio and desulfomaculum barton and fauque 2009 fig 3 accordingly sulfides are formed as a side product of anaerobic oxidation of organic carbon whereas sulfate is used as an external electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen and nitrate jensen 2009 jensen et al 2011 the concentration and chemical speciation of the produced sulfides is controlled by i temperature ii ph of the wastewater iii concentration of oxidized sulfur compounds in the wastewater iv the biodegradability and composition of the organic matter present e g complex or small organic molecules and v the multiphase i e gas liquid and solid flow characteristics and retention times of the wastewater hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 2002 gaseous hydrogen sulfide h2s is formed together with carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and other vocs and is partly degassing into the atmosphere of the wastewater piping system wastewater treatment plants and or pumping stations the liberation of those volatile components is governed by changes in the surrounding gas pressure ph temperature and wastewater turbulences intensified gas liberation is favored by transition chutes after power mains and gravity wastewater system sections with turns and hydraulic drops grengg et al 2016 2015 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 hvitved jacobsen and vollertsen 2005 via gaseous diffusion h2s and co2 dissolve and accumulate in the moist pore space of the concrete yuan et al 2015 islander at al 1991 first summarized the fundamental processes within the aerobic sequence of micc proposing a 3 step corrosion model fig 4 since concrete is an initially strongly alkaline porous and multiphase material with an initial pore solution of around ph 13 alexander et al 2013 vollpracht et al 2015 the first stage of corrosion is dominated by abiotic acid base reactions thereby the ph reduction of concrete occurs due to carbonation and simultaneous attack of thiosulfuric and polythionic acids produced by chemical oxidation of h2s roberts et al 2002 described ph reduction is potentially controlled by physiochemical material properties steering abiotic oxidation of reduced sulfur species and associated precipitation of the latter oxidation products formed such as elemental sulfur s0 or thiosulfate s2o3 provide the energy source for successive biotic acid production within the latter stages of corrosion grandclerc et al 2017 sun et al 2013 to what extend microbial activity contributes towards the initial ph neutralization of concrete is still under debate commonly it is considered that due to strongly alkaline conditions present in concrete the microbial occurrence within this stage is limited joseph et al 2012 nevertheless okabe et al 2007 reported four times higher ph declining rates on the surface of concrete specimen than calculated considering purely chemical neutralization reactions such a strong ph reduction was consequently related to diverse bacterial species mainly heterotrophic halotolerant and neutrophilic found on the concretes surface generally no loss of material occurs during this first stage but similar to conventional sulfate attack the diffusion of sulfate rich pore fluids is triggering initial leaching of calcium rich hydroxides and isochronal precipitation of expansive sulfate salts such as gypsum gp or ettringite ett especially within the cement rich interfacial transition zones close to the aggregates associated increase in pore pressure results in structural destabilization and crack formation grengg et al 2015 jiang et al 2014b mittermayr et al 2015 scrivener et al 2004 the transition to the second stage of corrosion is marked by the colonization of various strains of neutrophilic sulfur oxidizing bacteria nsob which adopt the moist concrete surface and pore structure at ph around 9 to 9 5 islander et al 1991 joseph et al 2012 satoh et al 2009 vincke et al 2000 a succession of at least 4 phylotypes of nsob with decreasing ph is reported fig 4 nsob possess the ability to utilize different sulfur compounds to form sulfuric acid h2so4 under moist conditions gomez alvarez et al 2012 okabe et al 2007 continued bacterial activity associated with biogenic h2so4 production and corresponding acidification is causing dissolution of the cementitious matrix and if present carbonatic aggregates together with neo formation of sulfate salts and consequent mass loss of material the newly formed mineral phases precipitating from strongly oversaturated interstitial concrete pore solutions are dominated by expansive gypsum bassanite bas and anhydrite anh grengg et al 2015 jiang et al 2014b the formation of secondary ettringite and associated internal cracking as reported in conventional sulfate attack on concrete is unlikely within the surface near low ph areas due to its instability below ph 10 7 gabrisova et al 1991 mittermayr et al 2015 additionally concrete standard regulations e g en 206 1 stipulate tri calcium aluminate c3a free opc cement for concretes used in such aggressive environments thereby limiting the aluminum source central for ettringite formation nevertheless ettringite appearance is reported in various studies jiang et al 2015 peyre lavigne et al 2016 2015a b presumably secondary ettringite could form within the transition zone between non corroded and strongly affected concrete layers where alkaline conditions still dominate but sulfate rich pore fluids are already present there ettringite formation could trigger initial crack formation thereby actively enhancing concrete degradation depending on the concrete chemistry the formation of iron oxyhydroxides e g lepidocrocite γ feo oh and goethite α feo oh and iron hydrosulfates such as parabutlerite fe so4 oh 2h2o within the deterioration layers are possible grengg et al 2017 jiang et al 2014b the third corrosion stage begins once a ph of 4 is reached as acidophil bacteria are starting to dominate the biofilm with acidithiobacillus thiooxidans being the most common one jiang et al 2016 li et al 2017 okabe et al 2007 satoh et al 2009 while the central role of a thiooxidans is well described little information exists regarding the contribution of other bacterial species especially the impact of acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans a chemoautotrophic asob well known from acid mine drainage environments osorio et al 2013 sugio et al 1992 valdés et al 2008 on corrosion which is often found within strongly deteriorated systems is under debate maeda et al 1999 yamanaka et al 2002 while okabe et al 2007 reported low abundances of the latter ones and consequently low impact on corrosion processes within their sampling campaign other studies emphasized their possible impact under suitable conditions grengg et al 2017 2015 jiang et al 2016 this last stage of micc is associated with massive loss of material as reported by corrosion rates of 10 mm year grengg et al 2015 mori et al 1992 fig 4 during the biotic cycle of micc the appearance and dominance of single sob both nsob and asob is controlled by ph trophic properties and the ability to utilize different sulfur compounds e g h2s s0 s2o3 islander et al 1991 li et al 2017 besides sob heterotrophic bacteria and fungi have been found in biofilms observed in various deteriorated wastewater systems cho and mori 1995 davis et al 1998 peyre lavigne et al 2015a b nica et al 2000 vincke et al 2001 okabe et al 2007 the importance of fungi algae and lichens in colonization of stone and concrete buildings especially under extreme environmental conditions is well documented and they are important in biofilm formation and stabilization flemming et al 2016 if and how heterotrophs contribute to the corrosion process in wastewater systems still remains uncertain however peyre lavigne et al 2015a b outlined the impact of heterotrophs on o2 mass transfer and their capability to produce co2 locally alternatively they could limit the self inhibition of growth of autotrophic bacteria by consumption of organic cell material of the latter both processes would stimulate autotrophic metabolic activities and associated acid production thus representing important aspects regarding the microbial cycle during micc progress scrutinizing of metabolic processes as well as characterization of microbial communities contributing to biofilm structure is required to better understand the biotic stages of micc therefore it is essential to quantify functional capabilities of heterotroph bacteria and fungi especially since the contribution of the latter is still under debate valix and shanmugarajah 2015 detailed knowledge on the metabolic interaction of these microorganisms is crucial to decipher reactions between such biofilms and cementitious materials associated gaps in knowledge have to be bridged by complementary research activities in order to develop sustainable materials and efficient mitigation strategies for micc environments gomez alvarez et al 2012 okabe et al 2007 satoh et al 2009 3 effect of concrete characteristics on micc to date no concrete product exists withstanding the aggressive micc environments over its entire service life but also there is no standard regulation for concrete which recognizes the processes responsible for this specific type of sulfate attack contrarily to the conventional form of sulfate attack where concrete degradation proceeds due to the interaction between sulfate rich fluids and the concrete micc is controlled via the emission and transport of hazardous gases therefore conventional exposition classes defined by critical sulfate acid concentrations within the interacting fluids cannot address the requirements on the other hand researchers have described temperature relative humidity rh h2s and co2 concentrations as the key environmental parameters in micc pomeroy and parkhurst 1977 jensen 2009 jiang et al 2015 nielsen et al 2006 okabe et al 2007 satoh et al 2009 vollertsen et al 2008 however variations in single parameters show relatively small effect on durability of investigated concretes jiang et al 2015 for example observed a corrosion difference of only 10 months for an individually fixed corrosion level surface precipitation of 1gs m2 to be reached between specimens exposed to 50 and 5 ppm h2s the expected service life for concrete based wastewater systems is up to 100 years thus 10 months in durability variation appears insignificantly small in contrast large durability variations are known to exist between different types of concretes subjected to micc alexander et al 2013 de belie et al 2004 girardi et al 2010 goyns and alexander 2014 lors et al 2017 herisson et al 2013 for instance calcium aluminate cements cac with carbonate aggregates have shown to perform up to 6 times more effective than ordinary portland cement opc based concretes within the same aggressive environments goyns and alexander 2014 kiliswa 2016 hence it can be concluded that the specific interaction of microorganism with certain materials rather than different levels of other environmental parameters are steering the degradation rates of concrete based construction materials in wastewater applications accordingly the prevention of the catalytic microbial growth within concrete is crucial for micc mitigation in depth knowledge of the physiochemical concrete parameters and their impact regarding biofilm adhesion biofilm development and microstructure form the basis for future development of suitable concrete technology for sustainable wastewater systems an overview of chemical and physical concrete parameters controlling micc is summarized in fig 5 to date no systematic study exists focusing on the latter subject matter from a combined microbiological and material sciences perspective the impact of certain physicochemical concrete parameters on micc initiation and propagation have been recognized from a material sciences perspective de belie et al 2004 girardi et al 2010 goyns and alexander 2014 herisson et al 2014a 2014b cement concrete chemistry water binder w b ratio or pore size and distribution could be attributed to process relevant aspects such as diffusion rates of h2s and co2 water saturation and acid neutralization capacity and were subsequently assigned to corrosion rates and material sustainability fig 5 especially the pore size distribution and connectivity is central within all types of diffusion based transport processes vincke et al 2002 accordingly new concrete formulations were designed which account for those parameters thereby achieving significant durability improvements herisson et al 2017 peyre lavigne et al 2015a b in this context the application of cac cements has provided significant advantages compared to conventional opc based concretes according to standard regulations e g en 206 1 alexander et al 2008 this is attributed to i cacs higher acid neutralization capacity kiliswa 2016 ii the formation of an aluminum hydroxide gel under acid attack which is stable above ph 4 and decreases porosity and associated ingress of aggressive species and iii possibly antibacteriostatic characteristics due to higher al content herisson et al 2017 2014a valix et al 2014 nevertheless to date a complete inhibition of corrosion could not be achieved one reason for this is that hardly any concrete parameter has been considered for its characteristics regarding biofilm adhesion composition and development for example the impact of total porosity and pore size distribution on diffusion of aggressive species and water saturation capacity has been extensively studied in various applications page and page 2007 at the same time in order to characterize its effect on biofilm development extended research is needed also little is known about the impact of cement chemistry on microbial growth characteristics in this context especially the role of ca for the metabolic cycle of sob is seen as fruitful avenue for future research kierek and watnick 2003 showed the ca2 dependency of biofilm development in seawater containing mainly gram negative proteobacteria accordingly ca could also occupy a key position regarding the metabolism of phylogenetically similar sob additionally the influence of surface conditions like surface roughness and texture controlled by chemical composition of mortar admixtures as well as the type of curing applied on bio adhesion should be investigated in more details in future studies the application of possible surface treatments and sealing methods with focus on applicability in micc environments should be substance of further research to date a variety of organic polymer based sealers are applied to prevent the access of aggressive substances in wastewater networks valix and shanmugarajah 2015 kaempfer and berndt 1998 for instance the patch repair no dig method is widely used for rehabilitation of the concrete pipes where organic polymer binders allow for rapid repair without pipe excavation or shrinkage problems the most widely used water repellent is silane and its derivatives e g silane siloxane while the use of polymer modified mortars and linings could potentially improve the durability of concrete sewer pipes in the latter aggressive environments beeldens et al 2001 its impact and interaction on and with microorganisms and on associated transformation of harmful gaseous species is unknown presumably the application of sealing methods described would potentially contribute towards increased accumulations of toxic and odorous substances e g h2s and vocs in the pipe atmospheres eventually representing a potential harmful source for continuing operations of wastewater networks 4 geopolymer technology for wastewater applications geopolymer concretes gpc possibly have a great potential as a new multi functional material for the wastewater infrastructure pacheco torgal et al 2014 due to their geopolymer characteristics they potentially combine positive properties of vitreous ceramic pipes acid permeability and abrasion resistance with advanced performance of concrete pipes low temperature molding no dig repair any pipe diameter possible while overcoming their individual specific limitations at the same time ceramic brittle small diameters dig renewal higher cost concrete low durability compared to existing concepts for concrete durability based on neutralization by an inevitable dissolution of a sacrificial layer thickness of about 3 10 mm year kiliswa 2016 gpc exhibit high acid resistance davidovits 2015 pacheco torgal et al 2014 provis et al 2015 especially in combination with potential antimicrobial properties see section 5 they may provide a much longer stable barrier against micc while acting as an implicit pipe protection traditional opc cement based materials are formed via the cement hydration reactions to form mainly calcium hydroxide portlandite and calcium silicate hydrates c s h phases whereas gpc is produced by polycondensation of alumino silicates thereby alumina silicate materials calcined clays volcanic rocks blast furnace slag bfs fly ash fa are mixed with an alkaline reagent solutions e g sodium or potassium soluble silicates water and stone aggregates to form a hardened concrete like texture with similar strength properties davidovits 2013 gpc technology avoids the formation of ca rich acid dissolvable hydration products as so far present in all cement based materials as well as in alkali activated ca rich binders thereby exhibiting high acid resistant properties provis and van deventer 2009 geopolymer binders gpb build a three dimensional network of sio4 4 and alo4 5 tetrahedrons linked randomly by sharing oxygen atoms fig 6 thereby the negative charge of the alo4 5 tetrahedron is balanced by additional framework cations na k etc possible chemical and mineralogical reactions of geopolymer binders gpbs compared to different cement based materials in aggressive biotic controlled acidic environments are summarized in table 1 while the chemical resistance of cement based concretes is based on the acid buffer capacity of their constituents and associated dissolution of the cementitious matrix and carbonate aggregates gpb resistance is governed by ion exchange reactions absorption leaching de alumination and zeolite crystallization and permeability table 1 gpbs are considered as analogues of zeolites due to their nano structural similarity but packed in an amorphous microstructure pacheco torgal et al 2014 which enables them to have analogous applications some examples include embodiment of antimicrobial cation additives to sharply reduce bacterial colonization hashimoto et al 2015 as well as for toxic waste immobilization andrejkovicova et al 2016 pacheco torgal et al 2014 although significant research efforts have already been done so far on gpbs there is no record of research evaluating the performance of gpb related to micc environments which considers both the cause and the resulting bio chemical degradation from a combined material and microbiological perspective therefore it should be emphasized here that gpc performance has not yet been proven in micc environments research so far covered only empirical gpc tests on acid resistance gao et al 2013 pacheco torgal et al 2014 in this context acid degradation of gpc depends on the concentration of the acid and can be described as follows fig 6 table 1 1 ion exchange reaction between the penetrating acid protons h and the charge compensating cations na or k of the geopolymer framework škvára et al 2012 ukrainczyk et al 2016 along with 2 dissolution of tetrahedral al from the aluminosilicate framework by breaking of si o al bonds and formation of water as a by product resulting in an increase in solution ph neutralization capacity as well as 3 crystallization of zeolites causing some additional strength loss the framework vacancies formed by al dissolution are mostly re occupied by si resulting in the formation of an imperfect amorphous highly siliceous framework that is relatively hard but brittle such an undissolved corroded layer could effectively inhibit the process of corrosion by acting as a barrier to the transport of acid protons as well as dissolved constituents if the shrinkage cracks due to the leaching of soluble constituents can be minimized thus compared to the neutralization capacity achieved by dissolution of hydration products the permeability of the acidified gpc layers governs the rate of further ingress of acids many studies have demonstrated that geopolymers exhibit better acid attack resistance than portland cement kwasny et al 2016 pacheco torgal et al 2014 provis et al 2015 bakaharev 2005 the low initial permeability of alkali activated slag specimens along with the low ca si ratio typical in ca rich geopolymer binders results in a sound layer of aluminosilicate gel even after decalcification provis et al 2015 lloyd et al 2012 gao et al 2013 investigated acid resistance of metakaolin i e very low calcium based gpb exposed to 0 01m hcl ph 2 for 28 days high content of potassium was leached out exchanged by h but the xrd electron microscopy and mechanical tests showed that the binder network structure remained practically intact still showing excellent binding properties in this context in depth knowledge of gpb solubility is central to evaluate the permeability and acid resistance of gpb based materials however predicting the extent of dissolution reactions of zeolites and even more so of gpb has so far been impeded by insufficient thermodynamic data which could not entirely consider the large variations in si al proportions and h2o and cation contents another aspect controlling the chemical resistance of gpcs in aggressive environments is the intrinsic ordering present within aluminosilicate gel gao et al 2013 pacheco torgal et al 2014 accordingly additional aluminum in metakaolin based geopolymer cements might favor their resistance against acid attack cross linking gel property as well as presumably the biological anergic state the nano structural similarity of gpb with zeolites enables gpb to have analogous applications as a carrier of antimicrobial cations see in detail section 5 particularly due to their cation exchange properties the potential mechanism of metal ions me interaction with gpb is proposed in the following equations 1 si o al o k me si o al o me k 2 si o al o me h si o al o h me the incorporation of me within the geopolymer gp network according to cation exchange reaction equation 1 can be performed in two ways hashimoto et al 2015 pacheco torgal et al 2014 1 during gp synthesis by addition of metal salts during mixing in a fresh state and or 2 impregnation of hardened gp with a solution of metal cations upon acid attack the me will be gradually released according to the cation exchange reaction equation 2 keeping them enclosed minimizing leaching and therefore environmental problems but allowing the interaction with microorganisms another mechanism for metal incorporation in gp structures considers the amphoteric behavior of metals which in alkaline environments creates hydroxide aquocomplexes e g zn oh 4 2 that are potentially strongly covalently incorporated in the geopolymer structure additionally gpc can add to the pressing need for innovative green construction materials which contributes towards a reduction of the co2 footprint associated with cement production gpb raw material production metakaolin mk and water glass cradle to gate co2 embodiment is about 70 davidovits 2015 of opc based binders and 82 of raw material extraction kwasny et al 2016 moreover the mk production requires much less capital investment in plant and equipment than cement production co2 emissions for mk production depend on clay purity and crystallinity calcination and transport to the production site recent developments include optimized k based waterglass for improved workability and efflorescence over na based ones mk substitutions and alternative cost effective waterglass production from reuse of sf silica fume and rha rice husk ash tchakouté et al 2016 partial replacement of mk by reuse of waste materials e g fly ash fa waste fcc catalyst mk from paper sludge waste ash kaolin sludge waste may enable further decrease of gpc co2 embodiment and cost reduction as well as improvement in workability and thus reduction in waterglass requirement while maintaining optimal mechanical properties and durability moreover expected increased durability of gp based products for micc resistant infrastructure or durable repair mortars will lower maintenance cost and result in decreasing overall co2 embodiment for the concrete structure described properties clearly demonstrate the general applicability potential of gpc for wastewater applications additionally the incorporation of antimicrobial agents into the gpc structure could contribute towards further increase in its micc resistance hashimoto et al 2015 nevertheless more research especially regarding gpc biofilm interaction is needed in order to verify gpc long term performance to characterize possible limitations and to validate suitable antimicrobial additives although having a high potential gpc applications are not a common practice yet lack of data on durability performances and standardization makes the field use of gpc difficult provis et al 2015 cation exchange property of geopolymers have also a negative effect e g alkalies leach out from geopolymer materials and form alkali carbonates and alkali sulfides in micc environments on the concrete surface known as efflorescence škvára et al 2012 pacheco torgal et al 2014 the leaching of alkalis is also lowering the ph inside the geopolymer eventually posing threats to initiate corrosion of steel reinforcement alkali hydroxide solutions and soluble silicate solutions with sio2 na2o molar ratios smaller than 1 45 are considered hazardous which limits the field application of geopolymer mixes using such solutions as the superplasticizer concept for cement dispersion and reducing water content in mix designs does not work on geopolymers new design strategies are needed to lower the amounts of activator solutions as well as water content for producing denser microstructures without impairing fresh concrete rheological properties the guarantee for no alkali silica reaction degradation requires again a low calcium content pacheco torgal et al 2014 shrinkage and creep of geopolymer materials is yet particularly under explored but an important topic to be studied as well 5 antimicrobial agents the successful use of antimicrobial agents has been documented in various applications ranging from environmental studies investigating the tolerance of heavy metals on fe iii reducing microbial communities in soils burkhardt et al 2011 to the antimicrobial function of copper coatings in the public sectors wei et al 2014 within recent years antimicrobial additives have also been increasingly used in conventional concretes vincke et al 2001 for instance alum et al 2008 studied different antimicrobial formulations containing fa silica fume sf zno cu slag ammonium and bromide they demonstrated by field and laboratory tests that concrete mixtures containing 10 zno had comparable antimicrobial properties similar to commercial biocides accordingly bacteriostatic characteristics of heavy metal ions could provide novel sustainable and economic answers to many aspects of biodeterioration but especially for micc environments gu et al 2011 a summary of the relevant studies on the effects of potential antimicrobial agents in micc relevant settings is presented in table 2 the toxic effect of heavy metal ions me on bacteria is based on me reactions with the negatively charged cell walls of bacteria and associated formation of complex compounds within the bacterial membrane these reactions are suggested to inhibit life essential activity of sensitive enzymes as well as to disturb the osmotic stability of the cell resulting in the leakage of intracellular constituents nies 1999 the inhibitory efficiency and applicability of me on microbial growth in micc environments is based on their solubility and or ion exchange function under acid attack conditions their affinity to sulfur their interaction with microbiological populations as well as on their geochemical abundances nies 1999 therefore the range of me possibly eligible as antimicrobial agents for wastewater networks can be limited to al fe mo mn zn ni cu v co w and cr since fe and mn are always present in significant concentrations within concrete admixtures they are not seen as decisive for achieving the desired bacteriostatic effects contrarily higher fe concentration could be positively correlated to bacterial activity of a ferrooxidans and associated acid production grengg et al 2017 2015 maeda et al 1999 diverse studies have already demonstrated the bacteriostatic effects of different heavy metal ions described on the growth of relevant sobs in various environments ezaka and anyanwu 2011 navarro et al 2013 orell et al 2013 table 2 for instance navarro et al 2013 determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of cu as zn cd and ni for different strains of acidophilic bacteria associated with a certain relevance regarding biomining including two strains of a caldus and a ferrooxidans at the same time orell et al 2013 investigated the tolerance of thermoacidophilic crenarchaeon used in high temperature bioleaching processes regarding cd and cu concentrations negishi et al 2005 were able to inhibit the growth of five strains of sob including a thiooxidans completely by the addition of 50 μm of sodium tungstate to the nutrient solution in the process tungsten was bound to the cell structure thereby inhibiting the activity of the sulfur oxidase of the bacteria and co depending cell growth in a further step 0 075 wt calcium tungstate was added to portland cement bars and outsourced to a wastewater system with mean h2s concentrations of 28 ppm significant decrease in weight loss for the calcium tungstate bearing mortars could be observed demonstrating the inhibitory effect of w on the growth of sobs present at the same time a bacteriostatic impact of al on microbial growth is proposed as one of the reasons for higher durability of cac based materials observed in micc environments herisson et al 2017 2013 alternatively the application of zeolites exchanged with me could provide a promising substitute for concretes suitable for aggressive wastewater systems inoue et al 2002 kaali et al 2011 zhang et al 2009 kaali et al 2011 investigated the influence of ag zn2 and cu2 exchanged zeolite on antimicrobial and long term in vitro stability of medical grade polyether polyurethane finding that the binary cu zn system had the same bacteriostatic efficiency as the single silver systems the synergetic effect was explained by different toxic mechanisms within the cell initiated by the individual metal cation accordingly they concluded that zeolites exchanged with metal cations exhibit a high potential technology to enhance antimicrobial properties of materials alternatively hashimoto et al 2015 have shown that the antimicrobial activity of metakaolin gp s against fungi hyphae could be significantly increased by the incorporation of copper ions into the gp structure due to immersing the latter in a 0 1 m copper chloride solution for 24 h in both contexts the antimicrobial mechanism of metal cation loaded zeolites is based on cation exchange reactions during which the inorganic molecular sieves trap the antibacterial metals keeping them enclosed and thus minimizing leaching and associated environmental problems but allowing the interaction with microorganisms as explained in detail within the section on geopolymers the above mentioned studies indicate the enormous potential of heavy metal ions as anti microbial agents in materials suited for aggressive wastewater environments however since the me resistance of acidophilic bacteria is generally magnitudes higher than those of neutrophilic bacteria the most promising approach should focus on the inhibition of nsob dopson et al 2003 since the nsob are mainly responsible for the ph reduction from 9 5 to around 4 during micc propagation a discontinuity of the succession of nsob must inevitable constrain the growth of asob in this regard additional research has to focus on advanced knowledge on the dynamically changing microbial community structure in micc environments in order to quantify the possible impact of antimicrobial agents during different corrosion stages additionally the potential impact of me addition on structural and mechanical concrete properties together with their environmental compatibility has to be considered 6 conclusions and outlook microbial induced concrete corrosion represents one of the main degradation mechanisms of subsurface infrastructure thereby raising high economic expenses as well as severe health related concerns while the overall process mechanisms and environmental parameters responsible for micc are fairly well understood to date no commercially available concrete can satisfactorily withstand the adverse conditions in such aggressive environments over its projected operating life as long as concrete surface conditions support microbial growth biogenic acid production will be initiated which is accompanied by subsequent autocatalytic intensification and degradation of cement based construction materials accordingly further research should focus on how to constrain concrete microorganism interactions on one hand physical and chemical concrete parameters have to be characterized in details regarding their impact on microbial growth on the other hand a better understanding of the microbial ecology supporting micc must be attained including metabolic process reactions a holistic characterization of the microbial communities involved biofilm structure and distribution as well as the functional capabilities of heterotrophs and fungi involved in this context geopolymer technology could represent promising construction materials suitable for micc environments due to properties such as low permeability caused by its fine pore structure cation exchange properties and chemical stability at low ph due to a lack of highly soluble ca hydration products as so far present in all cement based materials

19688,noroviruses cause significant global health burdens and waterborne transmission is a known exposure pathway chlorination is the most common method of disinfection for water and wastewater worldwide the purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying causes for discrepancies in human norovirus hnov resistance to free chlorine that have been previously published and to assess hnov gi and gii persistence during disinfection of municipal secondary wastewater ww effluent our results reveal that choice of hnov purification methodology prior to seeding the viruses in an experimental water matrix influences disinfection outcomes in treatment studies common hnov purification processes such as solvent extraction and 0 45 μm filtration were ineffective in removing high levels of organics introduced into water or wastewater samples when seeding norovirus positive stool these methods resulted in experimental water matrices receiving an additional 190 mg l as cl2 of 15

predicted ct values for reduction of hnov gii in ww were 0 4 2 0 and 7 0 mg min l respectively these results indicate that current ww treatment plant disinfection practices employing free chlorine are

wastewater ww remains chlorination due to its low cost effectiveness against many types of microorganisms and acceptance among regulatory agencies however discrepancies exist in the literature with regards to the efficacy of chorine to inactivate hnovs cook et al 2016 an influential study keswick et al 1985 suggested that hnovs were highly resistant to chlorination because a hnov suspension in water infected human volunteers after a free chlorine dose of 3 75 mg l for 30 min other studies came to a similar conclusions after detecting hnov gii 4 rna after a free chlorine dose of 3000 mg l for 10 min duizer et al 2004 and after observing less than 1 log10 reduction of hnov gi i and gii 4 after a 50 mg l total chlorine dose for 60 min kingsley et al 2017 however shin and sobsey postulated that hnovs were much more sensitive to free chlorine than commonly thought after observing 3 log10 reduction by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr after concentration time ct values of less than 5 mg min ml shin and sobsey 2008 the authors hypothesized that their findings differed from other research due to variations in virus preparation that could have led to excess oxidant demand viral aggregation or viral association with particulate matter additionally most chlorination data for hnov in water has been performed in either buffer or laboratory grade water duizer et al 2004 keswick et al 1985 kitajima et al 2010 shin and sobsey 2008 however previous work has shown that inactivation of viruses can vary between environmental water matrices and laboratory water dunkin et al 2017c kahler et al 2010 with researchers hypothesizing that turbidity in complex environmental waters may protect virions from disinfectants via shielding adsorption or enhanced aggregation haas et al 1996 thurston enriquez et al 2003 one study reported that differences in water quality between three natural waters caused variation in monochloramine ct values for 3 log10 reduction of coxsackievirus b5 ct values varied between 240 and 320 mg min l depending on water type echovirus 11 550 950 mg min l and human adenovirus 2 300 720 mg min l kahler et al 2011 in summary there is a need for hnov inactivation data in complex applied water matrices such as municipal ww since data generated in buffer or laboratory water may not be generalizable the limited number of studies and conflicting evidence on hnov sensitivity to chlorine highlights several challenges associated with performing bench scale assessments of hnov inactivation despite recent advancements ettayebi et al 2016 researchers have struggled to develop a hnov culturing method suitable for environmental studies as a result investigators have historically been unable to measure infectivity for hnovs and have instead had to rely primarily on measurements assumed to be correlated with infectivity such as nucleic acid reduction loss of capsid integrity or loss of capsid binding capacity knight et al 2013 2016 the most common method for detecting hnovs has been reverse transcription qpcr rt qpcr though viral rt qpcr signals are known to consistently underestimate infectivity reductions for cultivable surrogate viruses knight et al 2016 the lack of culture method has also forced researchers to obtain hnov samples from infected individuals which requires institutional approval individual consent and opportune timing these factors have contributed to the limited availability of hnovs for experimental use once a hnov positive stool sample has been collected researchers can seed the virus into an experimental water matrix for use in a bench scale treatability study one key assumption impacting data quality in these studies is that estimations of virus removal or inactivation are not altered by the viral seeding methodology however seeding hnovs into an experimental water matrix involves the addition of co constituents with the virus that are present in hnov positive stool samples these foreign constituents have the potential to induce non representative oxidant demand membrane fouling and uv light shielding which can lead to spurious experimental results and dramatically alter estimations of virus inactivation or removal some researchers have attempted to minimize the impact of constituents from human stool on experimental matrices by purifying hnovs prior to seeding approaches that have been used include centrifugation to remove cell mass solvent extraction to remove hydrophobic substances e g lipids micron filtration to remove particular matter and ultrafiltration to remove dissolved substances bae and schwab 2008 kingsley et al 2017 shin and sobsey 2008 however the impact of these purification approaches has not been quantified and the application of such approaches across studies has been less than uniform in fact most hnov treatability studies provide little information on stool preparation methodology or stool dilution ratios used during seeding thus there is need for rigorous assessment of hnov preparation methodologies to identify optimal strategies for reducing impacts from norovirus positive stool preparations on seeded water treatment studies the specific objectives of this study were therefore twofold the first objective was to determine optimal hnov preparation methodologies for loose i e unformed diarrheal and formed human stool by characterizing stool preparations at sequential stages of purification and to quantify based upon the degree of upstream purification their potential contribution to artificial oxidant demand furthermore molecular weight fractions of stool samples were assessed by size exclusion chromatography sec to determine their potential to induce non representative membrane fouling and uv light shielding in water treatment studies the second objective of this study was to employ optimal hnov purification strategies in a series of hnov chlorination experiments in municipal secondary ww effluent and phosphate buffer in order to more accurately estimate hnov susceptibility using rt qpcr during free chlorine disinfection in addition to elucidating the impact of hnov preparation methodologies on experimental results this work addresses an important gap in the literature by providing valuable hnov chlorination data in municipal secondary ww effluent an applied water matrix of importance to human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 human noroviruses and experimental design large volume 200 g de identified stool samples were collected from two hnov infected patients at an affiliated hospital under protocols approved by the johns hopkins institutional review board stool samples were immediately transferred to 4 c upon collection the two noroviruses were identified as genogroup g i 3 and gii 2 after sequencing analysis data not shown the gi 3 and gii 2 stool samples were subsequently processed through a series of purification steps outlined in fig 1 each box in the diagram represents a step in the purification process at each step a portion of the virus stock was collected and stored at 80 c for later analysis all experiments were performed in duplicate one objective of this study was to assess the influence of stool co constituents added to experimental water matrices during viral seeding therefore measurements were performed on hnov stool preparations after dilution to 1 stool w v in di water to imitate experimental water matrices seeded with hnovs diluted virus stocks are hereunto referred to as viral working solutions this methodology allowed clear observation of the quantitative impact of stool preparations on final experimental water matrices seeded with 1 stool amicon filtered and sucrose cushion purified hnov stocks which resulted in 100 fold concentration of viruses were diluted to 0 01 stool to allow for comparisons with viral stocks sampled from upstream purification steps fig 1 after normalization on genome copy number additionally researchers using stool dilutions other than those selected in this study may adapt our findings according to the stool dilution ratios utilized in their work the stool samples selected for analysis in this study were chosen due to their differences in consistency and viral titer the lower titer gi 3 stool sample formed and the higher titer gii 2 stool sample loose provide a range of consistencies from most difficult formed to process to less difficult loose that researchers are likely to encounter 2 2 stool purification norovirus positive stool samples were diluted to 10 w v in dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline dpbs and subsequently sonicated branson b2510 dth danbury ct at 40 khz three times for 1 min each time with 1 min resting on ice between each sonication the stool preparations were then sampled labeled as crude in fig 1 and stored at 80 c for later analysis equal volumes of crude hnov stool and vertrel xf dupont wilmington de were subsequently homogenized omni international inc marietta ga at 20 000 rpm for 3 min on ice the emulsified mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 g and 4 c and recovered water phase supernatant which contained the viruses was sampled for later analysis labeled as vertrel xf extraction in fig 1 norovirus vertrel xf extracted stocks were then filtered through 0 45 μm pore size low protein binding membrane filters millex pvdf millipore billerica ma and filtrate was sampled for later analysis labeled as 0 45 μm filtration in fig 1 following 0 45 μm filtration hnov filtrate was concentrated and further purified by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion dunkin et al 2017b hwang et al 2014 to perform sucrose cushion purification 0 45 μm filtered hnov stock was laid over sterile filtered 20 sucrose solution in an ultraclear centrifuge tube beckman brea ca and centrifuged at 95 000 g and 4 c for 3 h after centrifugation the sucrose and media were aspirated and the procedure repeated using the same ultracentrifuge tube with an additional volume of 0 45 μm filtered hnov stock in order to further concentrate the virus the volume of the final virus pellet and residual fluid depended on the initial stool consistency but was always less than 200 μl the pellet was then resuspended to a total volume of 560 μl in dpbs and stored at 80 c for later analysis labeled as sucrose cushion in fig 1 a subsample of 0 45 μm filtered gii 2 hnov was processed through amicon ultrafiltration rather than through sucrose cushion purification fig 1 this was done to compare amicon filtration a method used in previous studies to purify human stool shin and sobsey 2008 with sucrose cushion purification to perform amicon ultrafiltration 0 45 μm filtered gii 2 stocks were passed through a 0 1 μm filter for pre treatment and then further concentrated and purified using a 100 000 da molecular mwco ultra membrane filter as previously described bae and schwab 2008 the final retentate was stored at 80 c for later analysis labeled as amicon filtration in fig 1 a subsample of 0 45 μm filtered gi 3 hnov was not processed through amicon ultrafiltration because the formed nature of the stool precluded 0 1 μm filtration data not shown previous work with cultivable surrogates has demonstrated that the sucrose cushion purification and amicon ultrafiltration methods have negligible effects on viral capsids and that infectivity of the viruses is maintained after the purification methods are performed on viral stocks dunkin et al 2017b water quality parameters were measured for all viral working solutions as described in the supplementary material measurements included ph conductivity uv254 absorbance uva total organic carbon toc anions and molecular weight fractions as assessed by size exclusion chromatography sec 2 3 chlorine demand of stool preparations norovirus working solutions from each virus purification step shown in fig 1 were freshly prepared using dilution with di water to 1 stool before each experiment amicon and sucrose cushion purified hnov stocks which resulted in 100 fold concentration of viruses were diluted to 0 01 stool to allow for comparisons with hnov stocks sampled from upstream purification steps fig 1 after normalization on genome copy number for chlorine demand experiments dilutions of sodium hypochlorous acid solution naocl 10 15 sigma aldrich were freshly prepared and quantitated before each use virus working solutions were subjected to chlorination at a sample chlorine stock volume ratio of 95 5 chlorine residuals were measured immediately after addition of the free chlorine stock and additionally after 30 min of contact time control experiments with di water and no virus seeding were conducted in parallel in the same manner the n n diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd colorimetric method wef apha 2012 was used to measure the residual free chlorine chlorine demand was calculated as the difference between the free chlorine concentration of the control experiment sample and the virus working solution sample all experiments were conducted at 22 c and at ambient ph 2 4 chlorination experiments in phosphate buffer and wastewater chlorination experiments were performed using solvent extracted hnov gi and gii and sucrose cushion purified hnov gi and gii to determine if the degree of hnov purification prior to viral seeding impacted molecular viral log inactivation outcomes a 0 01 m phosphate buffer pb solution ph 7 and municipal secondary treated effluent nonchlorinated collected from the f wayne hill water resources center at the gwinnett county department of water resources georgia were used in this study the secondary wastewater effluent sample was shipped overnight at 4 c to our laboratory at johns hopkins university where experiments and water quality analysis supplementary material table s1 were begun within 24 h of sample arrival all viral reduction experiments were performed in duplicate and conducted at 20 c and ambient ph for ww 7 1 and at ph 7 0 for pb sterile chlorine demand free 125 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing an initial volume of 95 ml of water matrix and 5 ml of disinfectant were continuously mixed throughout the experiment human norovirus gi and gii disinfection experiments were performed separately to determine the impact of each stool preparation independently solvent extracted stocks were diluted to 0 01 stool in the final water matrix and sucrose cushion purified stocks to 0 0001 stool in order to normalize on genome copy number since sucrose cushion purification resulted in 100 fold concentration of viruses after the water matrix and virus were added to the flask 5 ml of free chlorine adjusted to achieve the final desired concentration were added two free chlorine doses were selected for evaluation in pb 1 and 5 mg l and ww 3 and 5 mg l a free chlorine master stock solution was freshly prepared diluted to desired concentration for disinfection experiments and residuals were measured using the dpd colorimetric method sampling was performed prior to the addition of free chlorine and at preselected time points up to 10 min at each sampling time point 4 ml were removed and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate 600 μg ml quenched samples were then portioned and stored at 80 c until molecular analysis by rt qpcr was performed as described in the supplementary material 2 5 kinetic modeling and statistical analyses disinfectant decay rate constants k for each hnov chlorination experiment were calculated by regressing measured residuals using the least squares method first order kinetics were assumed according to the equation 1 c c 0 e k t where k first order disinfectant decay rate constant c observed disinfectant residual mg l c 0 initial disinfectant dose mg l and t time from start of experiment to time of sample collection min viral reductions were determined by calculating the negative

time min to account for the effect of disinfect decay throughout an experiment equation 1 can be substituted into equation 2 and the resulting expression can be integrated to derive the specialized

residual sum of squared errors sse partial f tests were performed to assess significance of additional parameters in more highly parametrized models α 0 05 model errors were checked for normality using the shapiro wilk statistical test modeling and statistical analysis were performed in microsoft excel and r www r project org 3 results 3 1 characterization of norovirus stool preparation methodologies 3 1 1 water quality of norovirus working solutions norovirus infected stools were processed through a series of purification steps as described in fig 1 and samples from each purification step were diluted in di water to simulate appropriate viral seeding concentrations changes in water quality of experimental water matrices after seeding hnovs at specified concentrations were characterized and the results are shown in table 1 ultraviolet absorbance uva was employed in this study as a measure of the stool s potential impact on uv254 irradiation for disinfection since increased uva values may indicate that higher applied uv doses are necessary to achieve target inactivation goals from table 1 uva absorbance for crude solvent extracted and micron filtered gi and gii remained above 2 0 and 1 0 respectively sucrose cushion purification was able to reduce uva abs by over 85 from 2 569 to 0 361 in the formed gi stool and both sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration were able to reduce uva abs by over 97 from 1 076 to 0 029 in working solutions prepared from loose gii stool the addition of organic material to experimental water matrices during viral seeding is unwanted and could lead to bias in experimental results from disinfection or membrane studies toc was evaluated in this study as a measure of organics added to water matrices during virus seeding toc concentrations were consistently higher in gi working solutions relative to gii working solutions indicating that in this study formed stools introduced more organics into experimental matrices than loose stools interestingly vertrel xf extraction and 0 45 μm filtration did little to reduce toc in either gi or gii working solutions 10 reduction table 1 however sucrose cushion purification reduced toc from 365 mg l in working solutions of 0 45 μm filtered gi to 70 mg l a reduction of over 80 likewise sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration both resulted in toc reductions in working solutions of hnov gii of over 90 both sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration reduced toc in crude working solutions from 229 mg l to 15 7 mg l table 1 3 1 2 chlorine demand in norovirus working solutions seeding hnov positive stool in experimental water matrices will cause excess oxidant demand in disinfection studies which may lead to either underestimation of viral reduction at a given ct value or overestimation of required ct values to achieve a given level of viral reduction when residuals are not closely monitored the impact of hnov seeding on chlorine demand in experimental water matrices was therefore investigated demands were measured at 15 s to represent initial demand and 30 min to represent a common contact time for many water and wastewater facilities from table 2 15 s chlorine demands of 192 212 mg l as cl2 and 30 min chlorine demands of 439 461 mg l as cl2 were observed in the working solutions of crude vertrel xf extracted and 0 45 μm filtered hnov gi and gii sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration were both able to significantly reduce chlorine demand in gii working solutions with only 2 1 and 1 6 mg l as cl2 of 15 s chlorine demand observed respectively after seeding hnov gii to approximately 107 pcr units pcru per 10 μl sucrose cushion purification reduced 15 s chlorine demands in gi working solutions from 193 to 14 7 mg l as cl2 3 1 3 fractionation of constituents by molecular weight hplc sec was performed on hnov working solutions to evaluate removal of compounds segmented by molecular weight in each of the stool purification steps the sec method has previously been used to evaluate fractionation of natural organic matter in drinking water which is known to contribute to toc and chlorine demand chow et al 2008 this analysis was performed in the current study because it is known that high molecular weight compounds often impact water treatment processes such as membrane filtration where they exhibit greater fouling potential compared to low molecular weight compounds lee et al 2004 the results for hnov gi working solutions are presented in 3d graphs of the sorption wavelength absorbance intensity and retention time fig 2 the sec results for hnov gii are shown in fig 3 through comparison of fig 2 and fig s1 two major groups of compounds were identified based on molecular weight mw compounds with mw 4300 da and compounds with mw 150000 da compounds with mw 4300 da exhibited greater absorbance than compounds with mw 150000 da and were not removed by solvent extraction fig 2 b or 0 45 μm filtration fig 2 c compounds with mw 150000 da were seemingly introduced into the gi stool preparations after solvent extraction fig 2 b and was perhaps due to either residual solvent or compounds at the solvent aqueous interface preserved in the stool preparations however fig 2 d demonstrates that sucrose cushion purification is able to remove nearly all compounds with mw 4300 da and significantly reduce compounds with mw 150000 da similar trends were observed for hnov gii working solutions in fig 3 compounds with mw 4300 da exhibited greater absorbance than compounds with mw 150000 da and were not removed by solvent extraction fig 3 b or 0 45 μm filtration fig 3 c sucrose cushion purification fig 3 d was able to remove nearly all compounds regardless of mw amicon filtration was also effective removing most compounds with mw 4300 da though larger mw compounds 150000 da largely remained one limitation of the sec method is that it may not detect all large biopolymers which are problematic for water treatment operations however for the compounds that could be detected by sec in figs 2 and 3 results were consistent with toc and chlorine demand results in demonstrating that sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration are able to significantly reduce co constituents that are introduced into experimental water matrices during the hnov seeding process 3 2 reduction of human norovirus gi and gii by free chlorine 3 2 1 chlorination experiments in phosphate buffer and municipal wastewater chlorination experiments for hnov gi and gii were performed in 0 01 m pb with results shown as temporal profiles in fig 4 pb was seeded with vertrel xf extracted hnov gi to approximately 103 pcru 10 μl and in a separate experiment with sucrose cushion purified hnov gi also to approximately 103 pcru 10 μl to investigate whether the level of purification impacted experimental results separate experiments were performed in like manner for hnov gii which was seeded to approximately 105 pcru 10 μl due to the higher titer of the original stool sample the free chlorine residuals for both hnov gi and gii chlorination experiments demonstrate that additional chlorine demand was introduced to the water matrix from solvent extracted hnov as compared to sucrose cushion purified hnov in fig 4 a the 1 mg l free chlorine dose was depleted almost immediately in pb seeded with vertrel extracted hnov gi and as a result the virus persisted in contrast 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi was observed within 1 min at an equivalent free chlorine dose when the pb was seeded with sucrose purified hnov gi similar trends were observed for hnov gii when the pb was seeded with sucrose cushion purified hnov gii little to no reduction of free chlorine residual was observed within 10 min however solvent extracted hnov gii introduced chlorine demand that depleted the 1 mg l dose nearly instantaneously and reduced the 5 mg l dose to a residual of approximately 3 mg l within 1 min as a result 5 log10 reduction of hnov gii was observed in pb seeded with sucrose cushion purified hnov gii after 1 min of contact time with a 5 mg l dose while less than 3 log10 reduction was observed in pb seeded with vertrel xf extracted hnov gii with equivalent initial disinfectant doses overall both hnov gi and gii were susceptible to free chlorine in pb when a free chlorine residual was maintained 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi was observed within 1 min and 5 log10 reduction of hnov gii was observed within 3 min in order to assess the effects of a complex water matrix on gene copy reduction rates chlorination experiments for hnov gi and gii were performed in similar manner for municipal secondary ww effluent the results from these experiments in ww are shown as temporal profiles in fig 5 similar trends were observed as in pb where chlorine demand from the vertrel xf extracted hnov stocks reduced disinfectant residuals resulting in greater viral persistence nevertheless 3 log10 reduction was still observed in ww seeded with sucrose cushion purified hnov gi within 2 min at a free chlorine dose of 5 mg l similarly 5 log10 reduction was observed in ww seeded with sucrose cushion purified hnov gii within 5 min at a dose of 5 mg l in order to comparatively assess the effect of the ww matrix on gene copy reductions of hnov gi and gii and to compare gene copy reduction of hnov across purification approaches e g solvent extraction versus sucrose cushion purification after controlling for chlorine depletion integrated ct plots were developed for hnov gi and gii fig 6 by integrating under the chlorine residual decay curve from time 0 to the sampling time for each data point the results in this figure demonstrate a clear protective matrix effect for ww in fig 6 b ct values of approximately 3 mg min l resulted in less than 2 log10 reduction in ww and greater than 3 log10 reduction in pb the same trend is seen for hnov gi in fig 6 a at ct values of 2 mg min l or greater at a ct value of 2 mg min l reductions of approximately 3 log10 in pb and just over 2 log10 in ww were observed at ct values less than 2 mg min l differences in hnov gi reduction between ww and pb were less pronounced additionally fig 6 demonstrates that there is little impact of purification approach on experimental results once controlling for disinfectant demand for example ct values of 2 mg min l resulted in 2 log10 reduction of hnov gi in fig 6 a regardless of whether the matrix was seeded with solvent extracted or sucrose cushion purified hnov gi 3 2 2 kinetic modeling of viral reduction data inactivation models that consider disinfectant demand were employed in this study and fit to viral gene copy reduction data the best fit models for hnov gi and gii in ww are presented in the supplemental material in table s3 along with associated parameters modeling results for hnov gii in pb are also presented in order to provide a representative example in laboratory water free chlorine disinfectant decay constants and modeling results for non selected models along with shapiro wilk test statistics for model residuals are also provided in the supporting material table s3 shows that the igf hom model provided the best fit to the viral gene copy reduction data for hnov gi in ww while the power law model provided the best fit for hnov gii reduction in ww model fits for all scenarios are provided in fig 7 where observed gene copy reduction is plotted versus model predicted gene copy reduction the slope in fig 7 for the linear trend line was 1 01 which indicates high correlation between observed and predicted data points and demonstrates that selected models were able to effectively represent experimental data modeling analysis focused on experimental data in ww in order to develop ct values for 1 2 and 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi and gii by free chlorine in municipal secondary ww effluent table 3 the model predicted ct values demonstrate that both hnov gi and gii are susceptible to inactivation by free chlorine in ww with 3 log10 reduction observed at ct values under 8 mg min l 4 discussion 4 1 characterization of human stool and relevance for norovirus inactivation studies this study builds on the work of shin and sobsey 2008 by evaluating the hypothesis that preparation methodologies for hnov positive stool can dramatically alter estimations of log inactivation in chlorination studies our results demonstrate that hnov positive stool contributes considerable chlorine demand to water matrices in which it is seeded with 15 s demands on the order of 200 mg l as cl2 for solvent extracted or 0 45 μm filtered stool seeded at a weight to volume w v concentration of 1 table 2 regardless of the consistency of the initial stool sample e g loose versus formed moreover many studies have seeded hnov using higher stool concentrations such as 5 duizer et al 2004 10 poschetto et al 2007 or 20 tung et al 2013 if the results from table 2 are extrapolated these stool seeding concentrations would result in 15 s chlorine demands of approximately 1000 2000 and 4000 mg l as cl2 respectively in addition to any chlorine demand already present in the experimental matrix additionally our results indicate that 30 min chlorine demands for human stool are more than double 15 s demands table 2 taken together these extremely high chlorine demands suggest that nearly instantaneous free chlorine consumption may explain the persistence of hnov observed in some chlorination studies in the literature the chlorine demands observed in this study for differentially purified hnov gi and gii stools also correlated with uva absorbance and sec results figs 2 and 3 crude solvent extracted and 0 45 μm filtered stools maintained uva absorbance of greater than 2 0 for hnov gi and greater than 1 0 for hnov gii table 1 indicating that seeding stool at similar concentrations without further purification in uv disinfection studies is likely to impact experimental outcomes likewise sec results in figs 2 and 3 demonstrate that solvent extraction and 0 45 μm filtration do little to remove compounds than can cause fouling and bias estimates of virus removal in seeded membrane filtration studies huang et al 2012 even if these stool samples were seeded to 0 01 stool corresponding to approximately 103 pcru 10 μl for hnov gi and 105 pcru 10 μl for hnov gii the stool matrices would still contribute 2 4 mg l of toc to the experimental water matrix table 1 in summary observed chlorine demands uva absorbance and sec results all indicate that additional purification of hnov positive stool is warranted prior to seeding in bench scale water treatment assessments 4 2 selection of optimal stool preparation methodologies commonly employed stool purification methods such solvent extraction or micron filtration are insufficient to remove organic matter that leads to chlorine demand in studies seeking to demonstrate 4 log10 virus removal at practical residual free chlorine levels typically 0 5 5 mg l as cl2 for both drinking water and wastewater without additional purification researchers must further dilute stool matrices in order to reduce oxidant demand if they wish to assess inactivation at realistic disinfectant doses however this may lead to insufficient viral titers in experimental water matrices necessary to demonstrate 3 or 4 log10 removal thus there is need for advanced stool purification approaches viral purification strategies generally aim to separate viruses from complex matrices either through a density based approach or through size exclusion previous work has shown that amicon ultrafiltration a size exclusion approach can effectively purify human stool by allowing dissolved and small molecular weight compounds to pass through an ultrafilter with 100000 da mw cutoff while larger molecules including viruses are retained bae and schwab 2008 shin and sobsey 2008 density based methods such as sucrose cushion purification have also been employed for mammalian viruses in disinfection studies dunkin et al 2017c in this study we aimed to comparatively evaluate amicon ultrafiltration and sucrose cushion purification as potential options for advanced purification of human stool results from water quality analyses table 1 chlorine demand experiments table 2 and size exclusion chromatography figs 2 and 3 all demonstrate that amicon filtration and sucrose cushion purification are both able to effectively concentrate viruses and reduce organics in purified stool sucrose cushion purification was able to remove over 80 of toc from hnov gi experimental water matrices and over 90 of toc in hnov gii experimental water matrices amicon filtration performed equivalently to sucrose cushion purification for the loose hnov gii stool sample but was unable to be applied to the formed hnov gi stool sample due to filter clogging amicon filtration and sucrose cushion filtration were also able to reduce chlorine demands in hnov gii experimental water matrices by 99 table 2 and sucrose cushion purification reduced chlorine demands in hnov gi experimental water matrices by over 85 table 2 fig 2 d 3d and 3e demonstrate that both amicon filtration and sucrose cushion purification were able to remove low molecular weight compounds additionally figs 2 and 3 provide an easy visual comparison of matrix purities between crude solvent extracted micron filtered amicon filtered and sucrose cushion purified stool preparations however sec results in fig 3 e demonstrate one weakness of amicon ultrafiltration in that the method is unable to remove compounds that are larger than the mw cutoff of the filter as a result compounds with mw 100000 da remained in amicon filtered stool in summary both amicon filtration and sucrose cushion purification are viable options for advanced purification of human stool however sucrose cushion purification possesses slight advantages in that the method removes high mw compounds more readily than amicon filtration and is also easier to perform with difficult formed stool samples while vertrel xf treatment was infective in removing toc table 1 solvent extraction is recommended as a pretreatment for either sucrose cushion purification or amicon filtration in order to remove undissolved particles and debris including lipids in stool samples that can interfere with downstream purification processes 4 3 susceptibility of human norovirus gi and gii to free chlorine in wastewater the results of this study are in agreement with the work of shin and sobsey 2008 in indicating that hnovs are susceptible to free chlorine at practical doses and contact times employed in drinking water usually around 1 mg l with median contact times of 60 min burton et al 2014 furthermore our results demonstrate that ct values used for drinking water disinfection are sufficient to achieve 3 log10 reduction of both hnov gi and hnov gii during wastewater disinfection model predicted ct values for 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi and gii by free chlorine in municipal secondary ww effluent were 7 8 and 7 0 respectively table 3 since viral rt qpcr signals are known to consistently underestimate infectivity reductions knight et al 2016 hnov infectivity reductions in these experiments were likely greater than observed gene copy reductions thus standard water and wastewater disinfection practices employing free chlorine are likely to be protective for public health with regards to noroviruses one recently published study investigating reduction of hnovs during chlorination in secondary ww effluent observed less than 1 log10 reduction of hnov gi i and gii 4 after a 50 mg l total chlorine dose and 60 min of contact time kingsley et al 2017 discrepancies between our results and this study are likely due to differences in viral purification prior to seeding and differences in the method used to measure free chlorine beyond this study there is limited information available on hnov inactivation in applied water matrices which limited further comparisons with the literature however previous work has demonstrated that free chlorine is an effective wastewater disinfectant for surrogate viruses the pomona virus study performed by the sanitation districts of los angeles demonstrated that free chlorine was able achieve greater than 4 log10 inactivation of poliovirus during wastewater disinfection at pilot scale with a free chlorine residual of 4 mg l and contact time of 2 h parkhurst 1977 another pilot study reported that a free chlorine ct value of 1 6 mg min l was sufficient to remove 1 infectious log10 of anti e coli bacteriophage in municipal wastewater veschetti et al 2003 and the efficacy of free chlorine to inactivate other types microorganisms in ww has been documented rossi et al 2007 in short the efficacy of free chlorine to inactivate hnovs is consistent with data observed for other viruses and other types of microorganisms in municipal ww although there are few bench scale studies investigating hnov inactivation data in wastewater environmental monitoring of hnovs in municipal wastewater influent and effluent has been performed da silva et al 2007 dienus et al 2016 flannery et al 2012 kitajima et al 2014 laverick et al 2004 these studies have demonstrated that hnov gene copies are commonly detected in wastewater influent and that primary and secondary wastewater treatment typically achieve modest removal of hnovs a recent meta analysis estimated that wwtps achieve 2 2 log10 reduction hnov gi genome copies and 2 5 log10 reduction of hnov gii genome copies before disinfection though large variations between wwtps were observed pouillot et al 2015 limited data on hnov genome copy concentrations prior to disinfection limited the assessment of disinfection efficacy in this meta analysis moreover meta assessments of wwtp disinfection efficacy are complicated by the fact that free chlorine is rapidly converted to chloramines in the presence of nitrogenous substances which are often present in wastewater furthermore chloramine is known to be a less virucidal than free chlorine for noroviruses dunkin et al 2017a 2017c 4 4 effect of water matrix on chlorine efficacy previous research has reported that inactivation of viruses is moderated by water quality differences between applied water matrices and laboratory grade water dunkin et al 2017a 2017c one study reported that water quality differences in three source waters influenced chlorine ct values for 3 log10 reduction of viruses which varied between 2 6 and 7 9 mg min l for coxsackievirus b5 cvb5 0 6 1 2 mg min l for echovirus 11 e11 and 0 04 0 06 mg min l for human adenovirus 2 hadv2 however the investigators reported no correlation between viral inactivation kinetics and water quality parameters kahler et al 2010 the same research group also explored the effect of water quality on monochloramine inactivation of viruses and found that it influenced inactivation rates of cvb5 ct values varied between 240 and 320 mg min l for 3 log10 reduction depending on water type hadv2 300 720 mg min l and e11 550 950 mg min l kahler et al 2011 the results in this study indicate that the complexity of municipal ww does moderate the efficacy of free chlorine against hnovs compared to reductions observed in pb even after controlling for differences in disinfectant decay between the two water matrices model predicted ct values for 1 2 and 3 log10 reduction of hnov gii in ww were 0 4 2 0 and 7 0 mg min l table 3 additional modeling analysis was performed for hnov gii data in pb for comparison table s3 and application of the selected model revealed that predicted ct values required for 1 2 and 3 log10 reduction in pb were 0 3 1 2 and 3 0 mg min l respectively furthermore the integrated ct plot for hnov gii presented in fig 6 b provides visual evidence of enhanced viral persistence observed in ww the mechanism by which viruses exhibit greater resistance to disinfectants in complex environmental matrices is unknown but researchers have hypothesized that turbidity may protect virions haas et al 1996 via shielding adsorption or enhanced aggregation thurston enriquez et al 2003 thus the varied size number composition and structure of particles contributing to turbidity in municipal ww may shield or adsorb viruses during disinfection templeton et al 2008 in summary the differences in viral reduction rates between ww and pb suggest that inactivation data generated in laboratory water are likely not generalizable to ww applications and highlight the importance of employing applied water matrices in viral treatability studies 4 5 effect of viral preparation on disinfection results researchers have observed that rt qpcr signals for surrogate viruses are more persistent after chlorine or heat treatment when suspended in fecal material nowak et al 2011 tung et al 2013 suggesting that the fecal matrix may protect virions during inactivation studies shin and sobsey 2008 hypothesized that the protective effect could be due to either excess oxidant demand viral aggregation or viral association with particulate matter the results in this study indicate that oxidant demand explained nearly all of the variation observed in temporal profiles of viral inactivation in figs 4 and 5 between experiments seeded with solvent extracted hnov stool i e less purified and sucrose cushion purified hnov stool i e more purified thus viral aggregation and viral association with particulate matter are likely less important mechanisms by which fecal matrices protect virions than oxidant depletion though aggregation and association with particular matter may still contribute to tailing observed in both ww and pb in figs 4 6 this is demonstrated in fig 6 where integrated ct values which control for differential rates of chlorine decay are presented with associated hnov reductions for experiments seeded with solvent extracted stool alongside data from experiments seeded with sucrose cushion purified stool the high degree of overlap between data from solvent extracted stocks and from sucrose cushion purified stocks suggest that oxidant consumption is the primary mechanism by which fecal matrices protect virions during hnov inactivation studies thus researchers should exercise caution when designing inactivation studies with hnovs being careful not to allow inadvertent oxidant demand from hnov positive stool to dramatically alter estimations of log inactivation or removal 5 conclusion chlorination is the most common method of disinfection for water and wastewater but conflicting information on the susceptibility of hnovs to free chlorine has been presented in the literature duizer et al 2004 keswick et al 1985 kitajima et al 2010 poschetto et al 2007 shin and sobsey 2008 tung et al 2013 this study provides evidence that previously published reports of high hnov resistance to free chlorine during water and wastewater disinfection are likely an artifact of study design our primary conclusions are as follows human norovirus purification methodology greatly influences disinfection outcomes in water and wastewater treatment studies seeding solvent extracted and 0 45 μm filtered norovirus positive stool at 1 w v in an experimental water matrix will introduce over 190 mg l as cl2 of 15 s chlorine demand and approximately 440 mg l as cl2 of 30 min chlorine demand regardless of the consistency of the original stool sample i e formed versus loose these high organic loads will impact experimental water chemistry and bias results in disinfection studies sucrose cushion purification and ultrafiltration are viable options for advanced purification of human stool prior to seeding hnovs in water and wastewater disinfection studies these methods reduced 15 s chlorine demands in hnov stocks by 99 and toc by 93 sucrose cushion purification possesses slight advantages over ultrafiltration by more readily removing high molecular weight compounds and is also easier to perform on difficult to process formed stool samples current wastewater treatment plant disinfection practices employing free chlorine are likely sufficient for at least 3 log10 reduction of hnovs despite previous reports of high hnov resistance to free chlorine after controlling for the impact of organics in hnov stocks in our study design model predicted ct values for 1 2 and 3 log10 molecular reduction of hnov gi in wastewater were observed to be 0 3 2 1 and 7 8 mg min l respectively model predicted ct values for molecular reduction of hnov gii were 0 4 2 0 and 7 0 mg min l respectively it should be noted that the results in this study are specific to free chlorine they cannot be generalized to applications where ammonia may be present in wastewater and chloramines are formed viral gene copy reduction rates were higher in phosphate buffer relative to wastewater highlighting the importance of employing applied water matrices in viral reduction studies extrapolation of disinfection data generated in laboratory grade water to scenarios where water chemistry may differ greatly e g wastewater disinfection is not recommended as water reuse expands accurate estimates of viral inactivation and log removal during water treatment processes will be critical for estimating risk to human health developing regulations and informing engineering design of full scale treatment plants experimental inactivation data developed at bench scale for human pathogens such as norovirus will be critical with proper attention given to the selection of optimal viral

19688,noroviruses cause significant global health burdens and waterborne transmission is a known exposure pathway chlorination is the most common method of disinfection for water and wastewater worldwide the purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying causes for discrepancies in human norovirus hnov resistance to free chlorine that have been previously published and to assess hnov gi and gii persistence during disinfection of municipal secondary wastewater ww effluent our results reveal that choice of hnov purification methodology prior to seeding the viruses in an experimental water matrix influences disinfection outcomes in treatment studies common hnov purification processes such as solvent extraction and 0 45 μm filtration were ineffective in removing high levels of organics introduced into water or wastewater samples when seeding norovirus positive stool these methods resulted in experimental water matrices receiving an additional 190 mg l as cl2 of 15 s chlorine demand and approximately 440 mg l as cl2 of 30 min chlorine demand due to seeding norovirus positive stool at 1 w v these high organic loads impact experimental water chemistry and bias estimations of hnov persistence advanced purification of norovirus positive stool using sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration reduced 15 s chlorine demands by 99 and toc by 93 for loose i e unformed diarrhea stools using these methods hnov gi and gii persistence was investigated during free chlorination of municipal ww a suite five of kinetic inactivation models was fit to viral reverse transcription qpcr reduction data and model predicted ct values for 1 2 and 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi in municipal ww by free chlorine were 0 3 2 1 and 7 8 mg min l respectively model predicted ct values for reduction of hnov gii in ww were 0 4 2 0 and 7 0 mg min l respectively these results indicate that current ww treatment plant disinfection practices employing free chlorine are likely protective for public health with regards to noroviruses and will achieve at least 3 log reduction of hnov gi and gii rna despite previous reports of high hnov resistance graphical abstract image 1 keywords norovirus wastewater chlorination stool purification water treatment 1 introduction human noroviruses hnovs are now recognized as the number one cause of acute gastroenteritis sporadic cases and outbreaks globally across all age groups ahmed et al 2014 in the united states alone hnovs are estimated to cause 21 million illnesses and 71 000 hospitalizations annually lopman et al 2011 human noroviruses are transmitted through the fecal oral route and waterborne transmission is known to be an important exposure pathway lopman et al 2014 nenonen et al 2012 as such drinking water treatment plants dwtps and wastewater treatment plants wwtps serve as important barriers in limiting human exposure to hnovs the most common approach to reduce viruses in drinking water and wastewater ww remains chlorination due to its low cost effectiveness against many types of microorganisms and acceptance among regulatory agencies however discrepancies exist in the literature with regards to the efficacy of chorine to inactivate hnovs cook et al 2016 an influential study keswick et al 1985 suggested that hnovs were highly resistant to chlorination because a hnov suspension in water infected human volunteers after a free chlorine dose of 3 75 mg l for 30 min other studies came to a similar conclusions after detecting hnov gii 4 rna after a free chlorine dose of 3000 mg l for 10 min duizer et al 2004 and after observing less than 1 log10 reduction of hnov gi i and gii 4 after a 50 mg l total chlorine dose for 60 min kingsley et al 2017 however shin and sobsey postulated that hnovs were much more sensitive to free chlorine than commonly thought after observing 3 log10 reduction by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr after concentration time ct values of less than 5 mg min ml shin and sobsey 2008 the authors hypothesized that their findings differed from other research due to variations in virus preparation that could have led to excess oxidant demand viral aggregation or viral association with particulate matter additionally most chlorination data for hnov in water has been performed in either buffer or laboratory grade water duizer et al 2004 keswick et al 1985 kitajima et al 2010 shin and sobsey 2008 however previous work has shown that inactivation of viruses can vary between environmental water matrices and laboratory water dunkin et al 2017c kahler et al 2010 with researchers hypothesizing that turbidity in complex environmental waters may protect virions from disinfectants via shielding adsorption or enhanced aggregation haas et al 1996 thurston enriquez et al 2003 one study reported that differences in water quality between three natural waters caused variation in monochloramine ct values for 3 log10 reduction of coxsackievirus b5 ct values varied between 240 and 320 mg min l depending on water type echovirus 11 550 950 mg min l and human adenovirus 2 300 720 mg min l kahler et al 2011 in summary there is a need for hnov inactivation data in complex applied water matrices such as municipal ww since data generated in buffer or laboratory water may not be generalizable the limited number of studies and conflicting evidence on hnov sensitivity to chlorine highlights several challenges associated with performing bench scale assessments of hnov inactivation despite recent advancements ettayebi et al 2016 researchers have struggled to develop a hnov culturing method suitable for environmental studies as a result investigators have historically been unable to measure infectivity for hnovs and have instead had to rely primarily on measurements assumed to be correlated with infectivity such as nucleic acid reduction loss of capsid integrity or loss of capsid binding capacity knight et al 2013 2016 the most common method for detecting hnovs has been reverse transcription qpcr rt qpcr though viral rt qpcr signals are known to consistently underestimate infectivity reductions for cultivable surrogate viruses knight et al 2016 the lack of culture method has also forced researchers to obtain hnov samples from infected individuals which requires institutional approval individual consent and opportune timing these factors have contributed to the limited availability of hnovs for experimental use once a hnov positive stool sample has been collected researchers can seed the virus into an experimental water matrix for use in a bench scale treatability study one key assumption impacting data quality in these studies is that estimations of virus removal or inactivation are not altered by the viral seeding methodology however seeding hnovs into an experimental water matrix involves the addition of co constituents with the virus that are present in hnov positive stool samples these foreign constituents have the potential to induce non representative oxidant demand membrane fouling and uv light shielding which can lead to spurious experimental results and dramatically alter estimations of virus inactivation or removal some researchers have attempted to minimize the impact of constituents from human stool on experimental matrices by purifying hnovs prior to seeding approaches that have been used include centrifugation to remove cell mass solvent extraction to remove hydrophobic substances e g lipids micron filtration to remove particular matter and ultrafiltration to remove dissolved substances bae and schwab 2008 kingsley et al 2017 shin and sobsey 2008 however the impact of these purification approaches has not been quantified and the application of such approaches across studies has been less than uniform in fact most hnov treatability studies provide little information on stool preparation methodology or stool dilution ratios used during seeding thus there is need for rigorous assessment of hnov preparation methodologies to identify optimal strategies for reducing impacts from norovirus positive stool preparations on seeded water treatment studies the specific objectives of this study were therefore twofold the first objective was to determine optimal hnov preparation methodologies for loose i e unformed diarrheal and formed human stool by characterizing stool preparations at sequential stages of purification and to quantify based upon the degree of upstream purification their potential contribution to artificial oxidant demand furthermore molecular weight fractions of stool samples were assessed by size exclusion chromatography sec to determine their potential to induce non representative membrane fouling and uv light shielding in water treatment studies the second objective of this study was to employ optimal hnov purification strategies in a series of hnov chlorination experiments in municipal secondary ww effluent and phosphate buffer in order to more accurately estimate hnov susceptibility using rt qpcr during free chlorine disinfection in addition to elucidating the impact of hnov preparation methodologies on experimental results this work addresses an important gap in the literature by providing valuable hnov chlorination data in municipal secondary ww effluent an applied water matrix of importance to human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 human noroviruses and experimental design large volume 200 g de identified stool samples were collected from two hnov infected patients at an affiliated hospital under protocols approved by the johns hopkins institutional review board stool samples were immediately transferred to 4 c upon collection the two noroviruses were identified as genogroup g i 3 and gii 2 after sequencing analysis data not shown the gi 3 and gii 2 stool samples were subsequently processed through a series of purification steps outlined in fig 1 each box in the diagram represents a step in the purification process at each step a portion of the virus stock was collected and stored at 80 c for later analysis all experiments were performed in duplicate one objective of this study was to assess the influence of stool co constituents added to experimental water matrices during viral seeding therefore measurements were performed on hnov stool preparations after dilution to 1 stool w v in di water to imitate experimental water matrices seeded with hnovs diluted virus stocks are hereunto referred to as viral working solutions this methodology allowed clear observation of the quantitative impact of stool preparations on final experimental water matrices seeded with 1 stool amicon filtered and sucrose cushion purified hnov stocks which resulted in 100 fold concentration of viruses were diluted to 0 01 stool to allow for comparisons with viral stocks sampled from upstream purification steps fig 1 after normalization on genome copy number additionally researchers using stool dilutions other than those selected in this study may adapt our findings according to the stool dilution ratios utilized in their work the stool samples selected for analysis in this study were chosen due to their differences in consistency and viral titer the lower titer gi 3 stool sample formed and the higher titer gii 2 stool sample loose provide a range of consistencies from most difficult formed to process to less difficult loose that researchers are likely to encounter 2 2 stool purification norovirus positive stool samples were diluted to 10 w v in dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline dpbs and subsequently sonicated branson b2510 dth danbury ct at 40 khz three times for 1 min each time with 1 min resting on ice between each sonication the stool preparations were then sampled labeled as crude in fig 1 and stored at 80 c for later analysis equal volumes of crude hnov stool and vertrel xf dupont wilmington de were subsequently homogenized omni international inc marietta ga at 20 000 rpm for 3 min on ice the emulsified mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 g and 4 c and recovered water phase supernatant which contained the viruses was sampled for later analysis labeled as vertrel xf extraction in fig 1 norovirus vertrel xf extracted stocks were then filtered through 0 45 μm pore size low protein binding membrane filters millex pvdf millipore billerica ma and filtrate was sampled for later analysis labeled as 0 45 μm filtration in fig 1 following 0 45 μm filtration hnov filtrate was concentrated and further purified by ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion dunkin et al 2017b hwang et al 2014 to perform sucrose cushion purification 0 45 μm filtered hnov stock was laid over sterile filtered 20 sucrose solution in an ultraclear centrifuge tube beckman brea ca and centrifuged at 95 000 g and 4 c for 3 h after centrifugation the sucrose and media were aspirated and the procedure repeated using the same ultracentrifuge tube with an additional volume of 0 45 μm filtered hnov stock in order to further concentrate the virus the volume of the final virus pellet and residual fluid depended on the initial stool consistency but was always less than 200 μl the pellet was then resuspended to a total volume of 560 μl in dpbs and stored at 80 c for later analysis labeled as sucrose cushion in fig 1 a subsample of 0 45 μm filtered gii 2 hnov was processed through amicon ultrafiltration rather than through sucrose cushion purification fig 1 this was done to compare amicon filtration a method used in previous studies to purify human stool shin and sobsey 2008 with sucrose cushion purification to perform amicon ultrafiltration 0 45 μm filtered gii 2 stocks were passed through a 0 1 μm filter for pre treatment and then further concentrated and purified using a 100 000 da molecular mwco ultra membrane filter as previously described bae and schwab 2008 the final retentate was stored at 80 c for later analysis labeled as amicon filtration in fig 1 a subsample of 0 45 μm filtered gi 3 hnov was not processed through amicon ultrafiltration because the formed nature of the stool precluded 0 1 μm filtration data not shown previous work with cultivable surrogates has demonstrated that the sucrose cushion purification and amicon ultrafiltration methods have negligible effects on viral capsids and that infectivity of the viruses is maintained after the purification methods are performed on viral stocks dunkin et al 2017b water quality parameters were measured for all viral working solutions as described in the supplementary material measurements included ph conductivity uv254 absorbance uva total organic carbon toc anions and molecular weight fractions as assessed by size exclusion chromatography sec 2 3 chlorine demand of stool preparations norovirus working solutions from each virus purification step shown in fig 1 were freshly prepared using dilution with di water to 1 stool before each experiment amicon and sucrose cushion purified hnov stocks which resulted in 100 fold concentration of viruses were diluted to 0 01 stool to allow for comparisons with hnov stocks sampled from upstream purification steps fig 1 after normalization on genome copy number for chlorine demand experiments dilutions of sodium hypochlorous acid solution naocl 10 15 sigma aldrich were freshly prepared and quantitated before each use virus working solutions were subjected to chlorination at a sample chlorine stock volume ratio of 95 5 chlorine residuals were measured immediately after addition of the free chlorine stock and additionally after 30 min of contact time control experiments with di water and no virus seeding were conducted in parallel in the same manner the n n diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd colorimetric method wef apha 2012 was used to measure the residual free chlorine chlorine demand was calculated as the difference between the free chlorine concentration of the control experiment sample and the virus working solution sample all experiments were conducted at 22 c and at ambient ph 2 4 chlorination experiments in phosphate buffer and wastewater chlorination experiments were performed using solvent extracted hnov gi and gii and sucrose cushion purified hnov gi and gii to determine if the degree of hnov purification prior to viral seeding impacted molecular viral log inactivation outcomes a 0 01 m phosphate buffer pb solution ph 7 and municipal secondary treated effluent nonchlorinated collected from the f wayne hill water resources center at the gwinnett county department of water resources georgia were used in this study the secondary wastewater effluent sample was shipped overnight at 4 c to our laboratory at johns hopkins university where experiments and water quality analysis supplementary material table s1 were begun within 24 h of sample arrival all viral reduction experiments were performed in duplicate and conducted at 20 c and ambient ph for ww 7 1 and at ph 7 0 for pb sterile chlorine demand free 125 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing an initial volume of 95 ml of water matrix and 5 ml of disinfectant were continuously mixed throughout the experiment human norovirus gi and gii disinfection experiments were performed separately to determine the impact of each stool preparation independently solvent extracted stocks were diluted to 0 01 stool in the final water matrix and sucrose cushion purified stocks to 0 0001 stool in order to normalize on genome copy number since sucrose cushion purification resulted in 100 fold concentration of viruses after the water matrix and virus were added to the flask 5 ml of free chlorine adjusted to achieve the final desired concentration were added two free chlorine doses were selected for evaluation in pb 1 and 5 mg l and ww 3 and 5 mg l a free chlorine master stock solution was freshly prepared diluted to desired concentration for disinfection experiments and residuals were measured using the dpd colorimetric method sampling was performed prior to the addition of free chlorine and at preselected time points up to 10 min at each sampling time point 4 ml were removed and immediately quenched with sodium thiosulfate 600 μg ml quenched samples were then portioned and stored at 80 c until molecular analysis by rt qpcr was performed as described in the supplementary material 2 5 kinetic modeling and statistical analyses disinfectant decay rate constants k for each hnov chlorination experiment were calculated by regressing measured residuals using the least squares method first order kinetics were assumed according to the equation 1 c c 0 e k t where k first order disinfectant decay rate constant c

using the shapiro wilk statistical test modeling and statistical analysis were performed in microsoft excel and r www r project org 3 results 3 1 characterization of norovirus stool preparation methodologies 3 1 1 water quality of norovirus working solutions norovirus infected stools were processed through a series of purification steps as described in fig 1 and samples from each purification step were diluted in di water to simulate appropriate viral seeding concentrations changes in water quality of experimental water matrices after seeding hnovs at specified concentrations were characterized and the results are shown in table 1 ultraviolet absorbance uva was employed in this study as a measure of the stool s potential impact on uv254 irradiation for disinfection since increased uva values may indicate that higher applied uv doses are necessary to achieve target inactivation goals from table 1 uva absorbance for crude solvent extracted and micron filtered gi and gii remained above 2 0 and 1 0 respectively sucrose cushion purification was able to reduce uva abs by over 85 from 2 569 to 0 361 in the formed gi stool and both sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration were able to reduce uva abs by over 97 from 1 076 to 0 029 in working solutions prepared from loose gii stool the addition of organic material to experimental water matrices during viral seeding is unwanted and could lead to bias in experimental results from disinfection or membrane studies toc was evaluated in this study as a measure of organics added to water matrices during virus seeding toc concentrations were consistently higher in gi working solutions relative to gii working solutions indicating that in this study formed stools introduced more organics into experimental matrices than loose stools interestingly vertrel xf extraction and 0 45 μm filtration did little to reduce toc in either gi or gii working solutions 10 reduction table 1 however sucrose cushion purification reduced toc from 365 mg l in working solutions of 0 45 μm filtered gi to 70 mg l a reduction of over 80 likewise sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration both resulted in toc reductions in working solutions of hnov gii of over 90 both sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration reduced toc in crude working solutions from 229 mg l to 15 7 mg l table 1 3 1 2 chlorine demand in norovirus working solutions seeding hnov positive stool in experimental water matrices will cause excess oxidant demand in disinfection studies which may lead to either underestimation of viral reduction at a given ct value or overestimation of required ct values to achieve a given level of viral reduction when residuals are not closely monitored the impact of hnov seeding on chlorine demand in experimental water matrices was therefore investigated demands were measured at 15 s to represent initial demand and 30 min to represent a common contact time for many water and wastewater facilities from table 2 15 s chlorine demands of 192 212 mg l as cl2 and 30 min chlorine demands of 439 461 mg l as cl2 were observed in the working solutions of crude vertrel xf extracted and 0 45 μm filtered hnov gi and gii sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration were both able to significantly reduce chlorine demand in gii working solutions with only 2 1 and 1 6 mg l as cl2 of 15 s chlorine demand observed respectively after seeding hnov gii to approximately 107 pcr units pcru per 10 μl sucrose cushion purification reduced 15 s chlorine demands in gi working solutions from 193 to 14 7 mg l as cl2 3 1 3 fractionation of constituents by molecular weight hplc sec was performed on hnov working solutions to evaluate removal of compounds segmented by molecular weight in each of the stool purification steps the sec method has previously been used to evaluate fractionation of natural organic matter in drinking water which is known to contribute to toc and chlorine demand chow et al 2008 this analysis was performed in the current study because it is known that high molecular weight compounds often impact water treatment processes such as membrane filtration where they exhibit greater fouling potential compared to low molecular weight compounds lee et al 2004 the results for hnov gi working solutions are presented in 3d graphs of the sorption wavelength absorbance intensity and retention time fig 2 the sec results for hnov gii are shown in fig 3 through comparison of fig 2 and fig s1 two major groups of compounds were identified based on molecular weight mw compounds with mw 4300 da and compounds with mw 150000 da compounds with mw 4300 da exhibited greater absorbance than compounds with mw 150000 da and were not removed by solvent extraction fig 2 b or 0 45 μm filtration fig 2 c compounds with mw 150000 da were seemingly introduced into the gi stool preparations after solvent extraction fig 2 b and was perhaps due to either residual solvent or compounds at the solvent aqueous interface preserved in the stool preparations however fig 2 d demonstrates that sucrose cushion purification is able to remove nearly all compounds with mw 4300 da and significantly reduce compounds with mw 150000 da similar trends were observed for hnov gii working solutions in fig 3 compounds with mw 4300 da exhibited greater absorbance than compounds with mw 150000 da and were not removed by solvent extraction fig 3 b or 0 45 μm filtration fig 3 c sucrose cushion purification fig 3 d was able to remove nearly all compounds regardless of mw amicon filtration was also effective removing most compounds with mw 4300 da though larger mw compounds 150000 da largely remained one limitation of the sec method is that it may not detect all large biopolymers which are problematic for water treatment operations however for the compounds that could be detected by sec in figs 2 and 3 results were consistent with toc and chlorine demand results in demonstrating that sucrose cushion purification and amicon filtration are able to significantly reduce co constituents that are introduced into experimental water matrices during the hnov seeding process 3 2 reduction of human norovirus gi and gii by free chlorine 3 2 1 chlorination experiments in phosphate buffer and municipal wastewater chlorination experiments for hnov gi and gii were performed in 0 01 m pb with results shown as temporal profiles in fig 4 pb was seeded with vertrel xf extracted hnov gi to approximately 103 pcru 10 μl and in a separate experiment with sucrose cushion purified hnov gi also to approximately 103 pcru 10 μl to investigate whether the level of purification impacted experimental results separate experiments were performed in like manner for hnov gii which was seeded to approximately 105 pcru 10 μl due to the higher titer of the original stool sample the free chlorine residuals for both hnov gi and gii chlorination experiments demonstrate that additional chlorine demand was introduced to the water matrix from solvent extracted hnov as compared to sucrose cushion purified hnov in fig 4 a the 1 mg l free chlorine dose was depleted almost immediately in pb seeded with vertrel extracted hnov gi and as a result the virus persisted in contrast 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi was observed within 1 min at an equivalent free chlorine dose when the pb was seeded with sucrose purified hnov gi similar trends were observed for hnov gii when the pb was seeded with sucrose cushion purified hnov gii little to no reduction of free chlorine residual was observed within 10 min however solvent extracted hnov gii introduced chlorine demand that depleted the 1 mg l dose nearly instantaneously and reduced the 5 mg l dose to a residual of approximately 3 mg l within 1 min as a result 5 log10 reduction of hnov gii was observed in pb seeded with sucrose cushion purified hnov gii after 1 min of contact time with a 5 mg l dose while less than 3 log10 reduction was observed in pb seeded with vertrel xf extracted hnov gii with equivalent initial disinfectant doses overall both hnov gi and gii were susceptible to free chlorine in pb when a free chlorine residual was maintained 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi was observed within 1 min and 5 log10 reduction of hnov gii was observed within 3 min in order to assess the effects of a complex water matrix on gene copy reduction rates chlorination experiments for hnov gi and gii were performed in similar manner for municipal secondary ww effluent the results from these experiments in ww are shown as temporal profiles in fig 5 similar trends were observed as in pb where chlorine demand from the vertrel xf extracted hnov stocks reduced disinfectant residuals resulting in greater viral persistence nevertheless 3 log10 reduction was still observed in ww seeded with sucrose cushion purified hnov gi within 2 min at a free chlorine dose of 5 mg l similarly 5 log10 reduction was observed in ww seeded with sucrose cushion purified hnov gii within 5 min at a dose of 5 mg l in order to comparatively assess the effect of the ww matrix on gene copy reductions of hnov gi and gii and to compare gene copy reduction of hnov across purification approaches e g solvent extraction versus sucrose cushion purification after controlling for chlorine depletion integrated ct plots were developed for hnov gi and gii fig 6 by integrating under the chlorine residual decay curve from time 0 to the sampling time for each data point the results in this figure demonstrate a clear protective matrix effect for ww in fig 6 b ct values of approximately 3 mg min l resulted in less than 2 log10 reduction in ww and greater than 3 log10 reduction in pb the same trend is seen for hnov gi in fig 6 a at ct values of 2 mg min l or greater at a ct value of 2 mg min l reductions of approximately 3 log10 in pb and just over 2 log10 in ww were observed at ct values less than 2 mg min l differences in hnov gi reduction between ww and pb were less pronounced additionally fig 6 demonstrates that there is little impact of purification approach on experimental results once controlling for disinfectant demand for example ct values of 2 mg min l resulted in 2 log10 reduction of hnov gi in fig 6 a regardless of whether the matrix was seeded with solvent extracted or sucrose cushion purified hnov gi 3 2 2 kinetic modeling of viral reduction data inactivation models that consider disinfectant demand were employed in this study and fit to viral gene copy reduction data the best fit models for hnov gi and gii in ww are presented in the supplemental material in table s3 along with associated parameters modeling results for hnov gii in pb are also presented in order to provide a representative example in laboratory water free chlorine disinfectant decay constants and modeling results for non selected models along with shapiro wilk test statistics for model residuals are also provided in the supporting material table s3 shows that the igf hom model provided the best fit to the viral gene copy reduction data for hnov gi in ww while the power law model provided the best fit for hnov gii reduction in ww model fits for all scenarios are provided in fig 7 where observed gene copy reduction is plotted versus model predicted gene copy reduction the slope in fig 7 for the linear trend line was 1 01 which indicates high correlation between observed and predicted data points and demonstrates that selected models were able to effectively represent experimental data modeling analysis focused on experimental data in ww in order to develop ct values for 1 2 and 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi and gii by free chlorine in municipal secondary ww effluent table 3 the model predicted ct values demonstrate that both hnov gi and gii are susceptible to inactivation by free chlorine in ww with 3 log10 reduction observed at ct values under 8 mg min l 4 discussion 4 1 characterization of human stool and relevance for norovirus inactivation studies this study builds on the work of shin and sobsey 2008 by evaluating the hypothesis that preparation methodologies for hnov positive stool can dramatically alter estimations of log inactivation in chlorination studies our results demonstrate that hnov positive stool contributes considerable chlorine demand to water matrices in which it is seeded with 15 s demands on the order of 200 mg l as cl2 for solvent extracted or 0 45 μm filtered stool seeded at a weight to volume w v concentration of 1 table 2 regardless of the consistency of the initial stool sample e g loose versus formed moreover many studies have seeded hnov using higher stool concentrations such as 5 duizer et al 2004 10 poschetto et al 2007 or 20 tung et al 2013 if the results from table 2 are extrapolated these stool seeding concentrations would result in 15 s chlorine demands of approximately 1000 2000 and 4000 mg l as cl2 respectively in addition to any chlorine demand already present in the experimental matrix additionally our results indicate that 30 min chlorine demands for human stool are more than double 15 s demands table 2 taken together these extremely high chlorine demands suggest that nearly instantaneous free chlorine consumption may explain the persistence of hnov observed in some chlorination studies in the literature the chlorine demands observed in this study for differentially purified hnov gi and gii stools also correlated with uva absorbance and sec results figs 2 and 3 crude solvent extracted and 0 45 μm filtered stools maintained uva absorbance of greater than 2 0 for hnov gi and greater than 1 0 for hnov gii table 1 indicating that seeding stool at similar concentrations without further purification in uv disinfection studies is likely to impact experimental outcomes likewise sec results in figs 2 and 3 demonstrate that solvent extraction and 0 45 μm filtration do little to remove compounds than can cause fouling and bias estimates of virus removal in seeded membrane filtration studies huang et al 2012 even if these stool samples were seeded to 0 01 stool corresponding to approximately 103 pcru 10 μl for hnov gi and 105 pcru 10 μl for hnov gii the stool matrices would still contribute 2 4 mg l of toc to the experimental water matrix table 1 in summary observed chlorine demands uva absorbance and sec results all indicate that additional purification of hnov positive stool is warranted prior to seeding in bench scale water treatment assessments 4 2 selection of optimal stool preparation methodologies commonly employed stool purification methods such solvent extraction or micron filtration are insufficient to remove organic matter that leads to chlorine demand in studies seeking to demonstrate 4 log10 virus removal at practical residual free chlorine levels typically 0 5 5 mg l as cl2 for both drinking water and wastewater without additional purification researchers must further dilute stool matrices in order to reduce oxidant demand if they wish to assess inactivation at realistic disinfectant doses however this may lead to insufficient viral titers in experimental water matrices necessary to demonstrate 3 or 4 log10 removal thus there is need for advanced stool purification approaches viral purification strategies generally aim to separate viruses from complex matrices either through a density based approach or through size exclusion previous work has shown that amicon ultrafiltration a size exclusion approach can effectively purify human stool by allowing dissolved and small molecular weight compounds to pass through an ultrafilter with 100000 da mw cutoff while larger molecules including viruses are retained bae and schwab 2008 shin and sobsey 2008 density based methods such as sucrose cushion purification have also been employed for mammalian viruses in disinfection studies dunkin et al 2017c in this study we aimed to comparatively evaluate amicon ultrafiltration and sucrose cushion purification as potential options for advanced purification of human stool results from water quality analyses table 1 chlorine demand experiments table 2 and size exclusion chromatography figs 2 and 3 all demonstrate that amicon filtration and sucrose cushion purification are both able to effectively concentrate viruses and reduce organics in purified stool sucrose cushion purification was able to remove over 80 of toc from hnov gi experimental water matrices and over 90 of toc in hnov gii experimental water matrices amicon filtration performed equivalently to sucrose cushion purification for the loose hnov gii stool sample but was unable to be applied to the formed hnov gi stool sample due to filter clogging amicon filtration and sucrose cushion filtration were also able to reduce chlorine demands in hnov gii experimental water matrices by 99 table 2 and sucrose cushion purification reduced chlorine demands in hnov gi experimental water matrices by over 85 table 2 fig 2 d 3d and 3e demonstrate that both amicon filtration and sucrose cushion purification were able to remove low molecular weight compounds additionally figs 2 and 3 provide an easy visual comparison of matrix purities between crude solvent extracted micron filtered amicon filtered and sucrose cushion purified stool preparations however sec results in fig 3 e demonstrate one weakness of amicon ultrafiltration in that the method is unable to remove compounds that are larger than the mw cutoff of the filter as a result compounds with mw 100000 da remained in amicon filtered stool in summary both amicon filtration and sucrose cushion purification are viable options for advanced purification of human stool however sucrose cushion purification possesses slight advantages in that the method removes high mw compounds more readily than amicon filtration and is also easier to perform with difficult formed stool samples while vertrel xf treatment was infective in removing toc table 1 solvent extraction is recommended as a pretreatment for either sucrose cushion purification or amicon filtration in order to remove undissolved particles and debris including lipids in stool samples that can interfere with downstream purification processes 4 3 susceptibility of human norovirus gi and gii to free chlorine in wastewater the results of this study are in agreement with the work of shin and sobsey 2008 in indicating that hnovs are susceptible to free chlorine at practical doses and contact times employed in drinking water usually around 1 mg l with median contact times of 60 min burton et al 2014 furthermore our results demonstrate that ct values used for drinking water disinfection are sufficient to achieve 3 log10 reduction of both hnov gi and hnov gii during wastewater disinfection model predicted ct values for 3 log10 reduction of hnov gi and gii by free chlorine in municipal secondary ww effluent were 7 8 and 7 0 respectively table 3 since viral rt qpcr signals are known to consistently underestimate infectivity reductions knight et al 2016 hnov infectivity reductions in these experiments were likely greater than observed gene copy reductions thus standard water and wastewater disinfection practices employing free chlorine are likely to be protective for public health with regards to noroviruses one recently published study investigating reduction of hnovs during chlorination in secondary ww effluent observed less than 1 log10 reduction of hnov gi i and gii 4 after a 50 mg l total chlorine dose and 60 min of contact time kingsley et al 2017 discrepancies between our results and this study are likely due to differences in viral purification prior to seeding and differences in the method used to measure free chlorine beyond this study there is limited information available on hnov inactivation in applied water matrices which limited further comparisons with the literature however previous work has demonstrated that free chlorine is an effective wastewater disinfectant for surrogate viruses the pomona virus study performed by the sanitation districts of los angeles demonstrated that free chlorine was able achieve greater than 4 log10 inactivation of poliovirus during wastewater disinfection at pilot scale with a free chlorine residual of 4 mg l and contact time of 2 h parkhurst 1977 another pilot study reported that a free chlorine ct value of 1 6 mg min l was sufficient to remove 1 infectious log10 of anti e coli bacteriophage in municipal wastewater veschetti et al 2003 and the efficacy of free chlorine to inactivate other types microorganisms in ww has been documented rossi et al 2007 in short the efficacy of free chlorine to inactivate hnovs is consistent with data observed for other viruses and other types of microorganisms in municipal ww although there are few bench scale studies investigating hnov inactivation data in wastewater environmental monitoring of hnovs in municipal wastewater influent and effluent has been performed da silva et al 2007 dienus et al 2016 flannery et al 2012 kitajima et al 2014 laverick et al 2004 these studies have demonstrated that hnov gene copies are commonly detected in wastewater influent and that primary and secondary wastewater treatment typically achieve modest removal of hnovs a recent meta analysis estimated that wwtps achieve 2 2 log10 reduction hnov gi genome copies and 2 5 log10 reduction of hnov gii genome copies before disinfection though large variations between wwtps were observed pouillot et al 2015 limited data on hnov genome copy concentrations prior to disinfection limited the assessment of disinfection efficacy in this meta analysis moreover meta assessments of wwtp disinfection efficacy are complicated by the fact that free chlorine is rapidly converted to chloramines in the presence of nitrogenous substances which are often present in wastewater furthermore chloramine is known to be a less virucidal than free chlorine for noroviruses dunkin et al 2017a 2017c 4 4 effect of water matrix on chlorine efficacy previous research has reported that inactivation of viruses is moderated by water quality differences between applied water matrices and laboratory grade water dunkin et al 2017a 2017c one study reported that water quality differences in three source waters influenced chlorine ct values for 3 log10 reduction of viruses which varied between 2 6 and 7 9 mg min l for coxsackievirus b5 cvb5 0 6 1 2 mg min l for echovirus 11 e11 and 0 04 0 06 mg min l for human adenovirus 2 hadv2 however the investigators reported no correlation between viral inactivation kinetics and water quality parameters kahler et al 2010 the same research group also explored the effect of water quality on monochloramine inactivation of viruses and found that it influenced inactivation rates of cvb5 ct values varied between 240 and 320 mg min l for 3 log10 reduction depending on water type hadv2 300 720 mg min l and e11 550 950 mg min l kahler et al 2011 the results in this study indicate that the complexity of municipal ww does moderate the efficacy of free chlorine against hnovs compared to reductions observed in pb even after controlling for differences in disinfectant decay between the two water matrices model predicted ct values for 1 2 and 3 log10 reduction of hnov gii in ww were 0 4 2 0 and 7 0 mg min l table 3 additional modeling analysis was performed for hnov gii data in pb for comparison table s3 and application of the selected model revealed that predicted ct values required for 1 2 and 3 log10 reduction in pb were 0 3 1 2 and 3 0 mg min l respectively furthermore the integrated ct plot for hnov gii presented in fig 6 b provides visual evidence of enhanced viral persistence observed in ww the mechanism by which viruses exhibit greater resistance to disinfectants in complex environmental matrices is unknown but researchers have hypothesized that turbidity may protect virions haas et al 1996 via shielding adsorption or enhanced aggregation thurston enriquez et al 2003 thus the varied size number composition and structure of particles contributing to turbidity in municipal ww may shield or adsorb viruses during disinfection templeton et al 2008 in summary the differences in viral reduction rates between ww and pb suggest that inactivation data generated in laboratory water are likely not generalizable to ww applications and highlight the importance of employing applied water matrices in viral treatability studies 4 5 effect of viral preparation on disinfection results researchers have observed that rt qpcr signals for surrogate viruses are more persistent after chlorine or heat treatment when suspended in fecal material nowak et al 2011 tung et al 2013 suggesting that the fecal matrix may protect virions during inactivation studies shin and sobsey 2008 hypothesized that the protective effect could be due to either excess oxidant demand viral aggregation or viral association with particulate matter the results in this study indicate that oxidant demand explained nearly all of the variation observed in temporal profiles of viral inactivation in figs 4 and 5 between experiments seeded with solvent extracted hnov stool i e less purified and sucrose cushion purified hnov stool i e more purified thus viral aggregation and viral association with particulate matter are likely less important mechanisms by which fecal matrices protect virions than oxidant depletion though aggregation and association with particular matter may still contribute to tailing observed in both ww and pb in figs 4 6 this is demonstrated in fig 6 where integrated ct values which control for differential rates of chlorine decay are presented with associated hnov reductions for experiments seeded with solvent extracted stool alongside data from experiments seeded with sucrose cushion purified stool the high degree of overlap between data from solvent extracted stocks and from sucrose cushion purified stocks suggest that oxidant consumption is the primary mechanism by which fecal matrices protect virions during hnov inactivation studies thus researchers should exercise caution when designing inactivation studies with hnovs being careful not to allow inadvertent oxidant demand from hnov positive stool to dramatically alter estimations of log inactivation or removal 5 conclusion chlorination is the most common method of disinfection for water and wastewater but conflicting information on the susceptibility of hnovs to free chlorine has been presented in the literature duizer et al 2004 keswick et al 1985 kitajima et al 2010 poschetto et al 2007 shin and sobsey 2008 tung et al 2013 this study provides evidence that previously published reports of high hnov resistance to free chlorine during water and wastewater disinfection are likely an artifact of study design our primary conclusions are as follows human norovirus purification methodology greatly influences disinfection outcomes in water and wastewater treatment studies seeding solvent extracted and 0 45 μm filtered norovirus positive stool at 1 w v in an experimental water matrix will introduce over 190 mg l as cl2 of 15 s chlorine demand and approximately 440 mg l as cl2 of 30 min chlorine demand regardless of the consistency of the original stool sample i e formed versus loose these high organic loads will impact experimental water chemistry and bias results in disinfection studies sucrose cushion purification and ultrafiltration are viable options for advanced purification of human stool prior to seeding hnovs in water and wastewater disinfection studies these methods reduced 15 s chlorine demands in hnov stocks by 99 and toc by 93 sucrose cushion purification possesses slight advantages over ultrafiltration by more readily removing high molecular weight compounds and is also easier to perform on difficult to process formed stool samples current wastewater treatment plant disinfection practices employing free chlorine are likely sufficient for at least 3 log10 reduction of hnovs despite previous reports of high hnov resistance to free chlorine after controlling for the impact of organics in hnov stocks in our study design model predicted ct values for 1 2 and 3 log10 molecular reduction of hnov gi in wastewater were observed to be 0 3 2 1 and 7 8 mg min l respectively model predicted ct values for molecular reduction of hnov gii were 0 4 2 0 and 7 0 mg min l respectively it should be noted that the results in this study are specific to free chlorine they cannot be generalized to applications where ammonia may be present in wastewater and chloramines are formed viral gene copy reduction rates were higher in phosphate buffer relative to wastewater highlighting the importance of employing applied water matrices in viral reduction studies extrapolation of disinfection data generated in laboratory grade water to scenarios where water chemistry may differ greatly e g wastewater disinfection is not recommended as water reuse expands accurate estimates of viral inactivation and log removal during water treatment processes will be critical for estimating risk to human health developing regulations and informing engineering design of full scale treatment plants experimental inactivation data developed at bench scale for human pathogens such as norovirus will be critical with proper attention given to the selection of optimal viral preparation methodologies in seeded water treatment studies the quality of data that will inform water treatment and reuse practices will be improved funding this work was supported by the national

19689,development of a selective adsorbent with an enhanced removal efficiency for phosphate from wastewater is urgently needed here a hybrid adsorbent of nanoscale zirconium molybdate embedded in a macroporous anion exchange resin zmae is proposed for the selective removal of phosphate the zmae consists of a low agglomeration of zirconium molybdate nanoparticles zm nps dispersed within the structure of the anion exchange ae resin as major results the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zmae 26 1 mg p g in the presence of excess sulfate 5 mm is superior to that of the pristine ae resin 1 8 mg p g although their phosphate uptake capacity was similar in the absence of sulfate and these results were supported by the high selectivity coefficient of the zmae toward phosphate over sulfate spo4 so4 more than 100 times compared to the pristine ae resin this superior selective performance of the zmae for phosphate in the presence of sulfate ions is well explained by the role of the zm nps that contributed to 69 of the phosphate capacity which is based on an observation that the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zm nps is not affected by the presence of sulfate in addition the behavior of the selective phosphate removal by the zmae was well demonstrated by not only in the batch mode experiment with simulated mekong river water and representative wastewater effluent but also in a column test graphical abstract image 1 keywords selective removal of phosphate zirconium molybdate anion exchange resin hybrid phosphate removal 1 introduction the occurrence of excess phosphate is one of the main sources causing the eutrophication of lakes rivers and coastal regions eutrophication has become a widespread problem deteriorating water quality which has led to an accumulation of organic maters plants and algae and the development of color and odor in water as well su et al 2013 yang et al 2014 therefore developing effective technologies for reducing phosphate in wastewater going into river and lake waters has been one of the urgent strategies for controlling the eutrophication problem in recent decades among current technologies adsorption technologies have been an alternative to biological and chemical precipitation processes due to their simple operation environmental friendliness and effective removal of low level phosphate concentrations li et al 2014 su et al 2013 thus developing selective adsorbents for improving the efficiency of the adsorption process has become a critical issue in recent years organic inorganic nanocomposites based adsorbent which consist of inorganic nanoparticles nps and organic support matrix have been considered as alternative adsorbents due to their selective performance toward target ions in addition this approach for hybrid adsorbents is presumed to be one of the solutions for overcoming the inherent problems of nps such as poor mechanical hydraulic properties clogging the column and separation difficulty pan et al 2009a 2014 for this purpose various composite adsorbents have been synthesized and examined for phosphate adsorption which consist of metal oxides nps e g hydrated ferric oxide and zirconium oxide

zhang 2015 zeolites guaya et al 2015 xie et al 2015 or functional polymer blaney et al 2007 pan et al 2009c song et al 2016 you et al 2016 particularly ion exchange polymers have been reported as good candidates for a polymer matrix of a hybrid adsorbent due to their donnan effect resulting from the fixed charges cumbal and sengupta 2005 pan et al 2013 despite the limited success of the anion exchange resin as a matrix for the enhancing adsorption capacity and efficiency for phosphate removal cumbal and sengupta 2005 du et al 2013 selective adsorption for phosphate removal remains a challenging issue because the anion exchanger resin in a hybrid adsorbent rapidly loses its adsorption capacity in the presences of excess sulfate ions which is inevitable in wastewater conditions awual and jyo 2011 pan et al 2009b thus developing a selective adsorbent is urgently required to achieve a high removal efficiency of phosphate from wastewater pan et al 2009b therefore the aim of this study was to develop a novel molybdate based nanocomposite adsorbent for selective phosphate removal which was a hybrid of nanoscale zirconium molybdate and a macroporous anion exchange resin zmae the performance of the zmae was evaluated by adsorption studies in the absences presence of excessive sulfate 5 mm compared with that of the pristine ae resin furthermore the zmae was used with simulated mekong river water in batch mode and simulated waste effluent in a fixed bed column test to test its practical use 2 experiments and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals including the pristine ae resin used in this study were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa zirconium molybdate zm nps ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and zirconium iv oxychloride octahydrate zrocl2 8h2o were used as received the anion exchange ae resin used in this study was a macroporous strong base anion exchange resin with a polystyrene divinylbenzene matrix a dowex marathon msa 640 50 μm prior to use the resin was washed with a hydrochloric acid solution replacing the anionic form with chloride ions and then rinsed with ethanol for 24 h and dried at room temperature 2 2 synthesis of the zmae adsorbent in this study the zmae was fabricated as follows to fabricate the zmae 10 g of the ae resin was added to a 100 ml of 0 05 m nh4 6mo7o24 solution with shaking for 8 h this treated ae resin was immersed in a 100 ml of 0 2 m zrocl2 solution containing 5 sodium chloride with shaking for 24 h to precipitate the zm nps inside the ae resin this ae resin containing the zm nps was washed with deionized water and ethanol finally the zmae was obtained after drying at 50 55 c the zmae was compared with the zirconium oxide embedded ae resin zae for the purpose of examining the potential role of mo component in the zmae for the phosphate adsorption the zae only containing zirconium oxide instead of zirconium molybdate was synthesized following the method reported in the previous studies padungthon et al 2015 pan et al 2013 which was similar with the synthetic procedure for the zmae the only difference was that the hydrated zirconium oxide was precipitated with a 5 naoh solution instead of the nh4 6mo7o24 solution 2 3 analytical methods the phosphate concentration was analyzed with the molybdenum blue method using a uv vis spectrometer 8453 e uv vis agilent usa murphy and riley 1962 tsang et al 2007 low concentrations of phosphate below 0 05 mg l were analyzed with an icp analyzer icp ms varian 820 ms varian australia the contents of zr and mo loaded in the hybrid adsorbents zmae and zae were determined with icp aes after digesting with mixed acids hcl h2so4 and hclo4 the morphology and surface characteristics of the zmae were

bruker germany fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir 200 jasco japan and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps sigma probe thermovg u k the specific surface area and pore volume of the zmae adsorbent were measured with a bet analyzer asap 2000 micromeritics usa the phpzc point of zero charge of the zmae was determined by the drift method fan et al 2011 2 4 batch adsorption experiments phosphate adsorption isotherm experiments with the zmae 0 5 g l were carried out in the batch mode with a shaking glass bottle 100 ml containing 50 ml of a phosphate solution 5 50 mg l of p po4 at an initial ph of 5 5 without adjusting during adsorption for 24 h and compared with the zae and the pristine ae resin all batch mode experiments were conducted in a shaker at a constant temperature 25 c these experiments were conducted in the absence and presence of excess sulfate ions 5 mm in addition a kinetic study with zmae 0 5 g l in the absence and presence of high sulfate 5 mm was performed in phosphate solution 10 mg l of p po4 0 31 mm 200 ml and compared with the pristine ae resin at the predetermined time 0 5 2 ml of this solution were withdrawn to measure the phosphate concentration regeneration of the zmae was successively examined with adsorption desorption experiments of phosphate ion for adsorption step the experiments with the zmae 50 mg 50 ml were carried out in the batch mode containing 10 mg l p po4 with shaking 200 rpm at ph of 5 5 for 24 h the desorption step was performed in the condition of 0 1 m naoh 5 ml for 2 h at 200 rpm shaking the adsorption and desorption efficiencies were calculated as follows po 4 adsorbed po 4 removed po 4 initial 100 po 4 desorbed po 4 desorbed po 4 removed 100 2 5 determination of the selectivity coefficient of zmae the selectivity of the zmae 0 5 g l for phosphate ions over sulfate ions was measured in mixed solutions of equal concentrations of phosphate and sulfate ions for three different conditions 0 25 0 75 and 2 0 mm at ph 5 for 24 h equilibrium condition and compared with that of the pristine ae resin the selectivity coefficient spo4 so4 for either the zmae or the pristine ae resin was defined as the ratio of the distribution coefficients of the two respective ions between solution and adsorbent liu et al 2013 petrova et al 2015 s p o 4 s o 4 d p o 4 d s o 4 where dpo4 or dso4 l of solution g of adsorbent is the distribution coefficient of phosphate and sulfate ions respectively the distribution coefficient d was defined as follows d p o 4 q e p o 4 c e p o 4 or d s o 4 q e s o 4 c e s o 4 where qe mmol g and ce mmol l are the adsorption capacity and the concentration of the phosphate or sulfate in the equilibrated solution respectively 2 6 quantitative determination of the selective phosphate property of the zmae to evaluate the contribution of the zm nps to the selectivity of the zmae the phosphate capacity of two different sites within the zmae i the quaternary ammonium groups r4n of the ae resin and ii the zm nps were obtained separately in the following manner with the assumption that the zmae has only these two different types of sites for phosphate adsorption refer to the tem image in fig 1 a first the number of r4n groups of the pristine ae resin and the ae resin within the zmae was estimated by the ion exchange capacity iec meq g with a conventional titration method using chloride karas et al 2014 if the ion exchange behavior of the r4n of the ae resin inside the zmae is identical with that of the pristine ae resin the fraction of the number of r4n functional groups of the ae resin within the zmae over that of the pristine ae resin f the mass fraction of the ae within the zmae was obtained by equation 1 this assumption is supported by that the chloride adsorption on the zm nps was negligible refer to fig s2 in si 1 f q r 4 n i n z m a e q r 4 n i n a e q m a e i n z m a e q m a e 2 q m zmae q m n p s in zmae q m a e i n zmae where f is the fraction of the number of r4n functional groups in the ae resin within the zmae over that of the pristine ae resin q r4n in zmae is the number of r4n groups of the ae resin within the zmae per weight of the zmae meq g q r4n in ae is the number of r4n groups per weight of the pristine ae resin meq g qm ae in zmae is the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae resin inside the zmae per weight of the zmae mg of p g of zmae qm ae is the maximum phosphate capacity of the pristine ae resin mg of p g of ae qm zmae is the maximum phosphate capacity of the zmae mg of p g of zmae qm nps in zmae is the maximum phosphate capacity of the zm nps inside the zmae per weight of the zmae mg of p g of z mae second the maximum phosphate capacity of the zm nps within the zmae q m n p s in zmae was obtained by subtracting the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae resin within the zmae q m a e i n zmae from the maximum phosphate capacity of the zmae q m zmae shown in equation 2 both the q m zmae and q m a e i n zmae values were obtained from the phosphate isotherm experiments using the zmae and ae resin with the estimation of langmuir isotherm model on the other hand in the presence of excess sulfate the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae in the zmae can be estimated with equation 3 3 q m a e i n z m a e q m z m a e q m n p s in zmae where the additional in q m z m a e q m n p s i n z m a e and q m a e i n z m a e denotes the condition with the presence of excess sulfate respectively the value of q m zmae mg p g zmae was obtained in the same manner as done with qm nps in zmae the q m nps in zmae value was assumed to be identical with qm nps in zmae because the experimental results of zm nps for the phosphate adsorption was not affected at all by the presence of excess sulfate ions refer to fig s3 in si 2 7 ph effect on the phosphate adsorption and stability of the zmae to examine the ph effect on the phosphate adsorption of the zmae a batch adsorption experiment was conducted in a ph range from 2 to 11 under the same condition additionally to evaluate the stability of the zmae with respect to the ph the amounts of zirconium and molybdenum species from the zmae were measured a solution containing 1 g l of the zmae was stirred for 48 h with a varying ph range from 1 to 13 then the filtered supernatant solution was used to measure the zirconium and molybdenum concentration by icp aes the solution ph was maintained by adding hcl or naoh solution during the stability experiments 2 8 application of the zmae with simulated mekong river water and wastewater effluent to examine the feasibility of the zmae for practical applications batch adsorption and fixed bed column experiments were conducted with simulated mekong river water and typical wastewater effluent with the excess presence of phosphate and other coexisting ions respectively the ph condition was adjusted to an acidic condition around ph 4 4 to minimize the release of the molybdate species from the zmae the composition of the simulated mekong river water was as follows cl 50 mg l hco3 150 mg l and so4 2 70 mg l as competing ions and p po4 10 mg l at ph 4 5 huang et al 2009 the simulated wastewater effluent with an excess presence of phosphate was as follows cl 150 mg l hco3 150 mg l and so4 2 200 mg l with 10 mg l of p po4 at ph 4 5 blaney et al 2007 in addition a fixed bed column experiment was conducted with a glass column 12 50 mm in diameter and length packed with the zmae 5 ml and feed water at a constant temperature 25 c using a water bath the composition of the feed water was as follows phosphate p po4 2 0 mg l and other co existing anions cl 110 mg l hco3 150 mg l so4 2 120 mg l at ph 4 3 4 4 with a constant flow rate of 1 25 ml min empty bed contact time ebct 4 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the zmae fig 1 and table 1 show the physicochemical characterization of the zmae fabricated in this study as shown in fig 1 a and table 1 the zm nps were successfully loaded into the structure of the ae resin with low agglomeration and their size was about 8 9 1 7 nm n 50 particles the zm nps with a poor crystalline in nature and the higher bet surface area of the zmae compared to the pristine ae resin table 1 are presumed to be favorable for phosphate adsorption refer to fig s1 a in si cumbal and sengupta 2005 pan et al 2009c the ftir spectra of the zmae in contrast with the pristine ae resin show the specific peaks characterizing the zirconium molybdate embedded inside the zmae fig 1 b for example the peaks at the region of 800 950 cm 1 indicate the presence of the molybdate group for the loaded nps inamuddin and ismail 2010 nabi et al 2010 additionally the ftir spectrum of the zmae was distinguishable from the pristine ae resin by the peaks in the range of 450 550 cm 1 indicating the stretching vibration of the metal oxygen zr o and mo o nabi et al 2010 uhlrich et al 2011 the inherent characteristic of the quaternary ammonium functional in the ae support resin was observed in the vibration of the merging stretching hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups and hydroxyl groups of adsorbed water 3500 3300 cm 1 c h peak 3000 cm 1 and c c peak 1650 cm 1 kociolek balawejder et al 2016 shah and chudasama 2014 these results indicate that the zmae possesses not only the specific properties of the loaded zm nps but also the anion exchange properties of the r4n functional groups in the ae resin furthermore the presence of zirconium and molybdenum in the zmae was confirmed by icp aes with weight percent of 4 3 and 14 7 table 1 and by xps spectra with their oxidation states of zr 4 and mo 6 refer to fig s1 b in si respectively as shown in fig 1 b the structure of the polymer matrix and functional group in the zmae appeared to be very similar with that of the pristine ae resin however the surface area of the zmae containing the zm nps within the ae resin was increased from 22 2 to 28 3 m2 g which is explained by the poor crystalline nature of the zm nps table 1 3 2 selective phosphate adsorption of the zmae 3 2 1 effective phosphate adsorption of the zmae fig 2 shows the phosphate adsorption performance of the zmae compared with the pristine ae resin in terms of the kinetic behavior a and adsorption isotherm b 5 mm of sulfate and the effect of a competing ion concentration c as shown in fig 2 a in the absence of competing ions sulfate ions the difference in the phosphate uptake between the zmae and the pristine ae resin is not much 64 and 62 removal for the zmae and the ae for 90 min respectively one difference is that the phosphate uptake of the zmae steadily occurred even up to 9 h whereas the pristine ae resin quickly reached equilibrium on the other hand as shown in fig 2 a in the presence of excess sulfate ions 5 mm the phosphate uptake of the pristine ae resin became negligible even after 9 h only 3 removal possibly due to the interfering effect from the presence of excess competing ions 5 mm of sulfate yang et al 2015 whereas the zmae exhibited still a much higher phosphate uptake capability 48 removal at 9 h showing that the zmae had not only a higher phosphate removal efficiency in the absence of sulfate ions but also a selective property even in the presence of sulfate ions compared with the ae resin fig 2 b shows the phosphate adsorption isotherm of the zmae compared with the pristine ae resin for the whole range of phosphate concentrations in fig 2 b the phosphate adsorption of the zmae was higher than that of the pristine ae resin regardless of the presence of excess sulfate as expected from the result of fig 2 a however these differences between the zmae and ae became more drastic in the presence of excess sulfate because phosphate adsorption by the ae resin becomes greatly hindered in the presence of sulfate for example in case of the zmae the maximum adsorption capacity qm value obtained by langmuir isotherm model was decreased by 38 from 42 2 to 26 1 mg p g in the presence of excess sulfate whereas the qm of the pristine ae resin was significantly diminished by 96 from 43 1 to 1 8 mg p g fig 2 c shows the phosphate adsorption with respect to increasing sulfate concentration compared with the ae resin as shown in fig 2 c phosphate removal by the zmae was maintained at over about 55 of the removal even at an extremely high concentration of sulfate although it decreased slowly with an increasing sulfate concentration whereas the phosphate removal of the pristine ae resin quickly dropped to almost zero 3 2 2 selectivity coefficient of the zmae for phosphate ions relative to sulfate ions table 2 shows the distribution coefficients of phosphate and sulfate dpo4 and dso4 and the selectivity coefficients of the zmae for phosphate removal over sulfate spo4 so4 compared with the pristine ae resin which were examined in a mixed solution of identical concentrations of phosphate and sulfate 0 25 mm 2 0 mm at ph 5 for 24 h equilibrium condition as shown in table 2 the spo4 so4 value of the zmae was 7 0 in the mixed solution of phosphate and sulfate 0 25 mm each indicating that the dpo4 was 7 times higher compared to the dso4 under the same condition the spo4 so4 value of the pristine ae resin was 0 086 indicating that the pristine ae resin adsorbed sulfate much more therefore this result of selectivity compared between the zmae and pristine ae resin supports the great performance of the zmae for phosphate adsorption in the presence of excess sulfate ions shown in fig 2 3 2 3 chemical characterization for selective phosphate adsorption of the zmae fig 3 shows the results of the xps analysis in terms of the o1s a and p2p b spectra with respect to phosphate adsorption as shown in fig 3 a the clear change of the o1s spectra of the zmae indicates a specific interaction between the loaded zm nps and phosphate ions because of phosphate adsorption for example the change in quantity of the two overlapped peaks of the o1s xps spectra at 530 5 and 531 9 ev corresponding to oxide oxygen o and hydroxyl group oh after the phosphate adsorption reveals a new bonding formation between the surface zm nps and phosphate species su et al 2013 the initial content of the oh peak in the o1s total peak dropped after reacting with phosphate corresponding to the relative increase of the o peak content this change in the o1s spectra means that the hydroxyl surface group of the zm nps in the hybrid is replaced by the phosphate group during the adsorption process on the other hand the p2p xps spectra of the zmae in fig 3 b appeared in two main peaks at 133 8 and 132 8 ev corresponding to the p5 state show the specific interaction between the phosphate and the surface of the zm nps bai et al 2016 yao et al 2013 as a result of phosphate adsorption onto the zmae fig 4 shows the ftir spectra of the zmae with respect to phosphate adsorption as shown in fig 4 the adsorption of phosphate produces a slightly negative shift in the stretching vibration of the molybdate component from the region of 800 946 cm 1 to 750 930 cm 1 possibly resulting from a specific interaction between the phosphate ion and molybdate component of the zmae forming a complex of phosphomolybdate berchmans et al 2011 zezza et al 2012 in addition a new broad and intense peak was observed at 1052 cm 1 indicating the asymmetry vibration of the p o bond of the adsorbed phosphate after the phosphate adsorption su et al 2013 the appearance of this peak confirms the surface adsorption of the phosphate onto the loaded nps su et al 2013 yao et al 2013 as demonstrated in the xps analysis fig 3 3 3 interpretation of the selective phosphate selectivity of the zmae fig 5 shows the phosphate adsorption distribution of the zmae qm ae in zmae qm nps in zmae q m nps in zmae and q m ae in zmae compared with that of the pristine ae resin with or without the excess sulfate qm ae and q m ae note that the values of qm ae q m ae qm zmae and q m zmae were previously mentioned in fig 2 as previously described in the experimental section the contributions of the zm nps in the zmae for phosphate capacity qm nps in zmae were obtained from equations 1 and 2 these contributions of the zm nps in the zmae for phosphate capacity were calculated based on the observation of the negligible effect of the excess sulfate on the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zm nps refer to fig s3 in si the f value equation 1 the fraction of the number of r4n functional groups in the ae resin within the zmae over the pristine ae resin was obtained as 0 56 q r4n in ae 3 42 meq g and q r4n in zmae 1 92 meq g indicating that the ae resin within the zmae occupied around 56 wt of the zmae which has a phosphate capacity of 24 1 mg p g qm ae in zmae fig 5 it was noted that the phosphate capacity 24 1 mg g or 0 78 meq g calculated from experimental data is less than the qr4n value 1 92 meq g one of the explanations for this discrepancy can be from the multiprotic property of phosphoric acid pka1 2 1 pka2 7 2 pka3 12 3 chitrakar et al 2006 inside the ae resin phosphate may be present partly as hpo4 2 and therefore occupy two r4n sites in the resin on the other hand it can be explained by that h2po4 ion may be not effectively exchanged with chloride ion of the ae resin due to the similar affinity of r4n inside the ae resin toward both h2po4 and cl awual and jyo 2011 then qm nps in zmae became 18 1 mg p g which occupied 43 of the qm zmae this is explained in case i shown in fig 5 the contribution of qm nps in zmae was increased to 69 in the presence of excess sulfate because the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae within the zmae was decreased from 24 1 to 8 0 mg p g in contrast with case i the second approach was made case ii to characterize the phosphate adsorption distribution of the zmae in the presence of excess sulfate in this approach the maximum phosphate capacity of the pristine ae resin q m ae mg p g was maintained in the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae resin within the zmae qm ae in zmae assuming the consistency of the adsorption behavior of r4n for both the pristine ae resin and ae resin within the zmae then q m nps in zmae was obtained as 25 1 mg p g from a q m zmae of 26 1 mg p g because the ae resin inside the zmae occupied around 56 wt of the zmae and q m ae in zmae became 1 0 mg p g showing the higher contributions of the zm nps in the zmae for phosphate capacity compared with the case i approach consequently both approaches case i ii indicate that the major contribution of the zm nps in the zmae is for the selective phosphate removal in addition the advantages of zirconium molybdate in the zmae over zirconium oxide in the zae for phosphate adsorption are well demonstrated in fig s4 si showing that the zmae exhibited the better selectivity the maximum adsorption capacity of 26 1 mg g estimated by langmuir model than the zae the maximum adsorption capacity of 8 4 mg g estimated by langmuir model for almost all the concentration range of phosphate in the presence of excess sulfate ion although the adsorption capacities of the zmae 42 2 mg g estimated by langmuir model and the zae 46 7 mg g estimated by langmuir model appeared to be similar in the absence of excess sulfate ion this is well explained by the specific reaction of molybdate with phosphate to form phosphomolybdate complexes hori 1977 zhao et al 1996 in which the complex of 12 phosphomolybdic acid has been specifically applied for trace analysis of phosphate for many decades molybdenum blue method bobtelsky and barzily 1963 ma et al 2014 note that the zr contents of the zmae and the zae was similar as 4 3 and 4 9 wt respectively for this comparison 3 4 the ph effect on the phosphate adsorption capacity and chemical stability of the zmae fig 6 shows the ph effect on the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zmae a and on the chemical stability of the zmae focusing on the release of the molybdenum and zirconium species b as shown in fig 6 a the phosphate adsorption capacity appears to be quite dependent upon the ph conditions the phosphate capacity was the highest in the ph range of 3 5 possibly due to the favorable complexation of the molybdate and phosphate at acidic ph and the electrostatic attraction between the r4n functional groups in the ae resin inside the zmae and h2p o 4 pka2 of 7 20 chitrakar et al 2006 hori 1977 zhao et al 1996 meanwhile the phosphate adsorption capacity decreased as the ph increased over 5 even though the amount of negatively charged phosphate was increased on the other hand as shown in fig 6 b molybdenum species started to be released beyond ph 6 which is a disadvantage for practical applications at neutral or basic conditions whereas no zirconium species were released from the zmae even at basic conditions further improvement is required to prevent the release of the molybdenum species at neutral or basic conditions although the ion exchange polymer matrix inside the zmae contributed to delaying the release of the molybdenum species inside the zmae compared with the case of the bare zm nps refer to fig s5 in si in addition it is necessary to maintain the ph of water at not higher than ph 6 in order to maintain the stability of the zmae 3 5 the regeneration of the zmae fig 7 shows the results about the regeneration of the zmae with the five successive cycles of phosphate adsorption desorption as shown in fig 7 the regeneration efficiency or re adsorption efficiency black bar maintained more than 70 up to the 5th cycle of adsorption desorption experiments the lowering regeneration efficiency with respect to subsequent cycle is explained by the mo leaching during the desorption process at alkaline condition as previously mentioned in fig 6 b on the other hand the phosphate adsorbed adsorbents was effectively regenerated by 0 1 m naoh solution 92 0 3 0 of phosphate desorption efficiency although more efforts were made to find out the regenerant solution other than alkaline solution 0 1 m naoh in order to overcome the problem of mo leaching during the desorption process at alkaline condition it was noted that perchlorate perchloric acid sulfate sulfuric acid were not effective at all as regenerant solutions 3 6 application of the zmae for phosphate removal in simulated water the batch adsorption experiments and column experiments with the zmae in a slightly acidic ph were carried out to examine the feasibility of the zmae for use in potential applications and compared with the pristine ae resin fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zmae was relatively sustained compared with the pristine ae resin when using the simulated mekong river water and a representative wastewater for example the qe values of the zmae were about 15 and 13 mg p g for the simulated mekong river water and wastewater effluent respectively even in the presence of excess sulfate whereas the that of the pristine ae resin appeared to be very low for the simulated mekong river water and wastewater effluent showing the capability of the potential applications of the zmae for selective phosphate removal in common water wastewater within the presence of multi anions other than phosphate ions fig 8 b shows the result of the column study of the zmae with a simulated water compared with that of the pristine ae resin as shown in fig 8 b zmae had an extremely effective removal of phosphate compared with that of the pristine ae resin for instance zmae achieved about 4400 bvs considering the allowance of the phosphate concentration of discharging water 0 5 mg p po4 l whereas the pristine ae resin achieved only about 70 bv demonstrating the great potential of the zmae application for selective phosphate removal from various waters 4 conclusion it was successfully fabricated a hybrid zmae which is nanoscale zirconium molybdate embedded within a commercial macroporous anion exchange resin the zmae showed excellent selectivity toward phosphate which much superior to that of the hybrid zae or pristine ae resin supported by specific interaction of phosphate and the molybdate component of the loaded zm nps there was about 62 of the phosphate capacity of the zmae served the selective adsorption in the presence of excess sulfate ion the great selectivity of phosphate of the zmae was given by the attribution of the zm nps 69 96 of the selective capacity which not only exhibited itself excellent selectivity toward phosphate ion but also contributed to enhance the selective phosphate adsorption of the supported ae resin application of the zmae for removal of phosphate from synthetic water showed a great potential of treatment with over 4400 bvs of effective treatment capacity from 2 mg l p po4 to below 0 5 mg l p po4 compared with the pristine ae resin less than 70 bvs these results promise a high potential of field application of the zmae for effective removal of phosphate from wastewater acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions to improve the quality of this

19689,development of a selective adsorbent with an enhanced removal efficiency for phosphate from wastewater is urgently needed here a hybrid adsorbent of nanoscale zirconium molybdate embedded in a macroporous anion exchange resin zmae is proposed for the selective removal of phosphate the zmae consists of a low agglomeration of zirconium molybdate nanoparticles zm nps dispersed within the structure of the anion exchange ae resin as major results the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zmae 26 1 mg p g in the presence of excess sulfate 5 mm is superior to that of the pristine ae resin 1 8 mg p g although their phosphate uptake capacity was similar in the absence of sulfate and these results were supported by the high selectivity coefficient of the zmae toward phosphate over sulfate spo4 so4 more than 100 times compared to the pristine ae resin this superior selective performance of the zmae for phosphate in the presence of sulfate ions is well explained by the role of the zm nps that contributed to 69 of the phosphate capacity which is based on an observation that the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zm nps is not affected by the presence of sulfate in addition the behavior of the selective phosphate removal by the zmae was well demonstrated by not only in the batch mode experiment with simulated mekong river water and representative wastewater effluent but also in a column test graphical abstract image 1 keywords selective removal of phosphate zirconium molybdate anion exchange resin hybrid phosphate removal 1 introduction the occurrence of excess phosphate is one of the main sources causing the eutrophication of lakes rivers and coastal regions eutrophication has become a widespread problem deteriorating water quality which has led to an accumulation of organic maters plants and algae and the development of color and odor in water as well su et al 2013 yang et al 2014 therefore developing effective technologies for reducing phosphate in wastewater going into river and lake waters has been one of the urgent strategies for controlling the eutrophication problem in recent decades among current technologies adsorption technologies have been an alternative to biological and chemical precipitation processes due to their simple operation environmental friendliness and effective removal of low level phosphate concentrations li et al 2014 su et al 2013 thus developing selective adsorbents for improving the efficiency of the adsorption process has become a critical issue in recent years organic inorganic nanocomposites based adsorbent which consist of inorganic nanoparticles nps and organic support matrix have been considered as alternative adsorbents due to their selective performance toward target ions in addition this approach for hybrid adsorbents is presumed to be one of the solutions for overcoming the inherent problems of nps such as poor mechanical hydraulic properties clogging the column and separation difficulty pan et al 2009a 2014 for this purpose various composite adsorbents have been synthesized and examined for phosphate adsorption which consist of metal oxides nps e g hydrated ferric oxide and zirconium oxide dispersed into a porous structure of an organic host e g activated carbon graphite xu et al 2015 yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 mesoporous silica zheng et al 2016 chitosan jiang et al 2013 liu and zhang 2015 zeolites guaya et al 2015 xie et al 2015 or functional polymer blaney et al 2007 pan et al 2009c song et al 2016 you et al 2016 particularly ion exchange polymers have been reported as good candidates for a polymer matrix of a hybrid adsorbent due to their donnan effect resulting from the fixed charges cumbal and sengupta 2005 pan et al 2013 despite the limited success of the anion exchange resin as a matrix for the enhancing adsorption capacity and efficiency for phosphate removal cumbal and sengupta 2005 du et al 2013 selective adsorption for phosphate removal remains a challenging issue because the anion exchanger resin in a hybrid adsorbent rapidly loses its adsorption capacity in the presences of excess sulfate ions which is inevitable in wastewater conditions awual and jyo 2011 pan et al 2009b thus developing a selective adsorbent is urgently required to achieve a high removal efficiency of phosphate from wastewater pan et al 2009b therefore the aim of this study was to develop a novel molybdate based nanocomposite adsorbent for selective phosphate removal which was a hybrid of nanoscale zirconium molybdate and a macroporous anion exchange resin zmae the performance of the zmae was evaluated by adsorption studies in the absences presence of excessive sulfate 5 mm compared with that of the pristine ae resin furthermore the zmae was used with simulated mekong river water in batch mode and simulated waste effluent in a fixed bed column test to test its practical use 2 experiments and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals all chemicals including the pristine ae resin used in this study were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa zirconium molybdate zm nps ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o and zirconium iv oxychloride octahydrate zrocl2 8h2o were used as received the anion exchange ae resin used in this study was a macroporous strong base anion exchange resin with a polystyrene divinylbenzene matrix a dowex marathon msa 640 50 μm prior to use the resin was washed with a hydrochloric acid solution replacing the anionic form with chloride ions and then rinsed with ethanol for 24 h and dried at room temperature 2 2 synthesis of the zmae adsorbent in this study the zmae was fabricated as follows to fabricate the zmae 10 g of the ae resin was added to a 100 ml of 0 05 m nh4 6mo7o24 solution with shaking for 8 h this treated ae resin was immersed in a 100 ml of 0 2 m zrocl2 solution containing 5 sodium chloride with shaking for 24 h to precipitate the zm nps inside the ae resin this ae resin containing the zm nps was washed with deionized water and ethanol finally the zmae was obtained after drying at 50 55 c the zmae was compared with the zirconium oxide embedded ae resin zae for the purpose of examining the potential role of mo component in the zmae for the phosphate adsorption the zae only containing zirconium oxide instead of zirconium molybdate was synthesized following the method reported in the previous studies padungthon et al 2015 pan et al 2013 which was similar with the synthetic procedure for the zmae the only difference was that the hydrated zirconium oxide was precipitated with a 5 naoh solution instead of the nh4 6mo7o24 solution 2 3 analytical methods the phosphate concentration was analyzed with the molybdenum blue method using a uv vis spectrometer 8453 e uv vis agilent usa murphy and riley 1962 tsang et al 2007 low concentrations of phosphate below 0 05 mg l were analyzed with an icp analyzer icp ms varian 820 ms varian australia the contents of zr and mo loaded in the hybrid adsorbents zmae and zae were determined with icp aes after digesting with mixed acids hcl h2so4 and hclo4 the morphology and surface characteristics of the zmae were

adsorbent were measured with a bet analyzer asap 2000 micromeritics usa the phpzc point of zero charge of the zmae was determined by the drift method fan et al 2011 2 4 batch adsorption experiments phosphate adsorption isotherm experiments with the zmae 0 5 g l were carried out in the batch mode with a shaking glass bottle 100 ml containing 50 ml of a phosphate solution 5 50 mg l of p po4 at an initial ph of 5 5 without adjusting during adsorption for 24 h and compared with the zae and the pristine ae resin all batch mode experiments were conducted in a shaker at a constant temperature 25 c these experiments were conducted in the absence and presence of excess sulfate ions 5 mm in addition a kinetic study with zmae 0 5 g l in the absence and presence of high sulfate 5 mm was performed in phosphate solution 10 mg l of p po4 0 31 mm 200 ml and compared with the pristine ae resin at the predetermined time 0 5 2 ml of this solution were withdrawn to measure the phosphate concentration regeneration of the zmae was successively examined with adsorption desorption experiments of phosphate ion for adsorption step the experiments with the zmae 50 mg 50 ml were carried out in the batch mode containing 10 mg l p po4 with shaking 200 rpm at ph of 5 5 for 24 h the desorption step was performed in the condition of 0 1 m naoh 5 ml for 2 h at 200 rpm shaking the adsorption and desorption efficiencies were calculated as follows po 4 adsorbed po 4 removed po 4 initial 100 po 4 desorbed po 4 desorbed po 4 removed 100 2 5 determination of the selectivity coefficient of zmae the selectivity of the zmae 0 5 g l for phosphate ions over sulfate ions was measured in mixed solutions of equal concentrations of phosphate and sulfate ions for three different conditions 0 25 0 75 and 2 0 mm at ph 5 for 24 h equilibrium condition and compared with that of the pristine ae resin the selectivity coefficient spo4 so4 for either the zmae or the pristine ae resin was defined as the ratio of the distribution coefficients of the two respective ions between solution and adsorbent liu et al 2013 petrova et al 2015 s p o 4 s o 4 d p o 4 d s o 4 where dpo4 or dso4 l of solution g of adsorbent is the distribution coefficient of phosphate and sulfate ions respectively the distribution coefficient d was defined as follows d p o 4 q e p o 4 c e p o 4 or d s o 4 q e s o 4 c e s o 4 where qe mmol g and ce mmol l are the adsorption capacity and the concentration of the phosphate or sulfate in the equilibrated solution respectively 2 6 quantitative determination of the selective phosphate property of the zmae to evaluate the contribution of the zm nps to the selectivity of the zmae the phosphate capacity of two different sites within the zmae i the quaternary ammonium groups r4n of the ae resin and ii the zm nps were obtained separately in the following manner with the assumption that the zmae has only these two different types of sites for phosphate adsorption refer to the tem image in fig 1 a first the number of r4n groups of the pristine ae resin and the ae resin within the zmae was estimated by the ion exchange capacity iec meq g with a conventional titration method using chloride karas et al 2014 if the ion exchange behavior of the r4n of the ae resin inside the zmae is identical with that of the pristine ae resin the fraction of the number of r4n functional groups of the ae resin within the zmae over that of the pristine ae resin f the mass fraction of the ae within the zmae was obtained by equation 1 this assumption is supported by that the chloride adsorption on the zm nps was negligible refer to fig s2 in si 1 f q r 4 n i n z m a e q r 4 n i n a e q m a e i n z m a e q m a e 2 q m zmae q m n p s in zmae q m a e i n zmae where f is the fraction of the number of r4n functional groups in the ae resin within the zmae over that of the pristine ae resin q r4n in zmae is the number of r4n groups of the ae resin within the zmae per weight of the zmae meq g q r4n in ae is the number of r4n groups per weight of the pristine ae resin meq g qm ae in zmae is the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae resin inside the zmae per weight of the zmae mg of p g of zmae qm ae is the maximum phosphate capacity of the pristine ae resin mg of p g of ae qm zmae is the maximum phosphate capacity of the zmae mg of p g of zmae qm nps in zmae is the maximum phosphate capacity of the zm nps inside the zmae per weight of the zmae mg of p g of z mae second the maximum phosphate capacity of the zm nps within the zmae q m n p s in zmae was obtained by subtracting the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae resin within the zmae q m a e i n zmae from the maximum phosphate capacity of the zmae q m zmae shown in equation 2 both the q m zmae and q m a e i n zmae values were obtained from the phosphate isotherm experiments using the zmae and ae resin with the estimation of langmuir isotherm model on the other hand in the presence of excess sulfate the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae in the zmae can be estimated with equation 3 3 q m a e i n z m a e q m z m a e q m n p s in zmae where the additional in q m z m a e q m n p s i n z m a e and q m a e i n z m a e denotes the condition with the presence of excess sulfate respectively the value of q m zmae mg p g zmae was obtained in the same manner as done with qm nps in zmae the q m nps in zmae value was assumed to be identical with qm nps in zmae because the experimental results of zm nps for the phosphate adsorption was not affected at all by the presence of excess sulfate ions refer to fig s3 in si 2 7 ph effect on the phosphate adsorption and stability of the zmae to examine the ph effect on the phosphate adsorption of the zmae a batch adsorption experiment was conducted in a ph range from 2 to 11 under the same condition additionally to evaluate the stability of the zmae with respect to the ph the amounts of zirconium and molybdenum species from the zmae were measured a solution containing 1 g l of the zmae was stirred for 48 h with a varying ph range from 1 to 13 then the filtered supernatant solution was used to measure the zirconium and molybdenum concentration by icp aes the solution ph was maintained by adding hcl or naoh solution during the stability experiments 2 8 application of the zmae with simulated mekong river water and wastewater effluent to examine the feasibility of the zmae for practical applications batch adsorption and fixed bed column experiments were conducted with simulated mekong river water and typical wastewater effluent with the excess presence of phosphate and other coexisting ions respectively the ph condition was adjusted to an acidic condition around ph 4 4 to minimize the release of the molybdate species from the zmae the composition of the simulated mekong river water was as follows cl 50 mg l hco3 150 mg l and so4 2 70 mg l as competing ions and p po4 10 mg l at ph 4 5 huang et al 2009 the simulated wastewater effluent with an excess presence of phosphate was as follows cl 150 mg l hco3 150 mg l and so4 2 200 mg l with 10 mg l of p po4 at ph 4 5 blaney et al 2007 in addition a fixed bed column experiment was conducted with a glass column 12 50 mm in diameter and length packed with the zmae 5 ml and feed water at a constant temperature 25 c using a water bath the composition of the feed water was as follows phosphate p po4 2 0 mg l and other co existing anions cl 110 mg l hco3 150 mg l so4 2 120 mg l at ph 4 3 4 4 with a constant flow rate of 1 25 ml min empty bed contact time ebct 4 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of the zmae fig 1 and table 1 show the physicochemical characterization of the zmae fabricated in this study as shown in fig 1 a and table 1 the zm nps were successfully loaded into the structure of the ae resin with low agglomeration and their size was about 8 9 1 7 nm n 50 particles the zm nps with a poor crystalline in nature and the higher bet surface area of the zmae compared to the pristine ae resin table 1 are presumed to be favorable for phosphate adsorption refer to fig s1 a in si cumbal and sengupta 2005 pan et al 2009c the ftir spectra of the zmae in contrast with the pristine ae resin show the specific peaks characterizing the zirconium molybdate embedded inside the zmae fig 1 b for example the peaks at the region of 800 950 cm 1 indicate the presence of the molybdate group for the loaded nps inamuddin and ismail 2010 nabi et al 2010 additionally the ftir spectrum of the zmae was distinguishable from the pristine ae resin by the peaks in the range of 450 550 cm 1 indicating the stretching vibration of the metal oxygen zr o and mo o nabi et al 2010 uhlrich et al 2011 the inherent characteristic of the quaternary ammonium functional in the ae support resin was observed in the vibration of the merging stretching hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups and hydroxyl groups of adsorbed water 3500 3300 cm 1 c h peak 3000 cm 1 and c c peak 1650 cm 1 kociolek balawejder et al 2016 shah and chudasama 2014 these results indicate that the zmae possesses not only the specific properties of the loaded zm nps but also the anion exchange properties of the r4n functional groups in the ae resin furthermore the presence of zirconium and molybdenum in the zmae was confirmed by icp aes with weight percent of 4 3 and 14 7 table 1 and by xps spectra with their oxidation states of zr 4 and mo 6 refer to fig s1 b in si respectively as shown in fig 1 b the structure of the polymer matrix and functional group in the zmae appeared to be very similar with that of the pristine ae resin however the surface area of the zmae containing the zm nps within the ae resin was increased from 22 2 to 28 3 m2 g which is explained by the poor crystalline nature of the zm nps table 1 3 2 selective phosphate adsorption of the zmae 3 2 1 effective phosphate adsorption of the zmae fig 2 shows the phosphate adsorption performance of the zmae compared with the pristine ae resin in terms of the kinetic behavior a and adsorption isotherm b 5 mm of sulfate and the effect of a competing ion concentration c as shown in fig 2 a in the absence of competing ions sulfate ions the difference in the phosphate uptake between the zmae and the pristine ae resin is not much 64 and 62 removal for the zmae and the ae for 90 min respectively one difference is that the phosphate uptake of the zmae steadily occurred even up to 9 h whereas the pristine ae resin quickly reached equilibrium on the other hand as shown in fig 2 a in the presence of excess sulfate ions 5 mm the phosphate uptake of the pristine ae resin became negligible even after 9 h only 3 removal possibly due to the interfering effect from the presence of excess competing ions 5 mm of sulfate yang et al 2015 whereas the zmae exhibited still a much higher phosphate uptake capability 48 removal at 9 h showing that the zmae had not only a higher phosphate removal efficiency in the absence of sulfate ions but also a selective property even in the presence of sulfate ions compared with the ae resin fig 2 b shows the phosphate adsorption isotherm of the zmae compared with the pristine ae resin for the whole range of phosphate concentrations in fig 2 b the phosphate adsorption of the zmae was higher than that of the pristine ae resin regardless of the presence of excess sulfate as expected from the result of fig 2 a however these differences between the zmae and ae became more drastic in the presence of excess sulfate because phosphate adsorption by the ae resin becomes greatly hindered in the presence of sulfate for example in case of the zmae the maximum adsorption capacity qm value obtained by langmuir isotherm model was decreased by 38 from 42 2 to 26 1 mg p g in the presence of excess sulfate whereas the qm of the pristine ae resin was significantly diminished by 96 from 43 1 to 1 8 mg p g fig 2 c shows the phosphate adsorption with respect to increasing sulfate concentration compared with the ae resin as shown in fig 2 c phosphate removal by the zmae was maintained at over about 55 of the removal even at an extremely high concentration of sulfate although it decreased slowly with an increasing sulfate concentration whereas the phosphate removal of the pristine ae resin quickly dropped to almost zero 3 2 2 selectivity coefficient of the zmae for phosphate ions relative to sulfate ions table 2 shows the distribution coefficients of phosphate and sulfate dpo4 and dso4 and the selectivity coefficients of the zmae for phosphate removal over sulfate spo4 so4 compared with the pristine ae resin which were examined in a mixed solution of identical concentrations of phosphate and sulfate 0 25 mm 2 0 mm at ph 5 for 24 h equilibrium condition as shown in table 2 the spo4 so4 value of the zmae was 7 0 in the mixed solution of phosphate and sulfate 0 25 mm each indicating that the dpo4 was 7 times higher compared to the dso4 under the same condition the spo4 so4 value of the pristine ae resin was 0 086 indicating that the pristine ae resin adsorbed sulfate much more therefore this result of selectivity compared between the zmae and pristine ae resin supports the great performance of the zmae for phosphate adsorption in the presence of excess sulfate ions shown in fig 2 3 2 3 chemical characterization for selective phosphate adsorption of the zmae fig 3 shows the results of the xps analysis in terms of the o1s a and p2p b spectra with respect to phosphate adsorption as shown in fig 3 a the clear change of the o1s spectra of the zmae indicates a specific interaction between the loaded zm nps and phosphate ions because of phosphate adsorption for example the change in quantity of the two overlapped peaks of the o1s xps spectra at 530 5 and 531 9 ev corresponding to oxide oxygen o and hydroxyl group oh after the phosphate adsorption reveals a new bonding formation between the surface zm nps and phosphate species su et al 2013 the initial content of the oh peak in the o1s total peak dropped after reacting with phosphate corresponding to the relative increase of the o peak content this change in the o1s spectra means that the hydroxyl surface group of the zm nps in the hybrid is replaced by the phosphate group during the adsorption process on the other hand the p2p xps spectra of the zmae in fig 3 b appeared in two main peaks at 133 8 and 132 8 ev corresponding to the p5 state show the specific interaction between the phosphate and the surface of the zm nps bai et al 2016 yao et al 2013 as a result of phosphate adsorption onto the zmae fig 4 shows the ftir spectra of the zmae with respect to phosphate adsorption as shown in fig 4 the adsorption of phosphate produces a slightly negative shift in the stretching vibration of the molybdate component from the region of 800 946 cm 1 to 750 930 cm 1 possibly resulting from a specific interaction between the phosphate ion and molybdate component of the zmae forming a complex of phosphomolybdate berchmans et al 2011 zezza et al 2012 in addition a new broad and intense peak was observed at 1052 cm 1 indicating the asymmetry vibration of the p o bond of the adsorbed phosphate after the phosphate adsorption su et al 2013 the appearance of this peak confirms the surface adsorption of the phosphate onto the loaded nps su et al 2013 yao et al 2013 as demonstrated in the xps analysis fig 3 3 3 interpretation of the selective phosphate selectivity of the zmae fig 5 shows the phosphate adsorption distribution of the zmae qm ae in zmae qm nps in zmae q m nps in zmae and q m ae in zmae compared with that of the pristine ae resin with or without the excess sulfate qm ae and q m ae note that the values of qm ae q m ae qm zmae and q m zmae were previously mentioned in fig 2 as previously described in the experimental section the contributions of the zm nps in the zmae for phosphate capacity qm nps in zmae were obtained from equations 1 and 2 these contributions of the zm nps in the zmae for phosphate capacity were calculated based on the observation of the negligible effect of the excess sulfate on the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zm nps refer to fig s3 in si the f value equation 1 the fraction of the number of r4n functional groups in the ae resin within the zmae over the pristine ae resin was obtained as 0 56 q r4n in ae 3 42 meq g and q r4n in zmae 1 92 meq g indicating that the ae resin within the zmae occupied around 56 wt of the zmae which has a phosphate capacity of 24 1 mg p g qm ae in zmae fig 5 it was noted that the phosphate capacity 24 1 mg g or 0 78 meq g calculated from experimental data is less than the qr4n value 1 92 meq g one of the explanations for this discrepancy can be from the multiprotic property of phosphoric acid pka1 2 1 pka2 7 2 pka3 12 3 chitrakar et al 2006 inside the ae resin phosphate may be present partly as hpo4 2 and therefore occupy two r4n sites in the resin on the other hand it can be explained by that h2po4 ion may be not effectively exchanged with chloride ion of the ae resin due to the similar affinity of r4n inside the ae resin toward both h2po4 and cl awual and jyo 2011 then qm nps in zmae became 18 1 mg p g which occupied 43 of the qm zmae this is explained in case i shown in fig 5 the contribution of qm nps in zmae was increased to 69 in the presence of excess sulfate because the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae within the zmae was decreased from 24 1 to 8 0 mg p g in contrast with case i the second approach was made case ii to characterize the phosphate adsorption distribution of the zmae in the presence of excess sulfate in this approach the maximum phosphate capacity of the pristine ae resin q m ae mg p g was maintained in the maximum phosphate capacity of the ae resin within the zmae qm ae in zmae assuming the consistency of the adsorption behavior of r4n for both the pristine ae resin and ae resin within the zmae then q m nps in zmae was obtained as 25 1 mg p g from a q m zmae of 26 1 mg p g because the ae resin inside the zmae occupied around 56 wt of the zmae and q m ae in zmae became 1 0 mg p g showing the higher contributions of the zm nps in the zmae for phosphate capacity compared with the case i approach consequently both approaches case i ii indicate that the major contribution of the zm nps in the zmae is for the selective phosphate removal in addition the advantages of zirconium molybdate in the zmae over zirconium oxide in the zae for phosphate adsorption are well demonstrated in fig s4 si showing that the zmae exhibited the better selectivity the maximum adsorption capacity of 26 1 mg g estimated by langmuir model than the zae the maximum adsorption capacity of 8 4 mg g estimated by langmuir model for almost all the concentration range of phosphate in the presence of excess sulfate ion although the adsorption capacities of the zmae 42 2 mg g estimated by langmuir model and the zae 46 7 mg g estimated by langmuir model appeared to be similar in the absence of excess sulfate ion this is well explained by the specific reaction of molybdate with phosphate to form phosphomolybdate complexes hori 1977 zhao et al 1996 in which the complex of 12 phosphomolybdic acid has been specifically applied for trace analysis of phosphate for many decades molybdenum blue method bobtelsky and barzily 1963 ma et al 2014 note that the zr contents of the zmae and the zae was similar as 4 3 and 4 9 wt respectively for this comparison 3 4 the ph effect on the phosphate adsorption capacity and chemical stability of the zmae fig 6 shows the ph effect on the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zmae a and on the chemical stability of the zmae focusing on the release of the molybdenum and zirconium species b as shown in fig 6 a the phosphate adsorption capacity appears to be quite dependent upon the ph conditions the phosphate capacity was the highest in the ph range of 3 5 possibly due to the favorable complexation of the molybdate and phosphate at acidic ph and the electrostatic attraction between the r4n functional groups in the ae resin inside the zmae and h2p o 4 pka2 of 7 20 chitrakar et al 2006 hori 1977 zhao et al 1996 meanwhile the phosphate adsorption capacity decreased as the ph increased over 5 even though the amount of negatively charged phosphate was increased on the other hand as shown in fig 6 b molybdenum species started to be released beyond ph 6 which is a disadvantage for practical applications at neutral or basic conditions whereas no zirconium species were released from the zmae even at basic conditions further improvement is required to prevent the release of the molybdenum species at neutral or basic conditions although the ion exchange polymer matrix inside the zmae contributed to delaying the release of the molybdenum species inside the zmae compared with the case of the bare zm nps refer to fig s5 in si in addition it is necessary to maintain the ph of water at not higher than ph 6 in order to maintain the stability of the zmae 3 5 the regeneration of the zmae fig 7 shows the results about the regeneration of the zmae with the five successive cycles of phosphate adsorption desorption as shown in fig 7 the regeneration efficiency or re adsorption efficiency black bar maintained more than 70 up to the 5th cycle of adsorption desorption experiments the lowering regeneration efficiency with respect to subsequent cycle is explained by the mo leaching during the desorption process at alkaline condition as previously mentioned in fig 6 b on the other hand the phosphate adsorbed adsorbents was effectively regenerated by 0 1 m naoh solution 92 0 3 0 of phosphate desorption efficiency although more efforts were made to find out the regenerant solution other than alkaline solution 0 1 m naoh in order to overcome the problem of mo leaching during the desorption process at alkaline condition it was noted that perchlorate perchloric acid sulfate sulfuric acid were not effective at all as regenerant solutions 3 6 application of the zmae for phosphate removal in simulated water the batch adsorption experiments and column experiments with the zmae in a slightly acidic ph were carried out to examine the feasibility of the zmae for use in potential applications and compared with the pristine ae resin fig 8 as shown in fig 8 a the phosphate adsorption capacity of the zmae was relatively sustained compared with the pristine ae resin when using the simulated mekong river water and a representative wastewater for example the qe values of the zmae were about 15 and 13 mg p g for the simulated mekong river water and wastewater effluent respectively even in the presence of excess sulfate whereas the that of the pristine ae resin appeared to be very low for the simulated mekong river water and wastewater effluent showing the capability of the potential applications of the zmae for selective phosphate removal in common water wastewater within the presence of multi anions other than phosphate ions fig 8 b shows the result of the column study of the zmae with a simulated water compared with that of the pristine ae resin as shown in fig 8 b zmae had an extremely effective removal of phosphate compared with that of the pristine ae resin for instance zmae achieved about 4400 bvs considering the allowance of the phosphate concentration of discharging water 0 5 mg p po4 l whereas the pristine ae resin achieved only about 70 bv demonstrating the great potential of the zmae application for selective phosphate removal from various waters 4 conclusion it was successfully fabricated a hybrid zmae which is nanoscale zirconium molybdate embedded within a commercial macroporous anion exchange resin the zmae showed excellent selectivity toward phosphate which much superior to that of the hybrid zae or pristine ae resin supported by specific interaction of phosphate and the molybdate component of the loaded zm nps there was about 62 of the phosphate capacity of the zmae served the selective adsorption in the presence of excess sulfate ion the great selectivity of phosphate of the zmae was given by the attribution of the zm nps 69 96 of the selective capacity which not only exhibited itself excellent selectivity toward phosphate ion but also contributed to enhance the selective phosphate adsorption of the supported ae resin application of the zmae for removal of phosphate from synthetic water showed a great potential of treatment with over 4400 bvs of effective treatment capacity from 2 mg l p po4 to below 0 5 mg l p po4 compared with the pristine ae resin less than 70 bvs these results promise a high potential of field application of the zmae for effective removal of phosphate from wastewater acknowledgement the authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions to improve the quality of this
