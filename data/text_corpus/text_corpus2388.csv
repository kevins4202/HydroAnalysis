kathmandu nepal corresponding author groundwater potential gwp mapping of an area is the initial stage of assessing groundwater for further investigation leading towards exploitation of the resources to meet the water demand for various sectors groundwater availability is explicitly important especially in the mountainous area in the himalayan region in practice different combinations of parameters are used to prepare gwp map however the sensitivity of parameters are poorly assessed this paper aims to evaluate the sensitivity of parameter for delineating groundwater potential using gis and remote sensing multi criteria decision analysis mcda technique is used to prepare groundwater potential map of khadadevi manthali area ramechhap district of bagmati province nepal nine influencing parameters are considered in the present analysis which were integrated through assigning normalized weight to the thematic layers and their classes using analytical hierarchical process ahp further groundwater potential maps have been prepared for 7 different cases using different combination of parameters and for each case the results were successively validated with 21 springs and 3 tube wells spatially distributed within the study area the results show that the gwp maps prepared using the lineament and hydro geomorphic maps yield better result the roc auc curve receiver operating characteristic curve area under curve for gwp map prepared using 9 parameters shows higher prediction accuracy 72 4 as compared to other cases thus we conclude that lineament and hydro geomorphology of an area are most influencing factors in delineating gwp zones in mountainous area of himalayan region and the nine parameters considered in the present study can be applied in also other areas of the region for preparing gwp map graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential mapping multi criteria decision analysis mcda analytical hierarchy process ahp sensitivity analysis remote sensing and gis nepal himalaya 1 introduction groundwater is considered as a precious source of fresh water that is distributed at almost every place in nature patra et al 2018 further groundwater plays principal role in maintaining ecological balance human well being and economic development smithson 2002 the continuously increasing demand for groundwater due to growing population expanding cultivation area demanding additional water for irrigation and economic progress compromising the environment sustainability has stressed on its careful utilization maurya and kumar 2017 the total groundwater withdrawal at global scale and used for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes are respectively around 36 42 and 27 taylor et al 2013 hydrogeological investigations and exploitation in indo gangetic plain has been extensively carried out in nepal especially to meet the irrigation and drinking water demand pathak 2017a 2017b 2018 however hydrogeology in the mountainous area is least studied even though the mountain people heavily depend on groundwater resources for domestic use at present few studies have been made in such area which are mainly focused to groundwater potential mapping and groundwater resilience bricker et al 2014 ghosh et al 2016 khadka and pathak 2020 pathak and gautam 2019 pathak and shrestha 2016 the occurrences of groundwater are controlled by various geological factors such as slope aspect lithology geomorphology drainage density lineament density land use topographic wetness index etc geomorphology of an area is an important factor used for assessing the groundwater potential and recharge potential because it has significant influence on groundwater recharge movement and storage the drainage density expresses the closeness of spacing of stream channels thus providing a quantitative measurement of the average length of stream channels in a basin singh et al 2014 strahler 1964 the drainage density has an inverse relation with the permeability of the soil hence plays a vital role in the runoff distribution and level of infiltration the geological structure like discontinuities fracture joint fault lineaments etc also control the occurrence and flow of groundwater in particular direction global climate change has effect in nepal as well and has been identified as one of four global hotspots for the risk caused by climate change bahir et al 2020 khadka and pathak 2016 moste 2014 silwal et al 2020 there is growing demand of water in the mountainous region and difficulty to use surface water for domestic use the natural springs are either drying up or the discharge has been decreasing which is going to be severe in future with the changing pattern of rainfall khadka and pathak 2020 mishra and singh 2019 groundwater exploitation through drilled wells has already begun in the mountainous region without proper understanding of the delicate mountain aquifer system the earlier works leading to delineation of groundwater potential in nepal himalaya mostly considered common terrain parameters like geology drainage density lineament density slope land use precipitation e g pathak and shrestha 2016 however the influencing parameters have not been well assessed the significance of geomorphology and hydro geomorphology is not well considered for gwp mapping in nepal in small catchment the precipitation is least influencing as it does not significantly vary within the area kumar et al 2014 the groundwater potential mapping in different parts of the world have considered lithology lineament density slope drainage density soil as influencing factors for the groundwater potential duan et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 in addition to above factors some authors have considered geomorphology e g hussein et al 2017 the hydro geomorphic study that has been widely carried out in several regions of the globe adewumi and anifowose 2017 guida et al 2016 sidle and onda 2004 teixeira et al 2013 the hydro geomorphic approach for groundwater assessment has been proved as successful approach however it has not been applied in nepalese context it is adopted in the present work so that the hydrogeological assessment in mountainous areas of nepal could lead towards sustainable exploitation of the groundwater resources furthermore the use of ahp method is widely used elsewhere but are least applied in nepalese case the use of this technique that is well established elsewhere for the delineation of gwp has been emphasized in present study the yield of the drilled wells is mostly used to validate the gwp map das 2019 fenta et al 2015 hussein et al 2017 kumar et al 2016 in other cases the groundwater level data is used to validate the model e g kumar et al 2016 however in the nepalese case the boreholes are almost negligible in the mountainous area and hence neither the yield data nor water level data can be used for model validation therefore the spring locations are used as validating parameter the sensitivity of parameters for delineating groundwater potential has been assessed for other parts of the globe das 2019 fenta et al 2015 kumar et al 2014 however this is the first approach of evaluating parameter sensitivity for assessing groundwater potential in the mountainous area of nepal himalaya thereby suggesting most influencing parameter thus the present work is expected to further enhance the method of mountain groundwater exploration in nepal himalaya 1 1 study area study area covers khadadevi gaupalika and manthali municipality with geographical area of 48 73 sq km in ramechhap district bagmati province nepal fig 1 sunkoshi river flows from the southwest part of the study area and tama koshi river flows from the south east it is bounded by longitude 85 57 39 013 e 86 03 52 697 e and latitude 27 26 38 746 n 27 21 05 162 n the study area lies about 127 km east of the kathmandu valley the area falls in the hilly region 500 m 1490 m above sea level which is characterized by elevated mountains river valley spurs saddles ridges and valley the average annual rainfall in the area is 1372 mm most of which occur during summer monsoon rainfall while the winter rainfall is low the area is represented by the proterozoic rocks of the nawakot complex which represent the lesser himalayan sequence dhital 2015 with the phyllite amphibolites meta sandstone and schist rocks 2 materials and methods recent technological advances have brought gis cartographic techniques to the forefront as tools for recommending water management methods ballukraya and kalimuthu 2010 chowdary et al 2003 jaiswal et al 2003 jha 2011 jha et al 2007 nag and saha 2014 yeh et al 2009 the multi criteria approach which encompasses several types of layers of information e g topography climatology lithology structure slope drainage geomorphology hydrogeology land cover land use has been greatly enhanced by the versatile development of gis hardware and software díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 ettazarini 2007 mussa et al 2020 valverde et al 2016 the elevation data on the digital topographic data of the department of survey government of nepal has been used to prepare digital elevation model dem slope aspect and drainage density the same data was used to prepare twi based on beven and kirkby 1979 the google earth image was used to digitize land use land cover map which was updated in the field lineament was extracted through hillshade prepared from the digital elevation model mallast et al 2011 qari 2011 this process was further supported by the interpretation of satellite image similarly geomorphology and hydro geomorphology maps were prepared in the field while the geological information was extracted from the regional geological map of the area dhital 2015 the drainage density was prepared from the digital elevation model 20 m х 20 m resolution similarly the topographic wetness index twi was prepared based on the runoff model topmodel developed by beven and kirkby 1979 which is calculated as twi ln scaled flow accumulation tan slope where scaled flow accumulation flow accumulation 1 cell size tan slope is calculated as slope slope generated using dem 1 570796 90 tan slope con slope 0 tan slope 0 001 where ln con and tan are the function further the hydro geomorphology of the study area was initially assessed through the digital elevation model dem which was useful to evaluate the terrain condition later on the map was updated during the field investigation keeping in mind the groundwater occurrence in different geomorphic units preparing series of thematic maps to be used as input data for the analysis is of prime importance adewumi and anifowose 2017 thus input maps were prepared consisting of geological and geomorphologic features lithology lineament geomorphology and hydro geomorphology land cover drainage slope aspect and topographic wetness as well as other relevant information for the site investigation fig 2 once all data were registered in the spatial database weights and ranks of each thematic layer influencing parameters were calculated using analytical hierarchical process ahp and overlaid in gis platform using raster calculator the weights for each thematic layer and rank for respective classes have been calculated by ahp method and the thematic layers were integrated in gis environment kim et al 2009 saaty 2002 groundwater potential map was generated and the map was classified into high moderate and low potential zone the ahp method was developed by saaty in 1980 karayalcin 1982 saaty 1990 2004 is a structured mathematical method used to organize and analyze complex decision making studies have shown that the ahp technique provides better results in the groundwater related studies kaliraj et al 2014 in order to assess the significance of parameters for developing gwp map ahp analysis was carried out for different number of parameters viz 3 parameters 4 parameters 5 parameters including and excluding hydro geomorphology 6 parameters 8 parameters and 9 parameters the significance of hydro geomorphic parameter was assessed with seven different cases with different combination of parameters developing gwp maps 2 1 weight assignment multi criteria decision analysis was employed to determine the respective weights of the determinant thematic layers the ahp procedure applies scale of relative importance from 1 to 9 during pair wise comparison of parameters saaty 1980 the value 1 is assigned for equal importance 3 for moderate importance 5 for strong importance 7 for very strong importance and 9 for extreme importance likewise the values 2 4 6 and 8 are the intermediate values between adjacent scale values and the reciprocal values are assigned for inverse comparison as an example the pairwise comparison matrix for 5 parameters is presented in table 1 further a normalized pairwise comparison matrix is prepared through calculating weight criteria wc i e the ratio of sum of row values for all parameters and number of parameters value which is presented in table 2 the closeness of the matrix to consistency is evaluated through the calculation of the consistency ratio cr in order to calculate the consistency ratio cr the principal eigenvalue λ max is calculated as in table 3 the principal eigenvalue well indicates the consistency of the matrix when there is total consistency the principal eigenvalue λ max should be equal to n the number of parameters another parameter required to calculate the consistency ratio is the consistency index ci which is calculated by c o n s i s t e n c y i n d e x c i a v e r a g e λ m a x n n 1 where n stands for the number of parameters now the consistency ratio cr is calculated from the following relationship c o n s i s t e n c y r a t i o c r c i r i where ri is the random index which depends on the number of influencing factors used the values of ri for different number n of influencing factors parameters as of saaty 1980 are given in table 4 below if cr is less than 0 1 then the relative importance of parameters as judged in the initial pairwise comparison shows significance in all cases with different number of parameters the cr was obtained to less than 0 1 which reflects a reasonable level of consistency in the pair wise comparison phase with good accuracy in spatially predicting of groundwater probability the weight and rank values for the case with nine thematic layers influencing factors is presented in table 5 in this case the consistency ration cr is obtained as 0 06 and average λ max is 9 64 which are quite acceptable values likewise the average λ max and cr values for the classes of each thematic layers are given in table 5 which also lies within the acceptable limits the weights of the influencing factors thematic layers have been assigned according to their significance for groundwater occurrence influencing factors are assessed on the basis of author s knowledge of relative importance of different factors responsible for groundwater occurrence the author s prior experience in groundwater assessment in the mountainous region in similar terrain obtaining adequate knowledge is an important asset to decide and prioritize the controlling factors for the groundwater occurrence and availability in the area in addition the influencing factors are also identified through several literatures e g das 2019 pathak and shrestha 2016 senanayake et al 2016 the normalized weights were developed based on the assigned weight to each feature and pairwise comparison between the feature classes an area having high lineament density is characterized as high groundwater recharge areas mukherjee et al 2012 naghibi et al 2017 nampak et al 2014 rajaveni et al 2017 yeh et al 2016 while areas with high drainage density were assigned very low weight ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 rahmati et al 2015 rajaveni et al 2017 yildiz 2004 areas with gentle slope to flat is given the highest priority for groundwater recharge and storage since it had more concentration time to remain on the ground surface and percolate into the subsurface in contrast steeply sloping areas favor for overland flow limiting percolating to the subsurface and hence such condition is categorized as low significance for contributing to the groundwater in the area rajaveni et al 2017 terrace and thick soils are considered as having good groundwater reserve because the thick soils favor good infiltration of water received from rainfall and channelized flow through it therefore high relative influence values were given to terrace and thick soil classes of the hydro geomorphology influencing factor 2 2 groundwater potential gwp mapping the groundwater potential map was developed by overlaying the determinant groundwater contributing thematic layers pathak and gautam 2019 as given in fig 3 the different groundwater potential zones were evaluated based on the groundwater potential index gwpi computed from the integration of all groundwater influencing thematic layers the weighted overlay analysis tool was used to compute groundwater potential index values using the following equation leake and malczewski 2000 1 g w p i w 1 m j 1 n w j x i where wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer xi is the normalized weight of the ith feature class of the thematic layer m is the total number of thematic layers and n is the total number of features classes of a given factor the gwpi values were used to classify an area in high moderate and low poor groundwater potential zones 2 3 validation the results of groundwater potential maps were validated using the existing spring and tube well data the existing spring data was overlaid with the groundwater potential index map the receiver operating characteristic curve roc and area under the curve auc were used as a performance indicator for the validation of groundwater potential map developed using thematic maps das 2019 naghibi et al 2016 roc curve makes it easy to identify the best threshold for making a decision the approach of roc auc have been applied by some authors for validation of gwp map e g das 2019 it predicts the data based on tpr true positive rate also known as sensitivity and fpr false positive rate also known as 1 specificity the accuracy value of the curve depends on various influencing factors and number of springs that is used to validate the model in addition to roc auc curve analysis simple overlay of productive tube well locations present in the area was done over the gwp map as an additional means to validate the gwp map these wells are productive wells and indicates the adequate availability of groundwater in the area 3 results and discussion 3 1 influencing factor 3 1 1 lithology geology the geological or lithological features of the study area are shown in fig 3a the study area consists of eight different types of lithological features viz phyllite amphibolites metasandstone schist slate shale siltstone and paleozoic granite 3 1 2 land use land cover the land cover map was prepared from the google earth satellite image the study area consists of seven types of land cover viz agriculture forest sparse forest residential area road and others barren land bushes and water bodies sand river the major parts of the landscape were dominated by cultivated agriculture land followed by bushes covering respectively 34 26 and 20 44 of the study area fig 3b 3 1 3 geomorphology the khadadevi manthali area can be classified into 5 types of landforms namely highly dissected hills moderately dissected hills low dissected hills terrace and river valley fig 3c the low dissected hills are distributed throughout the study area while the either sides of the river that is flowing nw se direction are represented by highly dissected hillslopes the maximum area is occupied by low dissected area followed by moderate and low dissected area river terraces occupy around 7 41 of the study area while the waterbody river stream covers only 1 37 of the study area 3 1 4 drainage density drainage density map prepared from the drainage lines in the study area shows that about 38 16 and 37 79 of the total area were found in low density and moderate drainage density classes respectively fig 3d 3 1 5 lineament density lineaments represent the total length of lineaments in a unit area as expressed below yeh et al 2016 ld i 1 i n l i a where ld is lineament density li is the total length of lineament and a is the area the high lineament density is the representation of dense lineaments km per unit area km2 while the low density class represents relatively less dense lineament per square area the high and moderate lineament density classes occupy respectively 24 42 and 46 87 of the total area fig 3e in terms of ground water potentiality the high lineament density facilitates for groundwater recharge and hence is more favorable than low lineament density 3 1 6 slope khadadevi manthali landscape is characterized by undulating terrain varying from plains to steep hill slope and the slope map of the study area was developed from the digital elevation model 20 m х 20 m resolution the study area has been reclassified into four slope classes and the major parts of the landscape lies in the slope class 1 8o 25 which covers 38 22 of the study area fig 3f 3 1 7 aspect aspect is the orientation of slope measured clockwise in degrees from 0 to 360 where 0 is north facing 90 is east facing 180 is south facing and 270 is west facing most of the slope in the study area faces towards south south west and west direction fig 3g 3 1 8 topographic wetness index the major parts of the landscape 54 34 is covered by low twi while 37 49 of the study area has moderate twi and remaining area has high twi fig 3h 3 1 9 hydro geomorphology the hydro geomorphic map shows the area demarcated into different geomorphic units with respect to groundwater occurrence fig 3i the study area was divided into five main hydro geomorphic units namely terrace river river valley thick soil gentle slope moderately thick soil moderate slope and thin soil steep slope the gentle moderate and steep slope refers respectively to thick moderate and thin soil cover maximum area is occupied by gentle slope followed by steep slope and moderate slope area river valley occupies around 10 of the study area while terrace covers 2 68 of the study area the study area appears to have good groundwater potential from the fact that the geomorphic condition like terrace river valley and gently sloping area significantly covers the study area 3 1 10 mountain aquifer map the soil distribution and lithological variation together with hydro geomorphic condition was considered for the preparation of mountain aquifer of the study area fig 4 the mountain aquifer in the study area is mainly divided into aquifers on unconsolidated sediments that comprises of colluviums and residual soils and fractured aquifers in hard rock the aquifers in unconsolidated sediments are categorized as ua 1 and ua 2 ua 1 occurs at the flat to gently sloping area at the lower elevation zones while the unconfined aquifer ua 2 occurs in thick to moderately thick soil cover the fractured aquifers are subdivided into three different categories namely fa 1 that represents the aquifer at the steeper hill slope which is less productive fa 2 that represents the fractured aquifer overlain by very thin soil cover and fa 3 that is underlain by ua 2 which is unconfined in nature ua 1 and fa 3 are the most productive aquifers followed by fa 2 ua 2 and fa 3 the unconfined aquifer ua 1 is distributed on either side of the river valley while the fractured aquifer fa 3 and ua 2 predominantly occupies the study area fa 1 and fa 2 are scattered in the study area 3 2 groundwater potential map the groundwater potential index map of khadadevi manthali landscape has been prepared using ahp one of the widely used multi criteria decision making mcdm system nine parameters case 7 namely geomorphology land use lineament density hydro geomorphology lithology drainage density slope aspect and topographic wetness index twi have been considered for the analysis the weight and rank values for the influencing parameters and their classes were calculated from the ahp and given in table 1 gwpi values were classified into three groups table 6 using roc auc curve classification method the groundwater potential map of the study area using nine parameters shows that the southern and western parts has high potential excellent potential zone due to the flat slope with thick soil concentration which leads to a higher rate of infiltration and accumulation of water in the aquifer fig 5 the resulting groundwater potential map was validated using the success rate curve also called roc auc curve fig 6 it predicts the data based on tpr true positive rate also known as sensitivity plotted in y axis and fpr false positive rate also known as 1 specificity plotted in x axis in roc curve the true positive rate sensitivity is plotted in function of the false positive rate for different cut off points of a parameter each point on the roc curve represents a sensitivity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold the area under the roc curve auc is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups the relationship between auc and prediction accuracy can be summarized as naghibi et al 2015 low potential moderately potential and high potential the roc auc curve for the groundwater potential using nine parameters shows 0 724 area under curve auc indicating 72 4 prediction rate and upper bound of 80 1 showing that the analysis is valid further out of 21 springs in the study area 3 springs fall on low gwp 10 falls on moderate gwp and 8 springs fall on high gwp zones likewise out of 3 productive tube wells all fall on high gwp zone the prediction rate of up to 70 have been obtained for gwp map prepared from 8 thematic layers using ahp method in india das 2019 likewise razandi et al 2015 obtained 73 using the same method with 10 factor maps in the study carried out in iran both the studies were carried out in rather plain area with lots of bore wells with water table data as well as yield data and detailed information on aquifer however the present study area lies entirely in mountainous area with almost negligible information on the aquifer distribution and few bore holes with limited information in spite of this limitation we could get auc value 72 4 and the upper bound value of 80 this result is quite satisfactory and hence the gwp map prepared from ahp method can be considered reasonably representing the field condition as far as the success rate for groundwater potential classes zones is concerned 24 of the study area has a high rank and could explain 42 of total springs of the area likewise 47 of proposed gwp values could explain around 86 of all existing springs thus the three groundwater potential gwp classes are established as low potential less than 53 moderate potential 53 76 and high potential 78 100 using which gwp maps was prepared fig 5 3 3 sensitivity of parameters for groundwater potential mapping though the gwp map using nine parameters have been well validated and can be considered to represent the field condition there are several studies on the sensitivity analysis for groundwater vulnerability mapping e g barbulescu 2020 berhe zenebe et al 2020 saidi et al 2011 thapa et al 2018 however the research on parameter sensitivity for gwp mapping is almost none and the number of significant parameters required for the preparation of gwp map and the sensitivity of parameters is yet to be assessed for the himalayan region in order to bridge this gap gwp maps have been prepared using different combinations of parameters case 1 three parameters hydro geomorphology geomorphology and lithology case 2 four parameters hydro geomorphology land use lineament and lithology case 3 five parameters hydro geomorphology land use lineament slope and lithology case 4 five parameters geomorphology land use lineament slope and lithology case 5 six parameters hydro geomorphology geomorphology land use lineament slope and lithology case 6 eight parameters geomorphology land use lineament slope drainage density aspect twi and lithology and case 7 nine parameters hydro geomorphology geomorphology land use lineament slope aspect drainage density twi and lithology the combination of the parameters was principally chosen focusing to the hydro geomorphology factor aiming to understand its influence in gwp mapping other parameters were selected based on expert judgments such map removal techniques are applied in other literatures too e g fenta et al 2015 the groundwater potential maps for all cases were prepared through the same method as for the nine parameters case 7 the resulting gwp maps for the six cases are presented in fig 7 the gwp maps for all cases were evaluated through the roc auc curve the roc curves are plotted for respective cases fig 8 and the result of the analysis is tabulated in table 7 the success rate curve shows increasing accuracy from case 1 to 3 with the addition of influencing parameters inclusion of lineament and land use parameters significantly increases the accuracy of the analysis i e it increases from 57 4 in case 1 69 5 in case 2 the comparison between case 3 and 4 clearly indicates that the hydro geomorphic parameter is very much influencing factor in the preparation of gwp when the hydro geomorphology parameter in case 3 is replaced with the geomorphology in case 4 the accuracy lowers from 64 6 to 60 4 likewise the number of springs falling in high potential zone in case 3 is decreased in case 4 while the spring numbers falling in low potential zone increases significantly from 2 in case 3 to 8 in case 4 when both the geomorphology and hydro geomorphology parameters are used together with other parameters use in cases 3 and 4 the accuracy becomes only 63 in case 5 which is still less than that of case 3 this indicates that hydro geomorphology parameter is more influencing than that of the geomorphology parameter case 6 uses eight parameters excluding the hydro geomorphology and addition of drainage density aspect and twi in this case the accuracy drastically increases to 71 3 however when the hydro geomorphology parameter is included in the analysis case 7 the accuracy increases to 72 4 the accuracy obtained from the roc auc curve well matches with the springs and wells distribution in each gwp classes i e a greater number of springs and productive wells fall in moderate and high gwp class with the increase in accuracy in case of the nine parameter gwp map most of the springs are lying in high groundwater potential zone followed by moderate and low potential zones likewise all the productive wells lie in the high gwp zone output obtained from the analysis with six parameters in case 5 hydro geomorphology and geomorphology included shows that there is no drastic change when compared with case 4 with five parameters without hydro geomorphology analysis however in case 5 most of the spring fall in high potential zone followed by moderate potential and low potential zones similar result was obtained during comparison of eight parameters without using hydro geomorphic factor map and nine parameters hydro geomorphic map included this suggests that hydro geomorphology plays a positive role in delineating the groundwater potential in an area as it significantly increases the efficiency of projecting the groundwater potential 4 conclusions groundwater is a vital resource that is essential for domestic agriculture and industrial purposes these resources need to be exploited in a sustainable manner groundwater in terms of springs and seepage is the most readily available water resources in the mountainous area and hence the mountain people are primarily depending on this resource since historical time however with the increased population as well as water demand and decreasing the resources due to change in precipitation pattern as an impact of climate change the resource is much stressed and in many cases not meeting the water demand in the area there is a need to improve the mountain groundwater resources assessment technique through identifying the most influencing parameter for the resource assessment remote sensing and gis were used for evaluating groundwater potential zones of the study area using the different factor maps influencing factors like lithology land use lineament density drainage density topographic wetness index twi slope aspect geomorphology and most importantly hydro geomorphology the weight of factor maps and rank for their classes were calculated from ahp method based on their significance in the groundwater contribution which were integrated for groundwater potential zone delineation the results indicated that high groundwater potential zones are located in the southern and western parts of the study area mainly near to the river and terrace in these areas the slope is gentle to flat 0 8 the groundwater potential map was validated with the existing spring and the auc was found 0 806 for case 7 nine parameters which indicates good prediction capability of the ahp method the comparison of case 1 and 2 shows the significance of lineament while the importance of hydro geomorphology is highlighted while comparing the results between case 3 and case 4 as well as case 6 and case 7 it is observed that case 3 performed well with increased accuracy and a greater number of springs falling in moderate and high gwp classes in comparison to case 4 similar analysis was performed in case 6 and case 7 which resulted the accuracy auc from 0 713 in case 6 to and 0 724 in case 7 with the use of hydro geomorphology parameter table 3 thus the sensitivity analysis of parameters shows that lineament and hydro geomorphology are the important parameters that significantly increase the accuracy of the gwp map which has been depicted by the analysis carried out for seven different cases with different combinations of parameters when these two most influencing factors parameters are used together with other commonly used parameters the accuracy of gwp map significantly increases with increased auc in roc curve thus the method can be replicated to prepare gwp map for groundwater assessment in the mountainous area of nepal himalaya when detailed spring inventory data is absent such approach would greatly enhance the groundwater exploration in an area leading towards sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources in the mountainous region of the himalaya declaration of

kathmandu nepal corresponding author groundwater potential gwp mapping of an area is the initial stage of assessing groundwater for further investigation leading towards exploitation of the resources to meet the water demand for various sectors groundwater availability is explicitly important especially in the mountainous area in the himalayan region in practice different combinations of parameters are used to prepare gwp map however the sensitivity of parameters are poorly assessed this paper aims to evaluate the sensitivity of parameter for delineating groundwater potential using gis and remote sensing multi criteria decision analysis mcda technique is used to prepare groundwater potential map of khadadevi manthali area ramechhap district of bagmati province nepal nine influencing parameters are considered in the present analysis which were integrated through assigning normalized weight to the thematic layers and their classes using analytical hierarchical process ahp further groundwater potential maps have been prepared for 7 different cases using different combination of parameters and for each case the results were successively validated with 21 springs and 3 tube wells spatially distributed within the study area the results show that the gwp maps prepared using the lineament and hydro geomorphic maps yield better result the roc auc curve receiver operating characteristic curve area under curve for gwp map prepared using 9 parameters shows higher prediction accuracy 72 4 as compared to other cases thus we conclude that lineament and hydro geomorphology of an area are most influencing factors in delineating gwp zones in mountainous area of himalayan region and the nine parameters considered in the present study can be applied in also other areas of the region for preparing gwp map graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater potential mapping multi criteria decision analysis mcda analytical hierarchy process ahp sensitivity analysis remote sensing and gis nepal himalaya 1 introduction groundwater is considered as a precious source of fresh water that is distributed at almost every place in nature patra et al 2018 further groundwater plays principal role in maintaining ecological balance human well being and economic development smithson 2002 the continuously increasing demand for groundwater due to growing population expanding cultivation area demanding additional water for irrigation and economic progress compromising the environment sustainability has stressed on its careful utilization maurya and kumar 2017 the total groundwater withdrawal at global scale and used for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes are respectively around 36 42 and 27 taylor et al 2013 hydrogeological investigations and exploitation in indo gangetic plain has been extensively carried out in nepal especially to meet the irrigation and drinking water demand pathak 2017a 2017b 2018 however hydrogeology in the mountainous area is least studied even though the mountain people heavily depend on groundwater resources for domestic use at present few studies have been made in such area which are mainly focused to groundwater potential mapping and groundwater resilience bricker et al 2014 ghosh et al 2016 khadka and pathak 2020 pathak and gautam 2019 pathak and shrestha 2016 the occurrences of groundwater are controlled by various geological factors such as slope aspect lithology geomorphology drainage density lineament density land use topographic wetness index etc geomorphology of an area is an important factor used for assessing the groundwater potential and recharge potential because it has significant influence on groundwater recharge movement and storage the drainage density expresses the closeness of spacing of stream channels thus providing a quantitative measurement of the average length of stream channels in a basin singh et al 2014 strahler 1964 the drainage density has an inverse relation with the permeability of the soil hence plays a vital role in the runoff distribution and level of infiltration the geological structure like discontinuities fracture joint fault lineaments etc also control the occurrence and flow of groundwater in particular direction global climate change has effect in nepal as well and has been identified as one of four global hotspots for the risk caused by climate change bahir et al 2020 khadka and pathak 2016 moste 2014 silwal et al 2020 there is growing demand of water in the mountainous region and difficulty to use surface water for domestic use the natural springs are either drying up or the discharge has been decreasing which is going to be severe in future with the changing pattern of rainfall khadka and pathak 2020 mishra and singh 2019 groundwater exploitation through drilled wells has already begun in the mountainous region without proper understanding of the delicate mountain aquifer system the earlier works leading to delineation of groundwater potential in nepal himalaya mostly considered common terrain parameters like geology drainage density lineament density slope land use precipitation e g pathak and shrestha 2016 however the influencing parameters have not been well assessed the significance of geomorphology and hydro geomorphology is not well considered for gwp mapping in nepal in small catchment the precipitation is least influencing as it does not significantly vary within the area kumar et al 2014 the groundwater potential mapping in different parts of the world have considered lithology lineament density slope drainage density soil as influencing factors for the groundwater potential duan et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 in addition to above factors some authors have considered geomorphology e g hussein et al 2017 the hydro geomorphic study that has been widely carried out in several regions of the globe adewumi and anifowose 2017 guida et al 2016 sidle and onda 2004 teixeira et al 2013 the hydro geomorphic approach for groundwater assessment has been proved as successful approach however it has not been applied in nepalese context it is adopted in the present work so that the hydrogeological assessment in mountainous areas of nepal could lead towards sustainable exploitation of the groundwater resources furthermore the use of ahp method is widely used elsewhere but are least applied in nepalese case the use of this technique that is well established elsewhere for the delineation of gwp has been emphasized in present study the yield of the drilled wells is mostly used to validate the gwp map das 2019 fenta et al 2015 hussein et al 2017 kumar et al 2016 in other cases the groundwater level data is used to validate the model e g kumar et al 2016 however in the nepalese case the boreholes are almost negligible in the mountainous area and hence neither the yield data nor water level data can be used for model validation therefore the spring locations are used as validating parameter the sensitivity of parameters for delineating groundwater potential has been assessed for other parts of the globe das 2019 fenta et al 2015 kumar et al 2014 however this is the first approach of evaluating parameter sensitivity for assessing groundwater potential in the mountainous area of nepal himalaya thereby suggesting most influencing parameter thus the present work is expected to further enhance the method of mountain groundwater exploration in nepal himalaya 1 1 study area study area covers khadadevi gaupalika and manthali municipality with geographical area of 48 73 sq km in ramechhap district bagmati province nepal fig 1 sunkoshi river flows from the southwest part of the study area and tama koshi river flows from the south east it is bounded by longitude 85 57 39 013 e 86 03 52 697 e and latitude 27 26 38 746 n 27 21 05 162 n the study area lies about 127 km east of the kathmandu valley the area falls in the hilly region 500 m 1490 m above sea level which is characterized by elevated mountains river valley spurs saddles ridges and valley the average annual rainfall in the area is 1372 mm most of which occur during summer monsoon rainfall while the winter rainfall is low the area is represented by the proterozoic rocks of the nawakot complex which represent the lesser himalayan sequence dhital 2015 with the phyllite amphibolites meta sandstone and schist rocks 2 materials and methods recent technological advances have brought gis cartographic techniques to the forefront as tools for recommending water management methods ballukraya and kalimuthu 2010 chowdary et al 2003 jaiswal et al 2003 jha 2011 jha et al 2007 nag and saha 2014 yeh et al 2009 the multi criteria approach which encompasses several types of layers of information e g topography climatology lithology structure slope drainage geomorphology hydrogeology land cover land use has been greatly enhanced by the versatile development of gis hardware and software díaz alcaide and martínez santos 2019 ettazarini 2007 mussa et al 2020 valverde et al 2016 the elevation data on the digital topographic data of the department of survey government of nepal has been used to prepare digital elevation model dem slope aspect and drainage density the same data was used to prepare twi based on beven and kirkby 1979 the google earth image was used to digitize land use land cover map which was updated in the field lineament was extracted through hillshade prepared from the digital elevation model mallast et al 2011 qari 2011 this process was further supported by the interpretation of satellite image similarly geomorphology and hydro geomorphology maps were prepared in the field while the geological information was extracted from the regional geological map of the area dhital 2015 the drainage density was prepared from the digital elevation model 20 m х 20 m resolution similarly the topographic wetness index twi was prepared based on the runoff model topmodel developed by beven and kirkby 1979 which is calculated as twi ln scaled flow accumulation tan slope where scaled flow accumulation flow accumulation 1 cell size tan slope is calculated as slope slope generated using dem 1 570796 90 tan slope con slope 0 tan slope 0 001 where ln con and tan are the function further the hydro geomorphology of the study area was initially assessed through the digital elevation model dem which was useful to evaluate the terrain condition later on the map was updated during the field investigation keeping in mind the groundwater occurrence in different geomorphic units preparing series of thematic maps to be used as input data for the analysis is of prime importance adewumi and anifowose 2017 thus input maps were prepared consisting of geological and geomorphologic features lithology lineament geomorphology and hydro geomorphology land cover drainage slope aspect and topographic wetness as well as other relevant information for the site investigation fig 2 once all data were registered in the spatial database weights and ranks of each thematic layer influencing parameters were calculated using analytical hierarchical process ahp and overlaid in gis platform using raster calculator the weights for each thematic layer and rank for respective classes have been calculated by ahp method and the thematic layers were integrated in gis environment kim et al 2009 saaty 2002 groundwater potential map was generated and the map was classified into high moderate and low potential zone the ahp method was developed by saaty in 1980 karayalcin 1982 saaty 1990 2004 is a structured mathematical method used to organize and analyze complex decision making studies have shown that the ahp technique provides better results in the groundwater related studies kaliraj et al 2014 in order to assess the significance of parameters for developing gwp map ahp analysis was carried out for different number of parameters viz 3 parameters 4 parameters 5 parameters including and excluding hydro geomorphology 6 parameters 8 parameters and 9 parameters the significance of hydro geomorphic parameter was assessed with seven different cases with different combination of parameters developing gwp maps 2 1 weight assignment multi criteria decision analysis was employed to determine the respective weights of the determinant thematic layers the ahp procedure applies scale of relative importance from 1 to 9 during pair wise comparison of parameters saaty 1980 the value 1 is assigned for equal importance 3 for moderate importance 5 for strong importance 7 for very strong importance and 9 for extreme importance likewise the values 2 4 6 and 8 are the intermediate values between adjacent scale values and the reciprocal values are assigned for inverse comparison as an example the pairwise comparison matrix for 5 parameters is presented in table 1 further a normalized pairwise comparison matrix is prepared through calculating weight criteria wc i e the ratio of sum of row values for all parameters and number of parameters value which is presented in table 2 the closeness of the matrix to consistency is evaluated through the calculation of the consistency ratio cr in order to calculate the consistency ratio cr the principal eigenvalue λ max is calculated as in table 3 the principal eigenvalue well indicates the consistency of the matrix when there is total consistency the principal eigenvalue λ max should be equal to n the number of parameters another parameter required to calculate the consistency ratio is the consistency index ci which is calculated by c o n s i s t e n c y i n d e x c i a v e r a g e λ m a x n n 1 where n stands for the number of parameters now the consistency ratio cr is calculated from the following relationship c o n s i s t e n c y r a t i o c r c i r i where ri is the random index which depends on the number of influencing factors used the values of ri for different number n of influencing factors parameters as of saaty 1980 are given in table 4 below if cr is less than 0 1 then the relative importance of parameters as judged in the initial pairwise comparison shows significance in all cases with different number of parameters the cr was obtained to less than 0 1 which reflects a reasonable level of consistency in the pair wise comparison phase with good accuracy in spatially predicting of groundwater probability the weight and rank values for the case with nine thematic layers influencing factors is presented in table 5 in this case the consistency ration cr is obtained as 0 06 and average λ max is 9 64 which are quite acceptable values likewise the average λ max and cr values for the classes of each thematic layers are given in table 5 which also lies within the acceptable limits the weights of the influencing factors thematic layers have been assigned according to their significance for groundwater occurrence influencing factors are assessed on the basis of author s knowledge of relative importance of different factors responsible for groundwater occurrence the author s prior experience in groundwater assessment in the mountainous region in similar terrain obtaining adequate knowledge is an important asset to decide and prioritize the controlling factors for the groundwater occurrence and availability in the area in addition the influencing factors are also identified through several literatures e g das 2019 pathak and shrestha 2016 senanayake et al 2016 the normalized weights were developed based on the assigned weight to each feature and pairwise comparison between the feature classes an area having high lineament density is characterized as high groundwater recharge areas mukherjee et al 2012 naghibi et al 2017 nampak et al 2014 rajaveni et al 2017 yeh et al 2016 while areas with high drainage density were assigned very low weight ibrahim bathis and ahmed 2016 rahmati et al 2015 rajaveni et al 2017 yildiz 2004 areas with gentle slope to flat is given the highest priority for groundwater recharge and storage since it had more concentration time to remain on the ground surface and percolate into the subsurface in contrast steeply sloping areas favor for overland flow limiting percolating to the subsurface and hence such condition is categorized as low significance for contributing to the groundwater in the area rajaveni et al 2017 terrace and thick soils are considered as having good groundwater reserve because the thick soils favor good infiltration of water received from rainfall and channelized flow through it therefore high relative influence values were given to terrace and thick soil classes of the hydro geomorphology influencing factor 2 2 groundwater potential gwp mapping the groundwater potential map was developed by overlaying the determinant groundwater contributing thematic layers pathak and gautam 2019 as given in fig 3 the different groundwater potential zones were evaluated based on the groundwater potential index gwpi computed from the integration of all groundwater influencing thematic layers the weighted overlay analysis tool was used to compute groundwater potential index values using the following equation leake and malczewski 2000 1 g w p i w 1 m j 1 n w j x i where wj is the normalized weight of the jth thematic layer xi is the normalized weight of the ith feature class of the thematic layer m is the total number of thematic layers and n is the total number of features classes of a given factor the gwpi values were used to classify an area in high moderate and low poor groundwater potential zones 2 3 validation the results of groundwater potential maps were validated using the existing spring and tube well data the existing spring data was overlaid with the groundwater potential index map the receiver operating characteristic curve roc and area under the curve auc were used as a performance indicator for the validation of groundwater potential map developed using thematic maps das 2019 naghibi et al 2016 roc curve makes it easy to identify the best threshold for making a decision the approach of roc auc have been applied by some authors for validation of gwp map e g das 2019 it predicts the data based on tpr true positive rate also known as sensitivity and fpr false positive rate also known as 1 specificity the accuracy value of the curve depends on various influencing factors and number of springs that is used to validate the model in addition to roc auc curve analysis simple overlay of productive tube well locations present in the area was done over the gwp map as an additional means to validate the gwp map these wells are productive wells and indicates the adequate availability of groundwater in the area 3 results and discussion 3 1 influencing factor 3 1 1 lithology geology the geological or lithological features of the study area are shown in fig 3a the study area consists of eight different types of lithological features viz phyllite amphibolites metasandstone schist slate shale siltstone and paleozoic granite 3 1 2 land use land cover the land cover map was prepared from the google earth satellite image the study area consists of seven types of land cover viz agriculture forest sparse forest residential area road and others barren land bushes and water bodies sand river the major parts of the landscape were dominated by cultivated agriculture land followed by bushes covering respectively 34 26 and 20 44 of the study area fig 3b 3 1 3 geomorphology the khadadevi manthali area can be classified into 5 types of landforms namely highly dissected hills moderately dissected hills low dissected hills terrace and river valley fig 3c the low dissected hills are distributed throughout the study area while the either sides of the river that is flowing nw se direction are represented by highly dissected hillslopes the maximum area is occupied by low dissected area followed by moderate and low dissected area river terraces occupy around 7 41 of the study area while the waterbody river stream covers only 1 37 of the study area 3 1 4 drainage density drainage density map prepared from the drainage lines in the study area shows that about 38 16 and 37 79 of the total area were found in low density and moderate drainage density classes respectively fig 3d 3 1 5 lineament density lineaments represent the total length of lineaments in a unit area as expressed below yeh et al 2016 ld i 1 i n l i a where ld is lineament density li is the total length of lineament and a is the area the high lineament density is the representation of dense lineaments km per unit area km2 while the low density class represents relatively less dense lineament per square area the high and moderate lineament density classes occupy respectively 24 42 and 46 87 of the total area fig 3e in terms of ground water potentiality the high lineament density facilitates for groundwater recharge and hence is more favorable than low lineament density 3 1 6 slope khadadevi manthali landscape is characterized by undulating terrain varying from plains to steep hill slope and the slope map of the study area was developed from the digital elevation model 20 m х 20 m resolution the study area has been reclassified into four slope classes and the major parts of the landscape lies in the slope class 1 8o 25 which covers 38 22 of the study area fig 3f 3 1 7 aspect aspect is the orientation of slope measured clockwise in degrees from 0 to 360 where 0 is north facing 90 is east facing 180 is south facing and 270 is west facing most of the slope in the study area faces towards south south west and west direction fig 3g 3 1 8 topographic wetness index the major parts of the landscape 54 34 is covered by low twi while 37 49 of the study area has moderate twi and remaining area has high twi fig 3h 3 1 9 hydro geomorphology the hydro geomorphic map shows the area demarcated into different geomorphic units with respect to groundwater occurrence fig 3i the study area was divided into five main hydro geomorphic units namely terrace river river valley thick soil gentle slope moderately thick soil moderate slope and thin soil steep slope the gentle moderate and steep slope refers respectively to thick moderate and thin soil cover maximum area is occupied by gentle slope followed by steep slope and moderate slope area river valley occupies around 10 of the study area while terrace covers 2 68 of the study area the study area appears to have good groundwater potential from the fact that the geomorphic condition like terrace river valley and gently sloping area significantly covers the study area 3 1 10 mountain aquifer map the soil distribution and lithological variation together with hydro geomorphic condition was considered for the preparation of mountain aquifer of the study area fig 4 the mountain aquifer in the study area is mainly divided into aquifers on unconsolidated sediments that comprises of colluviums and residual soils and fractured aquifers in hard rock the aquifers in unconsolidated sediments are categorized as ua 1 and ua 2 ua 1 occurs at the flat to gently sloping area at the lower elevation zones while the unconfined aquifer ua 2 occurs in thick to moderately thick soil cover the fractured aquifers are subdivided into three different categories namely fa 1 that represents the aquifer at the steeper hill slope which is less productive fa 2 that represents the fractured aquifer overlain by very thin soil cover and fa 3 that is underlain by ua 2 which is unconfined in nature ua 1 and fa 3 are the most productive aquifers followed by fa 2 ua 2 and fa 3 the unconfined aquifer ua 1 is distributed on either side of the river valley while the fractured aquifer fa 3 and ua 2 predominantly occupies the study area fa 1 and fa 2 are scattered in the study area 3 2 groundwater potential map the groundwater potential index map of khadadevi manthali landscape has been prepared using ahp one of the widely used multi criteria decision making mcdm system nine parameters case 7 namely geomorphology land use lineament density hydro geomorphology lithology drainage density slope aspect and topographic wetness index twi have been considered for the analysis the weight and rank values for the influencing parameters and their classes were calculated from the ahp and given in table 1 gwpi values were classified into three groups table 6 using roc auc curve classification method the groundwater potential map of the study area using nine parameters shows that the southern and western parts has high potential excellent potential zone due to the flat slope with thick soil concentration which leads to a higher rate of infiltration and accumulation of water in the aquifer fig 5 the resulting groundwater potential map was validated using the success rate curve also called roc auc curve fig 6 it predicts the data based on tpr true positive rate also known as sensitivity plotted in y axis and fpr false positive rate also known as 1 specificity plotted in x axis in roc curve the true positive rate sensitivity is plotted in function of the false positive rate for different cut off points of a parameter each point on the roc curve represents a sensitivity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold the area under the roc curve auc is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups the relationship between auc and prediction accuracy can be summarized as naghibi et al 2015 low potential moderately potential and high potential the roc auc curve for the groundwater potential using nine parameters shows 0 724 area under curve auc indicating 72 4 prediction rate and upper bound of 80 1 showing that the analysis is valid further out of 21 springs in the study area 3 springs fall on low gwp 10 falls on moderate gwp and 8 springs fall on high gwp zones likewise out of 3 productive tube wells all fall on high gwp zone the prediction rate of up to 70 have been obtained for gwp map prepared from 8 thematic layers using ahp method in india das 2019 likewise razandi et al 2015 obtained 73 using the same method with 10 factor maps in the study carried out in iran both the studies were carried out in rather plain area with lots of bore wells with water table data as well as yield data and detailed information on aquifer however the present study area lies entirely in mountainous area with almost negligible information on the aquifer distribution and few bore holes with limited information in spite of this limitation we could get auc value 72 4 and the upper bound value of 80 this result is quite satisfactory and hence the gwp map prepared from ahp method can be considered reasonably representing the field condition as far as the success rate for groundwater potential classes zones is concerned 24 of the study area has a high rank and could explain 42 of total springs of the area likewise 47 of proposed gwp values could explain around 86 of all existing springs thus the three groundwater potential gwp classes are established as low potential less than 53 moderate potential 53 76 and high potential 78 100 using which gwp maps was prepared fig 5 3 3 sensitivity of parameters for groundwater potential mapping though the gwp map using nine parameters have been well validated and can be considered to represent the field condition there are several studies on the sensitivity analysis for groundwater vulnerability mapping e g barbulescu 2020 berhe zenebe et al 2020 saidi et al 2011 thapa et al 2018 however the research on parameter sensitivity for gwp mapping is almost none and the number of significant parameters required for the preparation of gwp map and the sensitivity of parameters is yet to be assessed for the himalayan region in order to bridge this gap gwp maps have been prepared using different combinations of parameters case 1 three parameters hydro geomorphology geomorphology and lithology case 2 four parameters hydro geomorphology land use lineament and lithology case 3 five parameters hydro geomorphology land use lineament slope and lithology case 4 five parameters geomorphology land use lineament slope and lithology case 5 six parameters hydro geomorphology geomorphology land use lineament slope and lithology case 6 eight parameters geomorphology land use lineament slope drainage density aspect twi and lithology and case 7 nine parameters hydro geomorphology geomorphology land use lineament slope aspect drainage density twi and lithology the combination of the parameters was principally chosen focusing to the hydro geomorphology factor aiming to understand its influence in gwp mapping other parameters were selected based on expert judgments such map removal techniques are applied in other literatures too e g fenta et al 2015 the groundwater potential maps for all cases were prepared through the same method as for the nine parameters case 7 the resulting gwp maps for the six cases are presented in fig 7 the gwp maps for all cases were evaluated through the roc auc curve the roc curves are plotted for respective cases fig 8 and the result of the analysis is tabulated in table 7 the success rate curve shows increasing accuracy from case 1 to 3 with the addition of influencing parameters inclusion of lineament and land use parameters significantly increases the accuracy of the analysis i e it increases from 57 4 in case 1 69 5 in case 2 the comparison between case 3 and 4 clearly indicates that the hydro geomorphic parameter is very much influencing factor in the preparation of gwp when the hydro geomorphology parameter in case 3 is replaced with the geomorphology in case 4 the accuracy lowers from 64 6 to 60 4 likewise the number of springs falling in high potential zone in case 3 is decreased in case 4 while the spring numbers falling in low potential zone increases significantly from 2 in case 3 to 8 in case 4 when both the geomorphology and hydro geomorphology parameters are used together with other parameters use in cases 3 and 4 the accuracy becomes only 63 in case 5 which is still less than that of case 3 this indicates that hydro geomorphology parameter is more influencing than that of the geomorphology parameter case 6 uses eight parameters excluding the hydro geomorphology and addition of drainage density aspect and twi in this case the accuracy drastically increases to 71 3 however when the hydro geomorphology parameter is included in the analysis case 7 the accuracy increases to 72 4 the accuracy obtained from the roc auc curve well matches with the springs and wells distribution in each gwp classes i e a greater number of springs and productive wells fall in moderate and high gwp class with the increase in accuracy in case of the nine parameter gwp map most of the springs are lying in high groundwater potential zone followed by moderate and low potential zones likewise all the productive wells lie in the high gwp zone output obtained from the analysis with six parameters in case 5 hydro geomorphology and geomorphology included shows that there is no drastic change when compared with case 4 with five parameters without hydro geomorphology analysis however in case 5 most of the spring fall in high potential zone followed by moderate potential and low potential zones similar result was obtained during comparison of eight parameters without using hydro geomorphic factor map and nine parameters hydro geomorphic map included this suggests that hydro geomorphology plays a positive role in delineating the groundwater potential in an area as it significantly increases the efficiency of projecting the groundwater potential 4 conclusions groundwater is a vital resource that is essential for domestic agriculture and industrial purposes these resources need to be exploited in a sustainable manner groundwater in terms of springs and seepage is the most readily available water resources in the mountainous area and hence the mountain people are primarily depending on this resource since historical time however with the increased population as well as water demand and decreasing the resources due to change in precipitation pattern as an impact of climate change the resource is much stressed and in many cases not meeting the water demand in the area there is a need to improve the mountain groundwater resources assessment technique through identifying the most influencing parameter for the resource assessment remote sensing and gis were used for evaluating groundwater potential zones of the study area using the different factor maps influencing factors like lithology land use lineament density drainage density topographic wetness index twi slope aspect geomorphology and most importantly hydro geomorphology the weight of factor maps and rank for their classes were calculated from ahp method based on their significance in the groundwater contribution which were integrated for groundwater potential zone delineation the results indicated that high groundwater potential zones are located in the southern and western parts of the study area mainly near to the river and terrace in these areas the slope is gentle to flat 0 8 the groundwater potential map was validated with the existing spring and the auc was found 0 806 for case 7 nine parameters which indicates good prediction capability of the ahp method the comparison of case 1 and 2 shows the significance of lineament while the importance of hydro geomorphology is highlighted while comparing the results between case 3 and case 4 as well as case 6 and case 7 it is observed that case 3 performed well with increased accuracy and a greater number of springs falling in moderate and high gwp classes in comparison to case 4 similar analysis was performed in case 6 and case 7 which resulted the accuracy auc from 0 713 in case 6 to and 0 724 in case 7 with the use of hydro geomorphology parameter table 3 thus the sensitivity analysis of parameters shows that lineament and hydro geomorphology are the important parameters that significantly increase the accuracy of the gwp map which has been depicted by the analysis carried out for seven different cases with different combinations of parameters when these two most influencing factors parameters are used together with other commonly used parameters the accuracy of gwp map significantly increases with increased auc in roc curve thus the method can be replicated to prepare gwp map for groundwater assessment in the mountainous area of nepal himalaya when detailed spring inventory data is absent such approach would greatly enhance the groundwater exploration in an area leading towards sustainable exploitation of groundwater resources in the mountainous region of the himalaya declaration of

11941,ground water systems form essential components of rural water supply in ghana four handpumps namely afridev india mark ii nira af 85 and vergnet have been standardized for rural water supply however they have failed to deliver satisfactory levels of water supply and sustainability largely due to inadequate maintenance capacity an alternative to standardized imported handpumps is the locally manufactured rope pump which is considerably cheaper and easier to maintain but has not been standardized for use in ghana for rural water supply framed from the technology acceptance model tam the post positivist paradigm and quantitative research approach this study compared the performance of rope pumps with standardized handpumps to determine whether rope pumps technology provide viable alternative for rural water supply probability sampling and self designed questionnaires were used to elicit data from 431 respondents descriptive statistics correlations and independent sample t test were utilized to analyze the data decision rule applied in testing the hypothesis ho with 95 confidence interval was accept ho if p values are α 0 05 and do not accept ho if p values are α 0 05 findings showed rope pumps as a potentially viable option to standardized handpumps there were no significant differences between rope pumps and standardized handpumps with respect to robustness sustainability and microbiological quality of water delivered by the two pump types rope pump technology is feasible sustainable scalable and will likely meet user needs if standardized and adapted for use by the communities measures for technology adaptation government subsidies investments pollution control and standardization are necessary and will remarkably improve water quality from rope pumps installed in the communities graphical abstract image 1 keywords rope pump and handpump sustainable rural community water supply water quality northern and upper east regions ghana 1 introduction water is an essential commodity in the lives of humans yet acces to potable water has become a problem for most people in rural communities the standardized handpump is a pump which has been in use for groundwater supply for a very long time in many countries calow et al 2009 its mechanism of drawing groundwater is by pump and suction which forces water to rise to the surface through the tubes connected to the pump wateraid ghana 2004 similar to the handpump is the rope pump which comprises of a wheel and a handle connected to a rope with washers and used to draw water from a well or a borehole european union 2013 globally the use of rope and handpumps have become increasingly essential because prolonged dry seasons experienced by rural poor communities and villages adversely affect the availability of rainwater or runoff and ground water resources including boreholes wells or springs which could serve as a buffer for short term environmental variability and evaporation of surface water resources macdonald and calow 2007 as a result of climate variabilities the rainfall patterns across africa have been highly variable droughts are becoming endemic in sub saharan africa and the extent of drought affected areas is increasing sheffield and wood 2008 there is observed increase in water demand during droughts in southern africa in the early 1990s calow et al 1997 droughts in west africa east africa and the horn of africa calow et al 2009 in periods of prolonged drought pipe born systems easily breakdown borehole water levels and quality reduce rapidly surface water and shallow unimproved groundwater sources shallow wells and small springs often fail leaving only water points abstracting from larger groundwater bodies operational therefore often only the larger springs deep hand dug wells or boreholes are reliable across seasons and in drought periods macdonald 2009 7 8 in poor aquifers an upsurge in demand for water particularly during excessive dry seasons can result in increased drawdowns and consequently an increased unpredictability and risk of failure of water sources manu 2015 as demand for water continues to rise as rural population grows the net effect includes increase in industrial chemical and domestic waste which can cause reduction in quality and availability of water resources ghana statistical service 2012 besides poor drainage improper waste disposal and increased economic activities such as farming and mining could result in water pollution deteriorate the quality of human health and cause damage to facilities used for transportation and delivery of drinking water to rural households bazaanah 2019 this affects the sustainability of water resources and increases the burden of water managers to satisfy the average annual rural population s demand for quality rural water ghana statistical service 2015 therefore there is the urgent need for communities to adapt to ecological variabilities in order to preserve their ecosystems and the quality of human life united nations 2015 this would require the avoidance of environmental degradation pollution control and human settlement planning bazaanah 2020 in addition technologies such as rope and handpump waer systems are required to effectively management water resources in order to prevent possible future challenges in rural settings calow et al 2009 in ghana the operation and maintenance practices for rural water sources remain poor and many gravity flows schemes and water point sources are not fully operational morinville and harris 2014 moreover post construction monitoring and technical support gaps exist at the district and rural level with the district water offices focusing more on construction and less on maintenance morinville and harris 2014 the benchmark of the smart development work 2018 indicates that a sustainable water source piped borehole schemes should provide water for a minimum of 350 days in a year with less than 14 days of breakdown in ghana very few water sources piped boreholes are able to meet this standard and a broken down water source can take up to 12 months or more before it is repaired bathsheba 2011 on average a water source functions well within the first three years after which it starts breaking down yire 2015 the majority of rural water sources are not regularly maintained and hence at risk of regular breakdowns meanwhile political commitment in construction and maintenance of existing water supply schemes is demonstrated mostly during an election year manu 2015 beyond the poor culture of maintenance is the lack of transparent and local accountability structures community sense of ownership and lack of water quality test especially for water schemes serving rural communities bazaanah 2019 again the excessive interference by governments and politicians in rural water supply basically for political expediencies addo 2010 is worrisome short term rural water policies and tariff setting are influenced by politicians bohman 2010 while the selection of beneficiary communities for award of water schemes and membership composition of water boards committees are riddled with political patronage doe 2007 while significant strides have been achieved in post construction maintenance of urban water supply facilities which are periodically rehabilitated by the ghana water company gwc in liaison with private operators and public utility regulatory commission purc ministry of water resource works and housing mwrwh 2011 similar progress are yet to be concretely registered for the small towns and rural community water sector cwsa 2015 drawing from the general comment 15 of the united nations 2003 this study contends that clean and affordable water access is a human right waer is essential for everyday life and development of human populace regardless of their locations yet in the northern and upper east regions while population soars access to affordable water supply and sanitation presents a different narrative cwsa 2015 and this is more prevalent in rural poor communities where the lack of maintenance of water facilities poses a challenge and threat to rural water sustainability mwrwh 2012 if the situation is unresolved it could affect the sustainable development goals sdgs implementation united nations 2015 and ghana s vision for achieving universal access to potable water and sanitation for all mwrwh 2012 to avoid the effects of water scarcity the rope pump technology is offered as a simple water withdrawal technology which has the potential of reducing the cost of installation operation and maintenance as compared to the handpump systems used in rural parts of ghana a prototype of rope pump is presented in fig 1 from fig 1 the rope pump technology is a hand operated water lifting device made of locally available materials it uses washers threaded on a rope to lift water inside a pipe to the surface the rope is moved by rotation of a wheel handle the rope pump costs between 75 and 80 less than the standard handpumps currently used in ghana it was first introduced on a pilot basis by cwsa in 2000 in western greater accra the northern and upper east regions european union 2013 as an alternative to pipe born water systems the rope and handpumps technology remain feasible and easily adaptable technologies which could help reduce the cost of access to potable water among rural poor communities wateraid ghana 2004 this study argues that if well adapted and integrated into the rural water sector the rope pump water technology could become a cost effective technology compared with the standardized handpump and pipe born water schemes it has the capacity to meet the increasing household water demands of the poor and needy in the rural communities of the northern and upper east regions of the country 2 problem statement standardized handpumps have been in use in ghana for quite some time now it has been one of the most widely used technologies for the supply of groundwater in most rural parts of the country especially in the northern and upper east regions community water and sanitation agency 2014 despite the widepread use of handpumps evidence show that only 57 percent of hand pumps are functional 31 percent are sub optimally functional and 12 percent are not functioning at all with respect to piped schemes 67 percent of all piped schemes are functional 4 percent are sub optimally functional and 29 percent are not functional cwsa 2015 moreover the 2016 estimates show that around nine out of ten ghanaians have access to improved drinking water source with around 68 percent having access to only basic water services who 2017 who unicef 2017 the rural communities where water schemes are either unavailable non functional or optimally functional would have to depend on unsafe surface water and or polluted water sources including rivers dams and rainwater sources for domestic purposes over the period of 1990 to 2017 national access to improved water increaseed by 32 percent ie from 56 to 88 showing that the national water coverage in ghana is higher than the regional average consequently rope pumps are essential for serving families and groups in rural communities collaborative africa budget reform initiative cabri 2017 while the above analysis presents a broadly positive representation on access to potable water delivered through handpumps it disguises urban rural disparities particularly on issues related to reliability water quality and sustainability the vast majority of ghanaians without access to quality water and sanitation services live in rural areas and small towns manu 2015 in ghana although four handpumps namely afridev india mark ii nira af 85 and vergnet have been standardized for supply of water coverage in rural areas has stagnated in recent years driven by climate variabilities poor service delivery mohammed 2015 pollution and failure to maintain infrastructure who unicef 2017 around two thirds of the installed handpump facilities in rural areas are either completely or partially broken down adank et al 2014 in terms of performance a handpump is considered fully functional if water flows within 5 strokes sub optimally functional if it takes more than 5 strokes for water to flow and not functional if water does not flow cwsa 2015 1 at the community level the level of service provided by handpumps are assessed against the national standards as determined by ghana standards authority for water quantity and water quality distance from users the maximum number of people per handpump as an indication for crowding and the reliability of water services cwsa 2017 for adank et al 2014 2 the service level indicators and minimum standards benchmarks for handpumps are specified as follows quantity at least 20 l per capita per day quality ghana standards authority gsa water quality standards however for practical reasons the minimum standard applied is set as perceived as acceptable by users coverage the number of people per handpump should not exceed 300 in case of boreholes and 150 in case of hand dug wells distance all users should be within 500 m of the handpump reliability the handpump should provide water for at least 95 of the year interpreted as at least 347 days of regular service without interruption adank et al 2014 2 in ghana handpumps which meet the standards for all five service level indicators are considered to provide basic services handpumps are managed and monitored by the water and sanitation management teams wsmts who operates in rural communities the performance standards for wsmts are assessed against indicators and benchmarks related to governance operation and financial management capacities the benchmarks for monitoring and managing hand pumps are i non political interference ii availability of area mechanics services iii breakdown repairs and routine maintenance these indicators are set by the cwsa based on national policy guidelines and standards regulating community water and sanitation delivery in ghana cwsa 2015 as compared with handpump the rope pump water technology was first piloted in ghana by the community water and sanitation agency cwsa in 1990 although rope pumps have been in use in rural settlements since 2000 the technology was first transferred from nicaragua to ghana between 1999 and 2000 bombas 2004 despite the wide usage of rope pumps the technology has not been standardized to supply adequate affordable and clean groundwater to communities the standardization of rope pumps would involve the adaptation of similar quality standards regulatory and management systems as used by the cwsa and gsa in the management of handpumps this study draws on cases from the northern and upper east regions of ghana in order to permit a comparative analysis of the utilization of rope pumps and standardized handpumps to ascertain their performance and make a case for standardization of rope pumps in order to make water easily accessible and affordable with guaranteed quality for use by rural poor communities 3 objectives and hypotheses the aim for the study was to compare the utilization of rope pumps and standardized handpumps to ascertain their performance in rural communities of the northern and upper east regions of ghana in specific terms this study determined the sanitation and hygiene around the pumps quality of water delivered by rope pumps and conventional handpump the sustainability and robustness frequency of breakdowns of rope pumps and conventional hand pumps moreover the study determined the popularity of rope pump and that of the standardized pumps among rural households in selected communities from the objectives the study estimated the following null hypothesis ho1 there is no significant difference between the robustness of the two types of pumps ho2 there is no significant differences in the sustainability of rope pumps compared with conventional handpumps ho3 rope pump do not perform better than conventional handpumps in the communities and finally ho4 there is no significant difference in the microbiological i e coliform water quality between the two pump types sustainability was defined by this study as intervention which is capable of being supported and maintained by a community or individual over an extended period of time with an absolute minimum of outside assistance wood 1994 also a water supply system is said to be sustainable when it can be financed or co financed by the users with limited but feasible external support and technical assistance moreover dayal et al 2000 discovered that a sustained water supply is one which is regular and reliable and provides enough water of an acceptable standard for at least domestic use the performance of the pumps is determined by their breakdown rates a pump is considered to perform better where breakdowns are rare and repairs are rapid within 48 hours and local financing covers at least the regular costs of operation maintenance o m and repairs it means that water which is sustainable is at the same time robust this study determined robustness of the pumps in terms of the pumps ability to continue to function under varying water demand conditions irc cinara 1997 4 theoretical and empirical literature this study draws from the technology acceptance model tam which serves as the theoretical foundation of technology adaptation studies in varying socio economic contexts agarwal 2000 both the theoretical and empirical literature presents sufficient evidence that tam has an enhanced capability of predicting how people make decisions regarding new technology adoption tam has frequently been used for information systems and other fields agarwal 2000 davis 2000 as such tam serves as an appropriate model to use to address consumer acceptance of various technologies therefore tam is useful when a study focuses on the potential adoption of an emerging technology this study utilized tam to predict user acceptance and highlight potential design issues before users of the technology interact with the system dillon and morris 1996 mohd et al 2011 tam was developed with support from ibm canada ajzen and fishbein 1980 tam demonstrates a pioneering research effort by generating a framework for explaining behavioral intentions and actual behavior of users for technology adoption yousafzai et al 2007 the efficiency of a technology is determined by its perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use the perceived usefulness pu and perceived ease of use peou are the perceptions of the beliefs users hold about the technology dillon and morris 1996 davis 2000 defined pu as the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance performance and peou as the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort venkatesh and davis 2000 through four longitudinal studies demonstrated that through the tam model interventions could be aimed in advance towards the 52 of variance in usage of interventions and 60 of the variance in use among populations who are less inclined to adopt the technology venkatesh and davis 2000 in a related study marks et al 2014 found that households participation during technology adoption meetings p value 0 04 α 0 01 n 176 involvement in technical decisions p value 0 6 α 0 01 n 176 and labour contribution to handpump and rope pump construction p value 0 07 α 0 01 n 176 were each strongly and positively associated with poorer handpump platform infrastructure in both regions however handpump infrastructure was likely to provide quality water outcomes when all other variables were else held constant similarly in kenya marks onda and davis 2013 studied the functionality of handpump systems which served between 500 and 8000 rural household populations the study discovered that due to the dispersed settlement patterns across the population and within the study provinces handpump water supply reached approximately 60 percent of households in each community in the case of ghana morinville 2012 and the cwsa 2003 found that the pu and peou of water technology are hindered by funding gaps technical capacities unavailability of spare parts and human resources again arlosoroff et al 1987 brikke and bredero 2003 found standardized pumps to have recorded a maximum pumping head of 75 m in contrast harvey and drouin 2006 found the average maximum flow rates of 10 m delivery head was recorded as 28 l min for the standardized handpump and 41 l min for the rope pump 5 study areas and methodology 5 1 description of the study areas the study area falls within two regions namely the upper east and northern regions the upper east region is bounded to the west by the upper west region to the north by burkina faso to the east by togo and to the south by the northern region the northern region is also bounded by ivory coast to the west upper east and upper west to the north brong ahafo region to the south and togo to the east the study was carried out in five communities namely damweo saboro and nalgukania in the upper east region and piriga and nayoku in the northern region from fig 2 damweo is located in the south eastern part of the bolgatanga township of the upper east region within longitudes 0 50 55 w and 0 51 20 w and latitudes 10 46 18 n and 10 46 40 n it is bounded by sawaba to the east zongo to the north ssnit flats to the south and zongo no 1 to the west see fig 2 piriga and nayoku are located within walewale township piriga lay roughly within longitude 0 47 7 w and latitude 10 19 55 n whiles nayoku roughly lay around longitude 0 47 19 w and latitude 10 21 13 n see fig 2 west mamprusi district profile 2012 damweo has a total population of 1 363 composed of males 655 and females 708 ghana statistical service gss 2010 the population for piriga and nayoku is 1979 population projected from 2000phc composed of 49 2 male and 50 8 females piriga is more populous 1016 than nayoku 963 gss 2012 in fig 2 the fourth and fifth study communities were the nalgukania 1356 population and saboro 1232 population are located in the navrongo township nalgukania is located roughly within longitude 1 5 58 063 w and 1 6 20 275 w and latitudes 10 52 43 507 n and 10 52 17 918 n it is bounded by gonia to the north korania to the south and nosinia and bonia to the east and west respectively saboro on the other hand is located roughly within longitude 1 5 46 309 w and 1 6 55 544 w and latitude 10 54 24 631 n and 10 54 31 277 n bounded by kayilo to the north namolo east to the east namolo west to the west and nosinia to the south see fig 2 the study communities generally have gentle slopes with isolated rock outcrops and uplands which have slopes gss 2012 the main type of soil present in the communities is the groundwater laterite the groundwater laterites are developed mainly over shale and granite due to the underlying rock type granite they become waterlogged during the rainy season and dry out during the dry season thus causing cemented layers of iron stone hard pan which makes cultivation difficult the study communities have no rivers but smaller streams exist and they are underlined by birimian rocks and granite the groundwater in the communities is laterite due to impervious iron pan or clay pan in the sub soil the areas are often characterized by waterlogs at the peak of the rains resulting in perennial floods gsd 2009 the climates of the communities are classified as tropical with two distinct seasons namely a wet season and a dry season gss 2010 2012 the natural vegetation of the communities is that of the guinea savannah woodland consisting of short deciduous trees widely spaced and a ground flora which gets burnt by fire or scorched by the sun during the long dry season characterized by the harmattan winds which blow across the sahara desert the most common economic trees are the shea nut dawadawa and baobab the primary sources of water supply in the communities are pipe systems boreholes fitted with handpumps hand dug wells fitted with rope pumps as well as unprotected hand dug wells streams ponds and dugouts which exist in the communiites are primarily used as water sources for animal farming pipe borne water are present in some households which can afford them whiles other households resort to hand dug wells fitted with rope pumps and the handpump fitted boreholes kassena nankana east district kned 2012 meanwhile the disposal of wastewater constitute major environmental and public health problems in the communities all the communities are not properly drained and therefore wastewater generated from bathing are normally collected around houses since no soakaways are constructed it increases the breeding of mosquitoes which causes malaria the communities lack toilet facilities hence open defecation is generally common solid waste generated in the settlements are managed by open dumping and incineration causing environmental pollution and increasing disease infection such as cholera and typhoid among residents in the communities gss 2010 5 2 methodology in planning the research approach data collection and analysis the study utilized several procedures the study adopted the cross sectional design and the post positivist paradigm which was generally structured along the quantitative research approach walliman 2018 these strategies were utilized to allow an objective study comparative analysis of the performance of rope pump and standardized handpumps in the communities cross sectional design enabled the selection of respondents across a section of the population at a pre defined time babbie 2016 moreover post positivism paradigm ensured precision in the sample estimation and allowed objectivity in the evaluation of the objectives and hypotheses of the study neuman 2014 also drawing from mugenda 2003 the profile of the study area was reviewed and communities within the study area where rope pumps and standardized handpumps existed were purposively chosen in order to permit a comparative analysis the five case study communities namely damweo saboro nalgukania piriga and nayoku were selected based on the availability and utilization of rope pumps as well as standardized handpumps the total number of pumps in the study area was 24 with rope pumps and standardized handpumps being 14 and 10 respectively the water sources were not evenly distributed in the communities the rope pumps were used by households while handpumps were used by the entire populace of the communities without any water source in their homes in order to determine the quality of drinking water i e bacteriological quality delivered by rope pumps and standardized handpumps a total of ten 10 water samples were taken from all the five 5 communities the ten water quality samples were taken due to financial constrains at the time of undertaking the study a 300 ml water sample was taken each for a rope pump and a standardized handpump water from the pumps which have been idle for a while were taken after water from the pumps has been allowed to run for 20 30 seconds the samples were cooled and filtered immediately after sampling and were transported to the laboratory for microbiological analysis since previous research has indicated a significant relationship between microbiological contamination of shallow groundwater and rainfall especially depth of rainfall howard et al 2003 it was important that this variable was considered when taking the samples for analysis the sustainability of a pump was considered by the study as the ability of the pump to withstand and endure continued pressure of usage sustainability is a very complex and difficult parameter to ascertain since different people have diverse ways of determining the sustainability of a pump however for this study the parameters used in the determination of the sustainability of the pumps were robustness of the pumps flow rate of the pumps availability of spare parts and easy access to technical expertise the robustness of the pumps was measured from the frequency in breakdown of the pumps in the communities the total head of the rope pump was determined by measuring the total length of the rope within the pump which aids in the transportation of water to the surface and dividing the length by two 2 however since drilling data was not available for drilled borehole with standardised handpumps the total head was estimated from the type of hamdpump installed since it provides the maximum depth at which a standardised handpump type can draw water from a borehole standardised handpumps installed on boreholes in ghana is dependent on the depth of the borehole that is shallow boreholes between 0m to 16 5m have the nira standardised handpump installed while the afridev is installed on boreholes with depth between 16 5m to 30m cwsa 2011 the flow rates of the rope pumps and standardized handpumps were determined by the amount of water obtained from the pumps after a minute of pumping the collection of data about the sustainability and robustness of the pumps occurred through directed interviews administered to 10 opinion leaders selected from the five communities self designed questionnaires were prepared and administered in each of the community the questionnaires aimed to collect information about the construction of the pumps acceptance of the pumps by the community members the uses of water hygeine around the pumps maintenance system costs and the frequency in breakdown the groups targeted for administering the questionnaire were individual household members between the ages of 18 60 who used these pumps as sources of water the total sample size for the study was 559 which composed of 459 household respondents and 10 purposively selected opinion leaders comprising two opinion leaders from each of the communities the choice and selection of the opinion leaders was based on their foreknowledge and experience on water and sanitation situation in the communities besides the opinion leaders are the mouthpiece of the communities and had much more information on whatever goes on in the communities and could furnish the study with the necessary information needed for the research also the rope pumps where mainly for household use and the landlords were the main point of information regarding the use and maintenanc of the rope pumps the sample size for the households was calculated based on the formula n n 1 n α ² where n sample size n total population of the communities and α margin of error a confidence level of 90 representing a 10 marginal error was used in estimating the sample size for the various communities the total sample size selected from damweo was calculated as follows n n 1 n α ² 1363 1 1363 0 1 ² 1363 1 1363 0 01 hence n 93 this sample calculation procedure was repeated in the selection of the remaining communities as illustrated by table 1 and based on the sample size formula the study utilized 459 household samples composed of damweo 93 saboro 92 nalgukania 93 nayoku 90 and piriga 91 the simple random sampling technique babbie 2016 i e the lottery method was utilized for selecting the units of analysis from the various sub groups stratum from each of the communities this technique allowed the respondents in each population sub group to have equal and fair chances of being represented in the study hacker 2014 the data collected were analyzed and compared with the world health organization 2006 standards to ascertain whether the bacteriological quality of the water is good for use by the community members in order to weigh the influence of external parameters on the results correlations were statistically analyzed pallant 2013 using the presumptive count of the total coliform counts as the dependent variable the independent variables considered were the type of pump location i e community depth of the well time period since the last rain age of the pump time period since the last cleaning of the well and number of users at 95 confidence interval and with tolerated error margin of 5 e 0 05 the decision rule for the hypothesis test was stated as accept the null hypothesis ho if p value is greater than or equal to the alpha value α of 0 05 and do not accept ho if p value is less than the assumed alpha value α of 0 05 furthermore statistical analysis was then conducted to compare the respective influences of the rope pumps and the conventional standardized handpumps on microbiological water quality in order to test the actual differences between the two sets of data the independent sample t test was utilized cresswell 2014 as a first step the distribution of log median value of the thermotolerant coliform counts for the conventional standardized pumps and for the rope pumps had to be tested for normality using the probability plots correlation coefficient test gronmo 2019 the sustainability robustness and total head of rope pumps and standardized handpumps were used in the comparative analysis using the statistical product for services and solutions spss version 25 software pallant 2013 the annual breakdown rate data for the rope pump as well as the standardized handpumps was tested for normality using the probability plot test it showed that the data did not follow a normal distribution hence the non parametric design which is the mann whitney wilcoxon s rank sum test bernard 2011 was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between the rope pump and standardized handpumps in the communities 6 results and discussion 6 1 gender location and perceptions on utilization of rope handpumps from table 2 the questionnaires retrieved from the respondents from the five communities were less than the initial total sample size of 559 the response distribution based on community location and gender showed about 431 respondents participated in the study translating into a response rate of 77 the difference in the participation among the respondents could probably be attributed to the timing when the fieldwork was conducted the communities are predominantly agrarian and the fieldwork occurred in the rainy season a period where most residents are often busy with farming activities and therefore were not mostly available at home for the interviews in table 2 the findings suggest that a little above half 52 of the respondents were females and 48 were males the relatively higher female participation was perhaps due to the perceived gender roles attached to water in the northern and upper east regions where females are traditionally perceived to be responsible for domestic responsibilities of fetching water and maintaining sanitary environment at the household level it suggest that the capacity of females towards maintenance and interpretation of drinking water quality is essential for ensuring good health and adequate hygiene around handpump and rope pumps water sources in the communities in terms of gender both male and females generally perceived that both the rope and handpump technology were useful in the communities as reliable sources of households drinking water community members are more inclined to use both technologies as sustainable sources of water agarwal 2000 venkatesh and davis 2000 a positive perceived usefulness pu and perceived ease of use peou among users of the technology dillon and morris 1996 is likely to result in change in attitudes possible technology adaptation and sustainability of water supply in the communities 6 2 water and sanitation facilities the communities are equipped with pipe systems boreholes fitted with handpumps hand dug wells fitted with rope pumps as well as unprotected hand dug wells these are the water sources from which members of the communities obtain water for their daily needs from table 3 the results showed damweo had one 1 standardized handpump a number of houses were also connected to the nations pipe borne water system there are also four 4 rope pumps in damweo as well as two 2 unprotected wells pond and dugouts about 2 of the respondents from damweo had access to pipe born water majority of the respondents 80 confirmed that there were two 2 public kvip s in damweo with some houses having water closets and pit latrines similar to gss 2010 about 50 of the respondents in damweo perceived that open defecation was still prevalent among residents in the community again from table 3 the finding showed saboro community had two 2 standardized handpumps three 3 rope pumps and only 3 of the households had access to pipe born water about 95 of the respondents confirmed that the community did not have public place of convenience only a few households 10 had access to pit latrines while most people 90 living in the community adhered to open air defecation from table 3 nalgakania had three 3 standardized handpumps and four 4 rope pumps about 8 of the respondents confirmed that only a few houses had access to pipe born water meaning most of the residents obtained their sources of drinking water mostly from rope pumps and standardized handpumps most of the respondents confirmed 86 that there were no public toilets in the community under these compelling conditions there is no option for most residents 77 of the community but for open defecation furthermore the study found that piriga was relatively equipped with two 2 standardized handpumps unprotected well with the use of rope and bucket and two 2 broken down rope pumps which were not in use hence all the community members utilized water from the unprotected wells and standardized handpumps for their daily needs see table 3 most of the respondents confirmed that there was only one public toilet serving the community with only a few households having pit latrines open defecation was perceived to be very common 84 practice at piriga since places of convenience were perceived to be inadequate from table 3 the findings raises public health concerns who 2006 who 2017 the need to intensify education on environmental health and hygiene promotion around drinking water sources in the community cwsa 2017 similarly the findings showed the people in nayoku had their source of water from two 2 standardized handpumps and three 3 unprotected wells the only rope pump available in the community had broken down due to lack of maintenance see table 3 with respect to sanitation 85 of the respondents confirmed the community was beset with inadequate toilet facilities apart from the relatively rare individual household latrines there was just one community latrine for the 962 residents of nayoku and it is not always in operation in times of flooding this situation compel most of the residents 92 to practice open defecation in general access to pipe born water was limited this is perhaps due to the cost of maintenance and inability to pay for user fees as an alternative to pipe born water supply the rope and handpumps technology remain feasible and easily adaptable technologies which could help reduce the cost of access to potable water among rural poor communities wateraid ghana 2004 again the findings in table 3 imply that access to basic water toilet facilities still remains a luxury for residents living in the communities open defecation was a common practice due to lack of improved public toilets the consequences of this practice on the health of residents are enormous forcing them to pay a heavy price for healthcare beside polluting the environment open defecation causes perilous problems arising from ill health high levels of open defecation are linked to child mortality poverty and disparities between rich and poor who unicef 2017 similarly calow et al 2009 admonishes the need to avoid environmental degradation and adapt to technologies such as rope and handpump systems in order to forestall possible future water challenges in rural settings adank et al 2014 also found that around two thirds of the installed handpump facilities in rural areas are either completely or partially broken down 6 3 hygiene around pump facilities the physical state and hygiene around both rope and handpumps under the study were further determined in order to establish whether the pumps were close to a latrine or any other source of pollutant including waste dumping site stagnant water or poor drainage channels around the wells which could pollute the communities drinking water sources although a 10 m radius is recommended by the who 2006 2017 and cwsa 2015 as standard distance between water sources and toilet refuse dumps at the damweo community the study found rope pumps were sited closer to public toilets the distance from the rope pump to the community latrine was 8 5 m the standardized hand pumps were however not located nearer to any source of pollution at the time of the survey similarly saboro had rope pumps closer to a latrine approximately the distance from the rope pump to the latrine was 7 3 m none of the standardized handpumps in the area was situated near a pollution source however there were incidences of poor drainage channels causing stagnant water around one of the boreholes fitted with standardized handpump in the community in contrast there were no cracks nor hygiene problems with both the rope and handpumps in the nalgukania community there were no latrine refuse dumping site cemetery nor toilet facilities nearer to the pumps an indication that the residents were perhaps aware of the 10 m radius stipulations and standards of the cwsa at both piriga and nayoku the survey found that the drainage channels in both communities were destroyed causing water stagnation around the pumps and boreholes the location of these water sources could cause pollution of the water utilized by both communities in contrast no hygiene problems were detected at any of the pumps in the nalgukania community this is perhaps due to awareness of water safety and maintenance environmental hygiene surrounding water sources in the community from the findings the study deduced that the benefits of having access to improved drinking water sources in the communities can only be fully realized when there is also access to improved sanitation and adherence to good hygiene practice who and unicef 2017 around the rope and handpumps water sources this is because contaminated water causes many water borne infections like diarrhoea and also serves as a carrier for vectors such as mosquitoes spreading epidemics kned 2012 drawing from the tam model dillon and morris 1996 the findings of this study demonstrated that the continued use of both rope and handpumps in the communities was an indication of user acceptance of both technologies mohd et al 2011 6 4 user related issues in terms of user access there was a remarkable difference between the two pump types in terms of the number of populations which directly had access to water from both pumps this proved the assumption that rope pumps can serve only family groups rather than entire rural communities cabri 2017 the findings showed that the number of users per rope pump for each of the communities in the study areas were between 150 and 300 population this is perhaps because rope pumps were being used primarily by families households and their immediate neighbourhoods in contrast handpumps served on average between 500 and 1500 population per each of the communities this disagree with the world health organization who 2006 who 2017 standards which prescribed that a standardized pump should serve 250 300 people in a community the standardized pumps and the rope pump were all perceived as technologies for potable rural water supply as compared to rainwater or unprotected hand dug wells that communities had been using and still continue to use for other house chores during rush hours which is early in the mornings and at sunset the pumps are mostly crowded with people especially women and children who come around to fetch water this crowding mostly occurred around the boreholes fitted with standardized handpumps since it serves the whole community other than the rope pumps which serve only households and families from table 3 the main types of standardized handpumps utilized in the communities were the nira af 85 and the afridev mohammed 2015 unlike rope pumps the flow rate of the standardized handpumps were also low between 16 l min and 20 l min the corresponding pumping heads supplied between 0 and 30 m of water per withdrawal from both pump types however the time spent at both pumps to fill a bucket depended on the flow rates as well as the abrupt lowering of the water level on average the waiting period for water to rise before pumping was between 15 and 40 min the users of handpump tend to walk between 10 and 15 min of distances in order to fetch water compared with residents who utilized rope pumps as main sources of water and who in most cases did not have to walk for long to water source although both pump types continued to serve as reliable sources of rural water supply the findings showed there were no standards for rope pumps cwsa 2015 unlike handpumps which were assessed against the national standards for water quantity and water quality distance from users the maximum number of people per handpump as an indication for crowding and the reliability of water services cwsa 2017 again the findings disagree with adank et al 2014 who discovered the number of people per handpump should not exceed 300 and 150 in the case of rope pumps hand dug wells in terms of distance all users should be within 500 m of the handpump adank et al 2014 2 6 5 technical performance the analysis on the technical performance of the pumps revealed that the pumping head for the rope pumps varied between 16 m and 25 m for deeper installations especially above 40 m the rope pump has to be installed in a drilled hole rather than a hand dug well this indicates that the rope pump has great diversity than the standardized pumps as a low lift pump for domestic water supply the maximum depth of standardized handpumps in the communities was less than 75 m the findings disagree with arlosoroff et al 1987 brikke and bredero 2003 who found standardized pumps to have recorded a maximum pumping head of 75 m in contrast harvey and drouin 2006 found the average maximum flow rates of 10 m delivery head was recorded as 28 l min for the standardized handpump and 41 l min for the rope pump this indicates that the rope pumps had comparative advantage since they were able to deliver water at approximately 1 5 times the rate of the nira from table 4 the study found that rope pumps at dameo with pumping heads of 18m had flow rate of 30 09 l min and standardized handpumps of 16 5 30m recorded flow rate of 24 26 l min this indicated that the rope pumps were 1 47 times faster than the rate of the standardized handpump similarly at saboro rope pumps of 16 4m had flow rate of 32 47 1 min and standardized handpumps of 16 5 30m had flow rate of 24 86 1 min an indication that the flow rates for rope pumps were on average better as compared with the handpumps based on the technical output and capacity of rope pumps technology the findings of findings support european union s 2013 argument for enabling structures at the national local government and private sector levels to develop rope pump technology and standardize its operation as alternative source of rural water supply 6 6 robustness of pumps the robustness of the pumps was measured from the frequency in breakdown of the pumps in the communities within the study area in a given year which is 2012 from table 5 the study introduced a new pump system robustness index for optimizing the pumps design and operation in order to ensure effective rural water distribution system the breakdown rate was taken as the robustness indicator and incorporated as a constraint in a pump design and operational model that minimized the total pump s operation as illustrated by table 5 the finding showed that in piriga and nayoku the breakdown rate for handpumps were relative higher compared with rope pumps in 2012 the reasons could be due to lack of maintenance culture or availability of technical personnel or high cost of spare parts for the handpumps technology in contrast however the findings showed that for damweo saboro and nalgakania there were no remarkable variations differences in the rates of breakdown between handpumps and rope pumps handpumps and rope pumps in damweo saboro and piriga appeared to be more robust than those in nalgakania and nayoku the distribution of the breakdown rate values for the pumps was tested for normality using the probability plot pp pallant 2013 argued that where the p value is low e g 0 05 you conclude that the data do not follow the normal distribution in this study the findings showed that all the set of data did not follow a normal distribution since its p value 0 026 was less than the alpha value of 0 05 at a confidence limit of 95 the probability plot is shown in fig 3 comparatively the findings from table 5 and fig 3 confirmed earlier studies by morinville 2012 and the cwsa 2003 which found that in ghana the pu and peou of water technology are hindered by funding gaps technical capacities unavailability of spare parts and human resources from fig 3 since the data did not follow a normal distribution the comparison between the two sets of data was therefore conducted using a non parametric test namely the mann whitney wilcoxon s rank sum test the first null hypothesis ho1 assumed that there is no significant difference between the robustness i e breakdown rate of the two types of pumps against an alternative hypothesis that assumed that there exist a significant difference between the robustness i e breakdown rate of the two types of pumps the test was conducted using the mean of the breakdown rate as an outcome measure for each pump type as illustrated by table 6 with 95 confidence and 1 degree of freedom df the findings showed that with the standardized handpumps the p value was 0 2123 which was comparatively greater than the alpha value α of 0 05 in terms of the rope pumps with 1 degree of freedom df the p value was 0 1341 which was also found to be greatere than the alpha value α of 0 05 the findings indicated that the first null hypothesis ho1 remained valid and therefore should be accepted the study therefore concluded that there exists no significant difference in the breakdown rate of handpumps and rope pumps in the five communities in comparison with earlier studies the present study disagree with marks et al 2013 who found handpump water systems to have capacities of easily reaching out to relatively poorer households in rural communities bathsheba 2011 also discovered that in ghana a broken down water source can take up to 12 months or more before it is repaired similarly morinville and harris 2014 and manu 2015 reports that the operation and maintenance practices for rural water sources remain poor and many gravity flows schemes and water point sources are not fully operational 6 7 sustainability and performance of pumps the sustainability of a pump is the ability of the pump to withstand and endure continued pressure of usage sustainability is very a complex and difficult parameter to ascertain since different people have diverse ways of determining the sustainability of a pump however for this study the parameters used in the determination of the sustainability of the pump were robustness of the pumps flow rate of the pumps availability of spare parts and easy access to technical expertise considering the robustness indicator the breakdown rate of both pumps was compared and from the above analysis the p values of 0 2123 and 0 1341 obtained were found to be greater than the alpha value α of 0 05 at 95 confidence level hence the null hypothesis that there was no significant difference between the robustness of the two pumps remained valid and therefore was accepted by the study the findings confirmed the second null hypothesis ho2 which assumed that there is no significant different between the sustainability of the two pumps from the third null hypothesis ho3 the study assumed that rope pump do not perform better than conventional handpumps in the communities the findings showed that the rope pumps were 1 47 times faster than the standardized handpump in terms of flow rate the rope pumps recorded flow rates of 30 09 l min and the standardized handpump 20 45 l min therefore the third null hypothesis of the study remained valid and was accepted by the study in terms of availability of spare parts the study found that the rope pump required more regular maintenance and repair than the standardized pumps this is because the rope pumps needed oil to ease the operation of the handle and also there was early wear of the rope however since there were availability of spare parts repairs could be undertaken relatively quickly and cheaply which was not perceived as a major constraint no particular preference between the two pump types was expressed by any of the respondents in terms of easy access to technical expertise the findings showed that since the rope pumps were manufactured locally technical expertise were readily available to deal with broken down pumps this made it possible for rope pumps to be repaired within the shortest possible time even though there exist some village based maintenance team not all the communities had these experts to deal with broken down standardized handpumps broken down pumps mostly took more than 48 h for repairs to begin this implies that with regards to availability of technical expertise the rope pump outperforms the standardized pump the findings confirm dayal et al 2000 who discovered that a sustained water supply is one which is regular and reliable and provides enough water of an acceptable standard for at least domestic use breakdowns are rare and repairs are rapid within 48 hours and local financing covers at least the regular costs of operation maintenance o m and repairs 6 8 microbiological water quality in determining the microbiological quality of the water from both pumps the study was initially planned to collect ten 10 water samples were collected from the five selected communities two 2 water samples each from a community one sample was taken from the rope pump and another from the standardized handpump however during the field survey six 6 water samples were collected this was because two communities namely piriga and nayoku had their rope pumps broken down hence water samples were taken from damweo nalgukania and saboro the collected samples were taken to the ghana urban water limited laboratory guwll in an ice pack and then analyzed using macconkey broth media to test for the total coliform level in the water the water was then incubated at a temperature of 37 5 c for 24 h the total coliforms for each sample recorded are illustrated in table 7 the findings showed that with the exception of damweo all the other test tube results for both rope pump and standardized handpumps remained positive across all the selected communities the positive coliform was an indication of the existing of unacceptable water quality for human consumption it implied either human or animal wastes were entering the water supplied by both pumping technologies utilized by the communities the positive results could be attributed to pollution around the water sources every effort should be made to achieve a drinking water quality as safe as possible it is important for the cwsa government and private sector to quickly identify all water contaminants and treat them before they do irreversible damage to the increasing population of the communities whose daily survival are dependent on water from both types of pumps from fig 4 the distribution of the total coliform values for the pumps see table 7 was tested for normality using the probability plot pp as illustrated by fig 4 the p value 0 414 for the data set was found to be greater than the alpha value of 0 05 at a confidence level of 95 which meant that all the set of data for both pumping devices did not follow a normal distribution consequently the distribution of the values for the pumps were tested for normality using the probability plot pp as illustrated by fig 4 from fig 4 the p value 0 414 of the test statistic was greater than the alpha value of 0 05 at 95 confidence limit this provided a sufficient indication that the set of data were not normally distributed hence the comparison between the two set of data was conducted using the independent sample t test the fourth null hypothesis ho4 assumed that there is no significant difference in microbiological i e total coliform water quality between the two pump types against an alternative hypothesis which stated that there exist significant differences in microbiological i e total coliform water quality between the two pump types the test was conducted using the mean of total coliform as an outcome measure for each pump type from table 8 the study found that the p values for the standardized handpumps and rope pumps were 0 374 and 0 478 respectively since the p values were greater than the alpha value of 0 05 at 95 confidence limit the fourth null hypothesis ho4 which assumed there is no significant difference in the total coliform between the rope pumps and standardized handpumps remained valid and was therefore accepted the study concluded there is no significant difference in total coliform between the pump types utilized by residents in the communities even though the use of the rope pump does not pose any negative impacts on the environment there is the potential for negative health impacts through secondary contamination from the rope the wear and tear from winding the wheel resulted in the rope particles breaking into the water water could also drain back into the wells resulting in contamination the finding affirm the assumption of poor operation and maintenance culture which is prevalent in the rural water sector morinville and harris 2014 the continuous use of rope and handpumps was an indication of pu and peou of both technologies in the rural communities davis 2000 dillon and morris 1996 however to improve the quality of water from both pumps there is the need to avoid environmental degradation through ecological policy measures for pollution control and human settlement planning in order to forestall possible future challenges in rural settings calow et al 2009 this is because contaminated water sources are found to be the cause for many water borne infections like diarrhoe kned 2012 who unicef 2017 7 conclusions the analysis shows that there are no significant differences in microbiological water quality between the two pumps types there are no significant differences in robustness between the two types of pumps the pumping heads of the two pump types were found to be different with relative flow rates of the two pumps the rope pumps outperformed the conventional handpumps in four out of five criteria used in determining the performance of the pumps the rope pump outperforming the standardized pump was not based on the coliform count but rather based on parameters of the sustainability and performance of the pumps in three out of four criteria used in determining sustainability i e flow rate availability of spare parts and technical expertise the rope pump outperformed the standardized handpumps in general the rope pump technology can be standardized and adapted as a pump for water supply in the five communities since there were no significant difference between the rope pump and standardized handpumps rope pump technology is feasible sustainable scalable and will meet user needs if adapted for use by the communities however the pu and peou of of handpump water technology in the rural communities are hindered by funding gaps technical capacities unavailability of spare parts and human resources the communities continual use of rope pumps highlights their intentions acceptance and actual behavior of users thus emphasizing the need to standardize and adopt both technologies in order to augment rural water supply measures for technology adaptation and pollution control will remarkably improve water quality from both rope and handpumps installed in the communities since rope pumps are not approved the cwsa and district level training packages for water and sanitation system operators do not include those who operate and maintain rope pumps if rope pump use is to be scaled up at the rural level the suitability of the technology for use on boreholes in addition to shallow wells needs to be better understood it should also be experimented with smaller number of users at the household level or in cluster of households 8 recommendations and policy implications there is the need to draw together all actors involved in rope pump technology introduction in order to address lapses in technology transfer including promotion to stimulate demand improve relationships between communities and the manufacturers secure relevant private sector investment and political will to invest in the rural water sector the attitudes of both regulators facilitators i e the water and sanitation team members the district municipal assemblies officials of the cwsa environmental health officers ehos and users will have to change if the technology is to be scaled up in the communities to improve water quality rope pump and handpump technologies should qualify for government subsidies and investment just as pipe born water technologies do again technical capacities must be built and financial sources for producers should be improved upon in order to promote and market rope pump technology to achieve this technical financial and user information on rope pump technology must be compiled and made easily accessible to stakeholders the flow rates of water from the rope pumps may be faster yet short lived therefore the study recommend future studies to compare the quantity of water and duration of flow per technology to see if the rope pump meets the per capita basic water requirement bwr of the communities declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

11941,ground water systems form essential components of rural water supply in ghana four handpumps namely afridev india mark ii nira af 85 and vergnet have been standardized for rural water supply however they have failed to deliver satisfactory levels of water supply and sustainability largely due to inadequate maintenance capacity an alternative to standardized imported handpumps is the locally manufactured rope pump which is considerably cheaper and easier to maintain but has not been standardized for use in ghana for rural water supply framed from the technology acceptance model tam the post positivist paradigm and quantitative research approach this study compared the performance of rope pumps with standardized handpumps to determine whether rope pumps technology provide viable alternative for rural water supply probability sampling and self designed questionnaires were used to elicit data from 431 respondents descriptive statistics correlations and independent sample t test were utilized to analyze the data decision rule applied in testing the hypothesis ho with 95 confidence interval was accept ho if p values are α 0 05 and do not accept ho if p values are α 0 05 findings showed rope pumps as a potentially viable option to standardized handpumps there were no significant differences between rope pumps and standardized handpumps with respect to robustness sustainability and microbiological quality of water delivered by the two pump types rope pump technology is feasible sustainable scalable and will likely meet user needs if standardized and adapted for use by the communities measures for technology adaptation government subsidies investments pollution control and standardization are necessary and will remarkably improve water quality from rope pumps installed in the communities graphical abstract image 1 keywords rope pump and handpump sustainable rural community water supply water quality northern and upper east regions ghana 1 introduction water is an essential commodity in the lives of humans yet acces to potable water has become a problem for most people in rural communities the standardized handpump is a pump which has been in use for groundwater supply for a very long time in many countries calow et al 2009 its mechanism of drawing groundwater is by pump and suction which forces water to rise to the surface through the tubes connected to the pump wateraid ghana 2004 similar to the handpump is the rope pump which comprises of a wheel and a handle connected to a rope with washers and used to draw water from a well or a borehole european union 2013 globally the use of rope and handpumps have become increasingly essential because prolonged dry seasons experienced by rural poor communities and villages adversely affect the availability of rainwater or runoff and ground water resources including boreholes wells or springs which could serve as a buffer for short term environmental variability and evaporation of surface water resources macdonald and calow 2007 as a result of climate variabilities the rainfall patterns across africa have been highly variable droughts are becoming endemic in sub saharan africa and the extent of drought affected areas is increasing sheffield and wood 2008 there is observed increase in water demand during droughts in southern africa in the early 1990s calow et al 1997 droughts in west africa east africa and the horn of africa calow et al 2009 in periods of prolonged drought pipe born systems easily breakdown borehole water levels and quality reduce rapidly surface water and shallow unimproved groundwater sources shallow wells and small springs often fail leaving only water points abstracting from larger groundwater bodies operational therefore often only the larger springs deep hand dug wells or boreholes are reliable across seasons and in drought periods macdonald 2009 7 8 in poor aquifers an upsurge in demand for water particularly during excessive dry seasons can result in increased drawdowns and consequently an increased unpredictability and risk of failure of water sources manu 2015 as demand for water continues to rise as rural population grows the net effect includes increase in industrial chemical and domestic waste which can cause reduction in quality and availability of water resources ghana statistical service 2012 besides poor drainage improper waste disposal and increased economic activities such as farming and mining could result in water pollution deteriorate the quality of human health and cause damage to facilities used for transportation and delivery of drinking water to rural households bazaanah 2019 this affects the sustainability of water resources and increases the burden of water managers to satisfy the average annual rural population s demand for quality rural water ghana statistical service 2015 therefore there is the urgent need for communities to adapt to ecological variabilities in order to preserve their ecosystems and the quality of human life united nations 2015 this would require the avoidance of environmental degradation pollution control and human settlement planning bazaanah 2020 in addition technologies such as rope and handpump waer systems are required to effectively management water resources in order to prevent possible future challenges in rural settings calow et al 2009 in ghana the operation and maintenance practices for rural water sources remain poor and many gravity flows schemes and water point sources are not fully operational morinville and harris 2014 moreover post construction monitoring and technical support gaps exist at the district and rural level with the district water offices focusing more on construction and less on maintenance morinville and harris 2014 the benchmark of the smart development work 2018 indicates that a sustainable water source piped borehole schemes should provide water for a minimum of 350 days in a year with less than 14 days of breakdown in ghana very few water sources piped boreholes are able to meet this standard and a broken down water source can take up to 12 months or more before it is repaired bathsheba 2011 on average a water source functions well within the first three years after which it starts breaking down yire 2015 the majority of rural water sources are not regularly maintained and hence at risk of regular breakdowns meanwhile political commitment in construction and maintenance of existing water supply schemes is demonstrated mostly during an election year manu 2015 beyond the poor culture of maintenance is the lack of transparent and local accountability structures community sense of ownership and lack of water quality test especially for water schemes serving rural communities bazaanah 2019 again the excessive interference by governments and politicians in rural water supply basically for political expediencies addo 2010 is worrisome short term rural water policies and tariff setting are influenced by politicians bohman 2010 while the selection of beneficiary communities for award of water schemes and membership composition of water boards committees are riddled with political patronage doe 2007 while significant strides have been achieved in post construction maintenance of urban water supply facilities which are periodically rehabilitated by the ghana water company gwc in liaison with private operators and public utility regulatory commission purc ministry of water resource works and housing mwrwh 2011 similar progress are yet to be concretely registered for the small towns and rural community water sector cwsa 2015 drawing from the general comment 15 of the united nations 2003 this study contends that clean and affordable water access is a human right waer is essential for everyday life and development of human populace regardless of their locations yet in the northern and upper east regions while population soars access to affordable water supply and sanitation presents a different narrative cwsa 2015 and this is more prevalent in rural poor communities where the lack of maintenance of water facilities poses a challenge and threat to rural water sustainability mwrwh 2012 if the situation is unresolved it could affect the sustainable development goals sdgs implementation united nations 2015 and ghana s vision for achieving universal access to potable water and sanitation for all mwrwh 2012 to avoid the effects of water scarcity the rope pump technology is offered as a simple water withdrawal technology which has the potential of reducing the cost of installation operation and maintenance as compared to the handpump systems used in rural parts of ghana a prototype of rope pump is presented in fig 1 from fig 1 the rope pump technology is a hand operated water lifting device made of locally available materials it uses washers threaded on a rope to lift water inside a pipe to the surface the rope is moved by rotation of a wheel handle the rope pump costs between 75 and 80 less than the standard handpumps currently used in ghana it was first introduced on a pilot basis by cwsa in 2000 in western greater accra the northern and upper east regions european union 2013 as an alternative to pipe born water systems the rope and handpumps technology remain feasible and easily adaptable technologies which could help reduce the cost of access to potable water among rural poor communities wateraid ghana 2004 this study argues that if well adapted and integrated into the rural water sector the rope pump water technology could become a cost effective technology compared with the standardized handpump and pipe born water schemes it has the capacity to meet the increasing household water demands of the poor and needy in the rural communities of the northern and upper east regions of the country 2 problem statement standardized handpumps have been in use in ghana for quite some time now it has been one of the most widely used technologies for the supply of groundwater in most rural parts of the country especially in the northern and upper east regions community water and sanitation agency 2014 despite the widepread use of handpumps evidence show that only 57 percent of hand pumps are functional 31 percent are sub optimally functional and 12 percent are not functioning at all with respect to piped schemes 67 percent of all piped schemes are functional 4 percent are sub optimally functional and 29 percent are not functional cwsa 2015 moreover the 2016 estimates show that around nine out of ten ghanaians have access to improved drinking water source with around 68 percent having access to only basic water services who 2017 who unicef 2017 the rural communities where water schemes are either unavailable non functional or optimally functional would have to depend on unsafe surface water and or polluted water sources including rivers dams and rainwater sources for domestic purposes over the period of 1990 to 2017 national access to improved water increaseed by 32 percent ie from 56 to 88 showing that the national water coverage in ghana is higher than the regional average consequently rope pumps are essential for serving families and groups in rural communities collaborative africa budget reform initiative cabri 2017 while the above analysis presents a broadly positive representation on access to potable water delivered through handpumps it disguises urban rural disparities particularly on issues related to reliability water quality and sustainability the vast majority of ghanaians without access to quality water and sanitation services live in rural areas and small towns manu 2015 in ghana although four handpumps namely afridev india mark ii nira af 85 and vergnet have been standardized for supply of water coverage in rural areas has stagnated in recent years driven by climate variabilities poor service delivery mohammed 2015 pollution and failure to maintain infrastructure who unicef 2017 around two thirds of the installed handpump facilities in rural areas are either completely or partially broken down adank et al 2014 in terms of performance a handpump is considered fully functional if water flows within 5 strokes sub optimally functional if it takes more than 5 strokes for water to flow and not functional if water does not flow cwsa 2015 1 at the community level the level of service provided by handpumps are assessed against the national standards as determined by ghana standards authority for water quantity and water quality distance from users the maximum number of people per handpump as an indication for crowding and the reliability of water services cwsa 2017 for adank et al 2014 2 the service level indicators and minimum standards benchmarks for handpumps are specified as follows quantity at least 20 l per capita per day quality ghana standards authority gsa water quality standards however for practical reasons the minimum standard applied is set as perceived as acceptable by users coverage the number of people per handpump should not exceed 300 in case of boreholes and 150 in case of hand dug wells distance all users should be within 500 m of the handpump reliability the handpump should provide water for at least 95 of the year interpreted as at least 347 days of regular service without interruption adank et al 2014 2 in ghana handpumps which meet the standards for all five service level indicators are considered to provide basic services handpumps are managed and monitored by the water and sanitation management teams wsmts who operates in rural communities the performance standards for wsmts are assessed against indicators and benchmarks related to governance operation and financial management capacities the benchmarks for monitoring and managing hand pumps are i non political interference ii availability of area mechanics services iii breakdown repairs and routine maintenance these indicators are set by the cwsa based on national policy guidelines and standards regulating community water and sanitation delivery in ghana cwsa 2015 as compared with handpump the rope pump water technology was first piloted in ghana by the community water and sanitation agency cwsa in 1990 although rope pumps have been in use in rural settlements since 2000 the technology was first transferred from nicaragua to ghana between 1999 and 2000 bombas 2004 despite the wide usage of rope pumps the technology has not been standardized to supply adequate affordable and clean groundwater to communities the standardization of rope pumps would involve the adaptation of similar quality standards regulatory and management systems as used by the cwsa and gsa in the management of handpumps this study draws on cases from the northern and upper east regions of ghana in order to permit a comparative analysis of the utilization of rope pumps and standardized handpumps to ascertain their performance and make a case for standardization of rope pumps in order to make water easily accessible and affordable with guaranteed quality for use by rural poor communities 3 objectives and hypotheses the aim for the study was to compare the utilization of rope pumps and standardized handpumps to ascertain their performance in rural communities of the northern and upper east regions of ghana in specific terms this study determined the sanitation and hygiene around the pumps quality of water delivered by rope pumps and conventional handpump the sustainability and robustness frequency of breakdowns of rope pumps and conventional hand pumps moreover the study determined the popularity of rope pump and that of the standardized pumps among rural households in selected communities from the objectives the study estimated the following null hypothesis ho1 there is no significant difference between the robustness of the two types of pumps ho2 there is no significant differences in the sustainability of rope pumps compared with conventional handpumps ho3 rope pump do not perform better than conventional handpumps in the communities and finally ho4 there is no significant difference in the microbiological i e coliform water quality between the two pump types sustainability was defined by this study as intervention which is capable of being supported and maintained by a community or individual over an extended period of time with an absolute minimum of outside assistance wood 1994 also a water supply system is said to be sustainable when it can be financed or co financed by the users with limited but feasible external support and technical assistance moreover dayal et al 2000 discovered that a sustained water supply is one which is regular and reliable and provides enough water of an acceptable standard for at least domestic use the performance of the pumps is determined by their breakdown rates a pump is considered to perform better where breakdowns are rare and repairs are rapid within 48 hours and local financing covers at least the regular costs of operation maintenance o m and repairs it means that water which is sustainable is at the same time robust this study determined robustness of the pumps in terms of the pumps ability to continue to function under varying water demand conditions irc cinara 1997 4 theoretical and empirical literature this study draws from the technology acceptance model tam which serves as the theoretical foundation of technology adaptation studies in varying socio economic contexts agarwal 2000 both the theoretical and empirical literature presents sufficient evidence that tam has an enhanced capability of predicting how people make decisions regarding new technology adoption tam has frequently been used for information systems and other fields agarwal 2000 davis 2000 as such tam serves as an appropriate model to use to address consumer acceptance of various technologies therefore tam is useful when a study focuses on the potential adoption of an emerging technology this study utilized tam to predict user acceptance and highlight potential design issues before users of the technology interact with the system dillon and morris 1996 mohd et al 2011 tam was developed with support from ibm canada ajzen and fishbein 1980 tam demonstrates a pioneering research effort by generating a framework for explaining behavioral intentions and actual behavior of users for technology adoption yousafzai et al 2007 the efficiency of a technology is determined by its perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use the perceived usefulness pu and perceived ease of use peou are the perceptions of the beliefs users hold about the technology dillon and morris 1996 davis 2000 defined pu as the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance performance and peou as the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort venkatesh and davis 2000 through four longitudinal studies demonstrated that through the tam model interventions could be aimed in advance towards the 52 of variance in usage of interventions and 60 of the variance in use among populations who are less inclined to adopt the technology venkatesh and davis 2000 in a related study marks et al 2014 found that households participation during technology adoption meetings p value 0 04 α 0 01 n 176 involvement in technical decisions p value 0 6 α 0 01 n 176 and labour contribution to handpump and rope pump construction p value 0 07 α 0 01 n 176 were each strongly and positively associated with poorer handpump platform infrastructure in both regions however handpump infrastructure was likely to provide quality water outcomes when all other variables were else held constant similarly in kenya marks onda and davis 2013 studied the functionality of handpump systems which served between 500 and 8000 rural household populations the study discovered that due to the dispersed settlement patterns across the population and within the study provinces handpump water supply reached approximately 60 percent of households in each community in the case of ghana morinville 2012 and the cwsa 2003 found that the pu and peou of water technology are hindered by funding gaps technical capacities unavailability of spare parts and human resources again arlosoroff et al 1987 brikke and bredero 2003 found standardized pumps to have recorded a maximum pumping head of 75 m in contrast harvey and drouin 2006 found the average maximum flow rates of 10 m delivery head was recorded as 28 l min for the standardized handpump and 41 l min for the rope pump 5 study areas and methodology 5 1 description of the study areas the study area falls within two regions namely the upper east and northern regions the upper east region is bounded to the west by the upper west region to the north by burkina faso to the east by togo and to the south by the northern region the northern region is also bounded by ivory coast to the west upper east and upper west to the north brong ahafo region to the south and togo to the east the study was carried out in five communities namely damweo saboro and nalgukania in the upper east region and piriga and nayoku in the northern region from fig 2 damweo is located in the south eastern part of the bolgatanga township of the upper east region within longitudes 0 50 55 w and 0 51 20 w and latitudes 10 46 18 n and 10 46 40 n it is bounded by sawaba to the east zongo to the north ssnit flats to the south and zongo no 1 to the west see fig 2 piriga and nayoku are located within walewale township piriga lay roughly within longitude 0 47 7 w and latitude 10 19 55 n whiles nayoku roughly lay around longitude 0 47 19 w and latitude 10 21 13 n see fig 2 west mamprusi district profile 2012 damweo has a total population of 1 363 composed of males 655 and females 708 ghana statistical service gss 2010 the population for piriga and nayoku is 1979 population projected from 2000phc composed of 49 2 male and 50 8 females piriga is more populous 1016 than nayoku 963 gss 2012 in fig 2 the fourth and fifth study communities were the nalgukania 1356 population and saboro 1232 population are located in the navrongo township nalgukania is located roughly within longitude 1 5 58 063 w and 1 6 20 275 w and latitudes 10 52 43 507 n and 10 52 17 918 n it is bounded by gonia to the north korania to the south and nosinia and bonia to the east and west respectively saboro on the other hand is located roughly within longitude 1 5 46 309 w and 1 6 55 544 w and latitude 10 54 24 631 n and 10 54 31 277 n bounded by kayilo to the north namolo east to the east namolo west to the west and nosinia to the south see fig 2 the study communities generally have gentle slopes with isolated rock outcrops and uplands which have slopes gss 2012 the main type of soil present in the communities is the groundwater laterite the groundwater laterites are developed mainly over shale and granite due to the underlying rock type granite they become waterlogged during the rainy season and dry out during the dry season thus causing cemented layers of iron stone hard pan which makes cultivation difficult the study communities have no rivers but smaller streams exist and they are underlined by birimian rocks and granite the groundwater in the communities is laterite due to impervious iron pan or clay pan in the sub soil the areas are often characterized by waterlogs at the peak of the rains resulting in perennial floods gsd 2009 the climates of the communities are classified as tropical with two distinct seasons namely a wet season and a dry season gss 2010 2012 the natural vegetation of the communities is that of the guinea savannah woodland consisting of short deciduous trees widely spaced and a ground flora which gets burnt by fire or scorched by the sun during the long dry season characterized by the harmattan winds which blow across the sahara desert the most common economic trees are the shea nut dawadawa and baobab the primary sources of water supply in the communities are pipe systems boreholes fitted with handpumps hand dug wells fitted with rope pumps as well as unprotected hand dug wells streams ponds and dugouts which exist in the communiites are primarily used as water sources for animal farming pipe borne water are present in some households which can afford them whiles other households resort to hand dug wells fitted with rope pumps and the handpump fitted boreholes kassena nankana east district kned 2012 meanwhile the disposal of wastewater constitute major environmental and public health problems in the communities all the communities are not properly drained and therefore wastewater generated from bathing are normally collected around houses since no soakaways are constructed it increases the breeding of mosquitoes which causes malaria the communities lack toilet facilities hence open defecation is generally common solid waste generated in the settlements are managed by open dumping and incineration causing environmental pollution and increasing disease infection such as cholera and typhoid among residents in the communities gss 2010 5 2 methodology in planning the research approach data collection and analysis the study utilized several procedures the study adopted the cross sectional design and the post positivist paradigm which was generally structured along the quantitative research approach walliman 2018 these strategies were utilized to allow an objective study comparative analysis of the performance of rope pump and standardized handpumps in the communities cross sectional design enabled the selection of respondents across a section of the population at a pre defined time babbie 2016 moreover post positivism paradigm ensured precision in the sample estimation and allowed objectivity in the evaluation of the objectives and hypotheses of the study neuman 2014 also drawing from mugenda 2003 the profile of the study area was reviewed and communities within the study area where rope pumps and standardized handpumps existed were purposively chosen in order to permit a comparative analysis the five case study communities namely damweo saboro nalgukania piriga and nayoku were selected based on the availability and utilization of rope pumps as well as standardized handpumps the total number of pumps in the study area was 24 with rope pumps and standardized handpumps being 14 and 10 respectively the water sources were not evenly distributed in the communities the rope pumps were used by households while handpumps were used by the entire populace of the communities without any water source in their homes in order to determine the quality of drinking water i e bacteriological quality delivered by rope pumps and standardized handpumps a total of ten 10 water samples were taken from all the five 5 communities the ten water quality samples were taken due to financial constrains at the time of undertaking the study a 300 ml water sample was taken each for a rope pump and a standardized handpump water from the pumps which have been idle for a while were taken after water from the pumps has been allowed to run for 20 30 seconds the samples were cooled and filtered immediately after sampling and were transported to the laboratory for microbiological analysis since previous research has indicated a significant relationship between microbiological contamination of shallow groundwater and rainfall especially depth of rainfall howard et al 2003 it was important that this variable was considered when taking the samples for analysis the sustainability of a pump was considered by the study as the ability of the pump to withstand and endure continued pressure of usage sustainability is a very complex and difficult parameter to ascertain since different people have diverse ways of determining the sustainability of a pump however for this study the parameters used in the determination of the sustainability of the pumps were robustness of the pumps flow rate of the pumps availability of spare parts and easy access to technical expertise the robustness of the pumps was measured from the frequency in breakdown of the pumps in the communities the total head of the rope pump was determined by measuring the total length of the rope within the pump which aids in the transportation of water to the surface and dividing the length by two 2 however since drilling data was not available for drilled borehole with standardised handpumps the total head was estimated from the type of hamdpump installed since it provides the maximum depth at which a standardised handpump type can draw water from a borehole standardised handpumps installed on boreholes in ghana is dependent on the depth of the borehole that is shallow boreholes between 0m to 16 5m have the nira standardised handpump installed while the afridev is installed on boreholes with depth between 16 5m to 30m cwsa 2011 the flow rates of the rope pumps and standardized handpumps were determined by the amount of water obtained from the pumps after a minute of pumping the collection of data about the sustainability and robustness of the pumps occurred through directed interviews administered to 10 opinion leaders selected from the five communities self designed questionnaires were prepared and administered in each of the community the questionnaires aimed to collect information about the construction of the pumps acceptance of the pumps by the community members the uses of water hygeine around the pumps maintenance system costs and the frequency in breakdown the groups targeted for administering the questionnaire were individual household members between the ages of 18 60 who used these pumps as sources of water the total sample size for the study was 559 which composed of 459 household respondents and 10 purposively selected opinion leaders comprising two opinion leaders from each of the communities the choice and selection of the opinion leaders was based on their foreknowledge and experience on water and sanitation situation in the communities besides the opinion leaders are the mouthpiece of the communities and had much more information on whatever goes on in the communities and could furnish the study with the necessary information needed for the research also the rope pumps where mainly for household use and the landlords were the main point of information regarding the use and maintenanc of the rope pumps the sample size for the households was calculated based on the formula n n 1 n α ² where n sample size n total population of the communities and α margin of error a confidence level of 90 representing a 10 marginal error was used in estimating the sample size for the various communities the total sample size selected from damweo was calculated as follows n n 1 n α ² 1363 1 1363 0 1 ² 1363 1 1363 0 01 hence n 93 this sample calculation procedure was repeated in the selection of the remaining communities as illustrated by table 1 and based on the sample size formula the study utilized 459 household samples composed of damweo 93 saboro 92 nalgukania 93 nayoku 90 and piriga 91 the simple random sampling technique babbie 2016 i e the lottery method was utilized for selecting the units of analysis from the various sub groups stratum from each of the communities this technique allowed the respondents in each population sub group to have equal and fair chances of being represented in the study hacker 2014 the data collected were analyzed and compared with the world health organization 2006 standards to ascertain whether the bacteriological quality of the water is good for use by the community members in order to weigh the influence of external parameters on the results correlations were statistically analyzed pallant 2013 using the presumptive count of the total coliform counts as the dependent variable the independent variables considered were the type of pump location i e community depth of the well time period since the last rain age of the pump time period since the last cleaning of the well and number of users at 95 confidence interval and with tolerated error margin of 5 e 0 05 the decision rule for the hypothesis test was stated as accept the null hypothesis ho if p value is greater than or equal to the alpha value α of 0 05 and do not accept ho if p value is less than the assumed alpha value α of 0 05 furthermore statistical analysis was then conducted to compare the respective influences of the rope pumps and the conventional standardized handpumps on microbiological water quality in order to test the actual differences between the two sets of data the independent sample t test was utilized cresswell 2014 as a first step the distribution of log median value of the thermotolerant coliform counts for the conventional standardized pumps and for the rope pumps had to be tested for normality using the probability plots correlation coefficient test gronmo 2019 the sustainability robustness and total head of rope pumps and standardized handpumps were used in the comparative analysis using the statistical product for services and solutions spss version 25 software pallant 2013 the annual breakdown rate data for the rope pump as well as the standardized handpumps was tested for normality using the probability plot test it showed that the data did not follow a normal distribution hence the non parametric design which is the mann whitney wilcoxon s rank sum test bernard 2011 was used to determine whether there was a significant difference between the rope pump and standardized handpumps in the communities 6 results and discussion 6 1 gender location and perceptions on utilization of rope handpumps from table 2 the questionnaires retrieved from the respondents from the five communities were less than the initial total sample size of 559 the response distribution based on community location and gender showed about 431 respondents participated in the study translating into a response rate of 77 the difference in the participation among the respondents could probably be attributed to the timing when the fieldwork was conducted the communities are predominantly agrarian and the fieldwork occurred in the rainy season a period where most residents are often busy with farming activities and therefore were not mostly available at home for the interviews in table 2 the findings suggest that a little above half 52 of the respondents were females and 48 were males the relatively higher female participation was perhaps due to the perceived gender roles attached to water in the northern and upper east regions where females are traditionally perceived to be responsible for domestic responsibilities of fetching water and maintaining sanitary environment at the household level it suggest that the capacity of females towards maintenance and interpretation of drinking water quality is essential for ensuring good health and adequate hygiene around handpump and rope pumps water sources in the communities in terms of gender both male and females generally perceived that both the rope and handpump technology were useful in the communities as reliable sources of households drinking water community members are more inclined to use both technologies as sustainable sources of water agarwal 2000 venkatesh and davis 2000 a positive perceived usefulness pu and perceived ease of use peou among users of the technology dillon and morris 1996 is likely to result in change in attitudes possible technology adaptation and sustainability of water supply in the communities 6 2 water and sanitation facilities the communities are equipped with pipe systems boreholes fitted with handpumps hand dug wells fitted with rope pumps as well as unprotected hand dug wells these are the water sources from which members of the communities obtain water for their daily needs from table 3 the results showed damweo had one 1 standardized handpump a number of houses were also connected to the nations pipe borne water system there are also four 4 rope pumps in damweo as well as two 2 unprotected wells pond and dugouts about 2 of the respondents from damweo had access to pipe born water majority of the respondents 80 confirmed that there were two 2 public kvip s in damweo with some houses having water closets and pit latrines similar to gss 2010 about 50 of the respondents in damweo perceived that open defecation was still prevalent among residents in the community again from table 3 the finding showed saboro community had two 2 standardized handpumps three 3 rope pumps and only 3 of the households had access to pipe born water about 95 of the respondents confirmed that the community did not have public place of convenience only a few households 10 had access to pit latrines while most people 90 living in the community adhered to open air defecation from table 3 nalgakania had three 3 standardized handpumps and four 4 rope pumps about 8 of the respondents confirmed that only a few houses had access to pipe born water meaning most of the residents obtained their sources of drinking water mostly from rope pumps and standardized handpumps most of the respondents confirmed 86 that there were no public toilets in the community under these compelling conditions there is no option for most residents 77 of the community but for open defecation furthermore the study found that piriga was relatively equipped with two 2 standardized handpumps unprotected well with the use of rope and bucket and two 2 broken down rope pumps which were not in use hence all the community members utilized water from the unprotected wells and standardized handpumps for their daily needs see table 3 most of the respondents confirmed that there was only one public toilet serving the community with only a few households having pit latrines open defecation was perceived to be very common 84 practice at piriga since places of convenience were perceived to be inadequate from table 3 the findings raises public health concerns who 2006 who 2017 the need to intensify education on environmental health and hygiene promotion around drinking water sources in the community cwsa 2017 similarly the findings showed the people in nayoku had their source of water from two 2 standardized handpumps and three 3 unprotected wells the only rope pump available in the community had broken down due to lack of maintenance see table 3 with respect to sanitation 85 of the respondents confirmed the community was beset with inadequate toilet facilities apart from the relatively rare individual household latrines there was just one community latrine for the 962 residents of nayoku and it is not always in operation in times of flooding this situation compel most of the residents 92 to practice open defecation in general access to pipe born water was limited this is perhaps due to the cost of maintenance and inability to pay for user fees as an alternative to pipe born water supply the rope and handpumps technology remain feasible and easily adaptable technologies which could help reduce the cost of access to potable water among rural poor communities wateraid ghana 2004 again the findings in table 3 imply that access to basic water toilet facilities still remains a luxury for residents living in the communities open defecation was a common practice due to lack of improved public toilets the consequences of this practice on the health of residents are enormous forcing them to pay a heavy price for healthcare beside polluting the environment open defecation causes perilous problems arising from ill health high levels of open defecation are linked to child mortality poverty and disparities between rich and poor who unicef 2017 similarly calow et al 2009 admonishes the need to avoid environmental degradation and adapt to technologies such as rope and handpump systems in order to forestall possible future water challenges in rural settings adank et al 2014 also found that around two thirds of the installed handpump facilities in rural areas are either completely or partially broken down 6 3 hygiene around pump facilities the physical state and hygiene around both rope and handpumps under the study were further determined in order to establish whether the pumps were close to a latrine or any other source of pollutant including waste dumping site stagnant water or poor drainage channels around the wells which could pollute the communities drinking water sources although a 10 m radius is recommended by the who 2006 2017 and cwsa 2015 as standard distance between water sources and toilet refuse dumps at the damweo community the study found rope pumps were sited closer to public toilets the distance from the rope pump to the community latrine was 8 5 m the standardized hand pumps were however not located nearer to any source of pollution at the time of the survey similarly saboro had rope pumps closer to a latrine approximately the distance from the rope pump to the latrine was 7 3 m none of the standardized handpumps in the area was situated near a pollution source however there were incidences of poor drainage channels causing stagnant water around one of the boreholes fitted with standardized handpump in the community in contrast there were no cracks nor hygiene problems with both the rope and handpumps in the nalgukania community there were no latrine refuse dumping site cemetery nor toilet facilities nearer to the pumps an indication that the residents were perhaps aware of the 10 m radius stipulations and standards of the cwsa at both piriga and nayoku the survey found that the drainage channels in both communities were destroyed causing water stagnation around the pumps and boreholes the location of these water sources could cause pollution of the water utilized by both communities in contrast no hygiene problems were detected at any of the pumps in the nalgukania community this is perhaps due to awareness of water safety and maintenance environmental hygiene surrounding water sources in the community from the findings the study deduced that the benefits of having access to improved drinking water sources in the communities can only be fully realized when there is also access to improved sanitation and adherence to good hygiene practice who and unicef 2017 around the rope and handpumps water sources this is because contaminated water causes many water borne infections like diarrhoea and also serves as a carrier for vectors such as mosquitoes spreading epidemics kned 2012 drawing from the tam model dillon and morris 1996 the findings of this study demonstrated that the continued use of both rope and handpumps in the communities was an indication of user acceptance of both technologies mohd et al 2011 6 4 user related issues in terms of user access there was a remarkable difference between the two pump types in terms of the number of populations which directly had access to water from both pumps this proved the assumption that rope pumps can serve only family groups rather than entire rural communities cabri 2017 the findings showed that the number of users per rope pump for each of the communities in the study areas were between 150 and 300 population this is perhaps because rope pumps were being used primarily by families households and their immediate neighbourhoods in contrast handpumps served on average between 500 and 1500 population per each of the communities this disagree with the world health organization who 2006 who 2017 standards which prescribed that a standardized pump should serve 250 300 people in a community the standardized pumps and the rope pump were all perceived as technologies for potable rural water supply as compared to rainwater or unprotected hand dug wells that communities had been using and still continue to use for other house chores during rush hours which is early in the mornings and at sunset the pumps are mostly crowded with people especially women and children who come around to fetch water this crowding mostly occurred around the boreholes fitted with standardized handpumps since it serves the whole community other than the rope pumps which serve only households and families from table 3 the main types of standardized handpumps utilized in the communities were the nira af 85 and the afridev mohammed 2015 unlike rope pumps the flow rate of the standardized handpumps were also low between 16 l min and 20 l min the corresponding pumping heads supplied between 0 and 30 m of water per withdrawal from both pump types however the time spent at both pumps to fill a bucket depended on the flow rates as well as the abrupt lowering of the water level on average the waiting period for water to rise before pumping was between 15 and 40 min the users of handpump tend to walk between 10 and 15 min of distances in order to fetch water compared with residents who utilized rope pumps as main sources of water and who in most cases did not have to walk for long to water source although both pump types continued to serve as reliable sources of rural water supply the findings showed there were no standards for rope pumps cwsa 2015 unlike handpumps which were assessed against the national standards for water quantity and water quality distance from users the maximum number of people per handpump as an indication for crowding and the reliability of water services cwsa 2017 again the findings disagree with adank et al 2014 who discovered the number of people per handpump should not exceed 300 and 150 in the case of rope pumps hand dug wells in terms of distance all users should be within 500 m of the handpump adank et al 2014 2 6 5 technical performance the analysis on the technical performance of the pumps revealed that the pumping head for the rope pumps varied between 16 m and 25 m for deeper installations especially above 40 m the rope pump has to be installed in a drilled hole rather than a hand dug well this indicates that the rope pump has great diversity than the standardized pumps as a low lift pump for domestic water supply the maximum depth of standardized handpumps in the communities was less than 75 m the findings disagree with arlosoroff et al 1987 brikke and bredero 2003 who found standardized pumps to have recorded a maximum pumping head of 75 m in contrast harvey and drouin 2006 found the average maximum flow rates of 10 m delivery head was recorded as 28 l min for the standardized handpump and 41 l min for the rope pump this indicates that the rope pumps had comparative advantage since they were able to deliver water at approximately 1 5 times the rate of the nira from table 4 the study found that rope pumps at dameo with pumping heads of 18m had flow rate of 30 09 l min and standardized handpumps of 16 5 30m recorded flow rate of 24 26 l min this indicated that the rope pumps were 1 47 times faster than the rate of the standardized handpump similarly at saboro rope pumps of 16 4m had flow rate of 32 47 1 min and standardized handpumps of 16 5 30m had flow rate of 24 86 1 min an indication that the flow rates for rope pumps were on average better as compared with the handpumps based on the technical output and capacity of rope pumps technology the findings of findings support european union s 2013 argument for enabling structures at the national local government and private sector levels to develop rope pump technology and standardize its operation as alternative source of rural water supply 6 6 robustness of pumps the robustness of the pumps was measured from the frequency in breakdown of the pumps in the communities within the study area in a given year which is 2012 from table 5 the study introduced a new pump system robustness index for optimizing the pumps design and operation in order to ensure effective rural water distribution system the breakdown rate was taken as the robustness indicator and incorporated as a constraint in a pump design and operational model that minimized the total pump s operation as illustrated by table 5 the finding showed that in piriga and nayoku the breakdown rate for handpumps were relative higher compared with rope pumps in 2012 the reasons could be due to lack of maintenance culture or availability of technical personnel or high cost of spare parts for the handpumps technology in contrast however the findings showed that for damweo saboro and nalgakania there were no remarkable variations differences in the rates of breakdown between handpumps and rope pumps handpumps and rope pumps in damweo saboro and piriga appeared to be more robust than those in nalgakania and nayoku the distribution of the breakdown rate values for the pumps was tested for normality using the probability plot pp pallant 2013 argued that where the p value is low e g 0 05 you conclude that the data do not follow the normal distribution in this study the findings showed that all the set of data did not follow a normal distribution since its p value 0 026 was less than the alpha value of 0 05 at a confidence limit of 95 the probability plot is shown in fig 3 comparatively the findings from table 5 and fig 3 confirmed earlier studies by morinville 2012 and the cwsa 2003 which found that in ghana the pu and peou of water technology are hindered by funding gaps technical capacities unavailability of spare parts and human resources from fig 3 since the data did not follow a normal distribution the comparison between the two sets of data was therefore conducted using a non parametric test namely the mann whitney wilcoxon s rank sum test the first null hypothesis ho1 assumed that there is no significant difference between the robustness i e breakdown rate of the two types of pumps against an alternative hypothesis that assumed that there exist a significant difference between the robustness i e breakdown rate of the two types of pumps the test was conducted using the mean of the breakdown rate as an outcome measure for each pump type as illustrated by table 6 with 95 confidence and 1 degree of freedom df the findings showed that with the standardized handpumps the p value was 0 2123 which was comparatively greater than the alpha value α of 0 05 in terms of the rope pumps with 1 degree of freedom df the p value was 0 1341 which was also found to be greatere than the alpha value α of 0 05 the findings indicated that the first null hypothesis ho1 remained valid and therefore should be accepted the study therefore concluded that there exists no significant difference in the breakdown rate of handpumps and rope pumps in the five communities in comparison with earlier studies the present study disagree with marks et al 2013 who found handpump water systems to have capacities of easily reaching out to relatively poorer households in rural communities bathsheba 2011 also discovered that in ghana a broken down water source can take up to 12 months or more before it is repaired similarly morinville and harris 2014 and manu 2015 reports that the operation and maintenance practices for rural water sources remain poor and many gravity flows schemes and water point sources are not fully operational 6 7 sustainability and performance of pumps the sustainability of a pump is the ability of the pump to withstand and endure continued pressure of usage sustainability is very a complex and difficult parameter to ascertain since different people have diverse ways of determining the sustainability of a pump however for this study the parameters used in the determination of the sustainability of the pump were robustness of the pumps flow rate of the pumps availability of spare parts and easy access to technical expertise considering the robustness indicator the breakdown rate of both pumps was compared and from the above analysis the p values of 0 2123 and 0 1341 obtained were found to be greater than the alpha value α of 0 05 at 95 confidence level hence the null hypothesis that there was no significant difference between the robustness of the two pumps remained valid and therefore was accepted by the study the findings confirmed the second null hypothesis ho2 which assumed that there is no significant different between the sustainability of the two pumps from the third null hypothesis ho3 the study assumed that rope pump do not perform better than conventional handpumps in the communities the findings showed that the rope pumps were 1 47 times faster than the standardized handpump in terms of flow rate the rope pumps recorded flow rates of 30 09 l min and the standardized handpump 20 45 l min therefore the third null hypothesis of the study remained valid and was accepted by the study in terms of availability of spare parts the study found that the rope pump required more regular maintenance and repair than the standardized pumps this is because the rope pumps needed oil to ease the operation of the handle and also there was early wear of the rope however since there were availability of spare parts repairs could be undertaken relatively quickly and cheaply which was not perceived as a major constraint no particular preference between the two pump types was expressed by any of the respondents in terms of easy access to technical expertise the findings showed that since the rope pumps were manufactured locally technical expertise were readily available to deal with broken down pumps this made it possible for rope pumps to be repaired within the shortest possible time even though there exist some village based maintenance team not all the communities had these experts to deal with broken down standardized handpumps broken down pumps mostly took more than 48 h for repairs to begin this implies that with regards to availability of technical expertise the rope pump outperforms the standardized pump the findings confirm dayal et al 2000 who discovered that a sustained water supply is one which is regular and reliable and provides enough water of an acceptable standard for at least domestic use breakdowns are rare and repairs are rapid within 48 hours and local financing covers at least the regular costs of operation maintenance o m and repairs 6 8 microbiological water quality in determining the microbiological quality of the water from both pumps the study was initially planned to collect ten 10 water samples were collected from the five selected communities two 2 water samples each from a community one sample was taken from the rope pump and another from the standardized handpump however during the field survey six 6 water samples were collected this was because two communities namely piriga and nayoku had their rope pumps broken down hence water samples were taken from damweo nalgukania and saboro the collected samples were taken to the ghana urban water limited laboratory guwll in an ice pack and then analyzed using macconkey broth media to test for the total coliform level in the water the water was then incubated at a temperature of 37 5 c for 24 h the total coliforms for each sample recorded are illustrated in table 7 the findings showed that with the exception of damweo all the other test tube results for both rope pump and standardized handpumps remained positive across all the selected communities the positive coliform was an indication of the existing of unacceptable water quality for human consumption it implied either human or animal wastes were entering the water supplied by both pumping technologies utilized by the communities the positive results could be attributed to pollution around the water sources every effort should be made to achieve a drinking water quality as safe as possible it is important for the cwsa government and private sector to quickly identify all water contaminants and treat them before they do irreversible damage to the increasing population of the communities whose daily survival are dependent on water from both types of pumps from fig 4 the distribution of the total coliform values for the pumps see table 7 was tested for normality using the probability plot pp as illustrated by fig 4 the p value 0 414 for the data set was found to be greater than the alpha value of 0 05 at a confidence level of 95 which meant that all the set of data for both pumping devices did not follow a normal distribution consequently the distribution of the values for the pumps were tested for normality using the probability plot pp as illustrated by fig 4 from fig 4 the p value 0 414 of the test statistic was greater than the alpha value of 0 05 at 95 confidence limit this provided a sufficient indication that the set of data were not normally distributed hence the comparison between the two set of data was conducted using the independent sample t test the fourth null hypothesis ho4 assumed that there is no significant difference in microbiological i e total coliform water quality between the two pump types against an alternative hypothesis which stated that there exist significant differences in microbiological i e total coliform water quality between the two pump types the test was conducted using the mean of total coliform as an outcome measure for each pump type from table 8 the study found that the p values for the standardized handpumps and rope pumps were 0 374 and 0 478 respectively since the p values were greater than the alpha value of 0 05 at 95 confidence limit the fourth null hypothesis ho4 which assumed there is no significant difference in the total coliform between the rope pumps and standardized handpumps remained valid and was therefore accepted the study concluded there is no significant difference in total coliform between the pump types utilized by residents in the communities even though the use of the rope pump does not pose any negative impacts on the environment there is the potential for negative health impacts through secondary contamination from the rope the wear and tear from winding the wheel resulted in the rope particles breaking into the water water could also drain back into the wells resulting in contamination the finding affirm the assumption of poor operation and maintenance culture which is prevalent in the rural water sector morinville and harris 2014 the continuous use of rope and handpumps was an indication of pu and peou of both technologies in the rural communities davis 2000 dillon and morris 1996 however to improve the quality of water from both pumps there is the need to avoid environmental degradation through ecological policy measures for pollution control and human settlement planning in order to forestall possible future challenges in rural settings calow et al 2009 this is because contaminated water sources are found to be the cause for many water borne infections like diarrhoe kned 2012 who unicef 2017 7 conclusions the analysis shows that there are no significant differences in microbiological water quality between the two pumps types there are no significant differences in robustness between the two types of pumps the pumping heads of the two pump types were found to be different with relative flow rates of the two pumps the rope pumps outperformed the conventional handpumps in four out of five criteria used in determining the performance of the pumps the rope pump outperforming the standardized pump was not based on the coliform count but rather based on parameters of the sustainability and performance of the pumps in three out of four criteria used in determining sustainability i e flow rate availability of spare parts and technical expertise the rope pump outperformed the standardized handpumps in general the rope pump technology can be standardized and adapted as a pump for water supply in the five communities since there were no significant difference between the rope pump and standardized handpumps rope pump technology is feasible sustainable scalable and will meet user needs if adapted for use by the communities however the pu and peou of of handpump water technology in the rural communities are hindered by funding gaps technical capacities unavailability of spare parts and human resources the communities continual use of rope pumps highlights their intentions acceptance and actual behavior of users thus emphasizing the need to standardize and adopt both technologies in order to augment rural water supply measures for technology adaptation and pollution control will remarkably improve water quality from both rope and handpumps installed in the communities since rope pumps are not approved the cwsa and district level training packages for water and sanitation system operators do not include those who operate and maintain rope pumps if rope pump use is to be scaled up at the rural level the suitability of the technology for use on boreholes in addition to shallow wells needs to be better understood it should also be experimented with smaller number of users at the household level or in cluster of households 8 recommendations and policy implications there is the need to draw together all actors involved in rope pump technology introduction in order to address lapses in technology transfer including promotion to stimulate demand improve relationships between communities and the manufacturers secure relevant private sector investment and political will to invest in the rural water sector the attitudes of both regulators facilitators i e the water and sanitation team members the district municipal assemblies officials of the cwsa environmental health officers ehos and users will have to change if the technology is to be scaled up in the communities to improve water quality rope pump and handpump technologies should qualify for government subsidies and investment just as pipe born water technologies do again technical capacities must be built and financial sources for producers should be improved upon in order to promote and market rope pump technology to achieve this technical financial and user information on rope pump technology must be compiled and made easily accessible to stakeholders the flow rates of water from the rope pumps may be faster yet short lived therefore the study recommend future studies to compare the quantity of water and duration of flow per technology to see if the rope pump meets the per capita basic water requirement bwr of the communities declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following

11942,groundwater quality in the ganga gomti fluvial plain is influenced by geogenic and various anthropogenic factors like human interventions urbanization mineral dissolution and ion exchangeability this study provides in depth information about the groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking and irrigation use in lucknow district of uttar pradesh state india the results based on ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids total hardness ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl and f suggest that most of the groundwater is appropriate for drinking usage in contrast elevated no3 concentration was found in about 6 of the samples which is much higher than the no relaxation limit of 45 mg l 1 set by the bureau of indian standards based on the water quality index wqi the study reveals that 34 of the samples have good water quality for drinking usage while 55 of the samples are of the fair type and about 11 of the samples indicate poor quality water the gibbs plot suggests that rock weathering or rock water interaction processes are dominant in the investigated area controlling groundwater chemistry particularly silicate weathering mostly due to the forward ion exchange the piper plot indicates that ca2 hco3 is the major hydrochemical facies along with the dominant presence of na hco3 resulting in mixed ca2 na hco3 type water groundwater quality for irrigation purposes was evaluated using suitable indices and ratios such as sodium absorption ratio residual sodium carbonate sodium soluble percentage magnesium hazard ratio kelly s ratio percent sodium permeability index and potential salinity the overall values of these indices and ratios show that most of the groundwater is suitable for irrigation use except for the mhr which indicates that 87 of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation usage graphical abstract image 1 keywords lucknow india groundwater quality water quality index silicate weathering irrigation indices 1 introduction the undesirable quality of groundwater may hinder the economic growth and living conditions of people in a region currently this natural resource is in critical condition due to over exploration climate change and anthropogenic activity in many parts of the world especially in south asia batabyal and chakraborty 2015 zaveri et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 gupta and sharma 2019 patel et al 2020 ouhamdouch et al 2019 bib ouhamdouch et al 2019a bib ouhamdouch et al 2020b salehi et al 2018 reported that globally 65 of groundwater is consumed for drinking 15 in industries and mining and 20 in rural areas for irrigation and domestic livestock therefore groundwater has a primary contribution to meet domestic industrial and agricultural needs worldwide kulkarni et al 2015 selvakumar et al 2017a ritchie and roser 2017 physico chemical parameters are the basic functional characteristics of groundwater that are affected by anthropogenic activities climate change and hydro geological formations selvakumar et al 2017b umamageswari et al 2019 ouhamdouch et al 2020 furthermore natural conditions affecting the groundwater resources involve local hydro meteorological processes like evapotranspiration rock water interaction dissolution weathering geology hydrogeology vadose zone hydrology and precipitation lapworth et al 2017 mcdonough et al 2020 patel et al 2020 adimalla et al 2020 shukla and saxena 2020 srivastava and parimal 2020 anthropogenic activities like excess withdrawal from the aquifer irrigation recharge direct discharge of industrial wastewater into inland water sources crop cultivation using chemical fertilizers improper sanitation and drainage systems are also affecting the groundwater quality considerably kumar and james 2019 verma et al 2020a patil et al 2020 the risk of contamination of shallow water resources is quite high especially from fecal microbes nitrate and fluoride releasing materials which can also pollute the deep groundwater by its vertical flow lapworth et al 2017 sharma and mutiyar 2020 continuous use of this poor quality water in direct and indirect forms gives rise to different water borne diseases ali and ahmad 2019 cissé 2019 kumar et al 2020 there has been an increased alertness in people about water quality and therefore groundwater quality appraisal at a regular interval is necessary for maintaining its suitability at present india is one of the fastest growing economies and densely inhabited countries in the world which needs a good quality of water for drinking irrigation and industrial uses khare and varade 2018 however maintaining a sustainable environment and fulfilling an increasing demand of safe drinking water is a leading challenge in counties like india saha and ray 2019 gupta 2020 therefore many studies have been conducted on the assessment of groundwater quality in different parts of india for instance a study was conducted by srivastava and parimal 2020 in purna alluvial basin of maharashtra state in central india to evaluate the groundwater suitability using ionic linkages sources of rock weathering and irrigation indices ahmad et al 2020 studied the characteristics of groundwater using bivariate plots and principal component analysis in the trans yamuna alluvium of palwal district in the state of haryana a study by patil et al 2020 based on multivariate statistical and groundwater quality index wqi analysis reported that weathering dissolution extensive use of nitrogen fertilizers and leaching of industrial and domestic wastewater are the major factors of water quality degradation in kanavi halla sub basin of belagavi karnataka more recent and relevant studies on groundwater quality assessment are conducted by tirkey et al 2017 saha et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 quino lima et al 2020 and chakraborty et al 2020 furthermore lapworth et al 2017 reported that deep groundwater contamination is likely due to vertical leaching of mobile contaminants from shallow aquifer systems in the indo gangetic basin of bist doab region of punjab the present study area is located in the state of uttar pradesh india has potential for groundwater pollution mainly due to rapid urbanization and widespread use of chemical fertilizers several districts of the state including unnao saharanpur agra jhansi bhadohi aligarh varanasi ghaziabad allahabad raebareli gorakhpur and siddharthnagar are suffering from poor water quality problems ansari and umar 2019 khan and umar 2019 kumar et al 2019 yadav et al 2019 madhav et al 2018 ahmad and khurshid 2019 pandey

urbanization prospects projected an annual population growth rate of 2 2 from 2016 to 2030 in the urban agglomeration of lucknow district which will put tremendous pressure on the groundwater resources of this region rapid urbanization industrial discharge improper sanitation facilities in the rural areas inadequate drainage systems and excessive use of chemical fertilizers are the main causes of severe water quality degradation in the present study area also previous studies in this region were based on groundwater quality for domestic use only and irrigation aspects were mostly ignored for example the study by jangam et al 2015 was focused on the impact of on site sanitation on groundwater quality in urban parts of lucknow at five locations likewise raju and singh 2017 assessed the hydrogeochemical processes controlling groundwater quality in lucknow urban area more recently singh et al 2020 studied the impact on groundwater affected by sewage sludge and waste dumping in lucknow district all these studies covered mainly the urban parts of the present study area and most of the rural and peri urban areas of lucknow district were ignored especially with reference to groundwater quality for irrigation aspects thus a thorough groundwater quality appraisal is essential in this region as most urban and peri urban people depend on groundwater for their livelihood the main objective of this study is to explore the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater and assess its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes the water quality indicators used to achieve the above objectives are water quality index wqi sodium absorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium soluble percentage ssp magnesium hazard ratio mhr kelly s ratio kr percent sodium na permeability index pi and potential salinity ps in addition piper plot gibbs plot wilcox diagram ussl diagram and spatial distribution maps are also prepared and analyzed for better understanding of groundwater quality in the present study area 2 study area climate and hydrogeology lucknow district is a fluvial plain that extends over about 2528 km2 between 26 30 to 27 10 n and

used for collecting groundwater samples according to the standard procedure bis 2019 using pre cleaned sampling bottles of 1 litre capacity from hand pumps and tube wells in the pre monsoon period jan may 2017 prior to the sampling tube wells and hand pumps were purged by 5 10 min pumping and sampling bottles were rinsed using the same water thrice the groundwater samples were then brought to the laboratory and kept at 4 c until the analysis began before the chemical analysis of groundwater samples all the used glassware was cleaned using dilute nitric acid along with distilled water the samples were analyzed for physical ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th and chemical ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 hco3 no3 f parameters on site measurements included ph ec and tds using portable pc 301 and tds meters cb18 945 which were calibrated using distilled water th was measured using the black t indicator by edta titration procedure subsequently cellulose filters 0 45 μm were used for filtering the samples before analyzing by ion chromatography ic metrohm 792b ic accuracy 2 metrosep c2 100 column of ic was used to estimate cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 whereas metrosep a supp 4 250 was used to determine the anions of f cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 the spatial analysis module of arcgis version 10 4 1 was used for preparing the spatial distribution maps of individual parameters before developing wqi map of lucknow district using the inverse distance weighted idw technique the latitude and longitude of the sampling points determined with a hand held gps unit garmin 650 were used for developing the maps the depth of the wells was not measured however most hand pumps and tube wells from which groundwater samples were taken are not deeper than 150 m the depth of the first aquifer group 3 2 charge balance error fritz 1994 reported that percentage charge balance error cbe is reliable for verification of chemical analysis of groundwater as a means for evaluating analytical techniques thus cbe was calculated through eq 1 to check the accuracy of the chemical analysis which was found to be within the acceptable range of 5 as presented in supplementary table 1 1 cbe ta tc ta tc x 100 ta and tc represent total anion and total cation concentrations in meq l 1 respectively 3 3 water quality index the water quality index wqi plays a

verma et al 2020a 2020b bib verma et al 2020a bib verma et al 2020b in the present study the wqi of each sampling site was calculated using the standards recommended by bis 10500 2012 listed in table 1 because the cumulative effect of different hydrochemical parameters on groundwater quality varies four steps are involved in calculating wqi in the first step relative weight rwi of discrete parameters is calculated using eq 2 2 r w i w i i 1 n w i where wi represents the assigned weight and n represents the number of parameters used in the analysis in the second step relative rate rri of each parameter is computed using eq 3 3 r r i r i b i s i x 100 where ri is ionic concentration of individual parameter and bisi is the desirable limit recommended by bis 2012 the wqi for each site is calculated by adding the standard index sii values of the individual parameters using eq 4 and 5 respectively in third and fourth steps 4 s i i r w i x r r i 5 wqi s i i 3 4 irrigation water quality indices in an effort to examine the groundwater quality with respect to irrigation purposes the concentration of major chemical elements in water was evaluated before calculating the index based

in general the results of on site and laboratory analysis of physico chemical elements indicate significant variability as listed in table 2 statistics of physico chemical data have been analyzed using graphical box plot analysis as shown in fig 2 moreover the descriptive statistics mean minimum maximum and standard deviation and comparative analysis of physico chemical parameters with bureau of indian standards bis 2012 and world health organization who 2011 limits are mentioned in table 3 table 3 reveals that ph of groundwater samples ranged between 7 5 and 8 6 with an average value of 8 results indicate that only two samples lko 15 and lko 40 were found to have ph above the guideline range of bis 2012 the variation of ph in the area is mainly due to hco3 dissolution and leaching of hydroxide substances especially from sodium hydroxide sources pulp and paper textiles soaps and detergents drain cleaners kurt and bittner 2012 is the likely cause of elevated ph the interpolation map of the ph indicates that the groundwater of lucknow is slightly alkaline in nature and that some parts in both the north and south have higher ph values fig 3 a table 3 reveals that concentration of tds ranged between 274 and 805 3 mg l 1 with an average value of 474 5 mg l 1 in the region according to the guidelines of freeze and cherry 1979 tds concentration indicate the presence of fresh quality water in the study area table 4 moreover as per davis and de wiest 1966 classification 71 of the samples were found to be below the 500 mg l 1 range in addition 29 of groundwater samples were found to be in the permissible 500 1000 mg l 1 range for drinking table 4 ec values range from 409 to 1202 μs cm with an average of 708 2 μs cm the spatial variation maps of ec and tds concentration as shown in fig 3b and c indicate that samples in both the northwest and southeast have high tds and ec values concentrations of th ranged from 160 8 to 442 5 mg l 1 with an average value of 254 4 mg l 1 table 3 in the study area based on the sawyer and mccarty 1967 classification of th it was found that 82 and 18 of groundwater samples are hard and very hard in nature respectively table 4 the elevated concentration of th is due to high amount of ca2 and mg2 as th is sum of these two ions however the intake of hard drinking water particularly high levels of mg2 helps in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease rosenlund et al 2005 the spatial concentration map of th suggests that the southeastern and central part of the lucknow district has hard quality water fig 3d the amount of ca2 ranged between 19 and 84 4 mg l 1 with a mean value of 41 1 mg l 1 table 3 minimum and maximum limits of ca2 in drinking water are 75 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 respectively for indian conditions bis 2012 all of the groundwater samples are within the maximum guidelines of bis 2012 and who 2011 changes in land use patterns construction and infrastructure practices in the area leading to significant reduction in vegetation cover may be the main reason of low ca2 concentration in the groundwater the reduced vegetation cover causes less root respiration and oxidative decay of organic matter humus ch2o thus limiting the production of co2 which forms carbonic acid h2co3 by reacting with rainfall and or irrigated water this carbonic acid further facilitates the dissolution of carbonate minerals as caco3 to release the ca2 in a shallow unconfined aquifer madhav et al 2018 table 3 shows that the concentration of mg2 ranged between 22 and 65 mg l 1 with a mean value of 36 9 mg l 1 in the study area the spatial distributions of ca2 and mg2 concentrations are shown in fig 3e and f the southern and some of the central part of the study area have elevated concentrations of ca2 likewise fig 3f shows that the central and southeastern regions of the study area have high concentrations of mg2 in groundwater which is probably due to dissolution of dolomite camg co3 2 in the presence of carbonic acid h2co3 the na concentration varied from 19 mg l 1 to 180 mg l 1 with a mean of 50 3 mg l 1 the who recommended limit of na concentration is 200 mg l 1 in groundwater who 2011 however marginally high concentrations of na were found in some samples such as lko 2 145 mg l 1 lko 4 102 mg l 1 lko 13 103 mg l 1 lko 32 180 mg l 1 lko 33 149 mg l 1 and lko 44 135 mg l 1 shown in table 2 the concentration of k was found between 2 4 and 49 mg l 1 with a mean value of 4 9 mg l 1 the maximum concentration of k is measured in sample lko 24 as presented in table 2 the spatial distributions of na and k in water are presented in fig 3g and h respectively fig 3g shows that the northern part has variably high amount of na in water whereas central and southeastern regions of the area have high ca2 and mg2 concentrations with low na this might be because of cation exchange of na with ca2 along the flow direction of groundwater fig 3h reveals that most of the study area has relatively low concentrations of k except the north central part no3 levels in natural groundwater are typically 10 mg l 1 while in polluted water no3 can go up to 100 mg l 1 or even more sakram et al 2019 there is a possibility of high levels of no3 at some places in the groundwater of lucknow district due to anthropogenic activity such as excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers industrial and domestic effluent the concentration of no3 in sampled wells ranged from 0 2 mg l 1 to 108 mg l 1 with a mean value of 7 8 mg l 1 table 3 three of the samples lko 8 lko 11 and lko 12 had no3 concentrations much higher than the no relaxation limit of 45 mg l 1 bis 2012 these samples pose high to very risk for domestic use table 5 the map of no3 fig 3i indicates that groundwater in the east central part of the study area has the highest concentrations as it is a densely populated area as shown in supplementary figure 2 on land surface discharge of wastewater without treatment and inadequate means of drainage can plausibly explain high nitrate level observed in the groundwater samples lapworth et al 2017 sakram et al 2019 hco3 is the dominant anion in the study area ranging from 240 to 672 mg l 1 with a mean value of 382 8 mg l 1 table 3 the map suggests that hco3 is relatively uniformly disseminated in groundwater of lucknow district except in the northern part fig 3j cl is the second most abundant anion found in the study area the data in table 3 indicate that the concentration of cl varied from 7 mg l 1 to 92 mg l 1 with a mean value of 31 9 mg l 1 furthermore the map of cl shows that east southeast parts have elevated cl concentrations fig 3k the increased concentration of cl may be due to infiltration from inadequate sewerage facilities and weathering of soils verma et al 2020a the concentration of so4 2 ranged between 1 1 and 88 mg l 1 with an average of 15 8 mg l 1 table 3 all groundwater samples in the study area have been found to be within the permissible limits bis 2012 who 2011 concentrations of so4 are relatively low except in the southeastern part of the study area fig 3l concentration of f in groundwater tends to be higher in arid and semi arid regions adimalla et al 2020 but is well within the bis 2012 limit in the study area with values from 0 1 mg l 1 to 0 9 mg l 1 about 39 of samples have f concentration 0 5 mg l 1 which does not protect against dental caries table 5 the concentration of fluoride in groundwater mainly varies due to rock water interaction and residence time of water beneath the ground sakram et al 2019 yadav et al 2019 the map of fluoride concentration shows its non uniform distribution in the study area fig 3m 4 2 groundwater evolution geochemical control and hydrochemical facies the gibbs 1970 plot is a widely used graphical technique to understand the factors controlling the major ion concentrations and mechanisms governing groundwater chemistry this diagram is categorized into three distinct regions evaporation precipitation and rock dominance zones firstly gibbs ratio i for cations and ii for anions are computed using eqs 14 and 15 respectively and then computed values are plotted against tds in mg l 1 values as shown in fig 4 a and b the diagram reveals that groundwater chemistry is controlled by rock weathering or rock water interaction processes 14 gibbs ratio i na k na k ca 2 15 gibbs ratio ii cl cl hco 3 furthermore the hydrogeochemical characteristics of an aquifer system are controlled by various chemical reactions that are usually responsible for the change in ion concentration in the forward ion exchange process ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater are substituted by na on mineral clay surfaces whereas in reverse ion exchange process ca2 and mg2 ions in clay minerals are substituted by na in the groundwater barzegar et al 2019 the occurrence of potential sources of ions was studied using various bivariate plots and ionic ratios the plot of na versus cl fig 5 a indicates that forward ion exchange is accountable for releasing na ions in groundwater of lucknow district barzegar et al 2019 and mgbenu and egbueri 2019 reported that na cl ratio 1 usually indicates that na ions in groundwater result from silicate weathering fig 5b confirms the occurrence of silicate weathering and indicates that only five samples are below the 1 1 equiline the bivariate plot of ca2 versus hco3 suggests that the carbonic acid weathering process is more accountable for release of ca2 ions than carbonate mineral dissolution in groundwater of lucknow district fig 5c fig 5d also indicates that silicate weathering is the dominant process in controlling the ion chemistry and hydrogeochemical development of the study area fig 6 a also suggests that the presence of na ions in groundwater is derived from forward ion exchange in addition fig 6b suggests that ca2 and mg2 ions in groundwater are derivative of silicate weathering instead of carbonate mineral dissolution in an effort to infer additional results chloro alkaline indices cai i cai ii were calculated using eqs 16 and 17 many researchers have used this method to determine ion exchange in aquifers mgbenu and egbueri 2019 adimalla et al 2020 schoeller 1977 proposed chloro alkaline indices to assess the ion exchange process between groundwater and its host rock during residence and travel in the vadose zone he reported that negative values of cai i and cai ii indicate forward ion exchange whereas positive values indicate reverse ion exchange the results of supplementary table 2 and fig 7 a and fig 7b reveal that there is a prevalence of forward ion exchange in releasing na k in groundwater of the lucknow region 16 cai i c l n a k c l 17 cai ii c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 n o 3 the piper 1944 trilinear plot is a well established approach to identify the hydrochemical facies of groundwater of any terrain fig 8 shows that ca2 hco3 is the dominant hydrochemical facies with a few samples showing na hco3 and mixed ca2 na hco3 water types reflecting that groundwater chemistry is primarily controlled through silicate weathering alkaline earths ca2 mg2 exceed alkalies na k and weak acid hco3 exceeds strong acids cl so4 2 4 3 correlation analysis correlation analysis based on the spearman rank coefficient correlation matrix is a well defined and prevalent technique for explaining the association between physico chemical parameters selvakumar et al 2017a umamageswari et al 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 barzegar et al 2019 verma et al 2020a 2020b bib verma et al 2020a bib verma et al 2020b values range from 1 negative association to 1 positive association with the magnitude of the association defined by assigning expressions such as significant strong 0 75 moderate 0 75 0 50 and insignificant poor 0 50 0 30 table 6 shows significant association between tds and ec 1 1 as expected and between tds and major ions ca2 na k hco3 so4 2 and cl na shows moderate positive relationship r 0 70 with hco3 which ratifies the existence of na hco3 water type in certain parts of the lucknow district a moderate correlation between mg2 and hco3 r 0 41 indicated that these ions might be produced from the same source that is dissolution of carbonate minerals barzegar et al 2019 magnesium is poorly associated with sulfate r 0 39 and chloride 0 35 th indicated a strong positive association r 0 8 with calcium and magnesium as expected and a moderate correlation with sulfate r 0 50 4 4 water quality index the wqi provides significant information about the cumulative influence of each water quality parameter of a particular point site adimalla et al 2020 patil et al 2020 the overall quality of groundwater based on the wqi category is presented in table 7 and the individual wqi value n 56 of each groundwater sample is shown in table 8 the results indicate that samples are neither of excellent type nor are of an unsuitable type in lucknow district table 7 shows 34 of the samples have good water quality for drinking usage while 55 of the samples are of only fair type and about 11 of the samples indicate poor quality water fig 9 shows the wqi map of lucknow district suggesting that the east central part has poor quality water the elevated concentrations of tds th and no3 are primarily responsible for poor groundwater quality in the east central part for drinking water purposes water quality is good in a 402 97 km2 area reasonable in a 2027 04 km2 area and poor in a 96 03 km2 area in general high concentration of tds is responsible for the deterioration of water quality in most areas 4 5 irrigation water quality groundwater is a primary source for irrigation in rural parts of the present study region irrigation water quality and proper irrigation management are both vital for effective crop production poor quality of irrigation water adversely affects both yield and physical properties of the soil therefore evaluation of irrigation water quality is conducted using various irrigation indices and ratios such as sar rsc ssp mhr kr na pi and ps and the computed values are shown in table 9 the maps of irrigation groundwater quality based on various indices have been shown in fig 10 a f typically the quality of groundwater in terms of elemental concentrations may change significantly over time or over a certain period of time especially in dry climates adimalla et al 2020 the excess amount of salts in water modulates osmotic pressure in the root zone which limits plant or crop growth by changing its metabolic activity hanson et al 2006 the present study area has a high concentration of sodium in the water which forms the alkaline soil while high salt amount in water leads to the formation of saline soil todd and mays 1980 sar ranged between 0 5 and 5 with an average value of 1 5 table 9 ec salinity hazard c values are plotted against the sar sodium hazard s values delineated on the united states salinity laboratory s ussl diagram richards 1954 the ussl diagram has 16 different classes to depict the suitability of water for irrigation fig 11 indicates that 73 of groundwater samples fall into the c2 s1 class suggesting medium salinity hazard and low sodium hazard however 27 of the samples fall under the c3 s1 class indicating high salinity hazard and low sodium hazard which requires proper prevention of salinity control hanson et al 2006 and läuchli and grattan 2013 reported that continuous use of this type of groundwater alters the plant growth in different ways such as osmotic effects specific ion toxicity and nutritional disorders in many arid and semi arid regions the cause of excessive accumulation of salts is mainly the indiscriminate use of groundwater for irrigation which promotes sodification and salinization of soil and eventually affects crop development prasad et al 2001 läuchli and grattan 2013 the effect of sodicity on crop development is unlikely to differ from salinity porcelli et al 1995 moreover sodicity negatively influences the physical and hydrological properties of soil prasad et al 2001 thus the rsc has been calculated as an index to ascertain the suitability of groundwater for irrigation eaton 1950 table 9 shows that rsc values ranged between 1 4 and 6 2 with an average of 1 2 in the study area as per eaton 1950 classification of irrigation water based on rsc reveals that 68 of the samples are in the good category for irrigation while 20 and 12 of samples are in the doubtful and unsuitable categories respectively table 10 ssp is another noteworthy irrigation index for studying sodium hazard groundwater with ssp value 50 might have sodium accumulation that can damage the physical properties of the soil kadyampakeni et al 2018 in the present study area ssp values ranged from 11 8 to 64 6 with a mean value of 28 7 table 9 according to the wilcox 1955 classification of groundwater based on ssp values for irrigation suitability 25 of the samples in the present study area are of excellent type while 59 and 16 of the samples are of good and marginal type respectively as shown in table 10 high concentrations of calcium and magnesium in groundwater adversely affect soil quality adimalla et al 2020 however magnesium has a more severe effect on crop yields than calcium szabolcs and darab 1964 furthermore an mhr value of more than 50 indicates soil alkalinity which affects crop yield and therefore this type of groundwater is considered unsuitable for irrigation purposes shukla and saxena 2020 table 9 indicates that mhr values ranged between 43 4 and 76 2 with an average of 60 1 in the study area in addition table 10 reveals that only 13 of the samples are below the 50 percent threshold of suitability for irrigation and the remaining 87 of the samples are not suitable for irrigation kr values ranged from 0 1 to 1 8 with an average of 0 5 table 9 the kr analysis as listed in table 10 indicates that 91 and 9 of groundwater samples fall in suitable and marginally fit categories of irrigation water respectively in general groundwater fitness for irrigation purposes also depends on the chemical components released from the host aquifer or other sources moreover the exchange process of na ions in water for ca2 and mg2 in soil decreases the porosity and ultimately changes the soil structure resulting in poor internal drainage conditions wilcox 1955 srivastava and parimal 2020 the computed results of na table 9 range from 12 8 to 64 9 with a mean value of 30 in the study area wilcox 1955 proposed a diagram of ec versus na for a better understanding of the suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation which is presented in fig 12 this diagram is divided into five different classes that denote excellent good good permissible permissible doubtful doubtful unsuitable and unsuitable categories fig 12 indicates that 70 of the samples are of excellent to good type and 23 of the samples are of good to permissible type while 7 of the samples are of permissible to doubtful type furthermore table 10 based on na states that 20 of the samples are excellent while 64 of the samples are good for irrigation in contrast 9 and 7 of the samples were found to be permissible 40 60 and doubtful 60 80 respectively for irrigation however todd and mays 1980 suggested a boundary of 60 as the maximum permissible limit of na in groundwater doneen 1964 utilized pi as another way to determine the quality of water for irrigation the categorization of irrigation water based on pi values is shown in table 10 while maximum 100 soil permeability is beneficial for plant growth a less permeable soil may not allow plant growth to occur properly it depends on exchange process of ionic constituents present in water and soil srivastava and parimal 2020 the sum of all ionic constituent concentrations tc meq l 1 was plotted against the pi values in relation to assess the quality of groundwater for irrigation fig 13 depicts three different classes based on the pi vs tc plot in which class i represents 100 permeability suitable class ii represents 75 permeability with marginal suitability and class iii represents 25 permeability unsuitable results indicate that 64 of groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation while 36 of samples are marginally suitable for irrigation doneen 1964 proposed ps as another water quality index with values less than 3 considered suitable for irrigation the results in table 9 show that ps values in the study area ranged from 0 2 to 2 8 with an average of 1 1 all groundwater samples based on ps analysis are suitable for irrigation as listed in table 10 5 conclusions groundwater is a major source for drinking and irrigation use in lucknow district india based on chemical analysis the concentrations of physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples were compared to bis 2012 and who 2011 limits the general hydrochemical analysis suggests that overall water quality is suitable for drinking purposes except at some locations where elevated nitrate concentration is found in addition the hydrochemical evaluation of groundwater in lucknow district revealed that the concentrations of major ions are controlled by rock water interaction in which silicate weathering is the predominant process furthermore groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline and hard to very hard in nature the piper plot revealed that ca2 hco3 is the dominant hydrochemical facies with a few samples having na hco3 and mixed ca2 na hco3 water types the spatial distribution of each parameter was mapped which may prove helpful in planning new groundwater schemes based on the wqi the study revealed that 34 of the samples had good quality water for drinking use while 55 of the samples were of a fair type and about 11 of the samples indicated poor quality water the wqi doesn t explicitly account for possible microbial contamination of drinking water although no3 results are suggestive of untreated wastewater discharge in the region the suitability of groundwater for irrigation was evaluated based on various indexes ratios of chemical constituents and graphical analysis sar index indicated that all the samples were excellent for irrigation while based on rsc categorization about 68 of samples were of good type and about 20 and 12 were found to be doubtful and unsuitable respectively ssp values indicated that 25 of samples were excellent type and 59 and 16 were found to be good and marginal for irrigation purposes respectively as far as mhr is concerned 87 of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation while based on kr pi and ps 91 100 and about 100 of samples were suitable for irrigation respectively based on na analysis about 20 of samples were found excellent for irrigation while 64 9 and 7 were good permissible and doubtful type respectively this study would help raise awareness amongst the inhabitants policymakers and authorities to understand the hydrogeological processes in the lucknow district reverse osmosis units could be installed nearby the groundwater outlets used for drinking purpose sewers are needed for inhibiting the no3 leaching to the groundwater resources in most of the urban areas domestic and industrial wastewater should be treated before discharging into water bodies and on the land surface according to the standards set by the central pollution control board the results obtained from the assessment of groundwater quality for irrigation require salinity control in some places which can be achieved by mixing the groundwater with lower salinity water before irrigation additionally the surface water bodies ponds lakes canals that have dried up or disappeared due to encroachment dumping of waste and entry of untreated sewage should be used for the storage of rainwater which will help in groundwater recharge and in its quality improvement in addition flood irrigation practices in the area should be replaced by drip and or sprinkler irrigation which reduces salt deposition in the soil and increases crop yield promoting organic farming can also help in reduction of no3 contamination in groundwater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

11942,groundwater quality in the ganga gomti fluvial plain is influenced by geogenic and various anthropogenic factors like human interventions urbanization mineral dissolution and ion exchangeability this study provides in depth information about the groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking and irrigation use in lucknow district of uttar pradesh state india the results based on ph electrical conductivity total dissolved solids total hardness ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 cl and f suggest that most of the groundwater is appropriate for drinking usage in contrast elevated no3 concentration was found in about 6 of the samples which is much higher than the no relaxation limit of 45 mg l 1 set by the bureau of indian standards based on the water quality index wqi the study reveals that 34 of the samples have good water quality for drinking usage while 55 of the samples are of the fair type and about 11 of the samples indicate poor quality water the gibbs plot suggests that rock weathering or rock water interaction processes are dominant in the investigated area controlling groundwater chemistry particularly silicate weathering mostly due to the forward ion exchange the piper plot indicates that ca2 hco3 is the major hydrochemical facies along with the dominant presence of na hco3 resulting in mixed ca2 na hco3 type water groundwater quality for irrigation purposes was evaluated using suitable indices and ratios such as sodium absorption ratio residual sodium carbonate sodium soluble percentage magnesium hazard ratio kelly s ratio percent sodium permeability index and potential salinity the overall values of these indices and ratios show that most of the groundwater is suitable for irrigation use except for the mhr which indicates that 87 of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation usage graphical abstract image 1 keywords lucknow india groundwater quality water quality index silicate weathering irrigation indices 1 introduction the undesirable quality of groundwater may hinder the economic growth and living conditions of people in a region currently this natural resource is in critical condition due to over exploration climate change and anthropogenic activity in many parts of the world especially in south asia batabyal and chakraborty 2015 zaveri et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 gupta and sharma 2019 patel et al 2020 ouhamdouch et al 2019 bib ouhamdouch et al 2019a bib ouhamdouch et al 2020b salehi et al 2018 reported that globally 65 of groundwater is consumed for drinking 15 in industries and mining and 20 in rural areas for irrigation and domestic livestock therefore groundwater has a primary contribution to meet domestic industrial and agricultural needs worldwide kulkarni et al 2015 selvakumar et al 2017a ritchie and roser 2017 physico chemical parameters are the basic functional characteristics of groundwater that are affected by anthropogenic activities climate change and hydro geological formations selvakumar et al 2017b umamageswari et al 2019 ouhamdouch et al 2020 furthermore natural conditions affecting the groundwater resources involve local hydro meteorological processes like evapotranspiration rock water interaction dissolution weathering geology hydrogeology vadose zone hydrology and precipitation lapworth et al 2017 mcdonough et al 2020 patel et al 2020 adimalla et al 2020 shukla and saxena 2020 srivastava and parimal 2020 anthropogenic activities like excess withdrawal from the aquifer irrigation recharge direct discharge of industrial wastewater into inland water sources crop cultivation using chemical fertilizers improper sanitation and drainage systems are also affecting the groundwater quality considerably kumar and james 2019 verma et al 2020a patil et al 2020 the risk of contamination of shallow water resources is quite high especially from fecal microbes nitrate and fluoride releasing materials which can also pollute the deep groundwater by its vertical flow lapworth et al 2017 sharma and mutiyar 2020 continuous use of this poor quality water in direct and indirect forms gives rise to different water borne diseases ali and ahmad 2019 cissé 2019 kumar et al 2020 there has been an increased alertness in people about water quality and therefore groundwater quality appraisal at a regular interval is necessary for maintaining its suitability at present india is one of the fastest growing economies and densely inhabited countries in the world which needs a good quality of water for drinking irrigation and industrial uses khare and varade 2018 however maintaining a sustainable environment and fulfilling an increasing demand of safe drinking water is a leading challenge in counties like india saha and ray 2019 gupta 2020 therefore many studies have been conducted on the assessment of groundwater quality in different parts of india for instance a study was conducted by srivastava and parimal 2020 in purna alluvial basin of maharashtra state in central india to evaluate the groundwater suitability using ionic linkages sources of rock weathering and irrigation indices ahmad et al 2020 studied the characteristics of groundwater using bivariate plots and principal component analysis in the trans yamuna alluvium of palwal district in the state of haryana a study by patil et al 2020 based on multivariate statistical and groundwater quality index wqi analysis reported that weathering dissolution extensive use of nitrogen fertilizers and leaching of industrial and domestic wastewater are the major factors of water quality degradation in kanavi halla sub basin of belagavi karnataka more recent and relevant studies on groundwater quality assessment are conducted by tirkey et al 2017 saha et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 quino lima et al 2020 and chakraborty et al 2020 furthermore lapworth et al 2017 reported that deep groundwater contamination is likely due to vertical leaching of mobile contaminants from shallow aquifer systems in the indo gangetic basin of bist doab region of punjab the present study area is located in the state of uttar pradesh india has potential for groundwater pollution mainly due to rapid urbanization and widespread use of chemical fertilizers several districts of the state including unnao saharanpur agra jhansi bhadohi aligarh varanasi ghaziabad allahabad raebareli gorakhpur and siddharthnagar are suffering from poor water quality problems ansari and umar 2019 khan and umar 2019 kumar et al 2019 yadav et al 2019 madhav et al 2018 ahmad and khurshid 2019 pandey

urbanization prospects projected an annual population growth rate of 2 2 from 2016 to 2030 in the urban agglomeration of lucknow district which will put tremendous pressure on the groundwater resources of this region rapid urbanization industrial discharge improper sanitation facilities in the rural areas inadequate drainage systems and excessive use of chemical fertilizers are the main causes of severe water quality degradation in the present study area also previous studies in this region were based on groundwater quality for domestic use only and irrigation aspects were mostly ignored for example the study by jangam et al 2015 was focused on the impact of on site sanitation on groundwater quality in urban parts of lucknow at five locations likewise raju and singh 2017 assessed the hydrogeochemical processes controlling groundwater quality in lucknow urban area more recently singh et al 2020 studied the impact on groundwater affected by sewage sludge and waste dumping in lucknow district all these studies covered mainly the urban parts of the present study area and most of the rural and peri urban areas of lucknow district were ignored especially with reference to groundwater quality for irrigation aspects thus a thorough groundwater quality appraisal is essential in this region as most urban and peri urban people depend on groundwater for their livelihood the main objective of this study is to explore the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater and assess its suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes the water quality indicators used to achieve the above objectives are water quality index wqi sodium absorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc sodium soluble percentage ssp magnesium hazard ratio mhr kelly s ratio kr percent sodium na permeability index pi and potential salinity ps in addition piper plot gibbs plot wilcox diagram ussl diagram and spatial distribution maps are also prepared and analyzed for better understanding of groundwater quality in the present study area 2 study area climate and hydrogeology lucknow district is a fluvial plain that extends over about 2528 km2 between 26 30 to 27 10 n and 80 30 to 81 13 e fig 1 it is one of the highly populated districts in central india having a population of around 4 589 838 census of india 2011 the elevation of the district is about 103 130 m above mean sea level with a gentle slope towards the southeast cgwb 2009 the climate of the region is defined as humid subtropical cwa as per the köppen geiger climate taxonomy beck et al 2018 the study area experiences three distinct seasons 1 dry hot summers march may 2 monsoons june september and 3 winters november february the maximum temperature in summer is 45 c while in winter it falls to 5 c

the area is a part of the indo gangetic quaternary alluvium which is broadly divided into older and younger alluvial plains cgwb 2009 the younger alluvium is made of active flood plains of the gomti river lowlands that is composed of clay and fine sandy silt of holocene age older alluvium found in the highlands of study area consists of grey to brown silty clay with occasional calcareous nodules of pleistocene age the central ground water board cgwb 2009 drilled a number of observation wells with depths between 100 and 753 m penetrating 5 aquifer groups each separated by a 5 10 m thick clay layer supplementary figure 1 the first aquifer group having depth of 0 150 m below ground level bgl consists of medium to fine grained sand and clay the second aquifer group situated between 160 and 240 m bgl is composed of silty material whereas the third aquifer made of very fine granular sand and clay lies between 260 and 370 m bgl the fourth aquifer group 380 480 m bgl is composed of sand silt hard and compacted sandstone chips while the fifth group 483 680 m bgl comprised of silty and very fine sand for this study groundwater samples were taken from the first aquifer group in which both unconfined and semi confined to confined type of aquifers are prevalent the pre monsoon depth of the water level varies from 5 20 to 32 70 m bgl while in post monsoon it changes from 1 61 to 28 40 m bgl the direction of groundwater flow in this study area is from northwest to southeast cgwb 2009 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis a total of 56 sampling points were used for collecting groundwater samples according to the standard procedure bis 2019 using pre cleaned sampling bottles of 1 litre capacity from hand pumps and tube wells in the pre monsoon period jan may 2017 prior to the sampling tube wells and hand pumps were purged by 5 10 min pumping and sampling bottles were rinsed using the same water thrice the groundwater samples were then brought to the laboratory and kept at 4 c until the analysis began before the chemical analysis of groundwater samples all the used glassware was cleaned using dilute nitric acid along with distilled water the samples were analyzed for physical ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total hardness th and chemical ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 hco3 no3 f parameters on site measurements included ph ec and tds using portable pc 301 and tds meters cb18 945 which were calibrated using distilled water th was measured using the black t indicator by edta titration procedure subsequently cellulose filters 0 45 μm were used for filtering the samples before analyzing by ion chromatography ic metrohm 792b ic accuracy 2 metrosep c2 100 column of ic was used to estimate cations such as na k ca2 and mg2 whereas metrosep a supp 4 250 was used to determine the anions of f cl so4 2 no3 and hco3 the spatial analysis module of arcgis version 10 4 1 was used for preparing the spatial distribution maps of individual parameters before developing wqi map of lucknow district using the inverse distance weighted idw technique the latitude and longitude of the sampling points determined with a hand held gps unit garmin 650 were used for developing the maps the depth of the wells was not measured however most hand pumps and tube wells from which groundwater samples were taken are not deeper than 150 m the depth of the first aquifer group 3 2 charge balance error fritz 1994 reported that percentage charge balance error cbe is reliable for verification of chemical analysis of groundwater as a means for evaluating analytical techniques thus cbe was calculated through eq 1 to check the accuracy of the chemical analysis which was found to be within the acceptable range of 5 as presented in supplementary table 1 1 cbe ta tc ta tc x 100 ta and tc represent total anion and total cation concentrations in meq l 1 respectively 3 3 water quality index the water quality index wqi plays a

verma et al 2020a 2020b bib verma et al 2020a bib verma et al 2020b in the present study the wqi of each sampling site was calculated using the standards recommended by bis 10500 2012 listed in table 1 because the cumulative effect of different hydrochemical parameters on groundwater quality varies four steps are involved in calculating wqi in the first step relative weight rwi of discrete parameters is calculated using eq 2 2 r w i w i i 1 n w i where wi represents the assigned weight and n represents the number of parameters used in the analysis in the second step relative rate rri of each parameter is computed using eq 3 3 r r i r i b i s i x 100 where ri is ionic concentration of individual parameter and bisi is the desirable limit recommended by bis 2012 the wqi for each site is calculated by adding the standard index sii values of the individual parameters using eq 4 and 5 respectively in third and fourth steps 4 s i i r w i x r r i 5 wqi s i i 3 4 irrigation water quality indices in an effort to examine the groundwater quality with respect to irrigation purposes the concentration of major chemical elements in water was evaluated before calculating the index based

in general the results of on site and laboratory analysis of physico chemical elements indicate significant variability as listed in table 2 statistics of physico chemical data have been analyzed using graphical box plot analysis as shown in fig 2 moreover the descriptive statistics mean minimum maximum and standard deviation and comparative analysis of physico chemical parameters with bureau of indian standards bis 2012 and world health organization who 2011 limits are mentioned in table 3 table 3 reveals that ph of groundwater samples ranged between 7 5 and 8 6 with an average value of 8 results indicate that only two samples lko 15 and lko 40 were found to have ph above the guideline range of bis 2012 the variation of ph in the area is mainly due to hco3 dissolution and leaching of hydroxide substances especially from sodium hydroxide sources pulp and paper textiles soaps and detergents drain cleaners kurt and bittner 2012 is the likely cause of elevated ph the interpolation map of the ph indicates that the groundwater of lucknow is slightly alkaline in nature and that some parts in both the north and south have higher ph values fig 3 a table 3 reveals that concentration of tds ranged between 274 and 805 3 mg l 1 with an average value of 474 5 mg l 1 in the region according to the guidelines of freeze and cherry 1979 tds concentration indicate the presence of fresh quality water in the study area table 4 moreover as per davis and de wiest 1966 classification 71 of the samples were found to be below the 500 mg l 1 range in addition 29 of groundwater samples were found to be in the permissible 500 1000 mg l 1 range for drinking table 4 ec values range from 409 to 1202 μs cm with an average of 708 2 μs cm the spatial variation maps of ec and tds concentration as shown in fig 3b and c indicate that samples in both the northwest and southeast have high tds and ec values concentrations of th ranged from 160 8 to 442 5 mg l 1 with an average value of 254 4 mg l 1 table 3 in the study area based on the sawyer and mccarty 1967 classification of th it was found that 82 and 18 of groundwater samples are hard and very hard in nature respectively table 4 the elevated concentration of th is due to high amount of ca2 and mg2 as th is sum of these two ions however the intake of hard drinking water particularly high levels of mg2 helps in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease rosenlund et al 2005 the spatial concentration map of th suggests that the southeastern and central part of the lucknow district has hard quality water fig 3d the amount of ca2 ranged between 19 and 84 4 mg l 1 with a mean value of 41 1 mg l 1 table 3 minimum and maximum limits of ca2 in drinking water are 75 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 respectively for indian conditions bis 2012 all of the groundwater samples are within the maximum guidelines of bis 2012 and who 2011 changes in land use patterns construction and infrastructure practices in the area leading to significant reduction in vegetation cover may be the main reason of low ca2 concentration in the groundwater the reduced vegetation cover causes less root respiration and oxidative decay of organic matter humus ch2o thus limiting the production of co2 which forms carbonic acid h2co3 by reacting with rainfall and or irrigated water this carbonic acid further facilitates the dissolution of carbonate minerals as caco3 to release the ca2 in a shallow unconfined aquifer madhav et al 2018 table 3 shows that the concentration of mg2 ranged between 22 and 65 mg l 1 with a mean value of 36 9 mg l 1 in the study area the spatial distributions of ca2 and mg2 concentrations are shown in fig 3e and f the southern and some of the central part of the study area have elevated concentrations of ca2 likewise fig 3f shows that the central and southeastern regions of the study area have high concentrations of mg2 in groundwater which is probably due to dissolution of dolomite camg co3 2 in the presence of carbonic acid h2co3 the na concentration varied from 19 mg l 1 to 180 mg l 1 with a mean of 50 3 mg l 1 the who recommended limit of na concentration is 200 mg l 1 in groundwater who 2011 however marginally high concentrations of na were found in some samples such as lko 2 145 mg l 1 lko 4 102 mg l 1 lko 13 103 mg l 1 lko 32 180 mg l 1 lko 33 149 mg l 1 and lko 44 135 mg l 1 shown in table 2 the concentration of k was found between 2 4 and 49 mg l 1 with a mean value of 4 9 mg l 1 the maximum concentration of k is measured in sample lko 24 as presented in table 2 the spatial distributions of na and k in water are presented in fig 3g and h respectively fig 3g shows that the northern part has variably high amount of na in water whereas central and southeastern regions of the area have high ca2 and mg2 concentrations with low na this might be because of cation exchange of na with ca2 along the flow direction of groundwater fig 3h reveals that most of the study area has relatively low concentrations of k except the north central part no3 levels in natural groundwater are typically 10 mg l 1 while in polluted water no3 can go up to 100 mg l 1 or even more sakram et al 2019 there is a possibility of high levels of no3 at some places in the groundwater of lucknow district due to anthropogenic activity such as excessive use of nitrogenous fertilizers industrial and domestic effluent the concentration of no3 in sampled wells ranged from 0 2 mg l 1 to 108 mg l 1 with a mean value of 7 8 mg l 1 table 3 three of the samples lko 8 lko 11 and lko 12 had no3 concentrations much higher than the no relaxation limit of 45 mg l 1 bis 2012 these samples pose high to very risk for domestic use table 5 the map of no3 fig 3i indicates that groundwater in the east central part of the study area has the highest concentrations as it is a densely populated area as shown in supplementary figure 2 on land surface discharge of wastewater without treatment and inadequate means of drainage can plausibly explain high nitrate level observed in the groundwater samples lapworth et al 2017 sakram et al 2019 hco3 is the dominant anion in the study area ranging from 240 to 672 mg l 1 with a mean value of 382 8 mg l 1 table 3 the map suggests that hco3 is relatively uniformly disseminated in groundwater of lucknow district except in the northern part fig 3j cl is the second most abundant anion found in the study area the data in table 3 indicate that the concentration of cl varied from 7 mg l 1 to 92 mg l 1 with a mean value of 31 9 mg l 1 furthermore the map of cl shows that east southeast parts have elevated cl concentrations fig 3k the increased concentration of cl may be due to infiltration from inadequate sewerage facilities and weathering of soils verma et al 2020a the concentration of so4 2 ranged between 1 1 and 88 mg l 1 with an average of 15 8 mg l 1 table 3 all groundwater samples in the study area have been found to be within the permissible limits bis 2012 who 2011 concentrations of so4 are relatively low except in the southeastern part of the study area fig 3l concentration of f in groundwater tends to be higher in arid and semi arid regions adimalla et al 2020 but is well within the bis 2012 limit in the study area with values from 0 1 mg l 1 to 0 9 mg l 1 about 39 of samples have f concentration 0 5 mg l 1 which does not protect against dental caries table 5 the concentration of fluoride in groundwater mainly varies due to rock water interaction and residence time of water beneath the ground sakram et al 2019 yadav et al 2019 the map of fluoride concentration shows its non uniform distribution in the study area fig 3m 4 2 groundwater evolution geochemical control and hydrochemical facies the gibbs 1970 plot is a widely used graphical technique to understand the factors controlling the major ion concentrations and mechanisms governing groundwater chemistry this diagram is categorized into three distinct regions evaporation precipitation and rock dominance zones firstly gibbs ratio i for cations and ii for anions are computed using eqs 14 and 15 respectively and then computed values are plotted against tds in mg l 1 values as shown in fig 4 a and b the diagram reveals that groundwater chemistry is controlled by rock weathering or rock water interaction processes 14 gibbs ratio i na k na k ca 2 15 gibbs ratio ii cl cl hco 3 furthermore the hydrogeochemical characteristics of an aquifer system are controlled by various chemical reactions that are usually responsible for the change in ion concentration in the forward ion exchange process ca2 and mg2 in the groundwater are substituted by na on mineral clay surfaces whereas in reverse ion exchange process ca2 and mg2 ions in clay minerals are substituted by na in the groundwater barzegar et al 2019 the occurrence of potential sources of ions was studied using various bivariate plots and ionic ratios the plot of na versus cl fig 5 a indicates that forward ion exchange is accountable for releasing na ions in groundwater of lucknow district barzegar et al 2019 and mgbenu and egbueri 2019 reported that na cl ratio 1 usually indicates that na ions in groundwater result from silicate weathering fig 5b confirms the occurrence of silicate weathering and indicates that only five samples are below the 1 1 equiline the bivariate plot of ca2 versus hco3 suggests that the carbonic acid weathering process is more accountable for release of ca2 ions than carbonate mineral dissolution in groundwater of lucknow district fig 5c fig 5d also indicates that silicate weathering is the dominant process in controlling the ion chemistry and hydrogeochemical development of the study area fig 6 a also suggests that the presence of na ions in groundwater is derived from forward ion exchange in addition fig 6b suggests that ca2 and mg2 ions in groundwater are derivative of silicate weathering instead of carbonate mineral dissolution in an effort to infer additional results chloro alkaline indices cai i cai ii were calculated using eqs 16 and 17 many researchers have used this method to determine ion exchange in aquifers mgbenu and egbueri 2019 adimalla et al 2020 schoeller 1977 proposed chloro alkaline indices to assess the ion exchange process between groundwater and its host rock during residence and travel in the vadose zone he reported that negative values of cai i and cai ii indicate forward ion exchange whereas positive values indicate reverse ion exchange the results of supplementary table 2 and fig 7 a and fig 7b reveal that there is a prevalence of forward ion exchange in releasing na k in groundwater of the lucknow region 16 cai i c l n a k c l 17 cai ii c l n a k s o 4 2 h c o 3 c o 3 n o 3 the piper 1944 trilinear plot is a well established approach to identify the hydrochemical facies of groundwater of any terrain fig 8 shows that ca2 hco3 is the dominant hydrochemical facies with a few samples showing na hco3 and mixed ca2 na hco3 water types reflecting that groundwater chemistry is primarily controlled through silicate weathering alkaline earths ca2 mg2 exceed alkalies na k and weak acid hco3 exceeds strong acids cl so4 2 4 3 correlation analysis correlation analysis based on the spearman rank coefficient correlation matrix is a well defined and prevalent technique for explaining the association between physico chemical parameters selvakumar et al 2017a umamageswari et al 2019 mgbenu and egbueri 2019 barzegar et al 2019 verma et al 2020a 2020b bib verma et al 2020a bib verma et al 2020b values range from 1 negative association to 1 positive association with the magnitude of the association defined by assigning expressions such as significant strong 0 75 moderate 0 75 0 50 and insignificant poor 0 50 0 30 table 6 shows significant association between tds and ec 1 1 as expected and between tds and major ions ca2 na k hco3 so4 2 and cl na shows moderate positive relationship r 0 70 with hco3 which ratifies the existence of na hco3 water type in certain parts of the lucknow district a moderate correlation between mg2 and hco3 r 0 41 indicated that these ions might be produced from the same source that is dissolution of carbonate minerals barzegar et al 2019 magnesium is poorly associated with sulfate r 0 39 and chloride 0 35 th indicated a strong positive association r 0 8 with calcium and magnesium as expected and a moderate correlation with sulfate r 0 50 4 4 water quality index the wqi provides significant information about the cumulative influence of each water quality parameter of a particular point site adimalla et al 2020 patil et al 2020 the overall quality of groundwater based on the wqi category is presented in table 7 and the individual wqi value n 56 of each groundwater sample is shown in table 8 the results indicate that samples are neither of excellent type nor are of an unsuitable type in lucknow district table 7 shows 34 of the samples have good water quality for drinking usage while 55 of the samples are of only fair type and about 11 of the samples indicate poor quality water fig 9 shows the wqi map of lucknow district suggesting that the east central part has poor quality water the elevated concentrations of tds th and no3 are primarily responsible for poor groundwater quality in the east central part for drinking water purposes water quality is good in a 402 97 km2 area reasonable in a 2027 04 km2 area and poor in a 96 03 km2 area in general high concentration of tds is responsible for the deterioration of water quality in most areas 4 5 irrigation water quality groundwater is a primary source for irrigation in rural parts of the present study region irrigation water quality and proper irrigation management are both vital for effective crop production poor quality of irrigation water adversely affects both yield and physical properties of the soil therefore evaluation of irrigation water quality is conducted using various irrigation indices and ratios such as sar rsc ssp mhr kr na pi and ps and the computed values are shown in table 9 the maps of irrigation groundwater quality based on various indices have been shown in fig 10 a f typically the quality of groundwater in terms of elemental concentrations may change significantly over time or over a certain period of time especially in dry climates adimalla et al 2020 the excess amount of salts in water modulates osmotic pressure in the root zone which limits plant or crop growth by changing its metabolic activity hanson et al 2006 the present study area has a high concentration of sodium in the water which forms the alkaline soil while high salt amount in water leads to the formation of saline soil todd and mays 1980 sar ranged between 0 5 and 5 with an average value of 1 5 table 9 ec salinity hazard c values are plotted against the sar sodium hazard s values delineated on the united states salinity laboratory s ussl diagram richards 1954 the ussl diagram has 16 different classes to depict the suitability of water for irrigation fig 11 indicates that 73 of groundwater samples fall into the c2 s1 class suggesting medium salinity hazard and low sodium hazard however 27 of the samples fall under the c3 s1 class indicating high salinity hazard and low sodium hazard which requires proper prevention of salinity control hanson et al 2006 and läuchli and grattan 2013 reported that continuous use of this type of groundwater alters the plant growth in different ways such as osmotic effects specific ion toxicity and nutritional disorders in many arid and semi arid regions the cause of excessive accumulation of salts is mainly the indiscriminate use of groundwater for irrigation which promotes sodification and salinization of soil and eventually affects crop development prasad et al 2001 läuchli and grattan 2013 the effect of sodicity on crop development is unlikely to differ from salinity porcelli et al 1995 moreover sodicity negatively influences the physical and hydrological properties of soil prasad et al 2001 thus the rsc has been calculated as an index to ascertain the suitability of groundwater for irrigation eaton 1950 table 9 shows that rsc values ranged between 1 4 and 6 2 with an average of 1 2 in the study area as per eaton 1950 classification of irrigation water based on rsc reveals that 68 of the samples are in the good category for irrigation while 20 and 12 of samples are in the doubtful and unsuitable categories respectively table 10 ssp is another noteworthy irrigation index for studying sodium hazard groundwater with ssp value 50 might have sodium accumulation that can damage the physical properties of the soil kadyampakeni et al 2018 in the present study area ssp values ranged from 11 8 to 64 6 with a mean value of 28 7 table 9 according to the wilcox 1955 classification of groundwater based on ssp values for irrigation suitability 25 of the samples in the present study area are of excellent type while 59 and 16 of the samples are of good and marginal type respectively as shown in table 10 high concentrations of calcium and magnesium in groundwater adversely affect soil quality adimalla et al 2020 however magnesium has a more severe effect on crop yields than calcium szabolcs and darab 1964 furthermore an mhr value of more than 50 indicates soil alkalinity which affects crop yield and therefore this type of groundwater is considered unsuitable for irrigation purposes shukla and saxena 2020 table 9 indicates that mhr values ranged between 43 4 and 76 2 with an average of 60 1 in the study area in addition table 10 reveals that only 13 of the samples are below the 50 percent threshold of suitability for irrigation and the remaining 87 of the samples are not suitable for irrigation kr values ranged from 0 1 to 1 8 with an average of 0 5 table 9 the kr analysis as listed in table 10 indicates that 91 and 9 of groundwater samples fall in suitable and marginally fit categories of irrigation water respectively in general groundwater fitness for irrigation purposes also depends on the chemical components released from the host aquifer or other sources moreover the exchange process of na ions in water for ca2 and mg2 in soil decreases the porosity and ultimately changes the soil structure resulting in poor internal drainage conditions wilcox 1955 srivastava and parimal 2020 the computed results of na table 9 range from 12 8 to 64 9 with a mean value of 30 in the study area wilcox 1955 proposed a diagram of ec versus na for a better understanding of the suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation which is presented in fig 12 this diagram is divided into five different classes that denote excellent good good permissible permissible doubtful doubtful unsuitable and unsuitable categories fig 12 indicates that 70 of the samples are of excellent to good type and 23 of the samples are of good to permissible type while 7 of the samples are of permissible to doubtful type furthermore table 10 based on na states that 20 of the samples are excellent while 64 of the samples are good for irrigation in contrast 9 and 7 of the samples were found to be permissible 40 60 and doubtful 60 80 respectively for irrigation however todd and mays 1980 suggested a boundary of 60 as the maximum permissible limit of na in groundwater doneen 1964 utilized pi as another way to determine the quality of water for irrigation the categorization of irrigation water based on pi values is shown in table 10 while maximum 100 soil permeability is beneficial for plant growth a less permeable soil may not allow plant growth to occur properly it depends on exchange process of ionic constituents present in water and soil srivastava and parimal 2020 the sum of all ionic constituent concentrations tc meq l 1 was plotted against the pi values in relation to assess the quality of groundwater for irrigation fig 13 depicts three different classes based on the pi vs tc plot in which class i represents 100 permeability suitable class ii represents 75 permeability with marginal suitability and class iii represents 25 permeability unsuitable results indicate that 64 of groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation while 36 of samples are marginally suitable for irrigation doneen 1964 proposed ps as another water quality index with values less than 3 considered suitable for irrigation the results in table 9 show that ps values in the study area ranged from 0 2 to 2 8 with an average of 1 1 all groundwater samples based on ps analysis are suitable for irrigation as listed in table 10 5 conclusions groundwater is a major source for drinking and irrigation use in lucknow district india based on chemical analysis the concentrations of physico chemical parameters of groundwater samples were compared to bis 2012 and who 2011 limits the general hydrochemical analysis suggests that overall water quality is suitable for drinking purposes except at some locations where elevated nitrate concentration is found in addition the hydrochemical evaluation of groundwater in lucknow district revealed that the concentrations of major ions are controlled by rock water interaction in which silicate weathering is the predominant process furthermore groundwater is slightly acidic to alkaline and hard to very hard in nature the piper plot revealed that ca2 hco3 is the dominant hydrochemical facies with a few samples having na hco3 and mixed ca2 na hco3 water types the spatial distribution of each parameter was mapped which may prove helpful in planning new groundwater schemes based on the wqi the study revealed that 34 of the samples had good quality water for drinking use while 55 of the samples were of a fair type and about 11 of the samples indicated poor quality water the wqi doesn t explicitly account for possible microbial contamination of drinking water although no3 results are suggestive of untreated wastewater discharge in the region the suitability of groundwater for irrigation was evaluated based on various indexes ratios of chemical constituents and graphical analysis sar index indicated that all the samples were excellent for irrigation while based on rsc categorization about 68 of samples were of good type and about 20 and 12 were found to be doubtful and unsuitable respectively ssp values indicated that 25 of samples were excellent type and 59 and 16 were found to be good and marginal for irrigation purposes respectively as far as mhr is concerned 87 of the samples were unsuitable for irrigation while based on kr pi and ps 91 100 and about 100 of samples were suitable for irrigation respectively based on na analysis about 20 of samples were found excellent for irrigation while 64 9 and 7 were good permissible and doubtful type respectively this study would help raise awareness amongst the inhabitants policymakers and authorities to understand the hydrogeological processes in the lucknow district reverse osmosis units could be installed nearby the groundwater outlets used for drinking purpose sewers are needed for inhibiting the no3 leaching to the groundwater resources in most of the urban areas domestic and industrial wastewater should be treated before discharging into water bodies and on the land surface according to the standards set by the central pollution control board the results obtained from the assessment of groundwater quality for irrigation require salinity control in some places which can be achieved by mixing the groundwater with lower salinity water before irrigation additionally the surface water bodies ponds lakes canals that have dried up or disappeared due to encroachment dumping of waste and entry of untreated sewage should be used for the storage of rainwater which will help in groundwater recharge and in its quality improvement in addition flood irrigation practices in the area should be replaced by drip and or sprinkler irrigation which reduces salt deposition in the soil and increases crop yield promoting organic farming can also help in reduction of no3 contamination in groundwater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

risk probability 0 8 1 0 has concentrated in the middle and north western part of this region it is decreased towards east and southerly fig 6 c demonstrated the risk probability of ph concentration in the region with high risk probability has been located in southern part of this district high risk probability of fluoride has concentrated in the eastern portion and low in the northwest and southern portion of this district fig 6 3 3 human health risk population density is one of the main parameters for determining the magnitude of population at risk calka et al 2017 population density in the region plays an important role in assessing human health risks as high density areas are likely to be at high risk rather than low population density areas table 4 for population density mapping block sound population statistics have been used and population density has been calculated by dividing the population of the region by dividing the area the population density map was categorized into three classes as high moderate and low in the arcgis environment using idw natural break method population density map categories in three classes such as high moderate and low population density the unit of population density is the number of persons km2 the southern part of the district has a high density of population the central part has moderate density of population and the other area has low density of population the high risk probability and high population density of arsenic the emphasis on a similar location indicating an extremely high risk to human health in the southern part and a high risk of iron in groundwater at a low moderate population density zone prefer a low and moderate risk to human health in the northern and southern parts of the region with a high risk of ph intentionally occurring in a high population density zone indicating an extremely high risk of human health in the southern part and a high risk of groundwater to fluoride intentionally in a low population density zone a low risk of human health is preferred fig 6 4 discussion human health risk assessment is a method for assessing the extent and likelihood of adverse human health effects that could be exposed to chemical contaminants in a polluted environment united states national academy ofs 1983 contamination of water resources has significant environmental and human health implications the magnitude of the risk and likelihood of human health risk in relation to population density was analyzed in this study various research has used various techniques such

conclusions human health is very important and the assessment of health risks is also very critical to the validation of human health risks as groundwater minerals pose a threat to human health study of the assessment of human health risks to the malda district as a whole and the following results the concentration of minerals above the standard level is hazardous to the human body and risk rm has been analyzed through kriging interpolation high risk magnitude for arsenic and iron in groundwater was identified in the southeast and central regions with relatively low risk magnitude for ph and fluoride in groundwater risk probability has been analyzed using a semi variogram a kriging geo statistical analysis high arsenic risk probability zone is located in the south and west of the district high iron risk probability zone is scattered high ph risk probability zone is located in the south of the district and the high risk probability zone of fluoride is located in the eastern part of the district finally a population density map has been added to the probability map to better understand the risks to human health extremely high risks to human health associated with arsenic and ph are identified in the area the risk of fluoride iron concentrations in groundwater to human health is low moderate these data sets will make health risk assessments more accurate for future research this tends to be more significant in future research as the actual risk of total exposure to arsenic iron ph and fluoride may be significantly higher the human health risk map as indicated above may be more effective in considering more effective criteria for appropriate remediation 6 funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public and government sectors

below eq 4 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n z x h z x 2 here n is the number of survey point pairs z x divided at points x and x h by distance h the observed form of analytical semi variogram analysis is equipped by the methodology of weighted least squares the close fitting of the analytical semi variogram to the model suggests that an appropriate choice of methodology was created for the spatial estimation of uncertain variables berke 2004 the semi variance generated meaning from the semi variogram model is replaced by eq 3 by using the lagrange multiplier carrat and valleron 1992 to gain weights λ eq 5 i

data spatial estimation reduced from dmc concentration using eq 1 was mapped and analyzed further probability kriging implies co kriging projections are defined as the primary and the auxiliary vector predictor values i x z th and standardized value u x respectively indicator values are binary codes 0 or 1 converted from random variables z x i 1 n regional rm database utilizing the indicator

spatial distribution of risk magnitude the rm emerged in eq 1 illustrates the positions of possible health risk hotspots correlated with exposure to dmc pollution to interpolate the datasets the kriging ordinary method interpolation method was used and the risk magnitude classified into five classes using natural break method for different parameters four maps are generated the rm of arsenic fig 4a of that district shows extreme high risk magnitude 3 93 9 80 very high risk high risk low risk and very low risk zone the lower and middle portions have high rm high risk magnitude is positioned in the southeastern portion where the amount of arsenic is very high above the permissible level the rm of iron has been classified into five classes moderate risk magnitude is in the 28 45 area high risk magnitude is in the 26 85 area and extreme high risk magnitude is in the 7 32 area the extremely high risk magnitude 5 54 8 13 is situated at the centre of this region fig 4c has demonstrates the ph of groundwater an enormous part of the district has a high rm zone 65 61 area of the total has high rm with the range of the rm is 1 0 1 10 the zone is positioned in the north east and southern part of the district lastly fluoride concentration in groundwater has been seen in fig 4d the map depicts that fluoride concentration in groundwater is found in the some portions of the entire district a large portion of this region has no risk of fluoride in groundwater and the moderate rm is located in only 1 03 of area at the eastern portion table 2 3 2 spatial distribution of risk probability the semi variograms show the spatial dependence of groundwater concentration points the semi variograms fitted for concentration of the study area and graphical representation provides a picture of the spatial correlation of the data points with their neighbors table 3 the best fitted semi variograms of transforming values from the database are shown in fig 5 the indicator value s associated semi variogram parameters nugget sill and range measure the probability of a higher health risk than the threshold value rm 1 the probability map has been prepared to show the risk in the region and showed a variable degree of probability of health risk the probability maps are created by probability kriging in geo statistical analysis maps has been classified into 5 classes and the classes are divided by four contours risk probability regarding arsenic highest value 0 8 1 0 found in the south western part of this district risk probability to contamination of iron highest risk probability 0 8 1 0 has concentrated in the middle and north western part of this region it is decreased towards east and southerly fig 6 c demonstrated the risk probability of ph concentration in the region with high risk probability has been located in southern part of this district high risk probability of fluoride has concentrated in the eastern portion and low in the northwest and southern portion of this district fig 6 3 3 human health risk population density is one of the main parameters for determining the magnitude of population at risk calka et al 2017 population density in the region plays an important role in assessing human health risks as high density areas are likely to be at high risk rather than low population density areas table 4 for population density mapping block sound population statistics have been used and population density has been calculated by dividing the population of the region by dividing the area the population density map was categorized into three classes as high moderate and low in the arcgis environment using idw natural break method population density map categories in three classes such as high moderate and low population density the unit of population density is the number of persons km2 the southern part of the district has a high density of population the central part has moderate density of population and the other area has low density of population the high risk probability and high population density of arsenic the emphasis on a similar location indicating an extremely high risk to human health in the southern part and a high risk of iron in groundwater at a low moderate population density zone prefer a low and moderate risk to human health in the northern and southern parts of the region with a high risk of ph intentionally occurring in a high population density zone indicating an extremely high risk of human health in the southern part and a high risk of groundwater to fluoride intentionally in a low population density zone a low risk of human health is preferred fig 6 4 discussion human health risk assessment is a method for assessing the extent and likelihood of adverse human health effects that could be exposed to chemical contaminants in a polluted environment united states national academy ofs 1983 contamination of water resources has significant environmental and human health implications the magnitude of the risk and likelihood of human health risk in relation to population density was analyzed in this study various research has used various techniques such as estimated daily intake edi hazard quotient hq to assess human health risk of exposure to fluoride in drinking water in iran yousefi et al 2018 china zhang et al 2020a 2020b shalyari et al 2019 used monte carlo simulation mcs technique to assess health risk assessment of iranshahr chronic daily intake cdi mg kg day and dermally absorbed dose dad mg kg day used for potential health risk assessment from nitrate in drinking water of south india adimalla 2020 in this study geo statistical analysis is used for assessing human health risk a similar types of study conducted by a similar approach for mapping risk to mercury in drinking water in northern india raju et al 2019 the risk probability map for human health risks has been outlined in this study the results of this study will help identify risk zones and take the necessary steps to develop sound management plans to improve daily water quality the government must also take effective action by purifying water using different plants etc 5 conclusions human health is very important and the assessment of health risks is also very critical to the validation of human health risks as groundwater minerals pose a threat to human health study of the assessment of human health risks to the malda district as a whole and the following results the concentration of minerals above the standard level is hazardous to the human body and risk rm has been analyzed through kriging interpolation high risk magnitude for arsenic and iron in groundwater was identified in the southeast and central regions with relatively low risk magnitude for ph and fluoride in groundwater risk probability has been analyzed using a semi variogram a kriging geo statistical analysis high arsenic risk probability zone is located in the south and west of the district high iron risk probability zone is scattered high ph risk probability zone is located in the south of the district and the high risk probability zone of fluoride is located in the eastern part of the district finally a population density map has been added to the probability map to better understand the risks to human health extremely high risks to human health associated with arsenic and ph are identified in the area the risk of fluoride iron concentrations in groundwater to human health is low moderate these data sets will make health risk assessments more accurate for future research this tends to be more significant in future research as the actual risk of total exposure to arsenic iron ph and fluoride may be significantly higher the human health risk map as indicated above may be more effective in considering more effective criteria for appropriate remediation 6 funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public and government sectors

11944,handwashing is one of the vital public health measures it helps to prevent the spread of the covid 19 pandemic however water overuse during hand scrubbing with soap keeping the tap on may put enormous pressure on the already overstretched groundwater resources and households economic well being therefore this study aimed to determine the overuse of water while scrubbing hands with soap for handwashing when the tap is on amid the covid 19 pandemic in bangladesh sociodemographic data were collected using a web based survey tool among 1980 participants and an experiment was conducted among 126 participants to estimate the overuse of water during hand scrubbing while the tap is on a total of 80 of the participants washed their hands regularly after returning home from outside about 57 3 of participants did not turn off their tap throughout the handwashing process a single participant who kept his tap on throughout the handwashing process overused approximately 1 7 l of water per handwash and 14 9 l of water per day hand scrubbing with soap keeping the tap on raised the overuse of water 13 fold during this pandemic compared to the non pandemic situation which cost an extra 225 0 bdt 2 7 per day for 1980 participants minimize the speed of tap using automatic taps and using taps operated by legs might be an effective solution to reduce the water overuse furthermore behavioral change interventions are needed to aware people turn off the tap during hand scrubbing with soap graphical abstract image 1 keywords overuse of water handwashing hand scrubbing covid 19 bangladesh 1 introduction hand hygiene is often considered synonymous with handwashing and it is the most important factor in preventing nosocomial infections by preventing contact and fecal oral transmission of pathogens boyce and pittet 2002 widmer 2000 hand hygiene is an important public health measure burton et al 2011 tao et al 2013 and it has long been recognized to be a convenient effective and also cost effective means of preventing infectious diseases tao et al 2013 during the covid 19 pandemic frequent handwashing with soap and water was recommended as one of the most effective measures to reduce the spread of infection cdc 2020 unicef 2020 who and unicef 2020 in addition to that who and unicef also recommended switching the faucet tap off while lathering hands with soap and scrubbing for at least 20 s to prevent water loss who and unicef 2020 many countries around the world including bangladesh utilize groundwater as the main source of drinking water and daily domestic activities evidence suggests that the frequency of handwashing increased during a pandemic situation park et al 2010 the outbreak of ebola in west africa during 2014 16 has also raised the demand for clean water for prevention and treatment conversation 2020 therefore the frequency of handwashing has also been reported to be increased during the co current covid 19 pandemic amegah 2020 roshan et al 2020 the water demand raised by 20 25 in india during this covid 19 pandemic due to keeping the tap open during handwashing rohilla 2020 besides a water sector official in jordan recently claimed that water demand has increased by 40 after the government ordered people to stay home as part of a nationwide curfew conversation 2020 this increase in demand will bring tremendous pressure on overstretched groundwater resources to fill existing shortages in the water supply in a resource constrained country like bangladesh hedrick 2018 van der voorn et al 2020 in dhaka the capital of bangladesh with over 21 million population the trend of water level change is mostly consistent with the pace and extent of groundwater extraction hoque et al 2007 over the past 50 years the abstraction of groundwater caused water levels to decline by more than 60 m and these levels continue to decrease at a rate of more than 3 m per year in dhaka city hoque et al 2007 khan et al 2016 in these urban settings rapid population growth may worsen the problems with groundwater depletion un 2014 van der voorn et al 2020 unicef 2020 the current practice of groundwater abstraction and use in other areas of the country may make the groundwater resources unsustainable mojid et al 2019 this situation will be further worsened in the country in summer when sources of water supply run dry therefore the overuse of water due to excess water flow especially keeping the tap on while hand scrubbing for handwashing is a serious issue sayeed et al 2020 however there is no previous study to evaluate the overuse of water because of open tap while hand scrubbing with soap during the practice of handwashing therefore this study aimed to estimate the overuse of water during scrubbing hands with soap for handwashing with running taps amid the covid 19 pandemic in bangladesh with an emphasis on quantifying the potential overuse of groundwater 2 methods 2 1 setting and participants a prospective cross sectional web based survey was conducted among the general population of bangladesh to assess handwashing practices from may 11 to june 7 2020 as a community based face to face survey was not feasible during this covid 19 pandemic situation data was collected through online from all divisions of bangladesh the authors distributed the survey link in all divisions of bangladesh via social media among rural and urban people the snowball sampling method was used to recruit the participants kirchherr and charles 2018 snowball sampling is defined as a non probability sampling technique in which the samples have traits that are rare to find this is a sampling technique in which existing subjects provide referrals to recruit samples required for a research study the chain referral process allows the researcher to reach populations that are difficult to sample when using other sampling methods in our study there were 7 people who initially sampled to start the snow ball then they shared the link among bangladeshi resident aged more than 18 kirchherr and charles 2018 to improve the participation rate reminder requests were sent through social media at 1 week intervals for a total of three times the survey questionnaire was sent to more than 2500 participants and 1980 of them from all the divisions of the country aged between 18 and 67 years completed the questionnaire eligibility criteria included the ability to read bangla residence in bangladesh during the pandemic and having access to the internet 2 2 data collection a survey tool was developed considering the regular pattern of handwashing practice and facility during the covid 19 pandemic the questionnaire survey consisted of 14 close ended questions of 4 5 min duration table 1 sociodemographic data were collected on age gender educational status location of residence besides the survey included questions on the frequency of handwashing duration of lathering and scrubbing hands with soap whether they keep their tap on or off during the lathering and scrubbing process the survey tool was piloted with a small online user group to test its clarity and consistency the survey included a short overview of the study context purpose procedures confidentiality agreement and consent this study complied with the most recent revision of the helsinki declaration williams 2008 and followed the checklist for reporting results of internet e surveys cherries guidelines eysenbach 2004 descriptive statistics were performed to define the fundamental characteristics of the data in the participants 2 3 experimental design the experiment was designed based on the method described by green venture 2007 and used in a previous study for determining the flow rate of water in china lu and smout 2008 the objective of the experiment was to estimate the volume of water drained during that time we invited 1134 participants 57 3 of total participants who did not turn off their tap during handwashing for voluntary participation in the study among them a total of 126 participants 6 4 of total participants agreed and participated in the experiment session from their house and each used 1 domicile handwashing tap the participants inclusion criteria for the experiment of determining flow rate was to have the experimental tools such as stopwatch milliliter jug etc all the participant who took part in this experiment were trained through online video conference we divided them into 14 groups with nine participants in each group during the training session each participant used one tap from his her home and took part in 3 experiments at three different speeds of the tap for the better measurement of flow rate a total of 378 experiments were conducted setting the tap at minimum average 39 4 ml s 126 experiments medium average 84 2 ml s 126 experiments and maximum speed average 161 3 ml s 126 experiments arbitrarily the water flow rate is the volume of water ml per unit time s that flows through the tap then water was collected in a water bottle marked for milliliter measurement the required time to fill 1 l of water for each experiment was recorded and noted then the overuse of water was calculated for 18 0 s table 2 2 4 data analysis the data collected was encoded and entered into a computer using microsoft excel 2016 version and exported to spss all statistical analyses were performed using the spss windows version 24 ibm spss statistics new york united states descriptive statistics such as frequency percentages mean and standard deviation were calculated and presented in the tables 2 5 ethics the research protocol was reviewed and approved by the research ethical committee rec of the department of food microbiology patuakhali science and technology university bangladesh approval no fmb may 29 2020 06 3 results and discussion 3 1 demographic information the characteristics of the participants is presenting in table 1 of the 1980 participants 55 5 were male 44 6 were female 28 9 of the participant were employees 25 6 were students and 18 8 were unemployed 35 0 of the participants completed their graduation and 5 7 had no schooling experience although most of the respondents were from the dhaka division 19 1 also respondents from all 8 divisions of the country participated in the study fig 1 the majority of the participants were from urban areas 74 and use municipal water for domiciliary use 60 9 3 2 handwashing practice during covid 19 pandemic the present study found that 77 9 of the participants practiced regular handwashing after returning home from outside during the pandemic which is lower compared to the others study in bangladesh haque et al 2020 kundu et al 2020 wadood et al 2020 this lower rate of handwashing practice after returning home from outside could be because of the less movement outside of home due to restrictions imposed by the government for covid 19 pandemic during the study period moreover regular handwashing practice after sneezing was poor 37 1 during the covid 19 pandemic 88 4 of participants increased the frequency of their handwashing during the pandemic compared to the pre pandemic situation about 82 5 of the participants used manual tap regularly for handwashing among all the participants the mean frequencies of handwashing per day were 2 9 0 2 sd times and 8 9 5 9 sd times during pre pandemic and pandemic situations respectively fig 2a this increased rate of handwashing practice during the covid 19 is also coherent with other studies amegah 2020 roshan et al 2020 3 3 overuse of water due to leaving the tap on while lathering and scrubbing the hands with soap among the 1980 participants 1134 participants 57 3 reported that they kept their tap on during lathering and scrubbing hands with soap fig 2b the average duration of lathering and scrubbing hands with soap per hand wash was 17 7 s among all the participants and 18 0 s among the participants who kept their tap on table 1 to put table 2 into perspective an individual overused 1704 7 ml and 416 9 ml of water by a single handwash during the covid 19 pandemic and pre covid 19 period respectively fig 3 besides that an individual overused 14882 4 ml and 1163 2 ml of water per day during the covid 19 pandemic and pre covid 19 period respectively therefore by keeping the tap on during lathering and scrubbing hands with soap for handwashing 1134 participants overused 12 8 times 16876 l vs 1319 l more water per day during this pandemic compared to the pre pandemic situation thus 1134 participant s overused an extra 15 557 l of water during this pandemic for handwashing purposes which cost an extra 225 0 bdt or 2 6 usd per day 14 5 bdt 1000 l water bdnews24 2020 3 4 limitation the speed of the tap was set by the judgment of the experimenter the number of participants for the experiment was not large enough and not country representative but from all divisions furthermore we were unable to reach those participants who do not have an internet connection and throughout the experiment and we were unable to observe the participants so the study is not without some errors we had no better solution during the countrywide lock down situation however it still gives a reasonable representation and we suggest a large scale study with an economic evaluation regarding the overuse of water 4 conclusion and recommendation while lathering hands with soap and scrubbing a large number of people keep their tap on thereby wasting 1179 of water during this pandemic compared to the pre pandemic situation this water and economic loss can be mitigated by good practice one of the first things that we need to address is to minimize the speed of tap during handwashing that would save 140 of water by them who keep their tap on during handwashing 57 3 at least without relying on individual behaviors it is also recommended to use push taps that automatically switch off after a period or sensor taps that are programmed to automatically turn on when hands are under the spout and immediately stop when the hands are taken away from the tap furthermore behavioral change interventions are needed to make people aware in bangladesh and similar low income countries to shut off the tap at periods when water is not being used considering the limited water resources and respective potential stress on economics relevance to the overuse however from a policy point of view it is important to know how much the overuse of water affect both the water supplies and the economic status to find an effective intervention so further studies are required not only in bangladesh but also worldwide new findings of this study will benefit future research to comprehensively assess the economic impact associated with the overuse of water in developed and developing countries due to new hygiene rules and regulations imposed during the covid 19 outbreak definitions overuse of water overuse of water means the waste of water when people scrub their hands with soap keeping the tap on water flow the water flow rate is the volume of water ml per unit time s that flows through the tap funding none

handwashing practice after sneezing was poor 37 1 during the covid 19 pandemic 88 4 of participants increased the frequency of their handwashing during the pandemic compared to the pre pandemic situation about 82 5 of the participants used manual tap regularly for handwashing among all the participants the mean frequencies of handwashing per day were 2 9 0 2 sd times and 8 9 5 9 sd times during pre pandemic and pandemic situations respectively fig 2a this increased rate of handwashing practice during the covid 19 is also coherent with other studies amegah 2020 roshan et al 2020 3 3 overuse of water due to leaving the tap on while lathering and scrubbing the hands with soap among the 1980 participants 1134 participants 57 3 reported that they kept their tap on during lathering and scrubbing hands with soap fig 2b the average duration of lathering and scrubbing hands with soap per hand wash was 17 7 s among all the participants and 18 0 s among the participants who kept their tap on table 1 to put table 2 into perspective an individual overused 1704 7 ml and 416 9 ml of water by a single handwash during the covid 19 pandemic and pre covid 19 period respectively fig 3 besides that an individual overused 14882 4 ml and 1163 2 ml of water per day during the covid 19 pandemic and pre covid 19 period respectively therefore by keeping the tap on during lathering and scrubbing hands with soap for handwashing 1134 participants overused 12 8 times 16876 l vs 1319 l more water per day during this pandemic compared to the pre pandemic situation thus 1134 participant s overused an extra 15 557 l of water during this pandemic for handwashing purposes which cost an extra 225 0 bdt or 2 6 usd per day 14 5 bdt 1000 l water bdnews24 2020 3 4 limitation the speed of the tap was set by the judgment of the experimenter the number of participants for the experiment was not large enough and not country representative but from all divisions furthermore we were unable to reach those participants who do not have an internet connection and throughout the experiment and we were unable to observe the participants so the study is not without some errors we had no better solution during the countrywide lock down situation however it still gives a reasonable representation and we suggest a large scale study with an economic evaluation regarding the overuse of water 4 conclusion and recommendation while lathering hands with soap and scrubbing a large number of people keep their tap on thereby wasting 1179 of water during this pandemic compared to the pre pandemic situation this water and economic loss can be mitigated by good practice one of the first things that we need to address is to minimize the speed of tap during handwashing that would save 140 of water by them who keep their tap on during handwashing 57 3 at least without relying on individual behaviors it is also recommended to use push taps that automatically switch off after a period or sensor taps that are programmed to automatically turn on when hands are under the spout and immediately stop when the hands are taken away from the tap furthermore behavioral change interventions are needed to make people aware in bangladesh and similar low income countries to shut off the tap at periods when water is not being used considering the limited water resources and respective potential stress on economics relevance to the overuse however from a policy point of view it is important to know how much the overuse of water affect both the water supplies and the economic status to find an effective intervention so further studies are required not only in bangladesh but also worldwide new findings of this study will benefit future research to comprehensively assess the economic impact associated with the overuse of water in developed and developing countries due to new hygiene rules and regulations imposed during the covid 19 outbreak definitions overuse of water overuse of water means the waste of water when people scrub their hands with soap keeping the tap on water flow the water flow rate is the volume of water ml per unit time s that flows through the tap funding none
