20510,modern society is dependent on offshore cables and consequently cable faults lead to major disruption and economic loss the most effective way to protect offshore cables from anchor damage is to bury them in the seabed but current guidance is ambiguous this paper attempts to produce more rational design guidance for anchor penetration in sand based on centrifuge modelling allowing suitable burial depths for cables to be calculated based on the more useful metrics of anchor or ship size a miniature anchor was dragged through sand of different densities within a centrifuge with maximum anchor penetration being measured the most significant factor that influences anchor penetration depth is the size of the anchor investigated by completing centrifuge tests at different g levels a linear relationship was recorded between anchor size and penetration depth which was used to develop new guidelines for cable burial the new chart is clear and easy to use with the cable burial depths given in relation to anchor size anchor mass and ship mass use of this chart will enable the safe and economic burial of cables and lead to a decrease in the impact of anchor damage to offshore cables keywords anchors cable burial sandy soil 1 introduction submarine cables exist worldwide to provide power and data connectivity across the oceans and to offshore assets such as wind turbines global connectivity relies on the uninterrupted use of these cable networks so damage to them can cause extreme disruption while cables cover only a small proportion of the seabed their linear nature makes them very susceptible to dragging anchors for example cables which span over shipping lanes such as the english channel will be crossed by an enormous number of shipping movements each day any ship dragging an anchor at depth equal to or greater than the cable burial depth will impact on these cables two recent examples of anchor damage to offshore cables highlight the potential for wide ranging economic damage from the disruption of cable networks during storm angus in november 2016 a ship deployed its anchor in an emergency and cut four of the eight cables in the crucial hvdc interconnector power link between the uk and france the 2 gw connection consequently ran at half its capacity until february 2017 resulting in a rise in uk electricity prices over winter as the national grid had to make use of back up coal fired power stations this incident raises concerns over the protection of these vital power links and shows the significance of having accurate information about appropriate cable burial depths on november 28 2016 an anchor being dragged across the seabed caused serious damage to three of the four internet cables to jersey in the channel islands leaving just one cable to provide the island with internet connectivity repair of the cables was a complex job with ships having to travel in bad weather to raise the cables and splice them back together over a 3 week period in order to prevent damage cables must be protected from aggression from both fishing activities and anchors at present three main methods are used armouring can be used to give physical protection against impact damage but provides little protection if the cable is hooked by an anchor alternatively rock mattresses may be laid over cables to allow anchors to ride over the cables however this is very expensive in the vast majority of cases the cheapest way to provide protection to cables from anchor damage is to bury the cable at depths of up to 3 m beneath the seabed such that the anchor will not reach the cable allen 1998 while burial is economical compared to other protection schemes increasing depth of burial comes at substantial cost over the entire cable length so optimising this parameter is vital most cable damage is caused by anchors that are fully deployed and being dragged along the seabed as this causes the flukes to penetrate the maximum distance into the seabed this investigation hence focuses on anchor behaviour due to a horizontal pull at the seabed this paper will focus on cable burial identified as being the most common and cost effective form of cable protection since the widespread adoption of cable burial in the 1980s a dramatic drop in the number of cable faults has been observed fig 1 the current state of practice in choosing burial depths for cables is based on fig 2 which provides a guideline for cable burial depth produced by mole et al 1997 in an attempt to reduce cable damage previously the nominal burial depth had been 0 6 m which was found to be insufficient to protect cables from anchors only providing protection against fishing gear the chart was developed from the cable wireless marine database of ploughing and survey operations while this chart has been widely used and has contributed to a decrease in cable faults due to anchor damage several aspects of its conclusions require further investigation firstly there is no record of the methodology used to measure penetration depths or the amount of data used to create the chart it was also reportedly produced from records of ploughing operations which will give different penetration depths when compared to anchors the fact that this chart is still in use after two decades suggests that the burial depths given are generally conservative as otherwise it would have been revised or rejected while using conservative burial depths does minimise cable damage it will lead to unnecessarily high burial costs conversely cable failures still occur so in some circumstances the prescribed burial depths are insufficient the second issue with the chart is the way in which the seabed is classified grouping soils by type is ambiguous as it relies on judgement to classify the seabed using a quantitative measure such as soil strength or particle size would be more useful in this situation the substantial difference in penetration depth predicted between coarse and fine sands also seems surprising as compared to the size of either an anchor or a mooring chain link both coarse and fine sand particles are very small and would be expected to behave as continua with very similar properties gui and bolton 1998 while sands exhibit a range of friction angles there is no strong correlation with mean particle size the internal friction angle of sand is a reflection of the friction and interlocking between particles and should be independent of scale but affected by the shape mineralogy and coefficient of uniformity of the particles none of which are directly functions of mean particle size this has been demonstrated experimentally by andersen schjetne 2013 and sadrekarimi and olson 2011 and based on discrete element modelling by jiang et al 2018 while changes in sand strength properties would be reflected in anchor penetration depths particle size itself should not have a significant effect and a metric such as internal friction angle would be more appropriate for use the final issue is the metric of burial protection index bpi this measure is only qualitatively described with for example bpi 3 giving protection against anchors of all but the largest ships a more useful metric would be the size of anchor against which the cable is protected overall while the chart is an improvement on the previous approach of a single deep burial requirement applied to all types of cables a more scientific approach to the problem could generate guidance which is more directly linked to shipping traffic expected above the cable 1 1 existing data on anchor penetration there has been little previous work carried out to study anchor penetration depths leading to the problems seen with existing guidelines but some limited results do exist from field trials on anchor performance which can be used to help with validating the reduced scale model tests reported in this paper taylor and valent 1984 carried out work for the us naval civil engineering laboratory investigating the holding capacity of anchors but also reported the maximum expected penetration depths the penetration depth was shown to be approximately equal to the length of the anchor fluke in sands and stiff clays and substantially more in soft silts and clays the sources of this recommendation are unclear in the report presumably coming from experience of anchor performance in may 2013 testing was carried out by tennet a company responsible for connecting offshore windfarms to the grid in the german sector of the north sea drews and maushake 2014 the existing design specification from the client was to bury cables at 3 m depth within shipping lanes equivalent to bpi 3 and at 1 5 m elsewhere there were concerns that this was overly conservative and that money could be saved by reducing burial depths so a 12 tonne halls anchor and an 8 tonne ac 14 anchor were tested with each being dragged three times at three different test sites in the north sea penetration depths were determined using side scan sonar sss sediment echosounder surveying ses and visual inspection using remotely operated vehicles rovs sss surveys of the entire pull area were conducted before and after anchors were dragged along the seabed to measure the depth of the tracks produced a clear limitation of this method is that sand could collapse back into the anchor tracks after the anchor has been pulled through leading to an underestimation of penetration depth the tests found that halls and ac 14 anchors had maximum penetration depths of 0 88 m and 0 67 m respectively which were achieved in the loosest sand as a result of this research burial depth guidelines were reduced to 1 5 m from the previous 3 m as recommended for a bpi of 3 in coarse sands resulting in huge savings in cable burial costs while these tests were not extensive the sands in this area are largely representative of sandy soils elsewhere these tests hence indicate that current design guidance is likely to be overly conservative in sandy soils nakamura et al 1992 presented penetration depths of anchors in different soils based on anchor weight table 1 the results were used in the development of a simple mathematical model which calculates the expected failure rate of a length of cable by considering external mechanical hazards by specifying the desired failure rate and imposing variations on critical parameters it was possible to find a safe limit for parameter values such as cable burial depth the parameter of external mechanical protection was considered too complex to model and so instead a new parameter was defined equivalent protection which combined mechanical protection and seabed properties to give five distinct levels for example the first level of equivalent protection is burying a cable 0 5 m deep in mud or laying it on the surface for sand the final results gained from their model were justified by reverse application on existing data of cable failure rates comparison of these values with the data from drews and maushake 2014 shows a surprising degree of divergence with penetration depths from the nakamura et al 1992 data being around 3 times those observed in field trials 2 theory and design of experiment 2 1 centrifuge modelling centrifuge modelling is an experimental test method used to reproduce large scale engineering problems with small scale physical models the aim is to induce stresses in the model which are equal to those that would be experienced in the full scale equivalent being investigated known as the prototype small scale geotechnical models typically suffer from issues with the non linear constitutive behaviour of soils the strength of soil is a strong and nonlinear function of the confining stresses applied to it as the majority of forces exerted in geotechnical problems come from the soil s own self weight centrifuge modelling uses the enhanced gravity field created from the rotation of a geotechnical centrifuge to achieve stress similitude between a 1 n scale model tested at n x g and a full size prototype the scaling factor n is proportional to the angular velocity of the centrifuge squared and so a model can be scaled precisely by controlling the speed of rotation further details of the principles of centrifuge modelling and its associated scaling laws can be found in schofield 1980 and madabhushi 2014 in this project the cambridge university minidrum centrifuge barker 1998 was used this drum centrifuge consists of a circular channel 1 m in diameter in which a soil model can be constructed rotating about a vertical axis to generate high centripetal accelerations up to 100 g in the tests described here the centrifuge was used with a model box on one side of the drum with a counterweight attached diametrically opposite to balance the rotor the model container occupied 1 6 of the circumference of the inner channel and had dimensions of approximately 450 mm 250 mm x 150 mm lxwxh the soil model consisted of a bed of hostun sand with properties shown in table 2 prepared at 1 g by air pluviation to a controlled relative density before being saturated with water the sand bed was then drained to induce sufficient capillary suction to keep the sand stable before being loaded into the centrifuge the model anchor was installed into the wet sand bed and keyed into the soil to maintain the anchor s initial position during the spin up phase of the test before the centrifuge was accelerated to the appropriate g level the channel of the centrifuge was then flooded with water submerging and saturating the sand bed before a model anchor was pulled across the surface by an actuator as shown in fig 3 2 2 anchor model a model ac 14 anchor was 3d printed in stainless steel as shown in fig 4 to accurately represent the geometry and mass of the prototype anchor this anchor was connected to the actuator by a rode consisting of a length of chain attached to a stainless steel wire cable with the pull on the anchor being maintained parallel to the ground surface by virtue of the positioning of the pulley shown in fig 3 this geometry simulates the anchor cable geometry in practice where the self weight of the chain rode attached to the anchor causes the pull at the anchor padeye to be horizontal assisting with penetration of the anchor while it is being deployed in practical situations increasing the anchor pull from the ship will lift the rode resulting in the pull on the anchor becoming more vertical eventually leading to anchor pull out this will however lead to shallower anchor penetration and is thus less critical for adequate burial of cables and pipelines than the horizontal pull scenario 3 results and discussion during testing the model anchor was dragged across the soil surface and embedded itself into the model seabed finally achieving an equilibrium depth once this had been achieved the centrifuge was stopped the model was sectioned as shown in fig 5 and the final position was measured a suite of tests was developed and implemented to investigate the effect of anchor size and sand type on the achieved anchor penetration preliminary tests were carried out with the anchor initially at the seabed or buried by 30 and 60 mm it was found that the final anchor equilibrium depth was identical to an accuracy of 0 25 mm at model scale for all tests and all anchors had an equilibrium position with the shank at 21 to the horizontal as shown in fig 5 3 1 impact of anchor size the size of an anchor varies greatly depending on the size of the ship that it belongs to with larger ships requiring larger anchors to give sufficiently high holding power it is therefore important that the relationship between anchor size and maximum penetration depth is known in order to protect cables from the sizes of anchors used in the surrounding area variation of penetration depth with anchor size was investigated by completing centrifuge tests at varying g levels allowing simulation of different anchor sizes with the same model from the scaling laws presented by madabhushi 2014 it is known that the prototype length can be found by multiplying the model length by the g level tests carried out at varying g levels between 20 g and 80 g with the same ac 14 model anchor 38 mm fluke length thus allowed prototype anchors with fluke lengths between 0 76 m and 3 04 m to be modelled the results of these tests are summarised in table 3 sand was prepared to a relative density of approximately 50 for all three g levels the test at 20 g was duplicated to assess the repeatability of the method ac 14 anchors are available with weights between 180 kg and 21 75 tonnes and fluke lengths ranging from 0 7 m to 3 5 m the experiments described here thus cover almost the entire range of possible anchor sizes and predict a maximum penetration depth of 2 9 m in sand for the largest ac 14 anchor available the data suggest that the relationship between anchor fluke length l and penetration depth d can be found from 1 d 0 85 l the experimental data obtained can be compared to existing guidelines and previous studies as shown in fig 6 in order to plot the burial protection index bpi recommendations some assumptions had to be made a bpi of 2 is stated to give protection against 2 tonne anchors implying an ac 14 fluke length of 1 58 m whereas a bpi of 3 applies to anchors of all but the largest ships assumed to indicate a ship mass of approximately 200 000 tonnes utilising the largest ac 14 anchor with a weight of 21 75 tonnes and a fluke length of 3 47 m it was also assumed that no interpolation would be carried out between these protection states of the existing guidelines for example protection against a 4 tonne anchor would require bpi 3 the linear graphs of mole et al 1997 shown in fig 2 were also extrapolated where necessary to reach bpi 3 it can be seen that the data from the experiments are generally in agreement with the existing data showing anchor penetration values similar to those predicted by nakamura et al 1992 and falling below the design guidance of mole et al 1997 fig 2 for coarse sand though above that for fine sand the hostun sand used in these experiments has a particle size of 470 μm haigh et al 2012 so would be classified as a medium sand by bs 1377 mole et al 1997 s design guidance for burial depths in fine sands thus looks very unconservative whereas the coarse sand guidance looks appropriate for all sands albeit overconservative for small fluke lengths as discussed earlier the substantial difference in the design guidance for fine and coarse sands is also difficult to reconcile with soil mechanics principles the obvious outlier on this figure is the datapoint for the tennet field trials reported by drews and maushake 2014 which shows anchor penetration depths of approximately 30 of those expected from other studies while it is possible that the soil at this north sea site was exceptionally hard limiting the penetration it is also possible that the geometry of pull or method of measuring penetration based on the anchor track in the tennet tests may have artificially reduced anchor penetration data 3 2 impact of sand density in order to investigate the effects of relative density on anchor penetration a series of seven tests was carried out at 20 g prototype 225 kg anchor 0 76 m fluke length with relative densities between 10 and 74 the final penetration depths in which are shown in fig 7 as a function of relative density while high stresses could cause the sand to densify the stresses in the centrifuge are insufficient for any plastic volumetric strain to be caused and no sign of surface settlement was observed after the tests so it is assumed that the relative density at placement is unchanged during the testing the results from these tests show that denser sand will lead to a shallower final penetration depth due to the sand s higher peak friction angle as a result of dilatancy this data can hence be re interpreted to link anchor penetration to sand friction angle allowing the use of the same data for sands with different strength characteristics from bolton s stress dilatancy equation equation 2 bolton 1986 values of peak friction angles for the hostun sand can be calculated 2 peak crit 3 i r 3 i c i d 1 3 i c ln σ c p this formula implies that the peak friction angle is a function of both the relative density of the soil i d and also the relative crushability i c which is itself a function of the confining stress p and the crushing strength of the soil grains σ c 20 mpa for quartz sands as shown by equation 3 the critical state friction angle is taken as 35 and the buoyant unit weight of the sand as 6 kn m3 giving an effective confining stress at 0 664 m depth the deepest penetration depth observed in the tests of 4 kpa the peak friction angles for the range of relative densities tested is calculated as 35 47 covering the expected range of friction angles that might be observed for marine sands it can be seen that the anchor penetration shows a decreasing trend with increasing sand density or peak friction angle and that this can be modelled with an approximately linear relationship while this relationship has a strong correlation r2 0 72 the effect is relatively minor with anchor penetration only reducing by 9 between relative densities of 10 and 70 whilst this difference is not negligible it is expected to be insignificant when deciding on cable burial depths as a result measuring the sand properties at the location of cable burial is deemed to be unnecessary this would be a costly and time consuming process that would lead to minimal difference in the suggested burial depth it might thus be appropriate to ignore this effect in design unless extremely high sand densities are anticipated 3 3 impact of sand particle size the existing guidance from mole et al 1997 advises different burial depths depending on whether the sand is coarse or fine fig 2 however as discussed previously the sand particle size should have little effect on penetration depth as the sand should behave as a continuum to investigate this a test was carried out using fraction b sand which has particles ten times larger than the hostun sand used for the other tests but similar friction angle by calculating the relative density of the coarse sand this result was added to the graph of relative density against penetration depth as the triangle in fig 7 the coarse sand test showed very similar penetration depth to those in fine sand at the same relative density while only one coarse sand test was carried out the results were nearly identical suggesting that particle size as expected does not have an impact on penetration depth of the anchor in sand 3 4 implications to practice the anchor penetration results from this study can be used to provide design guidance for the burial of offshore cables the guidance will provide an advised burial depth for cables in sand in relation to the size of the anchors expected to be present in the cable vicinity the proposed burial depth will not vary based on properties of the sand such as density critical state friction angle and particle size as these were seen to have only a minor impact on the anchor penetration the experimental results give the anchor penetration depth rather than a design cable burial depth therefore the advised burial depths will be greater than the results gained to give a margin of safety between the tip of the anchor fluke and the cable this safety margin will allow for variations in the level of the seabed different anchor types and potential under ploughing during burial for clarity the guideline will display both the predicted anchor penetration depth and the advised cable burial depth with the safety margin added the results were extrapolated for the full range of ac 14 anchor sizes and a 0 4 m safety margin was added to the experimental results to produce the design guideline this is deemed to be a suitable margin of safety between the fluke tip and the cable to allow for variations in environment and installation without incurring large excess costs operators of subsea infrastructure should however take into consideration the local seabed landforms when designing the burial depth and provide sufficient coverage such that the burial depth begins at the lowest local landform elevation for example seabed dunes this guideline does not assess the potential for migration of seabed landforms or local scour which may occur to depths greater than the burial depths recommended here the design chart for selecting appropriate cable burial depths is shown in fig 8 the burial depths are provided in relation to three variables anchor fluke length anchor mass and ship mass correlated with anchor mass using the data in nakamura et al 1992 the use of the design chart requires only one of the above properties to identify the appropriate burial depth this new guideline is more straightforward to use and less ambiguous than previous guidance including the mole et al 1997 chart the new guideline is anticipated to contribute to a decrease in anchor damage to buried subsea cable infrastructure 4 conclusions centrifuge modelling has been used to investigate the penetration of anchors into sandy seabeds in order to propose guidance on appropriate cable burial depths it has been shown that while existing guidance is approximately correct various issues with its application are unnecessarily difficult to apply and that a more rational design guidance can be produced the design chart shown in fig 8 will allow safe burial of cables in sandy seabeds for a wide variety of

but the largest ships a more useful metric would be the size of anchor against which the cable is protected overall while the chart is an improvement on the previous approach of a single deep burial requirement applied to all types of cables a more scientific approach to the problem could generate guidance which is more directly linked to shipping traffic expected above the cable 1 1 existing

resulting in huge savings in cable burial costs while these tests were not extensive the sands in this area are largely representative of sandy soils elsewhere these tests hence indicate that current design guidance is likely to be overly conservative in sandy soils nakamura et al 1992 presented penetration depths of anchors in different soils based on anchor weight table 1 the results were used

squared and so a model can be scaled precisely by controlling the speed of rotation further details of the principles of centrifuge modelling and its associated scaling laws can be found in schofield 1980 and madabhushi 2014 in this project the cambridge university minidrum centrifuge barker 1998 was used this drum centrifuge consists of a circular channel 1 m in diameter in which a soil model can

cable geometry in practice where the self weight of the chain rode attached to the anchor causes the pull at the anchor padeye to be horizontal assisting with penetration of the anchor while it is being deployed in practical situations increasing the anchor pull from the ship will lift the rode resulting in the pull on the anchor becoming more vertical eventually leading to anchor pull out this will however lead to shallower anchor penetration and is thus less critical for adequate burial of cables and pipelines than the horizontal pull scenario 3 results and discussion during testing the

on the size of the ship that it belongs to with larger ships requiring larger anchors to give sufficiently high holding power it is therefore important that the relationship between anchor size and maximum penetration depth is known in order to protect cables from the sizes of anchors used in the surrounding area variation of penetration depth with anchor size was investigated by completing centrifuge tests at varying g levels allowing simulation of different anchor sizes with the same model from the scaling laws presented by madabhushi 2014 it is known that the prototype length can be found by multiplying the model length by the g level tests carried out at varying g levels between 20 g and 80 g with the same ac 14 model anchor 38 mm fluke length thus allowed prototype anchors with fluke lengths between 0 76 m and 3 04 m to be modelled the results of these tests are summarised in table 3 sand was prepared to a relative density of approximately 50 for all three g levels the test at 20 g was duplicated to assess the repeatability of the method ac 14 anchors are available with weights between 180 kg and 21 75 tonnes and fluke lengths ranging from 0 7 m to 3 5 m the experiments described here thus cover almost the entire range of possible anchor sizes and predict a maximum penetration depth of 2 9 m in sand for the largest ac 14 anchor available the data suggest that the relationship between anchor fluke length l and penetration depth d can be found from 1 d 0 85 l the experimental data obtained can be compared to existing guidelines and previous studies as shown in fig 6 in order to plot the burial protection index bpi recommendations some assumptions had to be made a bpi of 2 is stated to give protection against 2 tonne anchors implying an ac 14 fluke length of 1 58 m whereas a bpi of 3 applies to anchors of all but the largest ships assumed to indicate a ship mass of approximately 200 000 tonnes utilising the largest ac 14 anchor with a weight of 21 75 tonnes and a fluke length of 3 47 m it was also assumed that no interpolation would be carried out between these protection states of the existing guidelines for example protection against a 4 tonne anchor would require bpi 3 the linear graphs of mole et al 1997 shown in fig 2 were also extrapolated where necessary to reach bpi 3 it can be seen that the data from the experiments are generally in agreement with the existing data showing anchor penetration values similar to those predicted by nakamura et al 1992 and falling below the design guidance of mole et al 1997 fig 2 for coarse sand though above that for fine sand the hostun sand used in these experiments has a particle size of 470 μm haigh et al 2012 so would be classified as a medium sand by bs 1377 mole et al 1997 s design guidance for burial depths in fine sands thus looks very unconservative whereas the coarse sand guidance looks appropriate for all sands albeit overconservative for small fluke lengths as discussed earlier the substantial difference in the design guidance for fine and coarse sands is also difficult to reconcile with soil mechanics principles the obvious outlier on this figure is the datapoint for the tennet field trials reported by drews and maushake 2014 which shows anchor penetration depths of approximately 30 of those expected from other studies while it is possible that the soil at this north sea site was exceptionally hard limiting the penetration it is also possible that the geometry of pull or method of measuring penetration based on the anchor track in the tennet tests may have artificially reduced anchor penetration data 3 2 impact of sand density in order to investigate the effects of relative density on anchor penetration a series of seven tests was carried out at 20 g prototype 225 kg anchor 0 76 m fluke length with relative densities between 10 and 74 the final penetration depths in which are shown in fig 7 as a function of relative density while high stresses could cause the sand to densify the stresses in the centrifuge are insufficient for any plastic volumetric strain to be caused and no sign of surface settlement was observed after the tests so it is assumed that the relative density at placement is unchanged during the testing the results from these tests show that denser sand will lead to a shallower final penetration depth due to the sand s higher peak friction angle as a result of dilatancy this data can hence be re interpreted to link anchor penetration to sand friction angle allowing the use of the same data for sands with different strength characteristics from bolton s stress dilatancy equation equation 2 bolton 1986 values of peak friction angles for the hostun sand can be calculated 2 peak crit 3 i r 3 i c i d 1 3 i c ln σ c p this formula implies that the peak friction angle is a function of both the relative density of the soil i d and also the relative crushability i c which is itself a function of the confining stress p and the crushing strength of the soil grains σ c 20 mpa for quartz sands as shown by equation 3 the critical state friction angle is taken as 35 and the buoyant unit weight of the sand as 6 kn m3 giving an effective confining stress at 0 664 m depth the deepest penetration depth observed in the tests of 4 kpa the peak friction angles for the range of relative densities tested is calculated as 35 47 covering the expected range of friction angles that might be observed for marine sands it can be seen that the anchor penetration shows a decreasing trend with increasing sand density or peak friction angle and that this can be modelled with an approximately linear relationship while this relationship has a strong correlation r2 0 72 the effect is relatively minor with anchor penetration only reducing by 9 between relative densities of 10 and 70 whilst this difference is not negligible it is expected to be insignificant when deciding on cable burial depths as a result measuring the sand properties at the location of cable burial is deemed to be unnecessary this would be a costly and time consuming process that would lead to minimal difference in the suggested burial depth it might thus be appropriate to ignore this effect in design unless extremely high sand densities are anticipated 3 3 impact of sand particle size the existing guidance from mole et al 1997 advises different burial depths depending on whether the sand is coarse or fine fig 2 however as discussed previously the sand particle size should have little effect on penetration depth as the sand should behave as a continuum to investigate this a test was carried out using fraction b sand which has particles ten times larger than the hostun sand used for the other tests but similar friction angle by calculating the relative density of the coarse sand this result was added to the graph of relative density against penetration depth as the triangle in fig 7 the coarse sand test showed very similar penetration depth to those in fine sand at the same relative density while only one coarse sand test was carried out the results were nearly identical suggesting that particle size as expected does not have an impact on penetration depth of the anchor in sand 3 4 implications to practice the anchor penetration results from this study can be used to provide design guidance for the burial of offshore cables the guidance will provide an advised burial depth for cables in sand in relation to the size of the anchors expected to be present in the cable vicinity the proposed burial depth will not vary based on properties of the sand such as density critical state friction angle and particle size as these were seen to have only a minor impact on the anchor penetration the experimental results give the anchor penetration depth rather than a design cable burial depth therefore the advised burial depths will be greater than the results gained to give a margin of safety between the tip of the anchor fluke and the cable this safety margin will allow for variations in the level of the seabed different anchor types and potential under ploughing during burial for clarity the guideline will display both the predicted anchor penetration depth and the advised cable burial depth with the safety margin added the results were extrapolated for the full range of ac 14 anchor sizes and a 0 4 m safety margin was added to the experimental results to produce the design guideline this is deemed to be a suitable margin of safety between the fluke tip and the cable to allow for variations in environment and installation without incurring large excess costs operators of subsea infrastructure should however take into consideration the local seabed landforms when designing the burial depth and provide sufficient coverage such that the burial depth begins at the lowest local landform elevation for example seabed dunes this guideline does not assess the potential for migration of seabed landforms or local scour which may occur to depths greater than the burial depths recommended here the design chart for selecting appropriate cable burial depths is shown in fig 8 the burial depths are provided in relation to three variables anchor fluke length anchor mass and ship mass correlated with anchor mass using the data in nakamura et al 1992 the use of the design chart requires only one of the above properties to identify the appropriate burial depth this new guideline is more straightforward to use and less ambiguous than previous guidance including the mole et al 1997 chart the new guideline is anticipated to contribute to a decrease in anchor damage to buried subsea cable infrastructure 4 conclusions centrifuge modelling has been used to investigate the penetration of anchors into sandy seabeds in order to propose guidance on appropriate cable burial depths it has been shown that while existing guidance is approximately correct various issues with its application are unnecessarily difficult to apply and that a more rational design guidance can be produced the design chart shown in fig 8 will allow safe burial of cables in sandy seabeds for a wide variety of

20511,the necessity of performing a detailed seismic fragility analysis of offshore wind turbines owts is well established in the wind power industry this paper presents a seismic fragility analysis for large scale monopile offshore wind turbines mowts considering ground motion directionality based on recommendations by the eurocode en 1993 1 6 dnvgl st 0126 and literature study the critical displacement rotation local buckling strength for structural components were proposed fragility curves under different angles of ground motion incidence were obtained by using the truncated incremental dynamic analysis tida and compared between the first scenario of the wind turbine parked in a calm sea and the second scenario of the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine the results show that ground motion directionality has obvious influence on the seismic fragility of the mowt wind and wave loads increase the probability of the mowt exceeding limit states and amplify the ground motion directionality effects on the structural fragility neglecting aerodynamic damping leads to an overestimation of the structural fragility the excessive displacement at the tower top local buckling at the bottom of the tower and in the monopile at the mudline section and tension fracture in the grouted connection are the critical failure modes of the mowt being subjected to earthquakes keywords monopile offshore wind turbine seismic fragility ground motion directionality load combination aerodynamic damping 1 introduction the use of renewable energy has been encouraged as many countries attempt to reduce their dependence on traditional fossil fuel energy and cut their carbon emissions as one of the most promising energy resources wind power has become a primary consideration following accelerated growth during the past few decades li et al 2015 vargas et al 2019 with the advantage of an abundant wind resource extensive available space for construction and little visual impact offshore wind power has received increasing attention and experienced significant growth during the last decade statistics by the global wind energy council show that the global installed offshore wind power capacity reached 35 3 gw at the end of 2020 an increase of 20 9 compared to the end of 2019 gwec 2021 the international energy agency predicted a global cumulative offshore wind capacity of up to 560 gw by 2040 in the sustainable development scenario iea 2019 with the growth in the offshore wind industry various wind farms have been constructed in seismically active areas such as the southeast coast of china the coast of japan and the west coast of the usa in these areas wind turbines are expected to be susceptible to damage caused by a combined excitation of seismic and environmental wind and wave loads industry code dnv os j101 dnv 2014 explicitly states that wind turbine structures targeted for installation in seismically active sites should be designed to withstand earthquake loads therefore it is necessary to study seismic performance to determine the reliability and safety of offshore wind turbines owts the seismic analysis for an owt must consider uncertainties from earthquake events including the ground motion intensity incident direction duration and structural capacity ground motion intensities of earthquake events are different from each other the ground motion incident direction at different measurement points varies with the relative position of the source and the propagation of the seismic wave ground motion intensity at a measurement point is not uniform in all directions due to the propagation characteristics of different types of seismic waves penzien and watabe 1974 wilson and button 1982 the uncertainty of structural capacity is derived from structural geometries materials boundary conditions katsanos et al 2016 leimeister and kolios 2018 etc these uncertainties make the seismic responses and damage of a wind turbine in an earthquake event a complicated probability problem most research about the seismic performance of wind turbines has focused on the structural responses hong 1984 investigated the dynamic behavior of a wind turbine blade subjected to seismic and turbulent wind excitation and concluded that the effect of turbulence on moment responses is greater than that of earthquakes if the system is stable bazeos et al 2002 performed static seismic and stability analyses of a prototype wind turbine steel tower prowell and veers 2009 lavassas et al 2003 and kaynia 2019 highlighted the consideration of seismic load as a part of the required load combination for wind turbines in areas with a high seismic hazard díaz and suárez 2014 showed that only the first two tower modes in the fore aft fa and side to side ss were mostly excited when a wind turbine subjected to earthquakes the influences of soil structure interaction ssi have been analyzed by austin and jerath 2017 zhao and maiβer 2006 yang et al 2019a b ju and huang 2019 yang et al 2019a b and sapountzakis et al 2015 the results showed that the seismic dynamic responses of wind turbines were significantly influenced by the ssi the effects of aerodynamic damping on the seismic responses of wind turbines have been studied by valamanesh and myers 2014 stamatopoulos 2013 and prowell et al 2014 they showed that aeroelastic damping reduces the earthquake responses of the structure santangelo et al 2016 studied the implementation of uncoupled analysis for seismic and wind loads for a 5 mw wind turbine wang et al 2019 and yu et al 2015 performed seismic centrifuge analyses for foundations of owts witcher 2005 and asareh 2015 showed that the scenario of earthquake coupling with the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine was the driving case in seismic response analysis hänler et al 2006 showed that higher tower modes were much more important in earthquake scenarios than normal operation scenarios zheng et al 2015 concluded that the joint earthquake and wave action was important for the proper evaluation of structural responses these structural response analyses provided structural capacity and or seismic demand for a specific wind turbine with a given earthquake event but no information about the uncertainties seismic fragility analysis is a powerful analytical tool for assessing seismic risk to evaluate the probabilistic seismic performance kennedy et al 1980 proposed the concept of seismic fragility analysis subsequently seismic fragility analysis became an active area of research in civil engineering and is considered the main component of the risk assessment procedure providing a measure of the safety margin for structural systems yuan et al 2017 studies have been conducted to investigate seismic fragility curves of bridges masanobu et al 2000 nielson and desroches 2007 frame buildings ramamoorthy et al 2006 and offshore platforms ajamy et al 2018 etc recently many studies have been conducted to investigate the fragility of wind turbines kim et al 2014 performed a seismic fragility analysis of owts considering nonlinear soil pile interactions in the analysis unidirectional seismic waves from a free field analysis were applied mardfekri and gardoni 2015 presented a multi hazard reliability assessment of owts and highlighted the consideration of seismic and hurricane loading for owts in seismically active and hurricane zones patil et al 2016 analyzed the structural performance of a parked wind turbine tower with a spread foot subjected to strong ground motions the results showed that the tower was most vulnerable to overturning asareh et al 2016a 2016b showed that earthquake loads had considerable effects on the design and analysis of wind turbines and the aerodynamic damping reduced the design demand loads mo et al 2017 studied the seismic fragility of a 5 mw monopile offshore wind turbine mowt in different operational conditions it was shown that the wind turbine in the normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected to earthquake was more susceptible to damage than that of the wind turbine in other operation conditions avossa et al 2017 investigated the vulnerability of a 5 mw land based wind turbine subjected to wind and earthquake it was concluded that the fragility of the wind turbine for seismic loads acting in the fa direction was slightly higher than that of the seismic loads acting in the ss directions yuan et al 2017 showed that the baseline control system reduced the fragility of large scale wind turbines when an earthquake occurs de risi et al 2018 concluded that monopile supported owts were particularly vulnerable to extreme crustal and interface earthquakes fan et al 2018 showed that near field earthquakes were more harmful than far field earthquakes for a 65 kw wind turbine tower with a longitude of 21 9 m hemmati et al 2019 presented fragility reduction for owts using a tuned liquid column damper tlcd ali et al 2020 investigated the vulnerability of owts subjected to pulse and non pulse ground motions cao et al 2020 presented a fragility analysis of a prestressed segmental concrete tower for wind turbines martín del campo and pozos estrada 2020 analyzed the multi hazard fragility of wind turbines considering the seismic environmental conditions in the southwest of mexico most previous studies assumed a component of ground motion exciting the wind turbine in the fa direction or a bi directional horizontal ground motion exciting the wind turbine in the fa and ss directions however it has been shown in the literature on the seismic performance of building frames and bridges that the direction of ground motion incidence significantly influences the structural responses mavronicola et al 2020 noori et al 2019 pinzón et al 2020 wang and dong 2011 studied the effect of ground motion direction on the dynamic responses of a vestas 2 mw v80 wind turbine tower the results showed that a 90 angle between the ground motion incident direction and the concentrated eccentric mass direction of the wind turbine was the most unfavorable direction of ground motion excitation tran et al 2020 showed that the structural responses of an owt varied with the incident direction of ground motions they concluded that the orthogonal directions of earthquakes should be reviewed in the principal directions of the owt mo et al 2021 showed that the structural responses of a 5 mw mowt were significantly affected by the angle of ground motion incidence the objective of this study is to analyze the seismic fragility of large scale mowts and evaluate the effect of ground motion directionality the case study involves a 5 mw baseline wind turbine supported by a monopile foundation to be installed in a wind farm in the east china sea two scenarios are analyzed including 1 the wind turbine parked in a

the influence of aerodynamic damping are analyzed in section 5 finally concluding remarks are summarized in section 6 2 model description and seismic fragility methodology 2 1 wind turbine model 2 1 1 structural model a 5 mw mowt to be installed in a wind farm in the east china sea is used as an example for this study the mowt is exactly the same as that in the authors previous studies mo et al 2017 2018 2021 the wind turbine is the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 the monopile foundation is 81 m long with a penetration of 57 5 m into the seabed 6 0 m in diameter and 45 80 mm in thickness a conical grouted connection gc without shear key is used to fix the transition piece to the top of the pile the base flange is 10 m above the mean water level mwl the mean water depth of the site is 18 5 m a schematic diagram of the mowt and the soil profile of the site is shown in fig 1 a summary of the main properties of the mowt is provided in table 1 the three dimensional 3d finite element fe model of the mowt is developed using the opensees program version 3 2 1 mckenna et al 2006 since the fe model in the present study is exactly the same as that in the authors previous study mo et al 2021 the numerical modeling is only briefly introduced herein for more detailed information about the fe model see ref mo et al 2021 the rotor including the three blades and the hub is simplified as lumped at the gravity center ignoring the influence of the blades on the dynamic response of the structure the nacelle is modeled as a lump mass at the center of mass of the nacelle very stiff beam columns behaving as rigid elements are used to couple the rotor and nacelle to the tower top and transfer loads of the rotor and the nacelle to the tower the yaw and pitch of the hub and nacelle system are neglected the monopile and tower both are modeled using displacement based beam column dispbeamcolumn elements the gc is simplified as elastic beam column elements neglecting the layer organization of the inner pile grout and transition piece to improve the astringency of the numerical model the bending stiffness compressive stiffness torsional stiffness and the mass of the beam column are calculated as the sum of the stiffness and the mass of the inner pile grouted layer and transition piece according to industry code gb 50936 2014 standardization administration of the p r c 2014 it should be noted that the grouted layer and the bonded contact between different structural material layers may suffer from fracture and failure before the buckling of the integral gc s beam column elements however the numerical simulation of the fracture and failure of the grouted layer and bonded contact between different structural material layers needs a detailed fe model and the seismic dynamic analysis of the fe model is computational expensive instead of simulating the fracture and failure of the grouted layer and the bonded contact in the gc this study used an analytical method to assess the damage of the gc as a compromise of the computational effort the analytical damage assessment method will be discussed in section 4 the ssi of the foundation is modeled using the beam on nonlinear winkler foundation yankelevsky et al 1989 soil liquefaction during earthquake is neglected p y x t z and q z springs are used to model the pile soil interaction in the lateral vertical and tip of the pile respectively the torsion boundary of the monopile is simplified as rotational constrained at the tip of the pile since the torsional load is relatively small as the direction of winds and waves is assumed alignment the constitutive behavior of the p y p x t z and q z springs are modeled using uniaxial material pysimple1 pysimple1 tzsimple1 and qzsimple1 boulanger and davis 2010 respectively the q345 steel standardization administration of the p r c 2018 is selected as the basic steel material for the monopile the tower and the nacelle assembly properties are listed in table 2 the elastic and plastic of the steel material is modeled using a steel 01 material model with kinematic hardening filippou and mazzoni 2020 in the immersing section of the monopile and gc hydraulic added mass feyzollahzadeh et al 2016 maniaci and li 2011 newman 1977 is used to model the interaction between the pile and sea water the additional tributary mass of water is calculated as the mass of water in the hollow of the pile plus the mass of water accelerated around the pile mo et al 2018 2021 shi et al 2013 an added mass coefficient of 1 0 for the accelerated water around the pile was used in the numerical model for a cylinder section according to newman 1977 the mesh size of the monopile in the section embedded into the seabed was 1 0 m and 1 5 m in other sections and the tower p y p x and t z springs were distributed along the pile below the mudline with an interval of 1 m while a q z spring was used at the pile tip fig 2 sketches the fe model of the mowt the natural frequencies of the mowt model are presented in table 3 2 1 2 wind and wave loads the mowt in the oceanic environment subjects to winds and waves the wind loads on the mowt are influenced by the wind velocity and the operational strategy parked or in normal operation of the wind turbine in cases of the wind turbine in parked conditions the wind loads on the wind turbine are small due to a small cross section of the wind turbine structures and a low relative velocity between the structure and the airflow in cases of the wind turbine in normal operation the sweeping blades introduce large wind forces on the rotor and the wind loads are influenced by the wind velocity the control strategies of the generation system the pitch angle of the blades and the yaw of the rotor the wave loads on the monopile foundation are influenced by the water depth and sea states in the current study the wind and wave loads on the mowt were calculated using the openfast program national renewable energy laboratory 2021 a multi physics multi fidelity tool for simulating the coupled dynamic response of wind turbines in the openfast a module called aerodyn is used to realize a time history aero elastic simulation of the wind turbine in steady and turbulent wind fields generated by turbsim software jonhkman and kilcher 2012 which is an external stochastic full field turbulent wind simulation program developed by nrel in the aerodyn module aerodynamic forces on the blades are calculated using the blade element momentum theory bem moriarty and hansen 2005 a module named hydrodyn is used to calculate the wave forces acting on the monopile foundation the hydrodyn generates waves analytically for finite depth using first order linear airy or first plus second order wave theory according to the inputted wave spectrum jonkman et al 2015 and the wave forces on the monopile are calculated using the strip theory solution by morison equation morison et al 1950 the detailed simulation techniques are referred to openfast documentation aerodyn theory manual moriarty and hansen 2005 national renewable energy laboratory 2021 and hydrodyn theory manual jonkman et al 2015 for the sake of brevity they are not expended in this paper 2 2 analytical seismic fragility methodology a fragility function specifies a structure s probability of damage failure or some other limit state of interest as a function of ground motion intensity measure baker 2015 seismic fragility of an owt can be defined as the conditional probability of a structural demand d of the owt to reach or exceed the structural capacity c at a given excitation intensity of ground motion according to kennedy et al 1980 assuming that both the structural capacity and the demand of an owt follow a lognormal distribution the seismic fragility of the owt can be described by lognormal probability distribution and mathematically expressed as baker 2015 1 f r a g i l i t y p d c i m a φ ln a ζ β where ф is the standard normal cumulative distribution function im is the ground motion intensity measure a represents an arbitrary ground motion intensity ζ is the median of the fragility function and represents the median value of ground motion index at which the owt reaches the threshold of limit state d β represents the dispersion of log standard deviation of im generating a fragility curve for an owt requires estimation of the parameters ζ and β these two parameters are usually derived from structural response analysis results rather than empirical data since very limited damage failure data for owts is publicly available and failure events are expected to be rare baker and cornell 2006 there are a number of methods to estimate the values of the parameters ζ and β baker 2015 baker and cornell 2006 masanobu et al 2000 ramamoorthy et al 2006 shome 1999 in the current study truncated incremental dynamic analysis tida baker 2015 is used as a compromise between the computation efforts and the selection of ground motion in tida dynamic response analysis of the owt is performed up to a desired ground motion intensity level im max to relate the structural demand to the ground motion intensity the maximum likelihood method is used to approach the likelihood of observing the data that were observed and estimate the values of ζ and β according to eq 1 the likelihood that an arbitrary ground motion causes damage to the owt at im i is the normal distribution probability density function as outlined in eq 2 2 l f φ ln i m i ζ β where φ denotes the standard normal distribution probability density function the likelihood that a given ground motion can be scaled to im max without causing damage to the owt can be expressed as 3 l n f 1 φ ln i m i ζ β for a suite of n ground motions the likelihood of an observation that m ground motions cause the owt damage at im levels lower than im max and n m ground motions do not cause structure damage prior to the analysis being stopped is calculated as eq 4 by assuming that the im i value for each ground motion is independent 4 l i 1 m φ ln i m i ζ β 1 φ ln i m max ζ β n m where π i 1 m is the product over i values from 1 to m using eq 4 the parameters ζ and β are obtained by varying the values until the likelihood function is maximized expressed as 5 ζ ˆ β ˆ argmax ζ β j 1 m ln φ ln i m i ζ β n m ln 1 φ ln i m max ζ β where ζ ˆ and β ˆ are the estimates of ζ and β in general the procedure for constructing seismic fragility curves is summarized as 1 select a suite of earthquake records 2 perform a truncated incremental dynamic simulation to obtain the structural demand 3 define damage critical levels and solve eq 5 for the likelihood of the realization of ζ and β 4 finally derive fragility curves using eq 1 for damage probability elevation 3 ground motion selection and limit state definition 3 1 ground motion selection to fully consider the uncertainties of ground motion a suite of 50 ground motion records was selected for nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis of the mowt the suite included a set of 22 far field records and a set of 28 near field records each consisting of two horizontal components these ground motion records were selected from the ground motions recommended by the federal emergency management agency fema based on eight fundamental principles i e source magnitude source type site condition site source number of records per event strongest ground motion records strong motion instrument capability and strong motion instrument location applied technology council 2009 detailed acceleration information of each ground motion record was obtained from the database of the pacific earthquake engineering research center peer 2011 the 22 far field records were taken from 14 events with magnitudes ranging from m6 5 to m7 6 with an average magnitude of m7 0 the minimum site source distance was 11 1 km the maximum distance was 26 4 km and the average distance was 16 4 km the peak ground accelerations pgas vary from 0 21 g to 0 82 g with an average of 0 43 g the 28 near field records were taken from 14 events with magnitudes ranging from m6 5 to m7 9 with an average magnitude of m7 0 the site source distances were in a range of 1 7 8 8 km with a medium of 4 2 km the pgas vary from 0 22 g to 1 43 g with an average of 0 6 g table 4 summarizes the detailed information of the 50 ground motion records fig 3 provides the 5 damped square root of sum of the squares pseudo spectral acceleration and the target spectrum of the site calculated according to api rp 2eq 2014 api 2014 earthquake induced ground motion produces horizontal translational accelerations which are recorded in two orthogonal components usually in the south north and east west directions penzien and watabe 1974 traditionally the two as recorded horizontal components of ground motion acceleration are applied in the fa and ss directions denoted as fs bi dictional excitation in owt seismic analysis in this study the two as recorded horizontal acceleration components are rotated and resolved along the centerline of the tower to account for different incidence angles as shown in fig 4 the rotated horizontal pairs of the ground motion accelerations are input into the fe model for dynamic analysis it is assumed that the wind and wave forces are in alignment and acting in the fa direction parallel to x axis pointing downwind the rotated input ground motions á x t θ and á y t θ were derived from the linear combination of the two horizontal as recorded components wilson and button 1982 a x t and a y t as shown in eq 6 and eq 7 each ground motion record is rotated to produce thirty six angles of seismic incidence θ i e 0 θ 360 with increments of 10 it should be noted that the methodology of rotating ground motion acceleration is the same as that in the authors previous study mo et al 2021 6 a x t θ a x t cos θ a y t sin θ 7 a y t θ a x t sin θ a y t cos θ 3 2 limit state definition a limit state defines the threshold beyond which a structural component no longer satisfies one of its performance objectives it indicates a damage failure mode of the structure in fragility analysis it is necessary to define the limit state for each kind of structure component since the performance objective and the capacity of different structural components are different the mowt is a high rise structure with a large diameter rotor rotating at the free end of the cantilever a previous study by the authors about the seismic response of mowts showed that the top of the tower experienced the largest displacement and rotation and the mudline section of the monopile was subjected to the largest bending moment excessive displacement and rotation at the top of the tower leads to a loss of efficiency in power generation and potentially results in a collision between the blades and the tower mo et al 2017 on the other hand the large forces may lead to the yield or bulking of the monopile foundation and tower also the gc can be a critical structural element for the low tension strength of the grouted material and a high stress concentration factor dnv gl 2016 mo et al 2018 the focus of this study is on the safety of the generator and the stability of the mowt and to this end the displacement and

properties of the gc were taken from mo et al 2018 as shown in table 5 in summary the maximum displacement at the top of the tower dis tt and the maximum rotation at the top of the tower rot tt associated with an emergency shutdown of the generator and a potential collision between the blades and tower are defined as limit states for the safety of the generator the local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section and at the bottom of the tower are defined as limit states for the stability of the monopile and the tower the maximum tensile stress of the grouted material σ tg is defined as the limit state for the reliability of the gc the analyzed limit states are summarized in table 6 4 study cases and incremental dynamic analysis 4 1 study cases the seismic response of a mowt is influenced by the environmental conditions and the control strategy of the turbine yuan et al 2017 showed that wind turbines in normal operation with the baseline control system working were less prone to damage than wind turbines in parked conditions witcher 2005 asareh et al 2016b and mo et al 2017 mo et al 2021 showed that the seismic dynamic response of wind turbines in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine is more pronounced than that of wind turbines for other wind speeds in this study two scenarios are analyzed as shown in table 7 in the first scenario denoted as wtp the wind turbine was parking in a calm sea with windless when earthquake striking in this scenario the mowt subjected to earthquake alone in the second scenario denoted as wto the wind turbine was in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine when earthquake striking and a random sea state of a five year return waves of the wind farm was considered in this scenario the mowt subjected to a combination of earthquake wind and wave loads the seismic dynamic response of the wind turbine in the two scenarios has been investigated in the authors previous study mo et al 2021 it was shown that the structural responses are significantly influenced by the directionality of the earthquake ground motion 4 2 incremental dynamic analysis numerical simulations are performed to obtain the seismic responses and the structural demands of the mowt for the wto scenario a two step procedure is used to approach the dynamic responses of the mowt under coupled wind wave and seismic loads in the first step the openfast program is used to derive the wind and wave loads acting on the mowt three dimensional 3d wind fields with a 1460 s duration and a 155 0 m grid height and gird width which encompasses the entire rotor disk and an additional space for structural vibration are generated by the turbsim program the reference wind speed was defined at the hub height and is set to 12 0 m s a little bit higher than the rated wind speed of the turbine of 11 4 m s as a compensation for the turbulent wind a meteorological boundary condition of kaimal spectrum with iec 61400 3 turbulence model turbulence characteristic b and normal turbulence type is considered the detailed expression of the wind spectrum and turbulence model is referred to references iec 2005 jonhkman and kilcher 2012 linear irregular first order waves are generated internally within the hydrodyn model using the jonswap spectrum iec 2009 jonkman et al 2015 the direction of winds and waves are assumed to align and point to downwind of the rotor as shown in fig 4 the airfoil properties supported structural properties geometric sizes and stiffness and control strategies of the control and electrical system were given to the openfast along with 1460 s turbulent wind fields coupled nonlinear aero hydro servo elastic simulation in the time domain were performed with a time step of 0 005 s the wind forces on the rotor and tower and the wave forces on the monopile from 800 s to 1000 s were extracted for the structural dynamic analysis and eliminating the initial transient behavior of the wind turbine in the second step the wind and wave loads and earthquake ground motion accelerations were applied to the opensees fe model for dynamic analyses the interaction effect of wind and wave loads and the dynamic response of the mowt are neglected damping of the mowt is accounted for and modeled using the rayleigh damping in the fe model analyses in the wtp scenario a total damping ratio of 1 47 which consists a value of 0 3 structural material damping η struc 0 8 soil damping η soil and 0 37 hydrodynamic damping η hydro was considered according to mo et al 2021 the aerodynamic damping was neglected in the wto scenario aerodynamic damping was added to the numerical simulation and two aerodynamic damping models were considered details of the two aerodynamic damping models are analyzed in section 5 2 as mentioned earlier the as recorded ground motion accelerations are rotated from 0 to 360 with intervals of 10 to investigate the effect of the ground motion incident direction pga was selected as the intensity measure for earthquake excitation the tida is performed from im 0 1 g up to im max 1 2 g with an interval of 0 1 g to acquire the structural demands for fragility analysis the rotated and scaled ground motion accelerations were applied for time history analysis dynamic analyses were performed in a 200 s duration with a basic iterative time step of 0 01 s in the wtp scenario the ground motions were applied at the start of the 20th second after the mowt model reached an initial gravity balance in the wto scenario the ground motions were applied at the start of the 120th second to eliminate the initial transient behavior of the wind turbine the wind and wave loads derived from turbulent winds and random waves are random the variation in the random seed results in the realization of different time series for the given wind speed and wave parameters this causes epistemic uncertainties during load and response computations dong et al 2012 in this study 50 monte carlo simulations of wind and wave time series were performed to reduce the uncertainty of the wind and wave loads each time series of wind and wave loads of the 50 monte carlo simulations was combined stochastically with a recorded earthquake in total more than 64800 dynamic simulations were performed with different earthquakes angles of ground motion incidence and wind and wave loads 5 results and discussion 5 1 wind turbine in parked condition fig 5 presents the dynamic responses displacement at the top of the tower dis tt rotation at the top of the tower rot tt bending moment in the monopile at the mudline section m pm bending moment at the bottom of the tower m tb and bending moment at the bottom of the gc m gc of the mowt subjected to the san fernando earthquake alone with different ground motion intensities fig 6 plots the maximum structural responses of the mowt excited by the san fernando earthquake alone with different pgas and angles of incidence as observed in fig 5 a b the mowt was forced to vibrate when earthquake striking the mowt suffers no ground motion loading post earthquake but the boundary constraints from the seabed and it vibrates freely with damping which makes the structural motion decayed gradually to a static equilibrium position the variation of the maximum structural responses see fig 6 shows that the dynamic responses of the mowt increase linearly with the pga when the ground motion intensity is lower than a critical threshold value 0 6 g for 0 angle of incidence it indicates that the mowt vibrates within the elastic range of the structure this also can be observed from fig 5 the dynamic responses of the mowt subjected to ground motions with pga 0 2 g and pga 0 4 g are similar in the tendency but different in the amplitude as the ground motion intensity going beyond the critical value the structural responses of the mowt increase nonlinearly with the pga it suggests that the mowt occurred plastic deformation this also can be observed from the dynamic responses of the mowt for a similar tendency and amplitude and a post earthquake permanent drift in the displacement and rotation at the top of the tower under pga 1 0 g and pga 1 2 g as shown in fig 5 as presented in fig 6 the structural responses of the mowt obtained from 70 to 250 angles of ground motion incidence are smaller than from other angles of incidence while the structural responses obtained from 160 to 320 angles of incidence are larger than from other angles of incidence this implies that the mowt is more likely to suffer damages when the san fernando earthquake ground motions are excited at 160 and 320 angles it also suggests that the bi directional horizontal ground motion exciting the mowt in the fa and ss directions fs bi directional excitation which corresponding to 0 angle of incidence as described in fig 4 does not necessarily produce the maximum structural responses over all the other incidence angles in general the ground motion incident direction has significant influence on the structural responses of the mowt fig 7 presents fragility curves of the mowt for different angles of ground motion incidence as was expected the angle of ground motion incidence has obvious influence on the structural fragility of the mowt since the directions of earthquake ground motions are unknown before an earthquake event structural fragility considering the uncertainties of ground motion direction is approximated using the structural demands of all thirty six angles of ground motion incidence and is denoted as uia curve in this study the uia curve is considered a reasonable prediction of the seismic fragility of the mowt since it contains information about the structural demands of different ground motion incident directions as shown in fig 7 the uia curve of the examined limit states predicts a median value of structural fragility over all the analyzed angles of incidence the fragility curve of 0 angle of incidence predicts a lower structural fragility than that of the uia curve it suggest that structural fragility analysis using the traditional fs bi directional excitation results in an underestimation as indicated in section 2 2 the median of the fragility function represents median value of ground motion index at which the mowt reaches the threshold of a limit state in this study statistical characteristics of the median of fragility functions among the thirty six angles of ground motion incidence of the examined limit states are used as a quantitative index for evaluating the effect of ground motion directionality on the structural vulnerability the ground motion incident direction under which the median of the fragility function receives the lowest value over all the other angles is defined as the critical incident direction θ critical the statistical characteristics i e the mean μ ζ the coefficient of variation cv ζ and the measure of dispersion md ζ of the median of the fragility function are calculated as 24 the mean μ ζ θ ζ θ n 25 the coefficient of variation c v ζ s ζ μ ζ θ ζ θ μ ζ 2 n 1 μ ζ 100 26 the measure of dispersion m d ζ max ζ θ min ζ θ μ ζ 100 where ζ θ is the median of the fragility function of the analyzed limit state for θ angle of ground motion incidence n 36 is the number of angles of incidence table 8 shows the obtained statistical characteristics of the median of fragility functions and the critical incident direction for the examined limit states it can be seen that the mean median fragility function for the limit state ls4 is 0 62 g the lowest among the five examined limit states it implies that the mowt reaches the threshold of local buckling at the bottom of the tower first with a mean ground motion intensity of 0 62 g as the ground motion intensity increases the mean median fragility function for the limit states ls3 ls5 and ls1 ranking the second to the fourth the mean median fragility function for the limit state ls2 is 0 84 g the highest it suggests the limit state of excessive rotation at the top of the tower requires a mean ground motion intensity of 0 84 g is the highest among the five examined limit states the maximum value of the measure of dispersion md ζ reaches 16 06 corresponding to the limit state ls1 while the minimum value of md ζ is 10 88 corresponding to the limit state ls3 the coefficient of variation cv ζ for different limit states falls in a range from 3 23 to 4 20 these high value of the measure of dispersion md ζ and coefficient of variation cv ζ indicate a high dispersion in the median of fragility functions with respect to the direction of ground motion incidence it implies that seismic fragility analysis using structural demands from a specific incident direction may result in a misestimation this can be observed from the variation of the structural fragility for different ground motion incident direction as shown fig 7 as shown in table 8 the critical incident angle for the limit state ls1 is 90 and the critical incident angle for the limit states ls2 ls5 is in a range of 220 240 it implies that the limit state of excessive displacement at top of the tower is sensitive to ground motions with a 90 angle of incidence the limit states of excessive rotation at the top of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section local buckling at the bottom of the tower and tension fracture in the gc are sensitive to ground motions with an angle of incidence ranges from 220 to 240 it can be concluded that ground motion directionality has a significant influence on the seismic fragility of the mowt in parked conditions subjected earthquakes the critical angle of ground motion incidence varies with the change of the defined limit states it suggests that ground motion directionality should be accounted for in seismic fragility analysis for mowts in parked conditions in order to analyze the vulnerability of the mowt in detail fragility curves of the examined limit states considering the uncertainty of ground motion incident direction uia curves are extracted and plotted in fig 7 to more clearly compare the damage modes of the mowt the pga for specified exceeding probabilities of 10 20 and 50 in different limit states are examined and shown in table 9 as shown in fig 7 pga 0 43 g is identified as a critical ground motion intensity in cases of the earthquake with a pga smaller than 0 43 g the limit state ls1 receives the highest exceeding probability among the five examined limit states however in cases of the earthquake with a pga larger than 0 43 g the limit state ls4 receives the highest exceeding probability this indicates that the damage of excessive displacement at the top of the tower is the most pronounced when the ground motion intensity is smaller than 0 43 g the damage of local buckling at the bottom of the tower is the most pronounced while the ground motion intensity is larger than 0 43 g this also can be observed from table 9 for the 10 exceeding probability the limit state ls1 requires the lowest ground motion intensity following is the limit state ls4 the limit states ls3 and ls4 ranks the third and the fourth respectively the limit state ls2 requires the highest ground motion intensity for the 20 and 50 exceeding probabilities the first four limit states requiring the lowest ground motion intensity are ls4 ls3 ls5 and ls1 this may be explained as an increase contribution of the high modes of the mowt to the force responses of the supported structures as the ground motion intensity increase the results suggest that excessive displacement at the top of the tower local buckling at the bottom of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline and tension fracture in the gc are the first four failure modes of the mowt in parked conditions subjected earthquakes 5 2 wind turbine in normal operation condition in cases of an earthquake occurring when the wind turbine is in normal operation the mowt is excited by a combination of ground motion winds and waves on the other hand the sweeping rotor introduces a high aerodynamic damping to the vibration system in the fa direction which mitigates the structural vibration liu et al 2017 mo et al 2021 yuan et al 2017 in the ss direction the aerodynamic damping is very small and can be neglected due to a small project area of the interaction surface between the rotor and the fluid koukoura et al 2015 valamanesh and myers 2014 xi et al 2020 the coupled earthquake wind and wave loading and aerodynamic damping make the dynamic responses of the mowt more complicated which results in a complex relationship between earthquake excitation and structural failure damage in the current study two aerodynamic damping models see table 10 adapted from ref mo et al 2021 were used to investigate the effect of aerodynamic damping on the seismic fragility of the mowt in the first model adm1 the aerodynamic damping was neglected in the fe model dynamic simulation it is out of the consideration that aerodynamic damping has been accounted for in the derivation of wind forces of the wind turbine in the openfast simulation moriarty and hansen 2005 this model has both conservative and unconservative aspects in the seismic responses under horizontal bi directional excitation when compared to a wind turbine with rotating blades when the blades are rotating they add about 3 40 aerodynamic damping in the fa direction liu et al 2017 the model does not have aerodynamic damping and therefore is conservative on the other hand it is unconservative in the ss direction since the rotating blades introduce little aerodynamic damping when vibrating in the ss direction in the second model adm2 the aerodynamic damping ratio is assumed equal to 3 40 koukoura et al 2015 liu et al 2017 valamanesh and myers 2014 which is the damping ratio of the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed vibrating in the fa direction this model is unconservative due to the fact that 1 the aerodynamic damping has been accounted for in the process of wind force derivation in openfast and 2 aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine in the other directions particularly in the ss direction is smaller than that of the fa direction fig 9 presents the dynamic responses dis tt rot tt m pm m tb and m gc of the mowt subjected to a combination of the san fernando earthquake wind and wave loads with the aerodynamic damping model adm1 for comparison the dynamic responses of the mowt subjected to the same wind and wave loads without ground motion are also plotted in the figure labelled as ww as observed being in normal operation the mowt was excited by wind and wave loads before earthquake when earthquake occurred the mowt vibrates around a basic drift derived by the wind and wave loads fig 10 plots the maximum structural responses of the mowt for different earthquake intensities and incident directions it can be seen that the angle of ground motion incidence has significant influence on the structural responses of the mowt the variation trend of the structural responses with respect to the ground motion intensity and incident direction is similar to that of the wind turbine in parked conditions as shown in fig 6 more specifically in cases of the earthquake with a small pga 0 5 g for 0 angle of incidence the structural responses of the mowt increase linearly with the increase of the ground motion intensity in cases of the earthquake with a large pga 0 5 g for 0 angle of incidence the structural responses of the mowt increase nonlinearly with the increases of the ground motion intensity due to the plastic response of the structure the structural responses of the mowt obtained from 60 to 250 angles of ground motion incidence are smaller than from other angles while the structural responses obtained from 140 to 340 angles of incidence are larger than from other angles a comparison of the structural responses of the mowt in parked conditions subjected to earthquakes figs 5 and 6 and in normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected earthquakes figs 9 and 10 shows that the seismic responses of the mowt in normal operation are larger than in the parked condition especially when the ground motion intensity is small it indicates that wind and wave loads increases the seismic responses of the mowt the obtained fragility curves for different limit states of the mowt subjected to a combination of earthquake winds and waves using the adm1 model denoted as wto adm1 scenario model for different ground motion incident angles are plotted in fig 11 table 11 gives the statistical characteristics of the median of fragility functions and the critical ground motion incident direction as shown in fig 11 the ground motion incident direction has significant influence on the structural fragility of the mowt the fragility curve of 0 angle of incidence predicts an obvious lower structural fragility than that of the uia curve it suggests that structural fragility analysis using the fs bi directional excitation results in a considerable underestimation table 11 shows that mean median fragility function for ls4 is 0 54 g the lowest among the five examined limit states the mean median fragility function for ls3 and ls5 is 0 59 g ranking the second the mean median fragility function for ls1 and ls2 ranking the third and the fourth respectively the measure of dispersion md ζ for different limit states is in a range from 10 10 to 24 45 while the coefficient of variation cv ζ varies from 2 56 to 5 86 these high values of md ζ and cv ζ indicate a high dispersion in the median of fragility functions with respect to the direction of ground motion incidence it indicates that assessment of the structural fragility of the mowt using the results of a specific ground motion incident direction leads to a misestimation this is similar to the scenario wtp as analyzed in section 5 1 it suggests that ground motion directionality should be accounted for in the fragility analysis for mowt in normal operation conditions a comparison of the statistical characteristics of the median of fragility functions of the wto adm1 model table 11 and the wtp scenario table 8 shows that the mean median fragility functions of the five examined limit states of the wto adm1 model is obviously smaller than that of the wtp scenario this indicates that the wind and wave loads significantly increase the seismic fragility of the mowt it suggest that the scenario of earthquake coupling with the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed is the driving case in seismic fragility analysis when compared to the scenario of earthquake coupling with the wind turbine in parked conditions this agrees with the results in witcher 2005 the value of md ζ and cv ζ of the wtp scenario is larger than that of the wtp adm1 model except the cases of md ζ for the limit state ls4 and cv ζ for the limit states ls4 and ls5 it implies that the wind and wave loads amplifies the effect of ground motion directionality on the seismic fragility of the mowt the critical angle of incidence for the limit states ls1 ls2 ls3 and ls5 is in a range from 40 to 70 and the critical angle of incidence for the limit state ls4 is 230 this is different from that of the scenario wpt as shown in table 8 it is because the wind and wave loads points to the downwind direction and contributes a basic structural response in the corresponding direction as plotted in figs 9 and 10 it suggests that the wind and wave loads also contribute to the critical angle of ground motion incidence it also indicates that the fs bi directional excitation does not produce the maximum exceeded probability over all other incidence angles for wind turbines in normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected to earthquakes fig 12 presents fragility curves of the mowt in the wto adm1 scenario considering the uncertainty of ground motion incident direction as observed a critical ground motion intensity is identified as pga 0 43 g in cases of the earthquake with a pga smaller than the critical ground motion intensity the limit state ls1 receives the highest exceeding probability among the five examined limit states in cases of the earthquake with a pga larger than the critical ground motion intensity the limit state ls4 receives the highest exceeding probability the results suggest that the mowt is susceptible to excessive displacement at the top of the tower local buckling at the bottom of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section and tension fracture in the grouted material in the gc this is similar to the wtp scenario as analyzed in section 5 1 and shown in fig 8 to analyze the effect of aerodynamic damping on the structural fragility the seismic fragility of the mowt in normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected to earthquakes using the aerodynamic model amd2 wto adm2 are calculated and plotted in fig 13 fig 14 presents the relative differences of the median of fragility functions of the mowt considering the uncertainties of ground motion direction for the wto adm1 model and the wto adm2 model table 12 provides the pgas for the 10 20 and 50 exceeding probabilities of different limit states as shown in fig 13 the fragility curves of the mowt for the wto adm2 model are similar in the tendency but different in the exceeding probability to that of the wto adm1 model see fig 12 more specifically a critical ground motion intensity of pga 0 56 g is identified this critical ground motion intensity is much higher than that of the wto adm1 model of 0 43 g in cases of the earthquake with a pga smaller than 0 56 g the limit state ls1 receives the highest exceeding probability among the five examined limit states in cases of the earthquake with a pga larger than 0 56 g the limit state ls4 is more pronounce than the other limit states it is observed that the wto adm2 model predicts a lower exceeding probability than the wto adm1 model this is also indicated in fig 14 and table 12 as shown in fig 14 the relative differences of the median of fragility functions of the wto adm2 model and the wto adm1 model fall in a range from 19 05 to 32 37 it means that the wto adm2 model requires a much higher ground motion intensity than the wto adm1 model to reach the threshold of the five examined limit states table 12 shows that the pgas for the 10 20 and 50 exceeding probabilities for the wto adm2 model are significantly higher than that of the wto adm1 model these imply that aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine significantly reduces the seismic fragility of the mowt it also indicates that the seismic fragility analyses of the mowt in normal operation conditions for ground motions exciting in the ss direction using the fa aerodynamic damping adm2 will result in a significant underestimation in contrast the seismic fragility analyses of the mowt in normal operation conditions for ground motion exciting in the fa direction neglecting the aerodynamic damping adm1 will result in an remarkable overestimation it can be concluded from another aspect that the aerodynamic damping amplifies the effect of ground motion directionality on seismic fragility of the mowt in normal operation conditions these results suggest that aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine and ground motion directionality should be accounted for in the seismic analysis of the mowt in normal operation conditions 6 conclusions seismic fragility of a 5 mw mowt was studied considering the effects of the directionality of ground motion a suite of 22 far field and 28 near field earthquake ground motions were selected and the horizontal pairs of the ground motion records were mathematically rotated to produce thirty six angles of incidence ranging from 0 to 360 with an increment of 10 a detailed fe model that consisted of different structural components of the wind turbine and the ssi was used to analyze the structural demands of the mowt subjected to earthquakes five limit states for the mowt were proposed based on the serviceability and ultimate limit states the tida method was applied to perform time history dynamic analysis and estimate fragility curves fragility of the wind turbine for two scenarios including 1 the wind turbine parking in a calm sea and 2 the wind turbine in normal operation at the rate wind speed were investigated the following significant conclusions were drawn 1 when wind turbines park in a calm sea situation the ground motion incident varies from 0 to 360 could lead to a 10 88 16 06 variation in the median of fragility functions for damage states of excessive displacement and rotation at the top of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section local buckling at the bottom of the tower and tension fracture in the gc the traditional horizontal bi directional ground motions exciting in the fa and ss directions led to a significant underestimation of the structural fragility the damage state of excessive displacement at the top of the tower was sensitive to ground motions with 90 angle of incidence and the damage states of local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section local buckling at the bottom of the tower tension fracture in the gc and excessive rotation at the top of the tower were sensitive to ground motions with an incidence angle of 220 240 the damage of excessive displacement at the top of the tower was the most pronounced when an earthquake with a pga smaller than 0 43 g the local buckling at the bottom of the tower was the most pronounced when the earthquake with a pga larger than 0 43 g 2 at the rated wind speed the wind and wave loads increased the seismic responses and the probability of exceeding a predefined limit states the ground motion directionality resulted in a 10 10 24 45 variation in the median of fragility functions the traditional analysis method of bi directional excitation in the fa and ss direction resulted in an obvious underestimation of the structural fragility the damage states of excessive displacement and rotation at the top of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section and tension fracture in the gc were sensitive to ground motions with an incident angle ranging from 40 to 70 the damage of local buckling at the bottom of the tower was sensitive to ground motions with 230 angle of incidence when an earthquake with the pga smaller than 0 43 g the damage of excessive displacement at the top of the tower was the most pronounced the damage of local buckling at the bottom of the tower was the most pronounced when the earthquake with a pga larger than 0 43 g 3 aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine obviously reduced the seismic fragility of the mowt in cases of the mowt in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine subjected to earthquakes the application of the fa aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine resulted in a 19 05 32 37 increment in the median of the fragility functions neglecting aerodynamic damping could result in a significant overestimation of structural fragility for the mowt in normal operation conditions subjected to earthquakes 4 excessive displacement at the top of the tower local buckling at the bottom of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section and tension fracture in the gc were identified as the first four failure modes of the mowt subjected to earthquakes the results of this study provide a significant insight into the seismic vulnerability of mowts it can be concluded that the directionality of the ground motion the wind and wave loads and the aerodynamic damping should be taken into account in seismic fragility analysis for mowts it should be noted that the seismic vulnerability of owts involves many aspects and this study constitutes a fundamental step in measuring seismic performance to ensure safety and reliability challenges still remain including the fluid structure interaction of the rotor the vibration control system and the aerodynamic damping of the rotor with respect to the vibration direction these require further investigation to provide a better

for large scale monopile offshore wind turbines mowts considering ground motion directionality based on recommendations by the eurocode en 1993 1 6 dnvgl st 0126 and literature study the critical displacement rotation local buckling strength for structural components were proposed fragility curves under different angles of ground motion incidence were obtained by using the truncated incremental dynamic analysis tida and compared between the first scenario of the wind turbine parked in a calm sea and the second scenario of the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine the results show that ground motion directionality has obvious influence on the seismic fragility of the mowt wind and wave loads increase the probability of the mowt exceeding limit states and amplify the ground motion directionality effects on the structural fragility neglecting aerodynamic damping leads to an overestimation of the structural fragility the excessive displacement at the tower top local buckling at the bottom of the tower and in the monopile at the mudline section and tension fracture in the grouted connection are the critical failure modes of the mowt being subjected to earthquakes keywords monopile offshore wind turbine seismic fragility ground motion directionality load combination aerodynamic damping 1 introduction the use of renewable energy has been encouraged as many countries attempt to reduce their dependence on traditional fossil fuel energy and cut their carbon emissions as one of the most promising energy resources wind power has become a primary consideration following accelerated growth during the past few decades li et al 2015 vargas et al 2019 with the advantage of an abundant wind resource extensive available space for construction and little visual impact offshore wind power has received increasing attention and experienced significant growth during the last decade statistics by the global wind energy council show that the global installed offshore wind power capacity reached 35 3 gw at the end of 2020 an increase of 20 9 compared to the end of 2019 gwec 2021 the international energy agency predicted a global cumulative offshore wind capacity of up to 560 gw by 2040 in the sustainable development scenario iea 2019 with the growth in the offshore wind industry various wind farms have been constructed in seismically active areas such as the southeast coast of china the coast of japan and the west coast of the usa in these areas wind turbines are expected to be susceptible to damage caused by a combined excitation of seismic and environmental wind and wave loads industry code dnv os j101 dnv 2014 explicitly states that wind turbine structures targeted for installation in seismically active sites should be designed to withstand earthquake loads therefore it is necessary to study seismic performance to determine the reliability and safety of offshore wind turbines owts the seismic analysis for an owt must consider uncertainties from earthquake events including the ground motion intensity incident direction duration and structural capacity ground motion intensities of earthquake events are different from each other the ground motion incident direction at different measurement points varies with the relative position of the source and the propagation of the seismic wave ground motion intensity at a measurement point is not uniform in all directions due to the propagation characteristics of different types of seismic waves penzien and watabe 1974 wilson and button 1982 the uncertainty of structural capacity is derived from structural geometries materials boundary conditions katsanos et al 2016 leimeister and kolios 2018 etc these uncertainties make the seismic responses and damage of a wind turbine in an earthquake event a complicated probability problem most research about the seismic performance of wind turbines has focused on the structural responses hong 1984 investigated the dynamic behavior of a wind turbine blade subjected to seismic and turbulent wind excitation and concluded that the effect of turbulence on moment responses is greater than that of earthquakes if the system is stable bazeos et al 2002 performed static seismic and stability analyses of a prototype wind turbine steel tower prowell and veers 2009 lavassas et al 2003 and kaynia 2019 highlighted the consideration of seismic load as a part of the required load combination for wind turbines in areas with a high seismic hazard díaz and suárez 2014 showed that only the first two tower modes in the fore aft fa and side to side ss were mostly excited when a wind turbine subjected to earthquakes the influences of soil structure interaction ssi have been analyzed by austin and jerath 2017 zhao and maiβer 2006 yang et al 2019a b ju and huang 2019 yang et al 2019a b and sapountzakis et al 2015 the results showed that the seismic dynamic responses of wind turbines were significantly influenced by the ssi the effects of aerodynamic damping on the seismic responses of wind turbines have been studied by valamanesh and myers 2014 stamatopoulos 2013 and prowell et al 2014 they showed that aeroelastic damping reduces the earthquake responses of the structure santangelo et al 2016 studied the implementation of uncoupled analysis for seismic and wind loads for a 5 mw wind turbine wang et al 2019 and yu et al 2015 performed seismic centrifuge analyses for foundations of owts witcher 2005 and asareh 2015 showed that the scenario of earthquake coupling with the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine was the driving case in seismic response analysis hänler et al 2006 showed that higher tower modes were much more important in earthquake scenarios than normal operation scenarios zheng et al 2015 concluded that the joint earthquake and wave action was important for the proper evaluation of structural responses these structural response analyses provided structural capacity and or seismic demand for a specific wind turbine with a given earthquake event but no information about the uncertainties seismic fragility analysis is a powerful analytical tool for assessing seismic risk to evaluate the probabilistic seismic performance kennedy et al 1980 proposed the concept of seismic fragility analysis subsequently seismic fragility analysis became an active area of research in civil engineering and is considered the main component of the risk assessment procedure providing a measure of the safety margin for structural systems yuan et al 2017 studies have been conducted to investigate seismic fragility curves of bridges masanobu et al 2000 nielson and desroches 2007 frame buildings ramamoorthy et al 2006 and offshore platforms ajamy et al 2018 etc recently many studies have been conducted to investigate the fragility of wind turbines kim et al 2014 performed a seismic fragility analysis of owts considering nonlinear soil pile interactions in the analysis unidirectional seismic waves from a free field analysis were applied mardfekri and gardoni 2015 presented a multi hazard reliability assessment of owts and highlighted the consideration of seismic and hurricane loading for owts in seismically active and hurricane zones patil et al 2016 analyzed the structural performance of a parked wind turbine tower with a spread foot subjected to strong ground motions the results showed that the tower was most vulnerable to overturning asareh et al 2016a 2016b showed that earthquake loads had considerable effects on the design and analysis of wind turbines and the aerodynamic damping reduced the design demand loads mo et al 2017 studied the seismic fragility of a 5 mw monopile offshore wind turbine mowt in different operational conditions it was shown that the wind turbine in the normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected to earthquake was more susceptible to damage than that of the wind turbine in other operation conditions avossa et al 2017 investigated the vulnerability of a 5 mw land based wind turbine subjected to wind and earthquake it was concluded that the fragility of the wind turbine for seismic loads acting in the fa direction was slightly higher than that of the seismic loads acting in the ss directions yuan et al 2017 showed that the baseline control system reduced the fragility of large scale wind turbines when an earthquake occurs de risi et al 2018 concluded that monopile supported owts were particularly vulnerable to extreme crustal and interface earthquakes fan et al 2018 showed that near field earthquakes were more harmful than far field earthquakes for a 65 kw wind turbine tower with a longitude of 21 9 m hemmati et al 2019 presented fragility reduction for owts using a tuned liquid column damper tlcd ali et al 2020 investigated the vulnerability of owts subjected to pulse and non pulse ground motions cao et al 2020 presented a fragility analysis of a prestressed segmental concrete tower for wind turbines martín del campo and pozos estrada 2020 analyzed the multi hazard fragility of wind turbines considering the seismic environmental conditions in the southwest of mexico most previous studies assumed a component of ground motion exciting the wind turbine in the fa direction or a bi directional horizontal ground motion exciting the wind turbine in the fa and ss directions however it has been shown in the literature on the seismic performance of building frames and bridges that the direction of ground motion incidence significantly influences the structural responses mavronicola et al 2020 noori et al 2019 pinzón et al 2020 wang and dong 2011 studied the effect of ground motion direction on the dynamic responses of a vestas 2 mw v80 wind turbine tower the results showed that a 90 angle between the ground motion incident direction and the concentrated eccentric mass direction of the wind turbine was the most unfavorable direction of ground motion excitation tran et al 2020 showed that the structural responses of an owt varied with the incident direction of ground motions they concluded that the orthogonal directions of earthquakes should be reviewed in the principal directions of the owt mo et al 2021 showed that the structural responses of a 5 mw mowt were significantly affected by the angle of ground motion incidence the objective of this study is to analyze the seismic fragility of large scale mowts and evaluate the effect of ground motion directionality the case study involves a 5 mw baseline wind turbine supported by a monopile foundation to be installed in a wind farm in the east china sea two scenarios are analyzed including 1 the wind turbine parked in a calm sea subjected to earthquakes and 2 the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine subjected to earthquakes in the scenario of the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected to earthquakes the influence of aerodynamic damping associated with the damping of the rotor vibrating in the fa direction and the ss direction is analyzed the structure

motion and the definition of damage critical levels section 4 presents incremental dynamic analysis for structural demands fragility curves of the mowt the effect of ground motion directionality and the influence of aerodynamic damping are analyzed in section 5 finally concluding remarks are summarized in section 6 2 model description and seismic fragility methodology 2 1 wind turbine model 2 1 1 structural model a 5 mw mowt to be installed in a wind farm in the east china sea is used as an example for this study the mowt is exactly the same as that in the authors previous studies mo et al 2017 2018 2021 the wind turbine is the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 the monopile foundation is 81 m long with a penetration of 57 5 m into the seabed 6 0 m in diameter and 45 80 mm in thickness a conical grouted connection gc without shear key is used to fix the transition piece to the top of the pile the base flange is 10 m above the mean water level mwl the mean water depth of the site is 18 5 m a schematic diagram of the mowt and the soil profile of the site is shown in fig 1 a summary of the main properties of the mowt is provided in table 1 the three dimensional 3d finite element fe model of the mowt is developed using the opensees program version 3 2 1 mckenna et al 2006 since the fe model in the present study is exactly the same as that in the authors previous study mo et al 2021 the numerical modeling is only briefly introduced herein for more detailed information about the fe model see ref mo et al 2021 the rotor including the three blades and the hub is simplified as lumped at the gravity center ignoring the influence of the blades on the dynamic response of the structure the nacelle is modeled as a lump mass at the center of mass of the nacelle very stiff beam columns behaving as rigid elements are used to couple the rotor and nacelle to the tower top and transfer loads of the rotor and the nacelle to the tower the yaw and pitch of the hub and nacelle system are neglected the monopile and tower both are modeled using displacement based beam column dispbeamcolumn elements the gc is simplified as elastic beam column elements neglecting the layer organization of the inner pile grout and transition piece to improve the astringency of the numerical model the bending stiffness compressive stiffness torsional stiffness and the mass of the beam column are calculated as the sum of the stiffness and the mass of the inner pile grouted layer and transition piece according to industry code gb 50936 2014 standardization administration of the p r c 2014 it should be noted that the grouted layer and the bonded contact between different structural material layers may suffer from fracture and failure before the buckling of the integral gc s beam column elements however the numerical simulation of the fracture and failure of the grouted layer and bonded contact between different structural material layers needs a detailed fe model and the seismic dynamic analysis of the fe model is computational expensive instead of simulating the fracture and failure of the grouted layer and the bonded contact in the gc this study used an analytical method to assess the damage of the gc as a compromise of the computational effort the analytical damage assessment method will be discussed in section 4 the ssi of the foundation is modeled using the beam on nonlinear winkler foundation yankelevsky et al 1989 soil liquefaction during earthquake is neglected p y x t z and q z springs are used to model the pile soil interaction in the lateral vertical and tip of the pile respectively the torsion boundary of the monopile is simplified as rotational constrained at the tip of the pile since the torsional load is relatively small as the direction of winds and waves is assumed alignment the constitutive behavior of the p y p x t z and q z springs are modeled using uniaxial material pysimple1 pysimple1 tzsimple1 and qzsimple1 boulanger and davis 2010 respectively the q345 steel standardization administration of the p r c 2018 is selected as the basic steel material for the monopile the tower and the nacelle assembly properties are listed in table 2 the elastic and plastic of the steel material is modeled using a steel 01 material model with kinematic hardening filippou and mazzoni 2020 in the immersing section of the monopile and gc hydraulic added mass feyzollahzadeh et al 2016 maniaci and li 2011 newman 1977 is used to model the interaction between the pile and sea water the additional tributary mass of water is calculated as the mass of water in the hollow of the pile plus the mass of water accelerated around the pile mo et al 2018 2021 shi et al 2013 an added mass coefficient of 1 0 for the accelerated water around the pile was used in the numerical model for a cylinder section according to newman 1977 the mesh size of the monopile in the section embedded into the seabed was 1 0 m and 1 5 m in other sections and the tower p y p x and t z springs were distributed along the pile below the mudline with an interval of 1 m while a q z spring was used at the pile tip fig 2 sketches the fe model of the mowt the natural frequencies of the mowt model are presented in table 3 2 1 2 wind and wave loads the mowt in the oceanic environment subjects to winds and waves the wind loads on the mowt are influenced by the wind velocity and the operational strategy parked or in normal operation of the wind turbine in cases of the wind turbine in parked conditions the wind loads on the wind turbine are small due to a small cross section of the wind turbine structures and a low relative velocity between the structure and the airflow in cases of the wind turbine in normal operation the sweeping blades introduce large wind forces on the rotor and the wind loads are influenced by the wind velocity the control strategies of the generation system the pitch angle of the blades and the yaw of the rotor the wave loads on the monopile foundation are influenced by the water depth and sea states in the current study the wind and wave loads on the mowt were calculated using the openfast program national renewable energy laboratory 2021 a multi physics multi fidelity tool for simulating the coupled dynamic response of wind turbines in the openfast a module called aerodyn is used to realize a time history aero elastic simulation of the wind turbine in steady and turbulent wind fields generated by turbsim software jonhkman and kilcher 2012 which is an external stochastic full field turbulent wind simulation program developed by nrel in the aerodyn module aerodynamic forces on the blades are calculated using the blade element momentum theory bem moriarty and hansen 2005 a module named hydrodyn is used to calculate the wave forces acting on the monopile foundation the hydrodyn generates waves analytically for finite depth using first order linear airy or first plus second order wave theory according to the inputted wave spectrum jonkman et al 2015 and the wave forces on the monopile are calculated using the strip theory solution by morison equation morison et al 1950 the detailed simulation techniques are referred to openfast documentation aerodyn theory manual moriarty and hansen 2005 national renewable energy laboratory 2021 and hydrodyn theory manual jonkman et al 2015 for the sake of brevity they are not expended in this paper 2 2 analytical seismic fragility methodology a fragility function specifies a structure s probability of damage failure or some other limit state of interest as a function of ground motion intensity measure baker 2015 seismic fragility of an owt can be defined as the conditional probability of a structural demand d of the owt to reach or exceed the structural capacity c at a given excitation intensity of ground motion according to kennedy et al 1980 assuming that both the structural capacity and the demand of an owt follow a lognormal distribution the seismic fragility of the owt can be described by lognormal probability distribution and mathematically expressed as baker 2015 1 f r a g i l i t y p d c i m a φ ln a ζ β where ф is the standard normal cumulative distribution function im is the ground motion intensity measure a represents an arbitrary ground motion intensity ζ is the median of the fragility function and represents the median value of ground motion index at which the owt reaches the threshold of limit state d β represents the dispersion of log standard deviation of im generating a fragility curve for an owt requires estimation of the parameters ζ and β these two parameters are usually derived from structural response analysis results rather than empirical data since very limited damage failure data for owts is publicly available and failure events are expected to be rare baker and cornell 2006 there are a number of methods to estimate the values of the parameters ζ and β baker 2015 baker and cornell 2006 masanobu et al 2000 ramamoorthy et al 2006 shome 1999 in the current study truncated incremental dynamic analysis tida baker 2015 is used as a compromise between the computation efforts and the selection of ground motion in tida dynamic response analysis of the owt is performed up to a desired ground motion intensity level im max to relate the structural demand to the ground motion intensity the maximum likelihood method is used to approach the likelihood of observing the data that were observed and estimate the values of ζ and β according to eq 1 the likelihood that an arbitrary ground motion causes damage to the owt at im i is the normal distribution probability density function as outlined in eq 2 2 l f φ ln i m i ζ β where φ denotes the standard normal distribution probability density function the likelihood that a given ground motion can be scaled to im max without causing damage to the owt can be expressed as 3 l n f 1 φ ln i m i ζ β for a suite of n ground motions the likelihood of an observation that m ground motions cause the owt damage at im levels lower than im max and n m ground motions do not cause structure damage prior to the analysis being stopped is calculated as eq 4 by assuming that the im i value for each ground motion is independent 4 l i 1 m φ ln i m i ζ β 1 φ ln i m max ζ β n m where π i 1 m is the product over i values from 1 to m using eq 4 the parameters ζ and β are obtained by varying the values until the likelihood function is maximized expressed as 5 ζ ˆ β ˆ argmax ζ β j 1 m ln φ ln i m i ζ β n m ln 1 φ ln i m max ζ β where ζ ˆ and β ˆ are the estimates of ζ and β in general the procedure for constructing seismic fragility curves is summarized as 1 select a suite of earthquake records 2 perform a truncated incremental dynamic simulation to obtain the structural demand 3 define damage critical levels and solve eq 5 for the likelihood of the realization of ζ and β 4 finally derive fragility curves using eq 1 for damage probability elevation 3 ground motion selection and limit state definition 3 1 ground motion selection to fully consider the uncertainties of ground motion a suite of 50 ground motion records was selected for nonlinear incremental dynamic analysis of the mowt the suite included a set of 22 far field records and a set of 28 near field records each consisting of two horizontal components these ground motion records were selected from the ground motions recommended by the federal emergency management agency fema based on eight fundamental principles i e source magnitude source type site condition site source number of records per event strongest ground motion records strong motion instrument capability and strong motion instrument location applied technology council 2009 detailed acceleration information of each ground motion record was obtained from the database of the pacific earthquake engineering research center peer 2011 the 22 far field records were taken from 14 events with magnitudes ranging from m6 5 to m7 6 with an average magnitude of m7 0 the minimum site source distance was 11 1 km the maximum distance was 26 4 km and the average distance was 16 4 km the peak ground accelerations pgas vary from 0 21 g to 0 82 g with an average of 0 43 g the 28 near field records were taken from 14 events with magnitudes ranging from m6 5 to m7 9 with an average magnitude of m7 0 the site source distances were in a range of 1 7 8 8 km with a medium of 4 2 km the pgas vary from 0 22 g to 1 43 g with an average of 0 6 g table 4 summarizes the detailed information of the 50 ground motion records fig 3 provides the 5 damped square root of sum of the squares pseudo spectral acceleration and the target spectrum of the site calculated according to api rp 2eq 2014 api 2014 earthquake induced ground motion produces horizontal translational accelerations which are recorded in two orthogonal components usually in the south north and east west directions penzien and watabe 1974 traditionally the two as recorded horizontal components of ground motion acceleration are applied in the fa and ss directions denoted as fs bi dictional excitation in owt seismic analysis in this study the two as recorded horizontal acceleration components are rotated and resolved along the centerline of the tower to account for different incidence angles as shown in fig 4 the rotated horizontal pairs of the ground motion accelerations are input into the fe model for dynamic analysis it is assumed that the wind and wave forces are in alignment and acting in the fa direction parallel to x axis pointing downwind the rotated input ground motions á x t θ and á y t θ were derived from the linear combination of the two horizontal as recorded components wilson and button 1982 a x t and a y t as shown in eq 6 and eq 7 each ground motion record is rotated to produce thirty six angles of seismic incidence θ i e 0 θ 360 with increments of 10 it should be noted that the methodology of rotating ground motion acceleration is the same as that in the authors previous study mo et al 2021 6 a x t θ a x t cos θ a y t sin θ 7 a y t θ a x t sin θ a y t cos θ 3 2 limit state definition a limit state defines the threshold beyond which a structural component no longer satisfies one of its performance objectives it indicates a damage failure mode of the structure in fragility analysis it is necessary to define the limit state for each kind of structure component since the performance objective and the capacity of different structural components are different the mowt is a high rise structure with a large diameter rotor rotating at the free end of the cantilever a previous study by the authors about the seismic response of mowts showed that the top of the tower experienced the largest displacement and rotation and the mudline section of the monopile was subjected to the largest bending moment excessive displacement and rotation at the top of the tower leads to a loss of efficiency in power generation and potentially results in a collision between the blades and the tower mo et al 2017 on the other hand the large forces may lead to the yield or bulking of the monopile foundation and tower also the gc can be a critical structural element for the low tension strength of the grouted material and a high stress concentration factor dnv gl 2016 mo et al 2018 the focus of this study is on the safety of the generator and the stability of the mowt and to this end the displacement and the rotation at the top of the tower and the failure of the monopile the tower and the gc are assessed 1 generator limit states assigned to the generator are related to any excessive displacement and rotation which cause a loss of efficiency in power generation and a potential collision between the blades and tower a threshold displacement of 1 25 of the length of the structure from the mudline to the tower top at the top of the tower proposed by asareh et al 2016a is used for an earthquake emergency shutdown of the wind turbine a rotation at the top of the tower equals to the precone of the rotor of 2 5 is used as the threshold of a potential collision between the rotor and tower mo et al 2017 2 monopile and tower the monopile and the tower are large tubulars with a thin thickness in this study limit state assigned to the monopile and the tower is related to local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section and at the bottom of the tower according to eurocode en 1993 1 6 european committee for standardization 2005 the stress limitation for buckling strength verification of the monopile and the tower subjected to a combined loading can be expressed as 8 f σ x e d σ x r

mowt is influenced by the environmental conditions and the control strategy of the turbine yuan et al 2017 showed that wind turbines in normal operation with the baseline control system working were less prone to damage than wind turbines in parked conditions witcher 2005 asareh et al 2016b and mo et al 2017 mo et al 2021 showed that the seismic dynamic response of wind turbines in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine is more pronounced than that of wind turbines for other wind speeds in this study two scenarios are analyzed as shown in table 7 in the first scenario denoted as wtp the wind turbine was parking in a calm sea with windless when earthquake striking in this scenario the mowt subjected to earthquake alone in the second scenario denoted as wto the wind turbine was in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine when earthquake striking and a random sea state of a five year return waves of the wind farm was considered in this scenario the mowt subjected to a combination of earthquake wind and wave loads the seismic dynamic response of the wind turbine in the two scenarios has been investigated in the authors previous study mo et al 2021 it was shown that the structural responses are significantly influenced by the directionality of the earthquake ground motion 4 2 incremental dynamic analysis numerical simulations are performed to obtain the seismic responses and the structural demands of the mowt for the wto scenario a two step procedure is used to approach the dynamic responses of the mowt under coupled wind wave and seismic loads in the first step the openfast program is used to derive the wind and wave loads acting on the mowt three dimensional 3d wind fields with a 1460 s duration and a 155 0 m grid height and gird width which encompasses the entire rotor disk and an additional space for structural vibration are generated by the turbsim program the reference wind speed was defined at the hub height and is set to 12 0 m s a little bit higher than the rated wind speed of the turbine of 11 4 m s as a compensation for the turbulent wind a meteorological boundary condition of kaimal spectrum with iec 61400

and kilcher 2012 linear irregular first order waves are generated internally within the hydrodyn model using the jonswap spectrum iec 2009 jonkman et al 2015 the direction of winds and waves are assumed to align and point to downwind of the rotor as shown in fig 4 the airfoil properties supported structural properties geometric sizes and stiffness and control strategies of the control and electrical system were given to the openfast along with 1460 s turbulent wind fields coupled nonlinear aero hydro servo elastic simulation in the time domain were performed with a time step of 0 005 s the wind forces on the rotor and tower and the wave forces on the monopile from 800 s to 1000 s were extracted for the structural dynamic analysis and eliminating the initial transient behavior of the wind turbine in the second step the wind and wave loads and earthquake ground motion accelerations were applied to the opensees fe model for dynamic analyses the interaction effect of wind and wave

of 1 47 which consists a value of 0 3 structural material damping η struc 0 8 soil damping η soil and 0 37 hydrodynamic damping η hydro was considered according to mo et al 2021 the aerodynamic damping was neglected in the wto scenario aerodynamic damping was added to the numerical simulation and two aerodynamic damping models were considered details of the two aerodynamic damping models are analyzed in section 5 2 as mentioned earlier the as recorded ground motion accelerations are rotated from 0 to 360 with intervals of 10 to investigate the effect of the ground motion incident direction pga was selected as the intensity measure for earthquake excitation the tida is performed from im 0 1 g up to im max 1 2 g with an interval of 0 1 g to acquire the structural demands for fragility analysis the rotated and scaled ground motion accelerations were applied for time history analysis dynamic analyses were performed in a 200 s duration with a basic iterative time step of 0 01 s in the wtp scenario the ground motions were applied at the start of the 20th second after the mowt model reached an initial gravity balance in the wto scenario the ground motions were applied at the start of the 120th second to eliminate the initial transient behavior of the wind turbine the wind and wave loads derived from turbulent winds and random waves are random the variation in the random seed results in the realization of different time series for the given wind speed and wave parameters this causes epistemic uncertainties during load and response computations dong et al 2012 in this study 50 monte carlo simulations of wind and wave time series were performed to reduce the uncertainty of the wind and wave loads each time series of wind and wave loads of the 50 monte carlo simulations was combined stochastically with a recorded earthquake in total more than 64800 dynamic simulations were performed with different earthquakes angles of ground motion incidence and wind and wave loads 5 results and discussion 5 1 wind turbine in parked condition fig 5 presents the dynamic responses displacement at the top of the tower dis tt rotation at the top of the tower rot tt bending moment in the monopile at the mudline section m pm bending moment at the bottom of the tower m tb and bending moment at the bottom of the gc m gc of the mowt subjected to the san fernando earthquake alone with different ground motion intensities fig 6 plots the maximum structural responses of the mowt excited by the san fernando earthquake alone with different pgas and angles of incidence as observed in fig 5 a b the mowt was forced to vibrate when earthquake striking the mowt suffers no ground motion loading post earthquake but the boundary constraints from the seabed and it vibrates freely with damping which makes the structural motion decayed gradually to a static equilibrium position the variation of the maximum structural responses see fig 6 shows that the dynamic responses of the mowt increase linearly with the pga when the ground motion intensity is lower than a critical threshold value 0 6 g for 0 angle of incidence it indicates that the mowt vibrates within the elastic range of the structure this also can be observed from fig 5 the dynamic responses of the mowt subjected to ground motions with pga 0 2 g and pga 0 4 g are similar in the tendency but different in the amplitude as the ground motion intensity going beyond the critical value the structural responses of the mowt increase nonlinearly with the pga it suggests that the mowt occurred plastic deformation this also can be observed from the dynamic responses of the mowt for a similar tendency and amplitude and a post earthquake permanent drift in the displacement and rotation at the top of the tower under pga 1 0 g and pga 1 2 g as shown in fig 5 as presented in fig 6 the structural responses of the mowt obtained from 70 to 250 angles of ground motion incidence are smaller than from other angles of incidence while the structural responses obtained from 160 to 320 angles of incidence are larger than from other angles of incidence this implies that the mowt is more likely to suffer damages when the san fernando earthquake ground motions are excited at 160 and 320 angles it also suggests that the bi directional horizontal ground motion exciting the mowt in the fa and ss directions fs bi directional excitation which corresponding to 0 angle of incidence as described in fig 4 does not necessarily produce the maximum structural responses over all the other incidence angles in general the ground motion incident direction has significant influence on the structural responses of the mowt fig 7 presents fragility curves of the mowt for different angles of ground motion incidence as was expected the angle of ground motion incidence has obvious influence on the structural fragility of the mowt since the directions of earthquake ground motions are unknown before an earthquake event structural fragility considering the uncertainties of ground motion direction is approximated using the structural demands of all thirty six angles of ground motion incidence and is denoted as uia curve in this study the uia curve is considered a reasonable prediction of the seismic fragility of the mowt since it contains information about the structural demands of different ground motion incident directions as shown in fig 7 the uia curve of the examined limit states predicts a median value of structural fragility over all the analyzed angles of incidence the fragility curve of 0 angle of incidence predicts a lower structural fragility than that of the uia curve it suggest that structural fragility analysis using the traditional fs bi directional excitation results in an underestimation as indicated in section 2 2 the median of the fragility function represents median value of ground motion index at which the mowt reaches the threshold of a limit state in this study statistical characteristics of the median of fragility functions among the thirty six angles of ground motion incidence of the examined limit states are used as a quantitative index for evaluating the effect of ground motion directionality on the structural vulnerability the ground motion incident direction under which the median of the fragility function receives the lowest value over all the other angles is defined as the critical incident direction θ critical the statistical characteristics i e the mean μ ζ the coefficient of variation cv ζ and the measure of dispersion md ζ of the median of the fragility function are calculated as 24 the mean μ ζ θ ζ θ n 25 the coefficient of variation c v ζ s ζ μ ζ θ ζ θ μ ζ 2 n 1 μ ζ 100 26 the measure of dispersion m d ζ max ζ θ min ζ θ μ ζ 100 where ζ θ is the median of the fragility function of the analyzed limit state for θ angle of ground motion incidence n 36 is the number of angles of incidence table 8 shows the obtained statistical characteristics of the median of fragility functions and the critical incident direction for the examined limit states it can be seen that the mean median fragility function for the limit state ls4 is 0 62 g the lowest among the five examined limit states it implies that the mowt reaches the threshold of local buckling at the bottom of the tower first with a mean ground motion intensity of 0 62 g as the ground motion intensity increases the mean median fragility function for the limit states ls3 ls5 and ls1 ranking the second to the fourth the mean median fragility function for the limit state ls2 is 0 84 g the highest it suggests the limit state of excessive rotation at the top of the tower requires a mean ground motion intensity of 0 84 g is the highest among the five examined limit states the maximum value of the measure of dispersion md ζ reaches 16 06 corresponding to the limit state ls1 while the minimum value of md ζ is 10 88 corresponding to the limit state ls3 the coefficient of variation cv ζ for different limit states falls in a range from 3 23 to 4 20 these high value of the measure of dispersion md ζ and coefficient of variation cv ζ indicate a high dispersion in the median of fragility functions with respect to the direction of ground motion incidence it implies that seismic fragility analysis using structural demands from a specific incident direction may result in a misestimation this can be observed from the variation of the structural fragility for different ground motion incident direction as shown fig 7 as shown in table 8 the critical incident angle for the limit state ls1 is 90 and the critical incident angle for the limit states ls2 ls5 is in a range of 220 240 it implies that the limit state of excessive displacement at top of the tower is sensitive to ground motions with a 90 angle of incidence the limit states of excessive rotation at the top of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section local buckling at the bottom of the tower and tension fracture in the gc are sensitive to ground motions with an angle of incidence ranges from 220 to 240 it can be concluded that ground motion directionality has a significant influence on the seismic fragility of the mowt in parked conditions subjected earthquakes the critical angle of ground motion incidence varies with the change of the defined limit states it suggests that ground motion directionality should be accounted for in seismic fragility analysis for mowts in parked conditions in order to analyze the vulnerability of the mowt in detail fragility curves of the examined limit states considering the uncertainty of ground motion incident direction uia curves are extracted and plotted in fig 7 to more clearly compare the damage modes of the mowt the pga for specified exceeding probabilities of 10 20 and 50 in different limit states are examined and shown in table 9 as shown in fig 7 pga 0 43 g is identified as a critical ground motion intensity in cases of the earthquake with a pga smaller than 0 43 g the limit state ls1 receives the highest exceeding probability among the five examined limit states however in cases of the earthquake with a pga larger than 0 43 g the limit state ls4 receives the highest exceeding probability this indicates that the damage of excessive displacement at the top of the tower is the most pronounced when the ground motion intensity is smaller than 0 43 g the damage of local buckling at the bottom of the tower is the most pronounced while the ground motion intensity is larger than 0 43 g this also can be observed from table 9 for the 10 exceeding probability the limit state ls1 requires the lowest ground motion intensity following is the limit state ls4 the limit states ls3 and ls4 ranks the third and the fourth respectively the limit state ls2 requires the highest ground motion intensity for the 20 and 50 exceeding probabilities the first four limit states requiring the lowest ground motion intensity are ls4 ls3 ls5 and ls1 this may be explained as an increase contribution of the high modes of the mowt to the force responses of the supported structures as the ground motion intensity increase the results suggest that excessive displacement at the top of the tower local buckling at the bottom of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline and tension fracture in the gc are the first four failure modes of the mowt in parked conditions subjected earthquakes 5 2 wind turbine in normal operation condition in cases of an earthquake occurring when the wind turbine is in normal operation the mowt is excited by a combination of ground motion winds and waves on the other hand the sweeping rotor introduces a high aerodynamic damping to the vibration system in the fa direction which mitigates the structural vibration liu et al 2017 mo et al 2021 yuan et al 2017 in the ss direction the aerodynamic damping is very small and can be neglected due to a small project area of the interaction surface between the rotor and the fluid koukoura et al 2015 valamanesh and myers 2014 xi et al 2020 the coupled earthquake wind and wave loading and aerodynamic damping make the dynamic responses of the mowt more complicated which results in a complex relationship between earthquake excitation and structural failure damage in the current study two aerodynamic damping models see table 10 adapted from ref mo et al 2021 were used to investigate the effect of aerodynamic damping on the seismic fragility of the mowt in the first model adm1 the aerodynamic damping was neglected in the fe model dynamic simulation it is out of the consideration that aerodynamic damping has been accounted for in the derivation of wind forces of the wind turbine in the openfast simulation moriarty and hansen 2005 this model has both conservative and unconservative aspects in the seismic responses under horizontal bi directional excitation when compared to a wind turbine with rotating blades when the blades are rotating they add about 3 40 aerodynamic damping in the fa direction liu et al 2017 the model does not have aerodynamic damping and therefore is conservative on the other hand it is unconservative in the ss direction since the rotating blades introduce little aerodynamic damping when vibrating in the ss direction in the second model adm2 the aerodynamic damping ratio is assumed equal to 3 40 koukoura et al 2015 liu et al 2017 valamanesh and myers 2014 which is the damping ratio of the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed vibrating in the fa direction this model is unconservative due to the fact that 1 the aerodynamic damping has been accounted for in the process of wind force derivation in openfast and 2 aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine in the other directions particularly in the ss direction is smaller than that of the fa direction fig 9 presents the dynamic responses dis tt rot tt m pm m tb and m gc of the mowt subjected to a combination of the san fernando earthquake wind and wave loads with the aerodynamic damping model adm1 for comparison the dynamic responses of the mowt subjected to the same wind and wave loads without ground motion are also plotted in the figure labelled as ww as observed being in normal operation the mowt was excited by wind and wave loads before earthquake when earthquake occurred the mowt vibrates around a basic drift derived by the wind and wave loads fig 10 plots the maximum structural responses of the mowt for different earthquake intensities and incident directions it can be seen that the angle of ground motion incidence has significant influence on the structural responses of the mowt the variation trend of the structural responses with respect to the ground motion intensity and incident direction is similar to that of the wind turbine in parked conditions as shown in fig 6 more specifically in cases of the earthquake with a small pga 0 5 g for 0 angle of incidence the structural responses of the mowt increase linearly with the increase of the ground motion intensity in cases of the earthquake with a large pga 0 5 g for 0 angle of incidence the structural responses of the mowt increase nonlinearly with the increases of the ground motion intensity due to the plastic response of the structure the structural responses of the mowt obtained from 60 to 250 angles of ground motion incidence are smaller than from other angles while the structural responses obtained from 140 to 340 angles of incidence are larger than from other angles a comparison of the structural responses of the mowt in parked conditions subjected to earthquakes figs 5 and 6 and in normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected earthquakes figs 9 and 10 shows that the seismic responses of the mowt in normal operation are larger than in the parked condition especially when the ground motion intensity is small it indicates that wind and wave loads increases the seismic responses of the mowt the obtained fragility curves for different limit states of the mowt subjected to a combination of earthquake winds and waves using the adm1 model denoted as wto adm1 scenario model for different ground motion incident angles are plotted in fig 11 table 11 gives the statistical characteristics of the median of fragility functions and the critical ground motion incident direction as shown in fig 11 the ground motion incident direction has significant influence on the structural fragility of the mowt the fragility curve of 0 angle of incidence predicts an obvious lower structural fragility than that of the uia curve it suggests that structural fragility analysis using the fs bi directional excitation results in a considerable underestimation table 11 shows that mean median fragility function for ls4 is 0 54 g the lowest among the five examined limit states the mean median fragility function for ls3 and ls5 is 0 59 g ranking the second the mean median fragility function for ls1 and ls2 ranking the third and the fourth respectively the measure of dispersion md ζ for different limit states is in a range from 10 10 to 24 45 while the coefficient of variation cv ζ varies from 2 56 to 5 86 these high values of md ζ and cv ζ indicate a high dispersion in the median of fragility functions with respect to the direction of ground motion incidence it indicates that assessment of the structural fragility of the mowt using the results of a specific ground motion incident direction leads to a misestimation this is similar to the scenario wtp as analyzed in section 5 1 it suggests that ground motion directionality should be accounted for in the fragility analysis for mowt in normal operation conditions a comparison of the statistical characteristics of the median of fragility functions of the wto adm1 model table 11 and the wtp scenario table 8 shows that the mean median fragility functions of the five examined limit states of the wto adm1 model is obviously smaller than that of the wtp scenario this indicates that the wind and wave loads significantly increase the seismic fragility of the mowt it suggest that the scenario of earthquake coupling with the wind turbine in normal operation at the rated wind speed is the driving case in seismic fragility analysis when compared to the scenario of earthquake coupling with the wind turbine in parked conditions this agrees with the results in witcher 2005 the value of md ζ and cv ζ of the wtp scenario is larger than that of the wtp adm1 model except the cases of md ζ for the limit state ls4 and cv ζ for the limit states ls4 and ls5 it implies that the wind and wave loads amplifies the effect of ground motion directionality on the seismic fragility of the mowt the critical angle of incidence for the limit states ls1 ls2 ls3 and ls5 is in a range from 40 to 70 and the critical angle of incidence for the limit state ls4 is 230 this is different from that of the scenario wpt as shown in table 8 it is because the wind and wave loads points to the downwind direction and contributes a basic structural response in the corresponding direction as plotted in figs 9 and 10 it suggests that the wind and wave loads also contribute to the critical angle of ground motion incidence it also indicates that the fs bi directional excitation does not produce the maximum exceeded probability over all other incidence angles for wind turbines in normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected to earthquakes fig 12 presents fragility curves of the mowt in the wto adm1 scenario considering the uncertainty of ground motion incident direction as observed a critical ground motion intensity is identified as pga 0 43 g in cases of the earthquake with a pga smaller than the critical ground motion intensity the limit state ls1 receives the highest exceeding probability among the five examined limit states in cases of the earthquake with a pga larger than the critical ground motion intensity the limit state ls4 receives the highest exceeding probability the results suggest that the mowt is susceptible to excessive displacement at the top of the tower local buckling at the bottom of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section and tension fracture in the grouted material in the gc this is similar to the wtp scenario as analyzed in section 5 1 and shown in fig 8 to analyze the effect of aerodynamic damping on the structural fragility the seismic fragility of the mowt in normal operation at the rated wind speed subjected to earthquakes using the aerodynamic model amd2 wto adm2 are calculated and plotted in fig 13 fig 14 presents the relative differences of the median of fragility functions of the mowt considering the uncertainties of ground motion direction for the wto adm1 model and the wto adm2 model table 12 provides the pgas for the 10 20 and 50 exceeding probabilities of different limit states as shown in fig 13 the fragility curves of the mowt for the wto adm2 model are similar in the tendency but different in the exceeding probability to that of the wto adm1 model see fig 12 more specifically a critical ground motion intensity of pga 0 56 g is identified this critical ground motion intensity is much higher than that of the wto adm1 model of 0 43 g in cases of the earthquake with a pga smaller than 0 56 g the limit state ls1 receives the highest exceeding probability among the five examined limit states in cases of the earthquake with a pga larger than 0 56 g the limit state ls4 is more pronounce than the other limit states it is observed that the wto adm2 model predicts a lower exceeding probability than the wto adm1 model this is also indicated in fig 14 and table 12 as shown in fig 14 the relative differences of the median of fragility functions of the wto adm2 model and the wto adm1 model fall in a range from 19 05 to 32 37 it means that the wto adm2 model requires a much higher ground motion intensity than the wto adm1 model to reach the threshold of the five examined limit states table 12 shows that the pgas for the 10 20 and 50 exceeding probabilities for the wto adm2 model are significantly higher than that of the wto adm1 model these imply that aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine significantly reduces the seismic fragility of the mowt it also indicates that the seismic fragility analyses of the mowt in normal operation conditions for ground motions exciting in the ss direction using the fa aerodynamic damping adm2 will result in a significant underestimation in contrast the seismic fragility analyses of the mowt in normal operation conditions for ground motion exciting in the fa direction neglecting the aerodynamic damping adm1 will result in an remarkable overestimation it can be concluded from another aspect that the aerodynamic damping amplifies the effect of ground motion directionality on seismic fragility of the mowt in normal operation conditions these results suggest that aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine and ground motion directionality should be accounted for in the seismic analysis of the mowt in normal operation conditions 6 conclusions seismic fragility of a 5 mw mowt was studied considering the effects of the directionality of ground motion a suite of 22 far field and 28 near field earthquake ground motions were selected and the horizontal pairs of the ground motion records were mathematically rotated to produce thirty six angles of incidence ranging from 0 to 360 with an increment of 10 a detailed fe model that consisted of different structural components of the wind turbine and the ssi was used to analyze the structural demands of the mowt subjected to earthquakes five limit states for the mowt were proposed based on the serviceability and ultimate limit states the tida method was applied to perform time history dynamic analysis and estimate fragility curves fragility of the wind turbine for two scenarios including 1 the wind turbine parking in a calm sea and 2 the wind turbine in normal operation at the rate wind speed were investigated the following significant conclusions were drawn 1 when wind turbines park in a calm sea situation the ground motion incident varies from 0 to 360 could lead to a 10 88 16 06 variation in the median of fragility functions for damage states of excessive displacement and rotation at the top of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section local buckling at the bottom of the tower and tension fracture in the gc the traditional horizontal bi directional ground motions exciting in the fa and ss directions led to a significant underestimation of the structural fragility the damage state of excessive displacement at the top of the tower was sensitive to ground motions with 90 angle of incidence and the damage states of local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section local buckling at the bottom of the tower tension fracture in the gc and excessive rotation at the top of the tower were sensitive to ground motions with an incidence angle of 220 240 the damage of excessive displacement at the top of the tower was the most pronounced when an earthquake with a pga smaller than 0 43 g the local buckling at the bottom of the tower was the most pronounced when the earthquake with a pga larger than 0 43 g 2 at the rated wind speed the wind and wave loads increased the seismic responses and the probability of exceeding a predefined limit states the ground motion directionality resulted in a 10 10 24 45 variation in the median of fragility functions the traditional analysis method of bi directional excitation in the fa and ss direction resulted in an obvious underestimation of the structural fragility the damage states of excessive displacement and rotation at the top of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section and tension fracture in the gc were sensitive to ground motions with an incident angle ranging from 40 to 70 the damage of local buckling at the bottom of the tower was sensitive to ground motions with 230 angle of incidence when an earthquake with the pga smaller than 0 43 g the damage of excessive displacement at the top of the tower was the most pronounced the damage of local buckling at the bottom of the tower was the most pronounced when the earthquake with a pga larger than 0 43 g 3 aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine obviously reduced the seismic fragility of the mowt in cases of the mowt in normal operation at the rated wind speed of the turbine subjected to earthquakes the application of the fa aerodynamic damping of the wind turbine resulted in a 19 05 32 37 increment in the median of the fragility functions neglecting aerodynamic damping could result in a significant overestimation of structural fragility for the mowt in normal operation conditions subjected to earthquakes 4 excessive displacement at the top of the tower local buckling at the bottom of the tower local buckling in the monopile at the mudline section and tension fracture in the gc were identified as the first four failure modes of the mowt subjected to earthquakes the results of this study provide a significant insight into the seismic vulnerability of mowts it can be concluded that the directionality of the ground motion the wind and wave loads and the aerodynamic damping should be taken into account in seismic fragility analysis for mowts it should be noted that the seismic vulnerability of owts involves many aspects and this study constitutes a fundamental step in measuring seismic performance to ensure safety and reliability challenges still remain including the fluid structure interaction of the rotor the vibration control system and the aerodynamic damping of the rotor with respect to the vibration direction these require further investigation to provide a better

20512,underwater explosion undex is one of the major threats to the vitality and sustained combat ability of the warship in the marine military confrontation with both attack and defense although there have been plenty of researches focusing on the undex load and its damage effect the failure mechanism of the structure under the combined undex and wave induced load especially in extreme sea conditions is still unrevealed in this paper a method for calculating the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load is proposed in which the acoustic structure interaction method was employed for determining the undex load and the wave induced response of hull girder was derived by using hydrodynamic to structure hts calculation procedure the synergistic effect of the combination of different levels of wave induced load and the underwater explosion was analyzed it is found that the hull girder is more dangerous under the combined undex and wave induced load especially in the severe wave level the damage severity of the hull girder will be underestimated without considering the synergistic effect of the combined loads keywords underwater explosion wave induced load synergistic effect hull girder dynamic response 1 introduction underwater explosion undex is one of the most concerned topics in the impact engineering which poses a serious threat to the safety and integrity of warships cole 1948 keil 1961 shurshalov 1974 during the undex event it can be recognized as two types of time dependent loads shock wave and bubble pulsation zong 2003 2005 although the pressure induced by the intensive shock is very large the effect on the hull girder s global strength is not significant due to the short duration however it usually causes local structural damage in fact pegg 1994 kwon et al 1993 hsu et al 2015 the bubble pulsation has great impact on the global longitudinal strength of the hull girder it may even lead to an overall hull collapse especially when the pulse duration is close to the natural frequency of the ship hull geers and hunter 2002 holloway et al 2004 chen et al 2009 although the peak pressure of the undex bubble pulsation is only around 10 20 of the shock wave pressure it has a similar amount of total impulse compared to that of the shock wave in the case of a non contact underwater explosion the bubble pulsation may cause an overall dynamic response of the hull girder when the duration of the bubble pulsation approaches the eigen frequency of the hull structure wang et al 2014 thus the explosion bubble hydrodynamic response has been one of the most concerned research topics in this field zhang et al 1993 wang et al 1996 hicks 1986 analyzed the elastic response of the hull girder under the undex bubble pulse based on the hydroelastic theory and timoshenko beam model the potential flow theory was employed to predict the whipping phenomenon of a typical warship subjected to undex bubble pulse zhang et al 2007 2008 2011 2013 2017 and cui et al 2016 investigated the nonlinear interaction between bubble and structure based on the fully coupled model and the method for calculating the dynamic bending moment of the structure caused by the bubble pulse was also proposed generally the ship structure was simplified as a hull girder when study the global dynamic response subjected to the undex zhang et al 2012 2014 2015 the hydrodynamic load should also be taken into consideration when analyzing the damage of the hull structure the progressive collapse behavior of ship hull subjected to wave induced loads was analyzed by pei et al 2015 and iijima et al 2011 the total damage of full scale ship was conducted by numerical simulation method which illustrated the evolution of deformation and damage of the ship under certain condition zhang et al 2011 zong et al 2013 however in fact the ship would experience the underwater explosion impact and the wave induced load simultaneously which has rarely been discussed before the synergistic effects caused by the combination of different types of loads would lead to the dynamic collapse of the hull girder which threatens the vitality of the ship seriously recently liu et al 2018 performed a numerical investigation on global responses of surface ship subjected to underwater explosion in waves and the interaction model for considering the nonlinear coupling between the fluid and structure solvers was established it worthy noted that the study considered the influence of wave shape on the dynamic response of the ship hull primarily in which the synergistic effect of undex and the wave induced load was not taken into consideration the overall collapse mechanism of the hull girder subjected to such combined load was still unrevealed in this paper the hull girder model of a ship was employed to investigate the characteristics of dynamic response subjected to combined undex and wave induced load firstly the acoustical structure coupling method in abaqus was used to calculate the response of the girder model caused by the impact load from undex numerically and this numerical procedure was validated by employing the test results meanwhile the hydrodynamic to structure hts calculation method was proposed to solve the dynamic response of the structure under wave induced load and it was also validated by comparing the calculated results with experimentally obtained data additionally multi steps analysis was performed to investigate the synergistic effect of undex and wave induced load on the dynamic response of the hull girder model 2 numerical model and validation of undex calculation method 2 1 overview of model in this section the acoustical structure coupling method in abaqus was employed to predict the dynamic response of the simplified hull girder model subjected to the undex load the results of experiment performed by wang et al 2014 were utilized to validate the accuracy of the numerical calculation method the model is designed as ship type box to discuss the dynamic response of ship structures subjected to close in non contact undex load the experimental model of the hull girder and its relevant dimensions are listed in fig 1 and table 1 respectively beyond that the weight distribution of the experiment model is uniform distributed along the ship length in the numerical simulation the hull girder model and the external flow region were modeled as s4r and acoustic medium element ac3d8r ac3d4 ac3d6 respectively as shown in fig 2 it should be noted that the diameter of cross section of flow region is taken as 6 times of the breadth of hull girder and the size of the acoustic medium elements which are connected with the hull girder should be smaller than that of the hull girder elements yao et al 2005 the length breadth and depth directions are denoted as x y and z respectively the finite element model of the hull girder consists of 6470 quadrilateral elements and 6650 nodes while the finite element model of the flow region consists of 688500 elements and 375531 nodes the bilinear elastic plastic constitutive model was adopted for the material of hull girder which is modified by cowper symonds c s model 1 σ d σ 0 e e h e e h ε p 1 ε d 1 p where σ 0 is the static yield strength e h represents the strain hardening modulus ε p and ε donate the effective plastic strain and the equivalent plastic strain rate respectively the constants d and p correspond to 40 4 s 1 and 5 for q235 steel respectively paik and thayamballi 2003 2 2 validation of the numerical method 2 2 1 natural frequencies of dry and wet mode in order to obtain the vibration modes of the structure and the corresponding vibration frequencies the linear perturbation analysis of the hull girder was carried out as shown in fig 3 the acoustical structure coupling method in abaqus introduced above was adopted to calculate the wet mode of the hull girder which employs the acoustic medium to simulate the flow region and connects the acoustic elements representing the aqueous medium to the hull girder through the tie interaction method to simulate the actual water adhesion effect on the wet surface of the hull girder the results of the first order vertical bending frequencies of the hull girder are compared in table 2 it can be found that the wet mode frequency of the hull girder is obviously lower than that of the dry mode frequency corresponding to the eigen frequency of the hull girder in the air which is caused by the influence of the attached water on the wet surface of the hull in the flow region the added mass caused by the attached water dominates this phenomenon the numerical results of the first order vertical bending wet mode frequency of the hull girder are in good agreement with experimental value according to the wang et al 2014 as can also be seen in table 2 2 2 2 deformation modes the dynamic failure of the hull girder subjected to the bubble pulsation load is mainly concerned in the underwater explosive based on the research in the previous section the abaqus acoustical structure coupling method is further used to simulate the dynamic response of the hull girder under the undex load according to the experimental set up described by wang et al 2014 0 005 kg tnt is deployed 0 3 m away below the location of the amidships the corresponding calculated bubble pulsation period is 50 2 ms therefore the calculation time is set more than two times of bubble pulsation periods which is taken as 0 12 s the deformation modes of the hull girder in experimental and simulation results at typical moments are shown in fig 4 in the initial stage shock wave induced small hog deformation after back to the horizontal position the hull girder has significant sag deformation due to the bubble pulsation load the obvious plastic hinge is produced at amidship of the structure while the plates of the other parts are in a rigid state without obvious plastic deformations due to the strain rate effect the maximum stress is 264 mpa at 12 ms which has exceeded the static yield stress σ 0 of the q235 steel however the overall deformation of the hull girder is not obvious as shown in fig 4 a after the shock wave stage the hull girder was loaded by the negative pressure from the bubble and spring back to the horizontal position at 24 ms while the maximum stress area converged at the amidships at this time the maximum stress value was 289 mpa as shown in fig 4 b as the bubble negative pressure continues a plastic hinge produced in the mid ship with a maximum stress value of 368 mpa and the overall sagging collapse occurred as shown in fig 4 c fig 5 shows the strain history curves at the same place of the amidships from experiment and numerical simulation the location of the strain records has been indicated as g3 marked in fig 11 it can be found that the compressive strain after 48 ms are much larger than that before 12 ms which reflects the permanent sagging deformation caused by gas bubble load after the slight hogging deformation caused by shock wave pressure in addition the strain changed slightly after the plastic hinge formed on the hull girder it can be found that the deformation modes and strain history agreed well between experimental and simulation results at each typical moment which verifies the accuracy and reliability of the acoustical structure coupling method in calculating the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to the undex load 3 dynamic response of hull girder subjected to wave induced load in the present study a hydrodynamic to structure hts calculation method is utilized to calculate the wave induced load and the dynamic response analysis the flowchart of this method is shown in fig 6 the time history of pressure distribution and inertial force on the wetted surface of the hull girder are determined by hydrostar then the calculated results are converted into the feasible load data in explicit dynamic analysis by homer code finally the structural response of the hull girder subjected to the wave induced load can be calculated in abaqus thus the distributions of the external pressure on the wetted surface of the hull girder can be obtained accurately through the calculation of the hydrodynamic load program the traditional method of applying fixed angle is only an ideally simplified method which cannot reflect the real collapse process of the hull girder moreover the hydrodynamic load results can be extracted into the finite element program to participate in the analysis of the structural response which is conducive to the numerical simulation under the case of multi loads combination 3 1 theoretical background the hydrodynamic load can be extracted by hydrostar software based on the boundary element method the pressures are integrated over the wetted body surface and the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated so that the ship s motion can be expressed as follows 2 ω 2 m a i ω b c ξ f d i f e where m and a donate genuine mass matrix and added mass matrix b and c are the damping matrix and hydrostatic restoring matrix f d i and f e are the excitation force vector and other external forces vector ξ is the body motion vector the generalized excitation force vector can be decomposed into incident diffracted and 6 radiated components 3 f d i i ω ρ ϕ n d s i ω ρ ϕ i ϕ d i ω j 1 6 ξ j ϕ r j n d s the solution of this equation gives the amplitudes of the body motions and the linear problem is formally solved the wetted body surfaces are discretized into sufficient number of panels over which the constant source distribution is assumed the load can be transferred from the hydrodynamic model to the structural finite element model in section 4 3 2 wave load calculation the hydrodynamic code hydrostar is employed to calculate the frequency response of the hull girder in regular waves of unit amplitude in head wave as shown in fig 7 the wave bending moment at the amidships section reaches the maximum value when the wave frequency is 4 6 rad s and the bending moment of other sections also reach the maximum near this frequency therefore the wave frequency is set as 4 6 rad s namely the corresponding wave period is 1 36 s and the wavelength is 2 91 m in order to obtain accurate load on each element of the hull girder at each time step including hydrodynamic pressure gravity and inertial force the pressure history of each element are obtained by homer hydrostar with a time interval of 0 01 s under head wave without forward speed the pressure time history at the amidships position under wave height of 0 08 m in a wave period is shown in fig 8 in which it is found that the positive pressure at the amidships element reach the peak value at 0 34 s while the hull girder corresponded to the hogging state the negative pressure at the amidships element fall back to the minimum value at 1 02 s while the hull girder being in the state of sagging it can be seen clearly from fig 9 the pressure direction is downward within 1 4 of the hull girder wetted surface from left to right which indicates that the gravity of the structure within this range is larger than the wave pressure including hydrostatic pressure and hydrodynamic pressure and the resultant direction is downward the direction of arrow while in the range of 1 4 to 3 4 the wave pressure is larger than the gravity of the structure so the direction of resultant force is upward from the overall point of view the pressure of mid ship is upward the pressure at both ends is downward and the hull girder shows the hogging deformation afterwards which will be verified in the next section 3 3 numerical simulation and analysis according to the hts calculation procedure of the wave induced load based on homer hydrostar the load data of each element are imported into abaqus explicit for calculating the structural response from the aspect of the relative motion between the wave and the hull girder it can be understood that the hull girder is in a static state and the wave crest moves from the left end to the right end of the hull girder as shown in fig 10 it can be observed from fig 10 a that when the wave crest located at the left quarter cross section of the hull girder the structure deformed upwards accordingly with the wave crest moves to the mid ship at 0 34 s hogging bending occurs at this moment as shown in fig 10 b the similar phenomenon can be found in fig 10 c and d which indicates that the proposed calculation procedure in this paper can solve the response process of the hull girder subjected to the wave induced load in explicit dynamic analysis in addition the maximum stress of the hull girder subjected to the wave load is only 4 03 mpa and the deformation of the hull girder is completely in the linear elastic range to observe the motion response of the hull girder at different locations two displacement measuring points are arranged as shown in fig 11 the measuring point g1 is located at the center of bottom hull plate while g2 is located in the bottom of stem bulkhead by comparing the vertical relative displacements of the two measuring points under different cases the deformation of the hull girder can be reflected clearly the stress measuring point g3 is also marked in fig 11 to monitor the stress time history on the broadside of the mid ship in order to observe the motion of the hull girder subjected to the wave induced load the dimensionless vertical displacement time history of the mid ship section is plotted in fig 12 in which δu w is the vertical relative displacement between g1 and g2 it can be found that the vertical displacement curve of the mid ship node is composed by the superposition of two sinusoidal functions with different frequencies among which the low frequency curve and the high frequency curve represent the wave frequency component and the high frequency vibration component induced by the wave load respectively it is clear that the frequency of the high vibrational component is 22 3 hz which is very close to the wet frequency 21 313 hz of the hull girder in section 2 2 it reveals that the wave induced load applied by the proposed calculation procedure in this paper can stimulate the vertical first order vibration of the hull girder furthermore the hull girder undergoes hogging and sagging bending deformation in a wave period which is consistent with the corresponding stages as demonstrated in fig 10 4 dynamic response of hull girder subjected to combined undex and wave induced load 4 1 multi loads calculation method based on abaqus explicit in this section multi steps analysis and calculation method in the commercial software abaqus is adopted to investigate the dynamic response of hull girder subjected to combined multi loads which was also applied in our previous research kong et al 2021 the fluid pressure exported from the hydrostar is used to calculated the structural responses of the finite element model since the loading period of undex is far less than that of wave induced load it can be considered that the wave induced load on the hull girder remains unchanged within the period of undex it should be noted that the influence of undex process on wave induced load is not considered in this paper for the cases of hogging and sagging bending the pressure and inertia forces on the wetted surface of the hull girder are obtained from homer hydrostar firstly then the wave induced load is loaded by smooth amplitude curve as shown in the step 1 of fig 13 at t 1 moment the hull girder is under the hogging or sagging bending condition and then the undex load will be applied until t 2 it should be noticed that the wave induced load still exists during t 1 to t 2 to make sure that the hull girder is subjected to combined undex and wave induced load 4 2 selection of undex case in this section a series of numerical analysis of undex cases are carried out in order to clarify the influence of the synergistic effect of undex and wave induced load it is necessary to ensure that the hull girder will not undergo permanent plastic deflection under the action of the undex and wave induced load separately if one of these loads could make the hull girder collapsed the effect of the other cannot be reflected accurately based on the above principle of load selection the numerical calculation method which has been verified in section 2 2 is adopted to determine the reasonable undex case by carrying out a series of numerical analysis 6 load cases of undex under different explosion distances d are listed in table 3 the mass of the charge w remains 0 005 kg for all the cases r max is the maximum radius of bubble and t 1 represents the first pulsation period of bubble it can be found that with the increase of explosion distance there is a modest slowdown trend of the bubble radius and pulsation periods but the reduction is not large the bubble pulsation periods are closed to the first order vertical bending wet mode frequency of the hull girder t 46 9 ms fig 14 shows the time history curves of vertical displacement of point g1 and g2 corresponding to different undex cases the relative displacement between g1 and g2 are also shown in this figure u exp is vertical displacement of measuring points subjected to undex load it can be found from bz case1 and bz case2 that when the explosion distance d is small the hull girder would experience permanent sagging deformation which is consistent with the experimental and numerical results in section 2 2 in bz case1 the vertical deformation of hull girder reaches its largest value at 48 ms during the following two bubble pulsations the relative displacements of g1 and g2 measuring points fluctuate within 0 6 but the sagging deformation remains significant compared to the results from bz case3 to bz case6 it can be seen that with the increase of explosion distances d the hull girder shows obvious dynamic whipping phenomenon in the stage of bubble pulsations the comparison of vertical relative displacement of typical measuring points under different explosion distance d is shown in fig 15 it can be found that the maximum vertical relative displacement of the hull girder decreases gradually with the increase of explosion distances and the vibration period also decreases slightly which is roughly the same as the change of the bubble period in table 3 especially when the d is larger than 0 7 m the whipping phenomenon of the hull girder subjected to undex load is remarkable the main reason for this phenomena is that the initial shock wave load of undex is relatively small because of larger explosion distance d the motion of the hull girder is dominated by the bubble pulsation effect the deformation modes of the hull girder under various cases are shown in fig 16 the numerical results indicate that the sagging deformation of the hull girder in bz case 1 is much more severe than those of the other cases and the plastic hinge occurs at the mid ship with the increase of explosion distance d the sagging deformation of the structure gradually decreases and the maximum stress value also decreases the comparison of the maximum vertical displacement and stress values under various cases are shown in table 4 in which δd max is the maximum vertical relative displacement and σ max represents the maximum stress it can be found that due to the large explosion distance the vertical deformation and maximum stress of the hull girder in bz case6 are the minimum value compared with other cases and the hull girder is still in the linear elastic deformation stage based on the principle of load selection pointed out previously bz case 6 is chosen to participate in the combination analysis of undex and wave induced load in the following sections 4 3 selection of wave case according to the response of the hull girder subjected to the wave induced load in section 3 2 the overall deformation of the structure is quite small it can be noticed that the dimensionless vertical relative displacement between g1 and g2 is only 0 002 and the maximum stress of the hull girder is only 4 03 mpa the reason is that the typical structure employed in this paper mainly used for revealing the dynamic failure mechanism of the hull gird subjected to undex when subjected to the wave induced load has less energy than that of undex the structure just experiences slight response therefore the wave induced loads in numerical simulation need to be amplified to make sure that the effect of the wave induced load can be observed during the process of being combined with undex it should be noted that this kind of adjustment is mainly for investigating the synergetic effect of the undex and wave induced load which may be different from the actual sea state after several trial analyses five load cases are chosen for both hogging and sagging bending conditions which are amplified by 20 40 50 60 80 times respectively based on the wave induced load at hogging and sagging moment calculated in section 3 2 furthermore the smooth loading curve is adopted in the numerical analyses to obtain stable results the numerical results of the vertical relative displacement between g1 and g2 and the stress along the length direction σ x of measuring point g3 subjected to five load cases are obtained in explicit dynamic analysis as shown in fig 17 since g3 is located above the neutral axis of the mid ship section when the hull girder is in sagging condition g3 is in compression state according to the results of fem analyses the maximum vertical relative displacement of g1 and g2 δu max and the maximum stress along the length direction σ x max of measuring point g3 are summarized in fig 18 it is observed that with the increase of the wave induced load the absolute value ofδu max and σ x ma x increase linearly which means the hull girder keeps linear elastic deformation in all wave cases as well taking the value of σ 0 as a reference bl case1 bl case3 and bl case5 are regarded as slight moderate and severe wave levels after comparing with the responses of the hull girder under the above five cases comprehensively fig 19 shows the stress distributions of the hull girder under three different wave levels it can be found that the maximum stress occurs at the side area of the mid ship under the conditions of hogging and sagging the maximum stress of the structure is 155 8 mpa with the wave level regarded as severe which is still in the elastic deformation range 4 4 the effect of the combined loads based on the abaqus explicit multi loads calculation method the dynamic response of the ship hull girder subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load is investigated by combining the selected undex load conditions and three wave levels conditions considering the efficiency of numerical calculation and the duration of wave induced load as well as undex load the numerical analysis period is set as 80 ms in this section according to the combination of multi loads calculation method the hull girder is assumed in hogging or sagging bending condition and then the undex load will be applied under the bz case 6 and three hogging condition wave levels fig 20 shows the vertical relative displacement δu between g1 and g2 the ratio of stress along longitudinal direction σ x of g3 to the yield stress of q235 σ 0 respectively it can be found that the vertical relative displacement of the hull girder increases with the wave induced load strengthened which increases the risk of overall collapse of the hull girder when the wave level is slight or moderate the whipping phenomenon of the ship girder is similar to the case of only bz case 6 the difference related to the magnitude of displacement is mainly caused by the initial deformation under the wave induced load however the hull girder remains hogging bending condition due to the initial obvious deformation of the hull girder under the wave induced load δu h 0 125 when the wave level is severe similar tendencies can also be concluded from the stress history curves as shown in fig 20 b for the initial sagging deformation under the wave induced load shown in fig 21 it can also be seen clearly that with the increase of the wave level the vertical relative displacement of the hull girder under combined load is increasing however when the wave level is severe obvious sagging damage occurs on the hull girder to be specific the dimensionless vertical relative displacement decreases sharply among 52 ms and 80 ms while the other cases show an upward trend besides the dimensionless maximum stress along the length direction of measuring point g3 drop to 1 15 which is larger than the yield stress of q235 in order to show the dynamic collapse process of the hull girder subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load more clearly the case of severe wave level is taken as an example for the following analysis firstly there is initial sagging deformation and stress of the hull girder subjected to the wave load at 0 ms as shown in fig 22 a on this basis the hull girder is subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load fig 22 b c and d show the weakening of sagging deformation caused by the shock wave of undex the increase of sagging deformation caused by bubble negative pressure and the hogging deformation induced by the positive pressure of bubble respectively in the negative pressure stage of the second bubble pulsation obvious sagging collapse of the hull girder occurs as shown in fig 22 f those results reveal that the hull girder is more dangerous under the combined undex and wave induced load especially in the severe wave level due to the cumulative effect of plastic damage the deformation level of the hull girder is more significant than that of the first bubble pulsation stage subjected to the combination of the secondary pulsating negative pressure of the bubble and the sagging wave load which increases the risk of sagging damage of the hull girder greatly 5 discussions the sagging collapse phenomenon can be found clearly when the hull girder is subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load from the above investigation however the damage severity will be significantly underestimated if the synergistic effect is not included the chain lines in fig 23 represent the linear adding principle of displacement which means adding the maximum vertical displacement induced by the undex and wave induced load together by comparing the synergistic effect and linear adding principle of displacement it can be found that even though the maximum vertical displacement induced by the undex and wave induced load are combined together it is still much smaller than the maximum hogging or sagging deformation induced by the combined load which indicates that the synergistic effect will cause more serious damage to the hull girder the maximum values of the dimensionless vertical relative hogging and sagging displacement under various conditions are shown in fig 24 respectively the green dotted line represents the maximum dimensionless vertical relative displacement of the hull girder 0 0725 in bz case 6 while the blue chain line is obtained by adding the above value with the maximum deformation under three levels of wave as the results of the previous analysis the effect of the combined load is greater than the added value of the displacement response in addition when the hull girder suffers a slight level of undex load which means the initial shock wave load of undex is relatively small and the motion of the hull girder is dominated by the bubble pulsation effect a steady growth trend is maintained with the increase of wave level however when the initial state is sagging deformation an inflection point will appear in the displacement response of the hull girder subjected to the combined load as shown in fig 24 b it can be found that the vertical deformation of the hull girder decreases sharply from the inflection point the previous analysis shows that the negative pressure load of the undex bubble will cause sagging damage of the hull girder for the hull girder with hogging deformation the effect of bubble negative pressure is to make it fall back to horizontal position first and then sagging deformation occurs as shown from the blue dash line in fig 20 a however when the initial state is sagging deformation the negative pressure bubble load will continue to cause more severe deformation and even sagging collapse based on the original sagging deformation this indicates that the hull girder will be more dangerous in the case to be subjected to undex load when the sagging deformation occurs under the wave induced load 6 conclusion in this paper a hts calculation procedure to solve the dynamic response of the structure under wave induced load is proposed in addition multi steps analysis and calculation method in abaqus combining with hts calculation procedure is adopted to investigate the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to undex and wave induced load the synergistic effect of the combined load on the dynamic response of the loaded structure is discussed the conclusions are summarized as follow 1 the hull girder is more dangerous under the combined undex and wave induced load especially in the severe wave level due to the cumulative effect of plastic damage the degree of deformation of the hull girder is more significant than that of the first bubble pulsation stage subjected to the combination of the secondary pulsating negative pressure of the bubble and the sagging wave load 2 if the synergistic effect is not considered the damage severity of the hull girder will be underestimated even though the maximum vertical displacement induced by the undex and wave induced load are added together it is still much smaller than the maximum hogging or sagging deformation induced by the combined load which indicates that the synergistic effect will cause more serious damage to the hull girder 3 for the hull girder with hogging deformation the effect of bubble negative pressure is to make it fall back to horizontal position first and then sagging deformation occurs however when the initial state is sagging deformation the negative pressure bubble load will continue to cause more severe deformation and even sagging collapse on the basis of the original sagging deformation credit authorship contribution statement

20512,underwater explosion undex is one of the major threats to the vitality and sustained combat ability of the warship in the marine military confrontation with both attack and defense although there have been plenty of researches focusing on the undex load and its damage effect the failure mechanism of the structure under the combined undex and wave induced load especially in extreme sea conditions is still unrevealed in this paper a method for calculating the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load is proposed in which the acoustic structure interaction method was employed for determining the undex load and the wave induced response of hull girder was derived by using hydrodynamic to structure hts calculation procedure the synergistic effect of the combination of different levels of wave induced load and the underwater explosion was analyzed it is found that the hull girder is more dangerous under the combined undex and wave induced load especially in the severe wave level the damage severity of the hull girder will be underestimated without considering the synergistic effect of the combined loads keywords underwater explosion wave induced load synergistic effect hull girder dynamic response 1 introduction underwater explosion undex is one of the most concerned topics in the impact engineering which poses a serious threat to the safety and integrity of warships cole 1948 keil 1961 shurshalov 1974 during the undex event it can be recognized as two types of time dependent loads shock wave and bubble pulsation zong 2003 2005 although the pressure induced by the intensive shock is very large the effect on the hull girder s global strength is not significant due to the short duration however it usually causes local structural damage in fact pegg 1994 kwon et al 1993 hsu et al 2015 the bubble pulsation has great impact on the global longitudinal strength of the hull girder it may even lead to an overall hull collapse especially when the pulse duration is close to the natural frequency of the ship hull geers and hunter 2002 holloway et al 2004 chen et al 2009 although the peak pressure of the undex bubble pulsation is only around 10 20 of the shock wave pressure it has a similar amount of total impulse compared to that of the shock wave in the case of a non contact underwater explosion the bubble pulsation may cause an overall dynamic response of the hull girder when the duration of the bubble pulsation approaches the eigen frequency of the hull structure wang et al 2014 thus the explosion bubble hydrodynamic response has been one of the most concerned research topics in this field zhang et al 1993 wang et al 1996 hicks 1986 analyzed the elastic response of the hull girder under the undex bubble pulse based on the hydroelastic theory and timoshenko beam model the potential flow theory was employed to predict the whipping phenomenon of a typical warship subjected to undex bubble pulse zhang et al 2007 2008 2011 2013 2017 and cui et al 2016 investigated the nonlinear interaction between bubble and structure based on the fully coupled model and the method for calculating the dynamic bending moment of the structure caused by the bubble pulse was also proposed generally the ship structure was simplified as a hull girder when study the global dynamic response subjected to the undex zhang et al 2012 2014 2015 the hydrodynamic load should also be taken into consideration when analyzing the damage of the hull structure the progressive collapse behavior of ship hull subjected to wave induced loads was analyzed by pei et al 2015 and iijima et al 2011 the total damage of full scale ship was conducted by numerical simulation method which illustrated the evolution of deformation and damage of the ship under certain condition zhang et al 2011 zong et al 2013 however in fact the ship would experience the underwater explosion impact and the wave induced load simultaneously which has rarely been discussed before the synergistic effects caused by the combination of different types of loads would lead to the dynamic collapse of the hull girder which threatens the vitality of the ship seriously recently liu et al 2018 performed a numerical investigation on global responses of surface ship subjected to underwater explosion in waves and the interaction model for considering the nonlinear coupling between the fluid and structure solvers was established it worthy noted that the study considered the influence of wave shape on the dynamic response of the ship hull primarily in which the synergistic effect of undex and the wave induced load was not taken into consideration the overall collapse mechanism of the hull girder subjected to such combined load was still unrevealed in this paper the hull girder model of a ship was employed to investigate the characteristics of dynamic response subjected to combined undex and wave induced load firstly the acoustical structure coupling method in abaqus was used to calculate the response of the girder model caused by the impact load from undex numerically and this numerical procedure was validated by employing the test results meanwhile the hydrodynamic to structure hts calculation method was proposed to solve the dynamic response of the structure under wave induced load and it was also validated by comparing the calculated results with experimentally obtained data additionally multi steps analysis was performed to investigate the synergistic effect of undex and wave induced load on the dynamic response of the hull girder model 2 numerical model and validation of undex calculation method 2 1 overview of model in this section the acoustical structure coupling method in abaqus was employed to predict the dynamic response of the simplified hull girder model subjected to the undex load the results of experiment performed by wang et al 2014 were utilized to validate the accuracy of the numerical calculation method the model is designed as ship type box to discuss the dynamic response of ship structures subjected to close in non contact undex load the experimental model of the hull girder and its relevant dimensions are listed in fig 1 and table 1 respectively beyond that the weight distribution of the experiment model is uniform distributed along the ship length in the numerical simulation the hull girder model and the external flow region were modeled as s4r and acoustic medium element ac3d8r ac3d4 ac3d6 respectively as shown in fig 2 it should be noted that the diameter of cross section of flow region is taken as 6 times of the breadth of hull girder and the size of the acoustic medium elements which are connected with the hull girder should be smaller than that of the hull girder elements yao et al 2005 the length breadth and depth directions are denoted as x y and z respectively the finite element model of the hull girder consists of 6470 quadrilateral elements and 6650 nodes while the finite element model of the flow region consists of 688500 elements and 375531 nodes the bilinear elastic plastic constitutive model was adopted for the material of hull girder which is modified by cowper symonds c s model 1 σ d σ 0 e e h e e h ε p 1 ε d 1 p where σ 0 is the static yield strength e h represents the strain hardening modulus ε p and ε donate the effective plastic strain and the equivalent plastic strain rate respectively the constants d and p correspond to 40 4 s 1 and 5 for q235 steel respectively paik and thayamballi 2003 2 2 validation of the numerical method 2 2 1 natural frequencies of dry and wet mode in order to obtain the vibration modes of the structure and the corresponding vibration frequencies the linear perturbation analysis of the hull girder was carried out as shown in fig 3 the acoustical structure coupling method in abaqus introduced above was adopted to calculate the wet mode of the hull girder which employs the acoustic medium to simulate the flow region and connects the acoustic elements representing the aqueous medium to the hull girder through the tie interaction method to simulate the actual water adhesion effect on the wet surface of the hull girder the results of the first order vertical bending frequencies of the hull girder are compared in table 2 it can be found that the wet mode frequency of the hull girder is obviously lower than that of the dry mode frequency corresponding to the eigen frequency of the hull girder in the air which is caused by the influence of the attached water on the wet surface of the hull in the flow region the added mass caused by the attached water dominates this phenomenon the numerical results of the first order vertical bending wet mode frequency of the hull girder are in good agreement with experimental value according to the wang et al 2014 as can also be seen in table 2 2 2 2 deformation modes the dynamic failure of the hull girder subjected to the bubble pulsation load is mainly concerned in the underwater explosive based on the research in the previous section the abaqus acoustical structure coupling method is further used to simulate the dynamic response of the hull girder under the undex load according to the experimental set up described by wang et al 2014 0 005 kg tnt is deployed 0 3 m away below the location of the amidships the corresponding calculated bubble pulsation period is 50 2 ms therefore the calculation time is set more than two times of bubble pulsation periods which is taken as 0 12 s the deformation modes of the hull girder in experimental and simulation results at typical moments are shown in fig 4 in the initial stage shock wave induced small hog deformation after back to the horizontal position the hull girder has significant sag deformation due to the bubble pulsation load the obvious plastic hinge is produced at amidship of the structure while the plates of the other parts are in a rigid state without obvious plastic deformations due to the strain rate effect the maximum stress is 264 mpa at 12 ms which has exceeded the static yield stress σ 0 of the q235 steel however the overall deformation of the hull girder is not obvious as shown in fig 4 a after the shock wave stage the hull girder was loaded by the negative pressure from the bubble and spring back to the horizontal position at 24 ms while the maximum stress area converged at the amidships at this time the maximum stress value was 289 mpa as shown in fig 4 b as the bubble negative pressure continues a plastic hinge produced in the mid ship with a maximum stress value of 368 mpa and the overall sagging collapse occurred as shown in fig 4 c fig 5 shows the strain history curves at the same place of the amidships from experiment and numerical simulation the location of the strain records has been indicated as g3 marked in fig 11 it can be found that the compressive strain after 48 ms are much larger than that before 12 ms which reflects the permanent sagging deformation caused by gas bubble load after the slight hogging deformation caused by shock wave pressure in addition the strain changed slightly after the plastic hinge formed on the hull girder it can be found that the deformation modes and strain history agreed well between experimental and simulation results at each typical moment which verifies the accuracy and reliability of the acoustical structure coupling method in calculating the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to the undex load 3 dynamic response of hull girder subjected to wave induced load in the present study a hydrodynamic to structure hts calculation method is utilized to calculate the wave induced load and the dynamic response analysis the flowchart of this method is shown in fig 6 the time history of pressure distribution and inertial force on the wetted surface of the hull girder are determined by hydrostar then the calculated results are converted into the feasible load data in explicit dynamic analysis by homer code finally the structural response of the hull girder subjected to the wave induced load can be calculated in abaqus thus the distributions of the external pressure on the wetted surface of the hull girder can be obtained accurately through the calculation of the hydrodynamic load program the traditional method of applying fixed angle is only an ideally simplified method which cannot reflect the real collapse process of the hull girder moreover the hydrodynamic load results can be extracted into the finite element program to participate in the analysis of the structural response which is conducive to the numerical simulation under the case of multi loads combination 3 1 theoretical background the hydrodynamic load can be extracted by hydrostar software based on the boundary element method the pressures are integrated over the wetted body surface and the hydrodynamic coefficients are calculated so that the ship s motion can be expressed as follows 2 ω 2 m a i ω b c ξ f d i f e where m and a donate genuine mass matrix and added mass matrix b and c are the damping matrix and hydrostatic restoring matrix f d i and f e are the excitation force vector and other external forces vector ξ is the body motion vector the generalized excitation force vector can be decomposed into incident diffracted and 6 radiated components 3 f d i i ω ρ ϕ n d s i ω ρ ϕ i ϕ d i ω j 1 6 ξ j ϕ r j n d s the solution of this equation gives the amplitudes of the body motions and the linear problem is formally solved the wetted body surfaces are discretized into sufficient number of panels over which the constant source distribution is assumed the load can be transferred from the hydrodynamic model to the structural finite element model in section 4 3 2 wave load calculation the hydrodynamic code hydrostar is employed to calculate the frequency response of the hull girder in regular waves of unit amplitude in head wave as shown in fig 7 the wave bending moment at the amidships section reaches the maximum value when the wave frequency is 4 6 rad s and the bending moment of other sections also reach the maximum near this frequency therefore the wave frequency is set as 4 6 rad s namely the corresponding wave period is 1 36 s and the wavelength is 2 91 m in order to obtain accurate load on each element of the hull girder at each time step including hydrodynamic pressure gravity and inertial force the pressure history of each element are obtained by homer hydrostar with a time interval of 0 01 s under head wave without forward speed the pressure time history at the amidships position under wave height of 0 08 m in a wave period is shown in fig 8 in which it is found that the positive pressure at the amidships element reach the peak value at 0 34 s while the hull girder corresponded to the hogging state the negative pressure at the amidships element fall back to the minimum value at 1 02 s while the hull girder being in the state of sagging it can be seen clearly from fig 9 the pressure direction is downward within 1 4 of the hull girder wetted surface from left to right which indicates that the gravity of the structure within this range is larger than the wave pressure including hydrostatic pressure and hydrodynamic pressure and the resultant direction is downward the direction of arrow while in the range of 1 4 to 3 4 the wave pressure is larger than the gravity of the structure so the direction of resultant force is upward from the overall point of view the pressure of mid ship is upward the pressure at both ends is downward and the hull girder shows the hogging deformation afterwards which will be verified in the next section 3 3 numerical simulation and analysis according to the hts calculation procedure of the wave induced load based on homer hydrostar the load data of each element are imported into abaqus explicit for calculating the structural response from the aspect of the relative motion between the wave and the hull girder it can be understood that the hull girder is in a static state and the wave crest moves from the left end to the right end of the hull girder as shown in fig 10 it can be observed from fig 10 a that when the wave crest located at the left quarter cross section of the hull girder the structure deformed upwards accordingly with the wave crest moves to the mid ship at 0 34 s hogging bending occurs at this moment as shown in fig 10 b the similar phenomenon can be found in fig 10 c and d which indicates that the proposed calculation procedure in this paper can solve the response process of the hull girder subjected to the wave induced load in explicit dynamic analysis in addition the maximum stress of the hull girder subjected to the wave load is only 4 03 mpa and the deformation of the hull girder is completely in the linear elastic range to observe the motion response of the hull girder at different locations two displacement measuring points are arranged as shown in fig 11 the measuring point g1 is located at the center of bottom hull plate while g2 is located in the bottom of stem bulkhead by comparing the vertical relative displacements of the two measuring points under different cases the deformation of the hull girder can be reflected clearly the stress measuring point g3 is also marked in fig 11 to monitor the stress time history on the broadside of the mid ship in order to observe the motion of the hull girder subjected to the wave induced load the dimensionless vertical displacement time history of the mid ship section is plotted in fig 12 in which δu w is the vertical relative displacement between g1 and g2 it can be found that the vertical displacement curve of the mid ship node is composed by the superposition of two sinusoidal functions with different frequencies among which the low frequency curve and the high frequency curve represent the wave frequency component and the high frequency vibration component induced by the wave load respectively it is clear that the frequency of the high vibrational component is 22 3 hz which is very close to the wet frequency 21 313 hz of the hull girder in section 2 2 it reveals that the wave induced load applied by the proposed calculation procedure in this paper can stimulate the vertical first order vibration of the hull girder furthermore the hull girder undergoes hogging and sagging bending deformation in a wave period which is consistent with the corresponding stages as demonstrated in fig 10 4 dynamic response of hull girder subjected to combined undex and wave induced load 4 1 multi loads calculation method based on abaqus explicit in this section multi steps analysis and calculation method in the commercial software abaqus is adopted to investigate the dynamic response of hull girder subjected to combined multi loads which was also applied in our previous research kong et al 2021 the fluid pressure exported from the hydrostar is used to calculated the structural responses of the finite element model since the loading period of undex is far less than that of wave induced load it can be considered that the wave induced load on the hull girder remains unchanged within the period of undex it should be noted that the influence of undex process on wave induced load is not considered in this paper for the cases of hogging and sagging bending the pressure and inertia forces on the wetted surface of the hull girder are obtained from homer hydrostar firstly then the wave induced load is loaded by smooth amplitude curve as shown in the step 1 of fig 13 at t 1 moment the hull girder is under the hogging or sagging bending condition and then the undex load will be applied until t 2 it should be noticed that the wave induced load still exists during t 1 to t 2 to make sure that the hull girder is subjected to combined undex and wave induced load 4 2 selection of undex case in this section a series of numerical analysis of undex cases are carried out in order to clarify the influence of the synergistic effect of undex and wave induced load it is necessary to ensure that the hull girder will not undergo permanent plastic deflection under the action of the undex and wave induced load separately if one of these loads could make the hull girder collapsed the effect of the other cannot be reflected accurately based on the above principle of load selection the numerical calculation method which has been verified in section 2 2 is adopted to determine the reasonable undex case by carrying out a series of numerical analysis 6 load cases of undex under different explosion distances d are listed in table 3 the mass of the charge w remains 0 005 kg for all the cases r max is the maximum radius of bubble and t 1 represents the first pulsation period of bubble it can be found that with the increase of explosion distance there is a modest slowdown trend of the bubble radius and pulsation periods but the reduction is not large the bubble pulsation periods are closed to the first order vertical bending wet mode frequency of the hull girder t 46 9 ms fig 14 shows the time history curves of vertical displacement of point g1 and g2 corresponding to different undex cases the relative displacement between g1 and g2 are also shown in this figure u exp is vertical displacement of measuring points subjected to undex load it can be found from bz case1 and bz case2 that when the explosion distance d is small the hull girder would experience permanent sagging deformation which is consistent with the experimental and numerical results in section 2 2 in bz case1 the vertical deformation of hull girder reaches its largest value at 48 ms during the following two bubble pulsations the relative displacements of g1 and g2 measuring points fluctuate within 0 6 but the sagging deformation remains significant compared to the results from bz case3 to bz case6 it can be seen that with the increase of explosion distances d the hull girder shows obvious dynamic whipping phenomenon in the stage of bubble pulsations the comparison of vertical relative displacement of typical measuring points under different explosion distance d is shown in fig 15 it can be found that the maximum vertical relative displacement of the hull girder decreases gradually with the increase of explosion distances and the vibration period also decreases slightly which is roughly the same as the change of the bubble period in table 3 especially when the d is larger than 0 7 m the whipping phenomenon of the hull girder subjected to undex load is remarkable the main reason for this phenomena is that the initial shock wave load of undex is relatively small because of larger explosion distance d the motion of the hull girder is dominated by the bubble pulsation effect the deformation modes of the hull girder under various cases are shown in fig 16 the numerical results indicate that the sagging deformation of the hull girder in bz case 1 is much more severe than those of the other cases and the plastic hinge occurs at the mid ship with the increase of explosion distance d the sagging deformation of the structure gradually decreases and the maximum stress value also decreases the comparison of the maximum vertical displacement and stress values under various cases are shown in table 4 in which δd max is the maximum vertical relative displacement and σ max represents the maximum stress it can be found that due to the large explosion distance the vertical deformation and maximum stress of the hull girder in bz case6 are the minimum value compared with other cases and the hull girder is still in the linear elastic deformation stage based on the principle of load selection pointed out previously bz case 6 is chosen to participate in the combination analysis of undex and wave induced load in the following sections 4 3 selection of wave case according to the response of the hull girder subjected to the wave induced load in section 3 2 the overall deformation of the structure is quite small it can be noticed that the dimensionless vertical relative displacement between g1 and g2 is only 0 002 and the maximum stress of the hull girder is only 4 03 mpa the reason is that the typical structure employed in this paper mainly used for revealing the dynamic failure mechanism of the hull gird subjected to undex when subjected to the wave induced load has less energy than that of undex the structure just experiences slight response therefore the wave induced loads in numerical simulation need to be amplified to make sure that the effect of the wave induced load can be observed during the process of being combined with undex it should be noted that this kind of adjustment is mainly for investigating the synergetic effect of the undex and wave induced load which may be different from the actual sea state after several trial analyses five load cases are chosen for both hogging and sagging bending conditions which are amplified by 20 40 50 60 80 times respectively based on the wave induced load at hogging and sagging moment calculated in section 3 2 furthermore the smooth loading curve is adopted in the numerical analyses to obtain stable results the numerical results of the vertical relative displacement between g1 and g2 and the stress along the length direction σ x of measuring point g3 subjected to five load cases are obtained in explicit dynamic analysis as shown in fig 17 since g3 is located above the neutral axis of the mid ship section when the hull girder is in sagging condition g3 is in compression state according to the results of fem analyses the maximum vertical relative displacement of g1 and g2 δu max and the maximum stress along the length direction σ x max of measuring point g3 are summarized in fig 18 it is observed that with the increase of the wave induced load the absolute value ofδu max and σ x ma x increase linearly which means the hull girder keeps linear elastic deformation in all wave cases as well taking the value of σ 0 as a reference bl case1 bl case3 and bl case5 are regarded as slight moderate and severe wave levels after comparing with the responses of the hull girder under the above five cases comprehensively fig 19 shows the stress distributions of the hull girder under three different wave levels it can be found that the maximum stress occurs at the side area of the mid ship under the conditions of hogging and sagging the maximum stress of the structure is 155 8 mpa with the wave level regarded as severe which is still in the elastic deformation range 4 4 the effect of the combined loads based on the abaqus explicit multi loads calculation method the dynamic response of the ship hull girder subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load is investigated by combining the selected undex load conditions and three wave levels conditions considering the efficiency of numerical calculation and the duration of wave induced load as well as undex load the numerical analysis period is set as 80 ms in this section according to the combination of multi loads calculation method the hull girder is assumed in hogging or sagging bending condition and then the undex load will be applied under the bz case 6 and three hogging condition wave levels fig 20 shows the vertical relative displacement δu between g1 and g2 the ratio of stress along longitudinal direction σ x of g3 to the yield stress of q235 σ 0 respectively it can be found that the vertical relative displacement of the hull girder increases with the wave induced load strengthened which increases the risk of overall collapse of the hull girder when the wave level is slight or moderate the whipping phenomenon of the ship girder is similar to the case of only bz case 6 the difference related to the magnitude of displacement is mainly caused by the initial deformation under the wave induced load however the hull girder remains hogging bending condition due to the initial obvious deformation of the hull girder under the wave induced load δu h 0 125 when the wave level is severe similar tendencies can also be concluded from the stress history curves as shown in fig 20 b for the initial sagging deformation under the wave induced load shown in fig 21 it can also be seen clearly that with the increase of the wave level the vertical relative displacement of the hull girder under combined load is increasing however when the wave level is severe obvious sagging damage occurs on the hull girder to be specific the dimensionless vertical relative displacement decreases sharply among 52 ms and 80 ms while the other cases show an upward trend besides the dimensionless maximum stress along the length direction of measuring point g3 drop to 1 15 which is larger than the yield stress of q235 in order to show the dynamic collapse process of the hull girder subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load more clearly the case of severe wave level is taken as an example for the following analysis firstly there is initial sagging deformation and stress of the hull girder subjected to the wave load at 0 ms as shown in fig 22 a on this basis the hull girder is subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load fig 22 b c and d show the weakening of sagging deformation caused by the shock wave of undex the increase of sagging deformation caused by bubble negative pressure and the hogging deformation induced by the positive pressure of bubble respectively in the negative pressure stage of the second bubble pulsation obvious sagging collapse of the hull girder occurs as shown in fig 22 f those results reveal that the hull girder is more dangerous under the combined undex and wave induced load especially in the severe wave level due to the cumulative effect of plastic damage the deformation level of the hull girder is more significant than that of the first bubble pulsation stage subjected to the combination of the secondary pulsating negative pressure of the bubble and the sagging wave load which increases the risk of sagging damage of the hull girder greatly 5 discussions the sagging collapse phenomenon can be found clearly when the hull girder is subjected to the combined undex and wave induced load from the above investigation however the damage severity will be significantly underestimated if the synergistic effect is not included the chain lines in fig 23 represent the linear adding principle of displacement which means adding the maximum vertical displacement induced by the undex and wave induced load together by comparing the synergistic effect and linear adding principle of displacement it can be found that even though the maximum vertical displacement induced by the undex and wave induced load are combined together it is still much smaller than the maximum hogging or sagging deformation induced by the combined load which indicates that the synergistic effect will cause more serious damage to the hull girder the maximum values of the dimensionless vertical relative hogging and sagging displacement under various conditions are shown in fig 24 respectively the green dotted line represents the maximum dimensionless vertical relative displacement of the hull girder 0 0725 in bz case 6 while the blue chain line is obtained by adding the above value with the maximum deformation under three levels of wave as the results of the previous analysis the effect of the combined load is greater than the added value of the displacement response in addition when the hull girder suffers a slight level of undex load which means the initial shock wave load of undex is relatively small and the motion of the hull girder is dominated by the bubble pulsation effect a steady growth trend is maintained with the increase of wave level however when the initial state is sagging deformation an inflection point will appear in the displacement response of the hull girder subjected to the combined load as shown in fig 24 b it can be found that the vertical deformation of the hull girder decreases sharply from the inflection point the previous analysis shows that the negative pressure load of the undex bubble will cause sagging damage of the hull girder for the hull girder with hogging deformation the effect of bubble negative pressure is to make it fall back to horizontal position first and then sagging deformation occurs as shown from the blue dash line in fig 20 a however when the initial state is sagging deformation the negative pressure bubble load will continue to cause more severe deformation and even sagging collapse based on the original sagging deformation this indicates that the hull girder will be more dangerous in the case to be subjected to undex load when the sagging deformation occurs under the wave induced load 6 conclusion in this paper a hts calculation procedure to solve the dynamic response of the structure under wave induced load is proposed in addition multi steps analysis and calculation method in abaqus combining with hts calculation procedure is adopted to investigate the dynamic response of the hull girder subjected to undex and wave induced load the synergistic effect of the combined load on the dynamic response of the loaded structure is discussed the conclusions are summarized as follow 1 the hull girder is more dangerous under the combined undex and wave induced load especially in the severe wave level due to the cumulative effect of plastic damage the degree of deformation of the hull girder is more significant than that of the first bubble pulsation stage subjected to the combination of the secondary pulsating negative pressure of the bubble and the sagging wave load 2 if the synergistic effect is not considered the damage severity of the hull girder will be underestimated even though the maximum vertical displacement induced by the undex and wave induced load are added together it is still much smaller than the maximum hogging or sagging deformation induced by the combined load which indicates that the synergistic effect will cause more serious damage to the hull girder 3 for the hull girder with hogging deformation the effect of bubble negative pressure is to make it fall back to horizontal position first and then sagging deformation occurs however when the initial state is sagging deformation the negative pressure bubble load will continue to cause more severe deformation and even sagging collapse on the basis of the original sagging deformation credit authorship contribution statement

20513,langmuir supercells ls are full depth langmuir circulations in unstratified shallow shelves a reynolds averaged eulerian formulation is developed resolving ls as a secondary component to the wind driven mean shear current this formulation is combined with lagrangian particle tracking to investigate oil droplet entrainment induced by ls as a function of wind stress two cases are simulated one in which 500 μm oil droplets are released into a steady field of ls generated by a wind stress of 0 1 n m 2 and waves of intermediate wavelength λ 6 h where h 15 m is the water column depth significant amplitude of 0 6 m and period of 8 s in the second case the 500 μm oil droplets are released into a steady field of ls generated by the same wave forcing but with a weaker wind stress of 0 025 n m 2 it is found that the greater wind stress leads to ls able to spread the droplets throughout upwelling and downwelling limbs of the cells within the first 80 minutes after release the weaker wind leads to weaker ls that within the same time after release limit the dispersion of the droplets to the downwelling limbs of the cells forming stommel retention zones for a prolonged time keywords langmuir supercells vertical dispersion oil droplets discrete random walk model 1 introduction turbulence in the upper ocean is generated by a combination of surface winds surface wave breaking wave current interaction and surface buoyancy wave current interaction gives rise to langmuir turbulence characterized by a wide range of langmuir circulation lc scales parallel counter rotating vortices roughly aligned in the direction of the wind an lc vortex pair is sketched in fig 1 wind speeds greater than approximately 3 m s 1 and winds roughly parallel to waves provide favorable conditions for the generation of langmuir turbulence the turbulence consists of small langmuir scales emanating from the water surface which over time on the order of tens of minutes grow in depth and width typically reaching the base of the mixed layer in the upper ocean or the bottom of the water column in homogenous shallow water this has been shown to be the case by skyllingstad and denbo 1995 for the upper ocean mixed layer it is well known that lc plays a major role towards the maintenance of the upper ocean mixed layer thorpe 2004 in the case of the shallow coastal ocean 10 20 meters in depth the field measurements of gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 have shown that during the passage of storms when the water column becomes homogenous lc can span the entire depth of the water column full depth lc has been denoted as langmuir supercells or ls due to their strong impact on the turbulence dynamics throughout the entire water column furthermore the structure of coastal ls differs from the structure of ordinary lc in the upper ocean mixed layer with ls being more coherent and intense shrestha et al 2018 gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 have shown that ls promote sediment re suspension by sweeping sediments towards the bottom convergences of the vortices where the upwelling limbs of the cells can transport the particles upwards into the water column surface oil slicks are commonly treated with dispersants to disintegrate the oil into droplets droplets may also form due to the persistent buffeting of surface breaking waves the droplets can then be entrained and dispersed throughout the water column via the action of lc as shown by farmer and li 1994 the downwelling limbs of the counter rotating vortices can exert vertical speeds greater than the buoyant rise speed of the droplets giving rise to submerged zones where the oil droplets can be retained for extended periods in what is referred to as stommel retention zones srzs such retention zones were originally postulated by stommel 1949 thus vertical dispersion of oil may be greatly enhanced during episodes of lc furthermore in the case of an oil spill in coastal regions given the observations of gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 ls should serve as a mechanism for simultaneous entrainment of oil droplets and resuspension of sediments such instances could potentially lead to increased mixing between the sediments and oil and ultimately to the formation of oil particle aggregates opas at offshore locations opas are often thought to be formed near shore where sediments and oil come in direct contact farmer and li 1994 developed a model for oil droplet dispersion by lc the model was based on an analytical representation of the largest lc scale with lagrangian tracking of oil droplets via a random walk method they found that over time the oil droplets can be homogenized about the srz due to the turbulence the homogenization time depends on the inputted eddy viscosity associated with the langmuir turbulence and physical characteristics of the oil droplets in this manuscript an eulerian reynolds averaged based methodology is introduced enabling a more accurate representation of lc than the analytical representation of farmer and li 1994 without the need to resort to more computationally intensive approaches such as large eddy simulation les the methodology is used to track oil droplets released at the water column surface in the presence of ls the methodology relies on the coherency and persistence of ls here these cells are treated as a secondary component to the wind and or pressure gradient driven primary flow as such the reynolds averaged flow equations and the mesh are designed to resolve both the primary flow and the ls with the turbulence model accounting for the unresolved smaller langmuir scales in the new methodology the flow equations consist of the reynolds averaged incompressible navier stokes equations augmented with the craik leibovich c l vortex force parameterizing the wave current interaction generating lc craik and leibovich 1976 the c l vortex force allows for simulations to be performed with a flat surface i e without resolution of the surface gravity waves that generate lc mathematically the c l vortex force consists of the cross product between the stokes drift velocity induced by surface gravity waves and the resolved flow vorticity the c l vortex force is representative of the stokes drift tilting of vertical vorticity associated with lateral shear towards the along wind direction resulting in lc turbulence closure in the reynolds averaged formulation developed consists of the standard k epsilon model updated to account for production of turbulent kinetic energy by stokes drift shear and non local transport induced by ls the reynolds averaged methodology for computing the flow described above differs from previous methodologies dealing with langmuir turbulence oftentimes langmuir turbulence is computed via les in which a majority of the langmuir scales are resolved a second approach more suitable to either general ocean circulation modeling or single water column modeling is based on reynolds averaging in which none of the langmuir scales including the largest lc scales are resolved and the turbulence model is left to account for the impact of the langmuir turbulence on the resolved mean flow the present methodology is based on reynolds averaging just as the previously described approach however the largest langmuir scales in this case the full depth ls are resolved in this manuscript the new methodology will be used to investigate the vertical dispersion of oil droplets caused by ls the new methodology computes the flow comprised of the mean flow plus the secondary ls structure and the eddy viscosity and turbulent kinetic energy predicted by the k epsilon model are used to perform lagrangian tracking of oil droplets through a discrete random walk drw method the drw approach of gosman and ioannides 1983 is adopted in which the unresolved random fluctuations of the droplet trajectories are calculated by modeling the interaction between the droplets with randomly generated eddies that fit the statistics of the turbulence velocity component root mean square and eddy lifetimes as predicted by the turbulence model javaherchi and aliseda 2016 2 reynolds averaged flow equations and turbulence model the eulerian equations of fluid motion consist of the incompressible reynolds averaged continuity equation and the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation in 1 and 2 respectively with the rans equation augmented with the c l vortex force parameterizing the generation of lc by the wave current interaction 1 u

the x 1 x 2 and x 3 directions are the downwind crosswind and vertical directions respectively the last term on the right side of equation 2 is the c l vortex force consisting of the cross product

appearing in 2 and 3 will be taken to be purely aligned in the downwind direction and thus its components along the crosswind and vertical directions are zero the downwind component follows the definition given by phillips 1966 u 2 s u 3 s 0 4 u 1 s σ k a 2 cosh 2 k x 3 2 sinh 2 k h where h is the water column depth and σ k and a are the dominant frequency wavenumber and amplitude

et al 2014 in 5 the eddy viscosity is modeled based on the k epsilon closure 6 ν t c μ k 2 ε where k and ε are the turbulent kinetic energy tke and tke dissipation rate respectively note that this eddy viscosity is used for the momentum equation in all three directions following the standard k epsilon model the tke and tke dissipation rate are obtained by solving the following transport

the reynolds stress in 9 is closed using the expression in 5 the values of the coefficients appearing in 6 7 and 8 are c μ 0 09 σ k 1 σ ε 1 3 c 1 ε 1 44 and c 1 ε 1 92 wilcox 1994 in the simulations to be presented below the mean flow fields such as u i contain the resolved mean wind driven flow and the largest of the langmuir cells while the fluctuating components such as u i contain the smaller unresolved scales 3 lagrangian particle tracking equations the lagrangian discrete phase model used to track oil droplets follows the euler lagrange approach the fluid phase is treated as a continuum by solving the navier stokes equations as described earlier while the dispersed phase is solved by tracking individual particles through the calculated flow field in the lagrangian discrete phase model the trajectory of a discrete phase particle is predicted by integrating the force balance on each particle which is written in a lagrangian reference frame this force balance equates the particle inertia with the forces i e drag and buoyancy acting on the particle given as boufadel et al 2018 cui et al 2018 2020 10 d u p d t 3 4 ρ ρ p d p c d u u p u u p k ˆ g ρ p ρ ρ p where u is the fluid velocity u p is the oil droplet particle velocity ρ p is the particle density ρ is the fluid density d p is the particle diameter g is the gravity acceleration and k ˆ is the unit vector in the vertical direction the drag coefficient c d in eq 10 is taken following morsi and alexander 1972 as 11 c d 0 4 24 r e p 6 1 r e p where r e p is the relative reynolds number defined as 12 r e p ρ p d p u u p μ with μ the molecular dynamic viscosity of the fluid recall that the fluid phase velocity can be decomposed into mean velocity u and fluctuation velocity u as 13 u u u the mean velocity u can be obtained from solution of the rans equations described earlier the cartesian components of the velocity fluctuation u u 1 u 2 u 2 are defined through a drw model gosman and ioannides 1983 javaherchi and aliseda 2017 given as 14 u i ξ i 2 k 3 where k is local turbulent kinetic energy and ξ i is a random number following a zero mean unit variance normal distribution the particle is assumed to interact with the fluid phase eddy over the smaller of the eddy lifetime and eddy crossing time when this time is reached a new value of the instantaneous velocity is obtained by applying a new value of ξ i in eq 14 the eddy lifetime is defined as 15 t l 2 c l k ε where c l 0 15 is an empirical constant and ε is the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate the eddy cross time is defined as 16 t c τ p ln 1 l e τ p u u p where l e is the eddy length scale and can be estimated as 17 l e c μ 3 4 k 3 2 ε where the empirical constant c μ 0 9 as before the particle relaxation time τ p is given by 18 τ p ρ p d p 2 18 μ w where d p is the particle diameter if l e τ p u u p eq 16 does not have a solution which indicates the droplet is captured by an eddy under this condition the interaction time between turbulent eddy and droplet will be the eddy lifetime 4 computational setup simulations of ls tracking the motion of oil droplets induced by the cells will be performed for the problem configuration sketched in fig 2 the surface or top of the domain is a wind sheared rigid lid leading to the primary flow with velocity arrows sketched in fig 2 the inclusion of the c l vortex force in the momentum equation in 2 leads to the generation of ls with orientation sketched in fig 2 the bottom of the domain is taken as a flat no slip surface furthermore periodicity is taken along the downwind x 1 and crosswind x 2 directions wind and wave forcing conditions are taken from the field measurements of gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 during the presence of ls in these measurements the water column depth was h 15 m furthermore the wind stress was τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 and the dominant amplitude wavelength and period of the waves generating langmuir cells were 0 6 m λ 6 h 90 m and 8 s respectively these conditions were also used to guide the large eddy simulation les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 dimensionless parameters characterizing langmuir cells are the wavelength to depth ratio λ h and the turbulent langmuir number the latter is defined as l a t u τ u s mcwilliams et al 1997 where u τ is the wind stress friction velocity given as u τ τ w i n d ρ and u s σ k a 2 where as before a is the dominant amplitude of the waves k is the dominant wavenumber and σ is the dominant frequency the turbulent langmuir number is inversely proportional to wave forcing relative wind forcing for the wind and wave forcing conditions described above λ h 6 and l a t 0 7 gargett and grosch 2014 considered a turbulent langmuir number based on bottom stress friction velocity in order to characterize the role of bottom stress on ls analyzing the data of gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 they concluded that clear signatures of ls in their records were obtained when bottom friction velocity was approximately equal to surface wind stress friction velocity other instances of unstratified water columns were characterized by convection driven by unstable surface buoyancy or when the bottom friction velocity exceeded the wind stress friction velocity leading to shear dominated turbulence near the bottom caused by pressure gradient driven flow such as tidal flow rather than langmuir dominated turbulence during ls events thus the rans simulations performed here as well as the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 are characterized by the equilibrium condition of bottom stress matching the wind stress the domain is l x 94 2 m long in the downwind and l y 62 8 m wide in the crosswind following the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 in particular the value l y 62 8 m was chosen to resolve a pair of full depth ls as expected from the field measurements of gargett et al 2004 and as sketched in fig 2 the reynolds averaged formulation will be tested with the domain discretized by a hexahedral mesh uniform in the downwind crosswind and vertical directions a mesh refinement study will be performed to demonstrate convergence of the solution the resolution in the crosswind and vertical directions will be varied for three cases coarse fine and refined uniform resolutions the coarse mesh consists of 32 elements in the crosswind and 32 elements in the vertical the fine mesh has 64 elements in the crosswind and vertical and the refined mesh has 128 elements in the crosswind and vertical based on the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 in the mean when bottom stress matches the wind stress full depth langmuir cells are steady and do not possess variation in the downwind direction x 1 thus the reynolds averaged simulation will be taken as steady and two dimensional and only 4 elements will be taken in the downwind direction for each mesh described above given that the steady mean flow is 2 d and recalling the stokes drift velocity in 4 the reynolds averaged continuity and momentum equations reduce to the following 19 u 2 x 2 u 3 x 3 0 20 u 2 u 1 x 2 u 3 u 1 x 3 ν 2 u 1 x 2 2 2 u 1

through a staggered grid in which the pressure is computed at the cell faces patankar 1980 a second order upwind scheme is used for the momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate equations the solution will be compared with the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 which was performed on a three dimensional 32 x 64 x 96 mesh i e 32 elements in the downwind 64 elements in the crosswind and 96 elements in the vertical the les mesh was uniform over downwind and crosswind directions and stretched in the vertical to better resolve sharp vertical gradients near the surface and near the bottom the interested reader is directed to tejada martínez and grosch 2007 for further details about the mesh and numerical discretization note that the les is significantly more expensive than the reynolds averaged simulation the les takes about 1 week running on 16 parallel processors while the reynolds averaged solution takes about 20 minutes running on a single core desktop the previously described flow setup excludes the effect of coriolis forcing from the momentum equations following the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 the latter was guided by the field measurements of langmuir supercells of gargett and wells 2007 characterized by the presence of tides and a geostrophic current in which the pressure gradient force was balanced by the coriolis effect despite simplifications in the les such as the exclusion of the geostrophic mean flow grosch and gargett 2016 and tidal flow that were measured in the field the les resolved langmuir supercells were coherent throughout the entire depth of the water column in agreement with the field measurements tejada martínez and grosch 2007 gargett and wells 2007 tejada martínez et al 2009 the full depth coherency of the cells in both the field measurements and the les was attributed to the active stokes drift shear near the bottom induced by the intermediate waves generating the cells and to the weak crosswind components of the tidal and geostrophic flows relative to the downwind current in the field and the complete absence of the tidal and geostrophic flows in the les following tejada martínez and grosch 2009 subsequent shallow water les of langmuir supercells kukulka et al 2011 martinat et al 2011 akan et al 2013 shrestha et al 2018 2019 shrestha and anderson 2020 have excluded the coriolis effect in contrast les of langmuir cells in the upper ocean mixed layer over deep water normally include rotational terms which produce an oscillating inertial current that rotates off the wind wave direction with time i e the ekman spiral breaking up originally coherent langmuir cells into much less organized structures mcwilliams et al 1997 in this case the turbulence may be considered steady i e under statistical equilibrium only when averaged over periods of the inertial current as discussed by tejada martínez et al 2009 grosch and gargett 2016 demonstrated analytically how the results of the shallow water les of langmuir supercells without the coriolis effect are nonetheless valid in comparison to the field measurements of langmuir supercells made under the effect of rotation in the presence of a coastal boundary specifically grosch and gargett 2016 showed the first order equivalency between two steady mean flows case a and case b resulting from the action of a constant wind stress on a shallow unstratified water column case a is obtained with rotation and a lateral boundary to the right of the direction of the wind stress similar to the gargett et al field measurements of ls and case b is obtained without rotation and without a lateral boundary the various shallow water les of langmuir supercells referenced above and the analogous rans simulations presented here follow case b 5 reynolds averaged vs les resolved flow comparison the reynolds averaged solution is first compared with les in terms of steady state velocity fluctuations characterizing the resolved full depth langmuir cells or ls in les the velocity fluctuations associated with ls are obtained as described by tejada martínez and grosch 2007 first the les resolved velocity is decomposed following the classical reynolds decomposition 23 u i l e s u i l e s x y t u i l e s where u i l e s x y t is the mean component obtained by averaging the statistically steady u i l e s velocity field over the downwind and crosswind directions and over time the les resolved velocity fluctuations u i l e s are decomposed into a component induced by ls v i l e s and a component induced by scales smaller than ls u i l e s 24 u i l e s v i l e s u i l e s where 25 v i l e s u i l e s x t note that u i l e s denotes the les resolved fluctuations which include the ls induced fluctuations plus fluctuations induced by scales smaller than ls ls is persistent over time and coherent in the downwind direction thus fluctuations associated with ls can be extracted by averaging u i l e s over time and over the downwind direction as expressed in 25 the steady ls induced fluctuation in the reynolds averaged formulation in 19 22 can be obtained as follows first re express the reynolds averaged solution from 19 22 as 26 u i r a n s u i the reynolds averaged solution i e the rans solution can then be decomposed as 27 u i r a n s u i x y v i r a n s where the primary component u i x y is the steady state rans solution averaged over the streamwise and spanwise directions and the secondary v i r a n s is the ls induced fluctuation thus in post processing the latter may be obtained from 27 as simply 28 v i r a n s u i r a n s u i x y fig 3 shows the structure of the resolved ls through les and rans solutions in terms of v i l e s and v i r a n s respectively over the crosswind vertical extent of the computational domain panels a c correspond to les and d f correspond to the rans solution the rans solution shown was obtained with the fine mesh 4 x 64 x 64 resolution described earlier panels a and c show the full depth downwelling and upwelling limbs of the ls resolved by the les and rans solutions respectively in terms of vertical velocity fluctuations the downwelling limb is revealed by a full depth region of negative vertical velocity fluctuation and the upwelling limb is revealed by a full depth region of positive velocity fluctuation notice that the top of the downwelling limb corresponds to the surface convergence of the ls seen on panels b and d in terms of the crosswind velocity fluctuation also notice that both les and rans downwind velocity fluctuations in panels c and f respectively are characterized by a full depth region of positive values coinciding with the downwelling limbs of the cells panels a and d furthermore these full depth regions of positive downwind velocity fluctuations are intensified near the bottom this near bottom intensification of downwind velocity fluctuations is a key signature of ls that distinguishes it from lc in the upper ocean mixed layer gargett et al 2004 gargett and wells 2007 the cell pattern and velocity fluctuation magnitudes obtained with the les in panels a c of fig 3 is in good agreement with the full depth lc measurements of gargett and collaborators this good agreement has been highlighted by tejada martínez et al 2009 furthermore it is seen in figure 3 that the reynold averaged formulation is able to capture the overall structure of ls panels d f consistent with the les the behavior of the turbulence model can be seen in fig 4 in terms of predicted eddy lifetimes and eddy length scales note that eddy length scales and lifetimes are important for the prediction of turbulent dispersion of the oil droplets through equations 10 18 as expected the smallest length scales occur near the surface and near the bottom and in the bulk of the water column the eddy length scale reaches approximately 12 m comparable to the water column depth of 15 m additionally the shorter eddy lifetimes correspond to the smallest eddies near the surface and bottom and the longer eddy lifetimes correspond to the larger eddies spanning the depth of the water column figs 5 and 6 present depth profiles of the velocity variances and mean downwind velocity characterizing ls respectively obtained with the reynolds averaged formulation with the three levels of mesh resolution described earlier coarse fine and refined meshes these figures show that the mesh refinement leads to convergence of the solution as no significant differences are observed between the fine and refined mesh solutions the mesh refinement study also suggests that the reynolds averaged formulation could be improved for example through calibration of the turbulence model coefficients in equations 6 9 in order to obtain better agreement with the les nevertheless the reynolds averaged solution is consistent with the les solution in terms of the ls structure as seen in fig 3 described earlier furthermore it can be seen that the downwind velocity variance panel a in fig 5 is characterized by near bottom intensification in both the reynolds averaged and les solutions this is associated with the near bottom intensification of downwind velocity fluctuations a key signature of ls as described earlier furthermore the crosswind velocity fluctuations are intensified near the surface relative to the middle of the water column panel b in fig 5 this intensification is induced by the surface convergences of the ls described earlier finally fig 6 shows that the level of vertical homogenization of mean downwind velocity induced by ls is nearly the same for all reynolds averaged solutions in good agreement with the les this is reflected through the near flat velocity profiles throughout the bulk of the water column given that no significant differences are observed between the fine and refined mesh reynolds averaged solutions results from the fine mesh solution will be presented for the remainder of this manuscript 6 oil dispersion via lagrangian particle tracking to explore the impact of ls on dispersion of oil droplets two simulations were conducted tracking the oil droplets under different wind stress in the first simulation the wind and wave forcing conditions are the same as in the ls simulation presented in the previous section recall that in this simulation the water column depth was h 15 m furthermore the wind stress was τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 and the dominant amplitude wavelength and period of the waves generating langmuir cells were a 0 6 m λ 90 m and t 8 s respectively for these parameters the dimensionless wind and wave forcing parameters are l a t 0 7 and λ h 6 i e λ 90 m the second ls simulation is characterized by a lower wind stress τ w i n d 0 025 n m 2 and with the same wave characteristics as the first simulation thus l a t 0 5 and λ h 6 such a change in parameters from simulation 1 to simulation 2 corresponds to a scenario in which the winds calm down while the waves amplitude and wavelength remain constant this was observed in the field by gargett et al 2004 during their measurements of ls ann gargett personal communication as the waves did not respond immediately to a change in wind other researchers have adopted a similar approach for example in their les li and song 2012 kept the wave field fixed while changing wind speed to investigate the effect of wind speed on the spacing between langmuir cells this type of scenario can come about if the waves are non locally generated such as swell waves fig 7 shows the vertical and crosswind velocity fluctuations and turbulent kinetic energy tke induced by ls generated with wind stress τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 and τ w i n d 0 025 n m 2 respectively stronger wind leads to more intense cells in terms of downwelling and upwelling vertical velocity fluctuations and in terms of surface cell convergence and bottom cell convergence represented through crosswind velocity fluctuations in both cases elevated values of tke are caused by the convergence of the cells at the surface and by the downwelling limbs of the cells impinging at the bottom with the τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 case providing the greatest tke values as seen in fig 8 in the case with τ w i n d 0 025 n m 2 throughout the duration of the simulation 4800 seconds or 80 minutes the majority of the 500 μm oil droplets released at the surface remain within the downwelling limb of the cell forming the so called stommel retention zone srz the upwelling limb of the cell is not active in driving vertical transport but some of the droplets do rise back to the surface primarily due to buoyancy in the case with τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 in fig 9 the droplets initially accumulate within the downwelling limb of the cell and are forced to the bottom of the water column much more rapidly than the case with τ w i n d 0 05 n m 2 in the stronger wind case fig 9 droplets begin reaching the bottom of the water column by about 800 seconds 13 3 minutes of the simulation whereas in the weaker wind case fig 8 at this time the droplets are still approximately 5 meters above the bottom in the case of τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 by 4800 seconds or 80 minutes the majority of the droplets have been swept underneath the upwelling limb of the cell to be advected back to the surface by the positive vertical velocity in this region of the cell fig 9 in both simulations the droplet distribution becomes more homogenous over time and the results with τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 indicate a homogenization about both the upwelling and downwelling limbs of ls in the case of langmuir circulation in the upper ocean mixed layer where the downwelling limbs of the cells are narrower and more intense than the upwelling limbs homogenization of droplets typically occurs only about the downwelling limbs i e the srzs farmer and li 1994 to ensure accuracy the time step of the lagrangian particle tracking δ t 2 2 10 5 s is taken smaller than the particle relaxation time τ p given in eqn 18 and the eddy lifetime t l 2 c l k ε given earlier in eqn 15 furthermore recall that the particle is assumed to interact with the fluid phase eddy over the smaller of the eddy lifetime eqn 15 and eddy crossing time eqn 18 when this time is reached a new value of the instantaneous fluctuating velocity is obtained by applying a new value of the random number ξ i in eqn 14 for example in the simulation with τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 within the downwelling limb of the cell the eddy length scale is l e τ p u u p since l e 5 m see fig 4 u p u and τ p 6 5 10 5 s as such the expression for eddy cross time eqn 16 is not defined under this condition the interaction time between turbulent eddy and droplet will be the eddy lifetime t l 160 s see fig 4 and thus a new value of ξ i is applied at every 160 s thus excessive droplet dispersion would occur within the downwelling limb of the cell if instead a new value of ξ i were to be applied say at every time step δ t 2 2 10 5 s 7 conclusions a reynolds averaged methodology capturing full depth langmuir supercells or ls in shallow water was presented showing consistent agreement with les in the presence of oil broken up into droplets at the surface of the sea ls serve to entrain the droplets along the downwelling limbs of the cells lagrangian particle tracking simulations demonstrated the entrainment and overall distributions of 500 μm oil droplets induced by ls as function of time and ls intensity in a water column 15 m in depth a 0 1 n m 2 wind stress and intermediate waves with significant wavelength amplitude and period of 90 m 0 6 m and 8 s respectively led to ls capable of transporting the oil droplets throughout both downwelling and upwelling limbs of the cells within 80 minutes of droplet release over time the droplet distribution homogenized about both limbs of the cells meanwhile a lower wind stress of 0 025 n m 2 with the same wave field previously described led to weaker ls structure accumulating the droplets within its downwelling limb and thus forming srzs over a prolonged time extending throughout at least the first 80 minutes after droplet release in addition to providing a less computationally expensive alternative to les the reynolds averaged methodology for capturing the largest scales of langmuir circulation introduced and its coupling with either lagrangian particle tracking or population balance equations would be suitable to predict processes such as oil weathering sediment flocculation and the formation of oil particle aggregates the latter two processes should be promoted at the surface convergence zones of the cells and underneath the downwelling limbs of the cells where the greatest values of tke were observed these areas of research will be explored in the future furthermore this methodology should permit future investigations of the interaction between langmuir cells and other processes such as river plumes and rip currents in the coastal ocean nearshore regions for which les may prove cost prohibitive coupling with either lagrangian particle tracking or scalar transport should allow for the investigation of the resulting vertical and lateral transport induced by langmuir cells in these complex and realistic settings in order to realize its potential the newly introduced methodology needs to be improved through calibration of turbulence model coefficients the values of the turbulence model coefficients appearing in eqns 6 7 and 8 were taken simply as default values and in the future should be re calibrated to represent langmuir turbulence furthermore the drw model coefficient in eqn 15 was taken as a default value of c l 0 15 however as noted by javaherchi and aliseda 2016 calibration of this coefficient through experimental data from various applications has led to a range between 0 0675 and 0 205 furthermore as they point out inaccurate values of this timescale constant can lead to gross under or overestimation of the particle dispersion process credit authorship contribution statement a j perez software validation visualization f cui software validation visualization j peñaloza

20513,langmuir supercells ls are full depth langmuir circulations in unstratified shallow shelves a reynolds averaged eulerian formulation is developed resolving ls as a secondary component to the wind driven mean shear current this formulation is combined with lagrangian particle tracking to investigate oil droplet entrainment induced by ls as a function of wind stress two cases are simulated one in which 500 μm oil droplets are released into a steady field of ls generated by a wind stress of 0 1 n m 2 and waves of intermediate wavelength λ 6 h where h 15 m is the water column depth significant amplitude of 0 6 m and period of 8 s in the second case the 500 μm oil droplets are released into a steady field of ls generated by the same wave forcing but with a weaker wind stress of 0 025 n m 2 it is found that the greater wind stress leads to ls able to spread the droplets throughout upwelling and downwelling limbs of the cells within the first 80 minutes after release the weaker wind leads to weaker ls that within the same time after release limit the dispersion of the droplets to the downwelling limbs of the cells forming stommel retention zones for a prolonged time keywords langmuir supercells vertical dispersion oil droplets discrete random walk model 1 introduction turbulence in the upper ocean is generated by a combination of surface winds surface wave breaking wave current interaction and surface buoyancy wave current interaction gives rise to langmuir turbulence characterized by a wide range of langmuir circulation lc scales parallel counter rotating vortices roughly aligned in the direction of the wind an lc vortex pair is sketched in fig 1 wind speeds greater than approximately 3 m s 1 and winds roughly parallel to waves provide favorable conditions for the generation of langmuir turbulence the turbulence consists of small langmuir scales emanating from the water surface which over time on the order of tens of minutes grow in depth and width typically reaching the base of the mixed layer in the upper ocean or the bottom of the water column in homogenous shallow water this has been shown to be the case by skyllingstad and denbo 1995 for the upper ocean mixed layer it is well known that lc plays a major role towards the maintenance of the upper ocean mixed layer thorpe 2004 in the case of the shallow coastal ocean 10 20 meters in depth the field measurements of gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 have shown that during the passage of storms when the water column becomes homogenous lc can span the entire depth of the water column full depth lc has been denoted as langmuir supercells or ls due to their strong impact on the turbulence dynamics throughout the entire water column furthermore the structure of coastal ls differs from the structure of ordinary lc in the upper ocean mixed layer with ls being more coherent and intense shrestha et al 2018 gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 have shown that ls promote sediment re suspension by sweeping sediments towards the bottom convergences of the vortices where the upwelling limbs of the cells can transport the particles upwards into the water column surface oil slicks are commonly treated with dispersants to disintegrate the oil into droplets droplets may also form due to the persistent buffeting of surface breaking waves the droplets can then be entrained and dispersed throughout the water column via the action of lc as shown by farmer and li 1994 the downwelling limbs of the counter rotating vortices can exert vertical speeds greater than the buoyant rise speed of the droplets giving rise to submerged zones where the oil droplets can be retained for extended periods in what is referred to as stommel retention zones srzs such retention zones were originally postulated by stommel 1949 thus vertical dispersion of oil may be greatly enhanced during episodes of lc furthermore in the case of an oil spill in coastal regions given the observations of gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 ls should serve as a mechanism for simultaneous entrainment of oil droplets and resuspension of sediments such instances could potentially lead to increased mixing between the sediments and oil and ultimately to the formation of oil particle aggregates opas at offshore locations opas are often thought to be formed near shore where sediments and oil come in direct contact farmer and li 1994 developed a model for oil droplet dispersion by lc the model was based on an analytical representation of the largest lc scale with lagrangian tracking of oil droplets via a random walk method they found that over time the oil droplets can be homogenized about the srz due to the turbulence the homogenization time depends on the inputted eddy viscosity associated with the langmuir turbulence and physical characteristics of the oil droplets in this manuscript an eulerian reynolds averaged based methodology is introduced enabling a more accurate representation of lc than the analytical representation of farmer and li 1994 without the need to resort to more computationally intensive approaches such as large eddy simulation les the methodology is used to track oil droplets released at the water column surface in the presence of ls the methodology relies on the coherency and persistence of ls here these cells are treated as a secondary component to the wind and or pressure gradient driven primary flow as such the reynolds averaged flow equations and the mesh are designed to resolve both the primary flow and the ls with the turbulence model accounting for the unresolved smaller langmuir scales in the new methodology the flow equations consist of the reynolds averaged incompressible navier stokes equations augmented with the craik leibovich c l vortex force parameterizing the wave current interaction generating lc craik and leibovich 1976 the c l vortex force allows for simulations to be performed with a flat surface i e without resolution of the surface gravity waves that generate lc mathematically the c l vortex force consists of the cross product between the stokes drift velocity induced by surface gravity waves and the resolved flow vorticity the c l vortex force is representative of the stokes drift tilting of vertical vorticity associated with lateral shear towards the along wind direction resulting in lc turbulence closure in the reynolds averaged formulation developed consists of the standard k epsilon model updated to account for production of turbulent kinetic energy by stokes drift shear and non local transport induced by ls the reynolds averaged methodology for computing the flow described above differs from previous methodologies dealing with langmuir turbulence oftentimes langmuir turbulence is computed via les in which a majority of the langmuir scales are resolved a second approach more suitable to either general ocean circulation modeling or single water column modeling is based on reynolds averaging in which none of the langmuir scales including the largest lc scales are resolved and the turbulence model is left to account for the impact of the langmuir turbulence on the resolved mean flow the present methodology is based on reynolds averaging just as the previously described approach however the largest langmuir scales in this case the full depth ls are resolved in this manuscript the new methodology will be used to investigate the vertical dispersion of oil droplets caused by ls the new methodology computes the flow comprised of the mean flow plus the secondary ls structure and the eddy viscosity and turbulent kinetic energy predicted by the k epsilon model are used to perform lagrangian tracking of oil droplets through a discrete random walk drw method the drw approach of gosman and ioannides 1983 is adopted in which the unresolved random fluctuations of the droplet trajectories are calculated by modeling the interaction between the droplets with randomly generated eddies that fit the statistics of the turbulence velocity component root mean square and eddy lifetimes as predicted by the turbulence model javaherchi and aliseda 2016 2 reynolds averaged flow equations and turbulence model the eulerian equations of fluid motion consist of the incompressible reynolds averaged continuity equation and the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation in 1 and 2 respectively with the rans equation augmented with the c l vortex force parameterizing the generation of lc by the wave current interaction 1 u

the x 1 x 2 and x 3 directions are the downwind crosswind and vertical directions respectively the last term on the right side of equation 2 is the c l vortex force consisting of the cross product

appearing in 2 and 3 will be taken to be purely aligned in the downwind direction and thus its components along the crosswind and vertical directions are zero the downwind component follows the definition given by phillips 1966 u 2 s u 3 s 0 4 u 1 s σ k a 2 cosh 2 k x 3 2 sinh 2 k h where h is the water column depth and σ k and a are the dominant frequency wavenumber and amplitude respectively of the waves generating lc note that k 2 π λ where λ is the dominant wavelength and k and σ may be related through the wave dispersion relation the reynolds stress in 2 is modeled as 5 u i u j ν t u i x j u j x i ν t u i s x j u j s x i where the second term on the right side of 5 accounts for non local transport induced by lc smyth et al 2002 mcwilliams et al 2012 harcourt 2013 sinha et al 2014 in 5 the eddy viscosity is modeled based on the k epsilon closure 6 ν t c μ k 2 ε where k and ε are the turbulent kinetic energy tke and tke dissipation rate respectively note that this eddy viscosity is used for the momentum equation in all three directions following the standard k epsilon model the tke and tke dissipation rate are obtained by solving the following transport

as the traditional production by mean shear first term on the right side of 9 augmented by production by stokes drift shear second term on the right hand side of 9 following harcourt 2013 note that the reynolds stress in 9 is closed using the expression in 5 the values of the coefficients appearing in 6 7 and 8 are c μ 0 09 σ k 1 σ ε 1 3 c 1 ε 1 44 and c 1 ε 1 92 wilcox 1994 in the simulations to be presented below the mean flow fields such as u i contain the resolved mean wind driven flow and the largest of the langmuir cells while the fluctuating components such as u i contain the smaller unresolved scales 3 lagrangian particle tracking equations the lagrangian discrete phase model used to track oil droplets follows the euler lagrange approach the fluid phase is treated as a continuum by solving the navier stokes equations as described earlier while the dispersed phase is solved by tracking individual particles through the calculated flow field in the lagrangian discrete phase model the trajectory of a discrete phase particle is predicted by integrating the force balance on each particle which is written in a lagrangian reference frame this force balance equates the particle inertia with the forces i e drag and buoyancy acting on the particle given as boufadel et al 2018 cui et al 2018 2020 10 d u p d t 3 4 ρ ρ p d p c d u u p u u p k ˆ g ρ p ρ ρ p where u is the fluid velocity u p is the oil droplet particle velocity ρ p is the particle density ρ is the fluid density d p is the particle diameter g is the gravity acceleration and k ˆ is the unit vector in the vertical direction the drag coefficient c d in eq 10 is taken following morsi and alexander 1972 as 11 c d 0 4 24 r e p 6 1 r e p where r e p is the relative reynolds number defined as 12 r e p ρ p d p u u p μ with μ the molecular dynamic viscosity of the fluid recall that the fluid phase velocity can be decomposed into mean velocity u and fluctuation velocity u as 13 u u u the mean velocity u can be obtained from solution of the rans equations described earlier the cartesian components of the velocity fluctuation u u 1 u 2 u 2 are defined through a drw model gosman and ioannides 1983 javaherchi and aliseda 2017 given as 14 u i ξ i 2 k 3 where k is local turbulent kinetic energy and ξ i is a random number following a zero mean unit variance normal distribution the particle is assumed to interact with the fluid phase eddy over the smaller of the eddy lifetime and eddy crossing time when this time is reached a new value of the instantaneous velocity is obtained by applying a new value of ξ i in eq 14 the eddy lifetime is defined as 15 t l 2 c l k ε where c l 0 15 is an empirical constant and ε is the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate the eddy cross time is defined as 16 t c τ p ln 1 l e τ p u u p where l e is the eddy length scale and can be estimated as 17 l e c μ 3 4 k 3 2 ε where the empirical constant c μ 0 9 as before the particle relaxation time τ p is given by 18 τ p ρ p d p 2 18 μ w where d p is the particle diameter if l e τ p u u p eq 16 does not have a solution which indicates the droplet is captured by an eddy under this condition the interaction time between turbulent eddy and droplet will be the eddy lifetime 4 computational setup simulations of ls tracking the motion of oil droplets induced by the cells will be performed for the problem configuration sketched in fig 2 the surface or top of the domain is a wind sheared rigid lid leading to the primary flow with velocity arrows sketched in fig 2 the inclusion of the c l vortex force in the momentum equation in 2 leads to the generation of ls with orientation sketched in fig 2 the bottom of the domain is taken as a flat no slip surface furthermore periodicity is taken along the downwind x 1 and crosswind x 2 directions wind and wave forcing conditions are taken from the field measurements of gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 during the presence of ls in these measurements the water column depth was h 15 m furthermore the wind stress was τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 and the dominant amplitude wavelength and period of the waves generating langmuir cells were 0 6 m λ 6 h 90 m and 8 s respectively these conditions were also used to guide the large eddy simulation les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 dimensionless parameters characterizing langmuir cells are the wavelength to depth ratio λ h and the turbulent langmuir number the latter is defined as l a t u τ u s mcwilliams et al 1997 where u τ is the wind stress friction velocity given as u τ τ w i n d ρ and u s σ k a 2 where as before a is the dominant amplitude of the waves k is the dominant wavenumber and σ is the dominant frequency the turbulent langmuir number is inversely proportional to wave forcing relative wind forcing for the wind and wave forcing conditions described above λ h 6 and l a t 0 7 gargett and grosch 2014 considered a turbulent langmuir number based on bottom stress friction velocity in order to characterize the role of bottom stress on ls analyzing the data of gargett et al 2004 and gargett and wells 2007 they concluded that clear signatures of ls in their records were obtained when bottom friction velocity was approximately equal to surface wind stress friction velocity other instances of unstratified water columns were characterized by convection driven by unstable surface buoyancy or when the bottom friction velocity exceeded the wind stress friction velocity leading to shear dominated turbulence near the bottom caused by pressure gradient driven flow such as tidal flow rather than langmuir dominated turbulence during ls events thus the rans simulations performed here as well as the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 are characterized by the equilibrium condition of bottom stress matching the wind stress the domain is l x 94 2 m long in the downwind and l y 62 8 m wide in the crosswind following the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 in particular the value l y 62 8 m was chosen to resolve a pair of full depth ls as expected from the field measurements of gargett et al 2004 and as sketched in fig 2 the reynolds averaged formulation will be tested with the domain discretized by a hexahedral mesh uniform in the downwind crosswind and vertical directions a mesh refinement study will be performed to demonstrate convergence of the solution the resolution in the crosswind and vertical directions will be varied for three cases coarse fine and refined uniform resolutions the coarse mesh consists of 32 elements in the crosswind and 32 elements in the vertical the fine mesh has 64 elements in the crosswind and vertical and the refined mesh has 128 elements in the crosswind and vertical based on the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 in the mean when bottom stress matches the wind stress full depth langmuir cells are steady and do not possess variation in the downwind direction x 1 thus the reynolds averaged simulation will be taken as steady and two dimensional and only 4 elements will be taken in the downwind direction for each mesh described above given that the steady mean flow is 2 d and recalling the stokes drift velocity in 4 the reynolds averaged continuity and momentum equations reduce to the following 19 u 2 x 2 u 3 x 3 0 20 u 2 u 1 x 2 u 3 u 1 x 3 ν 2 u 1 x 2 2 2 u 1 x 3 2 u 1 u 2 x 2 u 1 u 3 x 3 21 u 2 u 2 x 2 u 3 u 2 x 3 1 ρ π x 2 ν 2 u 2 x 2 2 2 u 2 x 3 2 u 2 u 2 x 2 u 2 u 3 x 3 u 1 s ω 3 22 u 2 u 3 x 2 u 3 u 3 x 3 1 ρ π x 3 ν 2 u 3 x 2 2 2 u 3 x 3 2 u 3 u 2 x 2 u 3 u 3 x 3 u 1 s ω 2 the reynolds averaged continuity and momentum equations and the turbulence model described earlier are solved via a finite volume method ensuring pressure velocity coupling through a staggered grid in which the pressure is computed at the cell faces patankar 1980 a second order upwind scheme is used for the momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent dissipation rate equations the solution will be compared with the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 which was performed on a three dimensional 32 x 64 x 96 mesh i e 32 elements in the downwind 64 elements in the crosswind and 96 elements in the vertical the les mesh was uniform over downwind and crosswind directions and stretched in the vertical to better resolve sharp vertical gradients near the surface and near the bottom the interested reader is directed to tejada martínez and grosch 2007 for further details about the mesh and numerical discretization note that the les is significantly more expensive than the reynolds averaged simulation the les takes about 1 week running on 16 parallel processors while the reynolds averaged solution takes about 20 minutes running on a single core desktop the previously described flow setup excludes the effect of coriolis forcing from the momentum equations following the les of tejada martínez and grosch 2007 the latter was guided by the field measurements of langmuir supercells of gargett and wells 2007 characterized by the presence of tides and a geostrophic current in which the pressure gradient force was balanced by the coriolis effect despite simplifications in the les such as the exclusion of the geostrophic mean flow grosch and gargett 2016 and tidal flow that were measured in the field the les resolved langmuir supercells were coherent throughout the entire depth of the water column in agreement with the field measurements tejada martínez and grosch 2007 gargett and wells 2007 tejada martínez et al 2009 the full depth coherency of the cells in both the field measurements and the les was attributed to the active stokes drift shear near the bottom induced by the intermediate waves generating the cells and to the weak crosswind components of the tidal and geostrophic flows relative to the downwind current in the field and the complete absence of the tidal and geostrophic flows in the les following tejada martínez and grosch 2009 subsequent shallow water les of langmuir supercells kukulka et al 2011 martinat et al 2011 akan et al 2013 shrestha et al 2018 2019 shrestha and anderson 2020 have excluded the coriolis effect in contrast les of langmuir cells in the upper ocean mixed layer over deep water normally include rotational terms which produce an oscillating inertial current that rotates off the wind wave direction with time i e the ekman spiral breaking up originally coherent langmuir cells into much less organized structures mcwilliams et al 1997 in this case the turbulence may be considered steady i e under statistical equilibrium only when averaged over periods of the inertial current as discussed by tejada martínez et al 2009 grosch and gargett 2016 demonstrated analytically how the results of the shallow water les of langmuir supercells without the coriolis effect are nonetheless valid in comparison to the field measurements of langmuir supercells made under the effect of rotation in the presence of a coastal boundary specifically grosch and gargett 2016 showed the first order equivalency between two steady mean flows case a and case b resulting from the action of a constant wind stress on a shallow unstratified water column case a is obtained with rotation and a lateral boundary to the right of the direction of the wind stress similar to the gargett et al field measurements of ls and case b is obtained without rotation and without a lateral boundary the various shallow water les of langmuir supercells referenced above and the analogous rans simulations presented here follow case b 5 reynolds averaged vs les resolved flow comparison the reynolds averaged solution is first compared with les in terms of steady state velocity fluctuations characterizing the resolved full depth langmuir cells or ls in les the velocity fluctuations associated with ls are obtained as described by tejada martínez and grosch 2007 first the les resolved velocity is decomposed following the classical reynolds decomposition 23 u i l e s u i l e s x y t u i l e s where u i l e s x y t is the mean component obtained by averaging the statistically steady u i l e s velocity field over the downwind and crosswind directions and over time the les resolved velocity fluctuations u i l e s are decomposed into a component induced by ls v i l e s and a component induced by scales smaller than ls u i l e s 24 u i l e s v i l e s u i l e s where 25 v i l e s u i l e s x t note that u i l e s denotes the les resolved fluctuations which include the ls induced fluctuations plus fluctuations induced by scales smaller than ls ls is persistent over time and coherent in the downwind direction thus fluctuations associated with ls can be extracted by averaging u i l e s over time and over the downwind direction as expressed in 25 the steady ls induced fluctuation in the reynolds averaged formulation in 19 22 can be obtained as follows first re express the reynolds averaged solution from 19 22 as 26 u i r a n s u i the reynolds averaged solution i e the rans solution can then be decomposed as 27 u i r a n s u i x y v i r a n s where the primary component u i x y is the steady state rans solution averaged over the streamwise and spanwise directions and the secondary v i r a n s is the ls induced fluctuation thus in post processing the latter may be obtained from 27 as simply 28 v i r a n s u i r a n s u i x y fig 3 shows the structure of the resolved ls through les and rans solutions in terms of v i l e s and v i r a n s respectively over the crosswind vertical extent of the computational domain panels a c correspond to les and d f correspond to the rans solution the rans solution shown was obtained with the fine mesh 4 x 64 x 64 resolution described earlier panels a and c show the full depth downwelling and upwelling limbs of the ls resolved by the les and rans solutions respectively in terms of vertical velocity fluctuations the downwelling limb is revealed by a full depth region of negative vertical velocity fluctuation and the upwelling limb is revealed by a full depth region of positive velocity fluctuation notice that the top of the downwelling limb corresponds to the surface convergence of the ls seen on panels b and d in terms of the crosswind velocity fluctuation also notice that both les and rans downwind velocity fluctuations in panels c and f respectively are characterized by a full depth region of positive values coinciding with the downwelling limbs of the cells panels a and d furthermore these full depth regions of positive downwind velocity fluctuations are intensified near the bottom this near bottom intensification of downwind velocity fluctuations is a key signature of ls that distinguishes it from lc in the upper ocean mixed layer gargett et al 2004 gargett and wells 2007 the cell pattern and velocity fluctuation magnitudes obtained with the les in panels a c of fig 3 is in good agreement with the full depth lc measurements of gargett and collaborators this good agreement has been highlighted by tejada martínez et al 2009 furthermore it is seen in figure 3 that the reynold averaged formulation is able to capture the overall structure of ls panels d f consistent with the les the behavior of the turbulence model can be seen in fig 4 in terms of predicted eddy lifetimes and eddy length scales note that eddy length scales and lifetimes are important for the prediction of turbulent dispersion of the oil droplets through equations 10 18 as expected the smallest length scales occur near the surface and near the bottom and in the bulk of the water column the eddy length scale reaches approximately 12 m comparable to the water column depth of 15 m additionally the shorter eddy lifetimes correspond to the smallest eddies near the surface and bottom and the longer eddy lifetimes correspond to the larger eddies spanning the depth of the water column figs 5 and 6 present depth profiles of the velocity variances and mean downwind velocity characterizing ls respectively obtained with the reynolds averaged formulation with the three levels of mesh resolution described earlier coarse fine and refined meshes these figures show that the mesh refinement leads to convergence of the solution as no significant differences are observed between the fine and refined mesh solutions the mesh refinement study also suggests that the reynolds averaged formulation could be improved for example through calibration of the turbulence model coefficients in equations 6 9 in order to obtain better agreement with the les nevertheless the reynolds averaged solution is consistent with the les solution in terms of the ls structure as seen in fig 3 described earlier furthermore it can be seen that the downwind velocity variance panel a in fig 5 is characterized by near bottom intensification in both the reynolds averaged and les solutions this is associated with the near bottom intensification of downwind velocity fluctuations a key signature of ls as described earlier furthermore the crosswind velocity fluctuations are intensified near the surface relative to the middle of the water column panel b in fig 5 this intensification is induced by the surface convergences of the ls described earlier finally fig 6 shows that the level of vertical homogenization of mean downwind velocity induced by ls is nearly the same for all reynolds averaged solutions in good agreement with the les this is reflected through the near flat velocity profiles throughout the bulk of the water column given that no significant differences are observed between the fine and refined mesh reynolds averaged solutions results from the fine mesh solution will be presented for the remainder of this manuscript 6 oil dispersion via lagrangian particle tracking to explore the impact of ls on dispersion of oil droplets two simulations were conducted tracking the oil droplets under different wind stress in the first simulation the wind and wave forcing conditions are the same as in the ls simulation presented in the previous section recall that in this simulation the water column depth was h 15 m furthermore the wind stress was τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 and the dominant amplitude wavelength and period of the waves generating langmuir cells were a 0 6 m λ 90 m and t 8 s respectively for these parameters the dimensionless wind and wave forcing parameters are l a t 0 7 and λ h 6 i e λ 90 m the second ls simulation is characterized by a lower wind stress τ w i n d 0 025 n m 2 and with the same wave characteristics as the first simulation thus l a t 0 5 and λ h 6 such a change in parameters from simulation 1 to simulation 2 corresponds to a scenario in which the winds calm down while the waves amplitude and wavelength remain constant this was observed in the field by gargett et al 2004 during their measurements of ls ann gargett personal communication as the waves did not respond immediately to a change in wind other researchers have adopted a similar approach for example in their les li and song 2012 kept the wave field fixed while changing wind speed to investigate the effect of wind speed on the spacing between langmuir cells this type of scenario can come about if the waves are non locally generated such as swell waves fig 7 shows the vertical and crosswind velocity fluctuations and turbulent kinetic energy tke induced by ls generated with wind stress τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 and τ w i n d 0 025 n m 2 respectively stronger wind leads to more intense cells in terms of downwelling and upwelling vertical velocity fluctuations and in terms of surface cell convergence and bottom cell convergence represented through crosswind velocity fluctuations in both cases elevated values of tke are caused by the convergence of the cells at the surface and by the downwelling limbs of the cells impinging at the bottom with the τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 case providing the greatest tke values as seen in fig 8 in the case with τ w i n d 0 025 n m 2 throughout the duration of the simulation 4800 seconds or 80 minutes the majority of the 500 μm oil droplets released at the surface remain within the downwelling limb of the cell forming the so called stommel retention zone srz the upwelling limb of the cell is not active in driving vertical transport but some of the droplets do rise back to the surface primarily due to buoyancy in the case with τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 in fig 9 the droplets initially accumulate within the downwelling limb of the cell and are forced to the bottom of the water column much more rapidly than the case with τ w i n d 0 05 n m 2 in the stronger wind case fig 9 droplets begin reaching the bottom of the water column by about 800 seconds 13 3 minutes of the simulation whereas in the weaker wind case fig 8 at this time the droplets are still approximately 5 meters above the bottom in the case of τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 by 4800 seconds or 80 minutes the majority of the droplets have been swept underneath the upwelling limb of the cell to be advected back to the surface by the positive vertical velocity in this region of the cell fig 9 in both simulations the droplet distribution becomes more homogenous over time and the results with τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 indicate a homogenization about both the upwelling and downwelling limbs of ls in the case of langmuir circulation in the upper ocean mixed layer where the downwelling limbs of the cells are narrower and more intense than the upwelling limbs homogenization of droplets typically occurs only about the downwelling limbs i e the srzs farmer and li 1994 to ensure accuracy the time step of the lagrangian particle tracking δ t 2 2 10 5 s is taken smaller than the particle relaxation time τ p given in eqn 18 and the eddy lifetime t l 2 c l k ε given earlier in eqn 15 furthermore recall that the particle is assumed to interact with the fluid phase eddy over the smaller of the eddy lifetime eqn 15 and eddy crossing time eqn 18 when this time is reached a new value of the instantaneous fluctuating velocity is obtained by applying a new value of the random number ξ i in eqn 14 for example in the simulation with τ w i n d 0 1 n m 2 within the downwelling limb of the cell the eddy length scale is l e τ p u u p since l e 5 m see fig 4 u p u and τ p 6 5 10 5 s as such the expression for eddy cross time eqn 16 is not defined under this condition the interaction time between turbulent eddy and droplet will be the eddy lifetime t l 160 s see fig 4 and thus a new value of ξ i is applied at every 160 s thus excessive droplet dispersion would occur within the downwelling limb of the cell if instead a new value of ξ i were to be applied say at every time step δ t 2 2 10 5 s 7 conclusions a reynolds averaged methodology capturing full depth langmuir supercells or ls in shallow water was presented showing consistent agreement with les in the presence of oil broken up into droplets at the surface of the sea ls serve to entrain the droplets along the downwelling limbs of the cells lagrangian particle tracking simulations demonstrated the entrainment and overall distributions of 500 μm oil droplets induced by ls as function of time and ls intensity in a water column 15 m in depth a 0 1 n m 2 wind stress and intermediate waves with significant wavelength amplitude and period of 90 m 0 6 m and 8 s respectively led to ls capable of transporting the oil droplets throughout both downwelling and upwelling limbs of the cells within 80 minutes of droplet release over time the droplet distribution homogenized about both limbs of the cells meanwhile a lower wind stress of 0 025 n m 2 with the same wave field previously described led to weaker ls structure accumulating the droplets within its downwelling limb and thus forming srzs over a prolonged time extending throughout at least the first 80 minutes after droplet release in addition to providing a less computationally expensive alternative to les the reynolds averaged methodology for capturing the largest scales of langmuir circulation introduced and its coupling with either lagrangian particle tracking or population balance equations would be suitable to predict processes such as oil weathering sediment flocculation and the formation of oil particle aggregates the latter two processes should be promoted at the surface convergence zones of the cells and underneath the downwelling limbs of the cells where the greatest values of tke were observed these areas of research will be explored in the future furthermore this methodology should permit future investigations of the interaction between langmuir cells and other processes such as river plumes and rip currents in the coastal ocean nearshore regions for which les may prove cost prohibitive coupling with either lagrangian particle tracking or scalar transport should allow for the investigation of the resulting vertical and lateral transport induced by langmuir cells in these complex and realistic settings in order to realize its potential the newly introduced methodology needs to be improved through calibration of turbulence model coefficients the values of the turbulence model coefficients appearing in eqns 6 7 and 8 were taken simply as default values and in the future should be re calibrated to represent langmuir turbulence furthermore the drw model coefficient in eqn 15 was taken as a default value of c l 0 15 however as noted by javaherchi and aliseda 2016 calibration of this coefficient through experimental data from various applications has led to a range between 0 0675 and 0 205 furthermore as they point out inaccurate values of this timescale constant can lead to gross under or overestimation of the particle dispersion process credit authorship contribution statement a j perez software validation visualization f cui software validation visualization j peñaloza

20514,engineering practice presents some impact of sloshing and ship motion interaction on added resistance in waves and this paper is an attempt to figure out the effect of such impact through experiment while theoretical investigation is troubling scholars due to the complexity of this problem a liquefied natural gas lng carrier scaled to 1 27 384 with one prismatic tank is modeled for free running tests in regular head waves of 6 different wavelengths in the deepwater towing tank of china scientific research center cssrc for each wave case the revolution rate of propeller the ship speed and corresponding torque and thrust are measured and the added resistance is thereafter obtained by subtracting the still water resistance from the mean total resistance on assumption of a constant thrust deduction the experimental results are comparatively discussed in conditions of sloshing and ballast weight it is found that under current test conditions internal sloshing affects ship motion by reducing its value and the added resistance in waves decreases accordingly while the energy consumption decreases the experimental results that liquid sloshing has an evident influence on the added resistance shall be a very important consideration for the development of green lng cargos keywords model test free running self propulsion sloshing added resistance 1 introduction in ship hydrodynamics the problem of liquefied natural gas lng ships sailing in waves is actually ship motion responses coupling with liquid tank sloshing when a ship with liquid tank sails in waves wave exciting force and moment will cause ship motion responses and ship motion responses will cause sloshing in liquid tank meanwhile sloshing exciting force and moment will affect ship motion responses this is a very complicated coupled process recently energy issues have caused more and more attention on one hand the demand for natural gas in the world energy market has been growing on the other hand international maritime organization imo introduced the concept of energy efficiency design index eedi which aims to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions from global shipping industry since the added resistance in waves takes one term in the eedi formula ship designers are seeking all kinds of ways to diminish it to make ships green strøm tejsen et al 1973 pointed out that accurate predictions of ship motion are more important than improvements in added resistance theory therefore it is necessary and meaningful to study the effect of internal sloshing on ship motion which may lead to a change of added resistance in waves research on sloshing phenomena and sloshing induced loads were extensively carried out from the 1970s abramson et al 1974 introduced the potentially dangerous loads on ship tanks faltinsen et al 2000 faltinsen and timokha 2001 and faltinsen et al 2005 came up with a modal system method for analytical approach since analytical solutions have limitations such as geometry restriction model testing has been considered as the most reliable method in predicting the maximum impact pressure due to violent sloshing yung et al 2009 studied sloshing model test and identified relevant dimensionless numbers necessary for the dynamic similarity of scaled model tests involving local pressures however some technical issues in the application of experimental data to actual tank designs are not yet completely resolved for example the scaling law from model test data to real ships is not yet clear kimmoun et al 2009 and bogaert et al 2010 carried out wave canal tests and the sloshel project respectively in order to see the difference of pressure scaling ratio with respect to different model test scaling ratios in recent years studies on the coupling analysis between sloshing flow and ship motion have been widely introduced this coupling effect is considerable in two aspects potential risks of violent sloshing loads on lng cargo containment system lng ccs and the change of ship motion francescutto and contento 1994 gave experimental results of coupling between roll and sloshing under a regular beam sea condition malenica et al 2003 newman 2005 kim and shin 2008 conducted coupling analysis in the linear regime by frequency domain method rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 studied partially filled tanks in waves both numerically and experimentally kim et al 2007 and lee et al 2007 applied the sola scheme kim 2001 to solve sloshing problem nam et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments on lng fpso with two tanks in regular waves besides they solved the coupling problem using a nonlinear sloshing solver and a linear impulse response function imf method for ship motion and got a good agreement with the model test data later li et al 2012 and jiang 2015 applied openfoam to deal with sloshing and linear ship motion in the time domain mitra et al 2012 simulated coupling problem using nonlinear sloshing and nonlinear ship motion and analyzed responses in complex sea conditions cercos pita et al 2016 performed a cfd approach based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph to solve the nonlinear ship motion coupled with sloshing added resistance in waves is one of the major factors affecting ship performance since it makes a significant difference in the selection of ship engine and propulsion system as well as the sustainable service speed and fuel consumption liu et al 2010 in the late 1950s the first far field approach was introduced by maruo 1957 and further elaborated by maruo 1960 1963 joosen 1966 and newman 1967 since 1970s this problem has been studied widely through experiments and numerical calculations boses 1970 introduced the first near field method with a highly simplified hydrodynamic pressure distribution gerritsma and beukelman 1972 used the radiated energy approach showed that added resistance varies linearly as the square of wave height and the influence of surge on added resistance may be negligible strøm tejsenet et al 1973 did a thorough evaluation on the discrepancies between numerical results from different theoretical approaches and experimental data from relevant model tests nakamura and naito 1977 performed the self propulsion model tests for a containership journee 1992 measured the added resistance on wigley hull forms ye and hsiung 1997 applied wave green function to solve the added resistance problem recently kashiwagi et al 2009 adopted maruo s approach to calculate added resistance by applying enhanced unified theory kuroda et al 2012 studied the effect of bow shape above the mean water level on added resistance kim and kim 2011 and kim et al 2012 applied a higher order rankine panel method with both the far and near field approaches although significant progress has been made in the analysis of sloshing and added resistance separately as far as the effect of sloshing on added resistance is concerned very limited studies exist till now seo et al 2017 conducted a computation analysis on a wigley hull with two sloshing tanks using three dimensional rankine panel method which is of great value to a deeper and broader study in the future nevertheless there is no published research so far concerning this problem using experimental methods the possible two main reasons are listed below firstly the added resistance itself is generally a small proportion in the ship total resistance in waves and it is quite difficult to be accurately predicted or measured furthermore the effect of coupling between ship motions and liquid tank sloshing on added resistance will be even less thus how to separate the tiny quantity out from the total added resistance in a model test is even more difficult secondly with respect to model test the usual method nowadays for added resistance of ship advancing in waves is to restrict the ship model to some extent especially using the restriction of surge motion this may cause some differences between the model test and the actual situation the restriction will affect the liquid tank sloshing inevitably and then affect ship motions and even added resistance in a word it is quite challenging for the model test study on the effect of sloshing on added resistance in waves therefore it is quite necessary and meaningful to do a pioneering attempt at analyzing this coupling effect on ship added resistance through experimental method in this paper a lng carrier with one prismatic sloshing tank is considered in order to include the sloshing effect on surge motion and then on the added resistance free running tests surge free are carried out in the deep water towing tank under regular head seas according to the international towing tank conference ittc recommendations the added resistance is investigated by subtracting the still water resistance from the mean total resistance in waves first ship motion response amplitude operators raos from experimental measurements are compared with numerical calculations using strip method then propeller thrust and added resistance results with liquid sloshing are compared with those without sloshing it is found that internal sloshing does make a difference on both ship motions and the added resistance in waves under the test conditions in present study interestingly the added resistance decreases with liquid sloshing included 2 experimental methods 2 1 testing facilities the model test is conducted in the deep water towing tank of china ship scientific research center cssrc as shown in fig 1 the towing tank is 474m long and the test section for our experiment is about 100m long except the accelerating and decelerating sections side absorbers and front beach are installed to absorb waves the 16 unit pedal type wave maker can generate regular and irregular waves in the frequency of 0 3 1 2hz and the wave height up to 0 4m the towing carriage runs in the speed range of 0 02 20 m s no 1 trailer and 0 01 15 m s no 3 trailer 2 2 model setup a wood model of lng carrier is manufactured in cssrc with a liquid tank made of plexiglass the model ship is 6 226m long so as to make the scale ratio as large as possible the main particulars of the ship and model are listed in table 1 the dimensions of the liquid tank model are 0 939m in length 0 747m in width and 0 526m in height respectively the liquid tank model is installed on the ship model and its center of gravity is located on station 7 the distance between the bottom of liquid tank model and baseline of ship model is 0 285m fig 2 shows the body plan of the lng carrier model and fig 3 gives the cross section and a photo of the liquid tank model fig 4 presents the ship model with 70 loading tank after set up 2 3 instrumentation and data acquisition fig 5 shows the measurement device used in the free running system it is composed of steering self propulsion acquisition and wireless communication system the ship model is equipped with a rudder and a propeller an electric motor with power supplied by storage batteries is used for driving the ship model an automatic pilot controller using gyroscope signals is applied to keep the designed heading of the self propelled ship model during tests the thrust and torque of the propeller as well as the rudder angle are obtained in real time by a remote acquisition system the self propulsion dynamometer measures the thrust and torque and the gyroscope records the 6 dof acceleration and ship motion raos in roll pitch and yaw directions the incoming waves are monitored and measured by a servo type wave probe table 2 shows the specification of instrumentations used in the model test one thing needs to be pointed out is that the gyroscope measures the degree of pitch motion directly however for the surge and heave motion only acceleration can be measured the surge and heave motion raos are then obtained by two successive integrals of the corresponding acceleration 2 4 testing procedure as mentioned before any restraint to the ship model may cause unpredicted additional disturbance to the experiment and might lead to a loss of some important factors thus ship model with free running mode is used in the present study the key issues lie in two aspects how to measure the added resistance of a free running ship model in waves and how to separate the coupling effect from the measured added resistance according to ittc 2011 regulations there are two steps in the procedure of resistance tests in regular waves 1 measurement of still water resistance r 0 at the test speed 2 measurement of the resistance in waves r w at the same speed after time averaging the measured value the added resistance can be obtained by subtracting still water resistance from the total resistance r a w r w r 0 as is known to all for a towing ship model the resistance can be measured directly by using a pull force transducer yet for a free running ship model there is no direct ways strictly speaking the self propulsion ship running freely in waves would be unsteady however for a distance or period long enough the ship model could be considered as quasi steady averagely the time averaged thrust of propeller and time averaged resistance of ship model should satisfy r 0 t 0 1 t 0 in calm water and r w t w 1 t w in waves where t 0 and t w represent the thrust deduction in calm water and waves respectively hence the resistance here can be obtained by measuring the thrust of the model propeller before the free running test in the present research a powering performance towing test of the same ship model has been done from the resistance test in calm water without propeller r 0 is obtained at the target speed v then by adjusting the revolution rotation of propeller the towing force is set to be zero and t 0 is measured thus the thrust deduction at the speed v can be calculated by t 0 1 r 0 t 0 in our study we assume that the thrust deduction contains the same for all test conditions that is t 0 t 0 s t w t w s the flowchart below in fig 6 provides the outline of the whole procedure for the self propulsion free running tests firstly model tests are carried out in calm water without liquid tank for a given distance which is long enough for the ship model to run steadily or quasi steadily the ship speeds v 1 v 2 v 3 and propeller thrust forces t 1 t 2 t 3 can be measured correspondingly at given propeller rotations n 1 n 2 and n 3 then the rotation n 0 torque q 0 and thrust force t 0 of the propeller at a certain target ship speed v can be obtained by using interpolation the resistance in calm water r 0 satisfying r 0 t 0 1 t 0 has already been gained from the towing test results secondly self propulsion tests with ballast weights are conducted in head waves thirdly free running tests with liquid sloshing are performed in calm water finally tests with liquid sloshing are conducted under the same wave conditions as in step 2 following the same process in the first step t w t 0s and t ws can be calculated by interpolation generally the thrust change due to incoming waves without and with sloshing can be expressed as δ t t w t 0 and δ t s t w s t 0 respectively here since both t 0 and t 0s are tested in calm water the thrust change with sloshing due to incoming waves can be calculated in two ways noted as δ t s 1 t w s t 0 and δ t s 2 t w s t 0 s next we can get the total resistance of the ship model in waves without sloshing named r w t w 1 t w and with sloshing r 0 s t 0 s 1 t 0 s in calm water r w s t w s 1 t w s in head seas then the added resistance without sloshing is presented as r a w r w r 0 while the added resistance with sloshing is r a w s r w s r 0 finally the effect of liquid sloshing on added resistance can be achieved by analyzing the difference between the two values regarded as δ r a w s r a w 2 5 testing matrix the design speed of the lng carrier in prototype is 16 9kn the target speed of the model lng carrier is set to be 1 448 m s in accordance with the prototype speed 15kn during the test the model ship is driven under different propeller rotations then the corresponding trusts torques and model speeds can be obtained next we use the interpolation method to get the above parameters under the target speed 1 448 m s the target speed shall be in the range of the ship advancing speeds corresponding to given propeller rotation speeds test conditions in calm water is shown in table 3 it should be pointed out that in order to precisely replace the liquid tank for the cases of ship model without sloshing proper ballast weights with the same mass placed on the same position is used besides the gravity height and longitudinal inertia radius of the ballast weights are also the same with those of replaced liquid the details of the replacement is shown in fig 7 a snapshot of ship model with ballast weight is shown in fig 8 after calm water analysis the model tests are then conducted in regular head sea condition filling level of 70 tank height is selected as the load condition and the tint water is used as the filling liquid instead of lng the added resistance is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude which means that the quality of wave making is very important to the accuracy of the added resistance results thus all the waves are calibrated carefully before model tests six regular waves combined with three different propeller rotation speeds with and without liquid sloshing are tested the periods of selected regular waves should include the resonant periods of the ship motions and the liquid tank sloshing at 70 filling level the longitudinal natural frequency of the liquid tank is 0 8489 faltinsen and timokha 2009 the wavelength ranges from 0 5l to 1 3l and the wave height is set to 0 1m at the point of λ l 0 85 the wave encounter frequency is 0 8521 where the resonance may occur detailed wave conditions and model test information are summarized in table 4 below 3 data analysis method 3 1 stages of ship motion at each run of the model test as shown in fig 9 illustrated by the time history of propeller thrust there are four time stages listed as follows stage 1 partly constraining stage waiting incoming wave to be steady stage 2 acceleration stage rotating the propeller and meanwhile releasing the ship model stage 3 steady stage free running data collection stage 4 braking stage turning off the propeller waiting the model stop all the parameters needed for later analysis are collected in stage 3 when the model ship moves in a steady state 3 2 rudder angle it is important to control the bow angle because the backward flow of the propeller is asymmetric fig 10 shows the rudder use in real time both in calm water and in waves here t 0 is relatively to the starting time of stage 3 of each wave condition it is easy to see that there is no significant rudder use so the ship can keep a straight course during the model test 3 3 data processing as mentioned above the measured parameters including propeller thrust torque and pitch motion rao of the model ship are collected in the steady stage those data need to be time averaged before final analysis fig 11 presents the measured parameters in real time under the case no s03 similarly to fig 10 t 0 here is relatively to the starting time of stage 3 of each wave condition in each figure the red curves show the real time variation and the blue lines give the averaged values of each parameter for thrust and torque the averaging value is the simple arithmetic mean for the pitch motion the peaks and throughs are picked and arithmetic means are calculated separately noted as a and b then the motion amplitude is obtained by a b 2 4 results and discussions 4 1 ship motion responses ship motion raos measured from model test are compared with those calculated from numerical simulation since the key to the present study is experimental analysis a quick computation using an in house coding with stf salvesen et al 1970 strip theory is applied to show the tendency of motion fig 12 shows the surge heave and pitch motion raos of the self propulsion ship in regular head sea conditions here the black dash line represents numerical results without considering inner sloshing while the solid line expresses experimental results the blue one with round dots shows the uncoupled ship motion without liquid sloshing the red one with triangular dots shows the coupled ship motion with 70 h filling tank as seen from fig 12 b and c although there are small discrepancies between numerical and experimental curves the whole tendencies are the same especially indicated by pitch motion rao the differences of ship motion raos between uncoupled and coupled are analyzed through model test data as for heave and pitch motion the coupled motion raos are smaller when 0 85 λ l 0 95 in the case of surge motion in fig 7 a as λ l becomes larger than 0 85 coupled motion raos are smaller compared with uncoupled results one thing needs to be mentioned is that at the point of λ l 0 85 the encounter frequency in waves is 0 8521 very close to 0 8489 which is the fundamental natural frequency of longitude motion of the liquid tank therefore under such test conditions sloshing phenomena decreases the ship motion rao as much as 43 6 in surge 7 23 in heave and 3 66 in pitch 4 2 propeller rotation and torque to maintain a constant speed of the lng carrier the circular frequency and torque of the propeller shaft is controlled the rotation speed and torque in calm water is recorded as n 0 and q 0 with solid ballast n 0s and q 0s with liquid sloshing respectively while under regular head sea conditions rotation speed and torque are represented as n w and q w in the case without sloshing n ws and q ws with liquid sloshing next comparisons on δ nq are made to see the effect of sloshing on parameters related to the ship propeller since the engine power is proportional to nq the difference made by incoming waves could be presented as δ n q n w q w n 0 q 0 with ballast weight onboard and δ n q s n w s q w s n 0 s q 0 s with internal sloshing fig 13 shows the comparisons of δ nq due to incoming waves with and without liquid tank onboard the blue line with round marks represents the case without sloshing while the red line with triangular marks shows δ nq with internal sloshing it is observed that both of the two curves go up as λ increases and go down at the point of λ l 1 1 where the wavelength is around the ship length and resonance may occur besides the existence of liquid sloshing makes the engine power decrease for all wavelengths especially in the short and middle wavelength part the energy reduction is bigger 4 3 propeller thrust thrust of propeller shaft is a key parameter in the model test because the ship resistance is calculated based on the value of thrust to maintain the same speed there must be an increase in propeller thrust when ship sails in waves instead of still water as mentioned before for the case of ship without internal sloshing thrust change due to incoming waves can be expressed as δ t t w t 0 for the case with sloshing there are two forms of thrust change δ t s 1 t w s t 0 and δ t s 2 t w s t 0 s depending on the whether sloshing is considered in calm water as the baseline fig 14 shows the comparisons of thrust change increase due to incoming waves with and without internal sloshing the blue line with round marks represents δt without sloshing while the red and green lines show δts1 and δts2 with internal sloshing it is easy to see that both of the three curves have the same trend with those of δ nq first increasing with λ and then decreasing after λ l 1 1 similarly internal sloshing makes the thrust change in waves smaller in other words a save of energy under current test conditions besides as λ l becomes bigger δts1 tends to δt while δts2 still keeps a certain discrepancy that is to say when ship model runs in calm water liquid sloshing makes some differences on the ship motion resulting in that t0s is bigger than t0 when λ l 1 1 4 4 added resistance in waves using the procedure introduced in fig 6 above first we can get the thrust deduction in calm water from the previous powering performance towing model test t 0 1 r 0 t 0 1 25 573 31 449 0 1868 then by assuming the same thrust deduction in waves we can get the ship resistance from the measured propeller thrust under each wave condition both with and without liquid sloshing finally the added resistance in waves is given as r a w r w r 0 without sloshing and r a w s r w s r 0 with sloshing fig 15 below gives the comparisons in detail here the blue line with round marks represents r a w without sloshing while the red line with triangular marks shows r a w s with internal sloshing due to r a w δ t 1 t w and r a w s δ t s 1 1 t w we can see that the two curves show exactly the same trend with δt and δts1 besides the peak of added resistance in waves shifts to longer wave section after sloshing involved what is more under the determined test conditions in present study for all wavelengths r a w s r a w which means that the existence of sloshing makes the value of added resistance in waves lower by comparing figs 10 12 it is not difficult to say that those results match with each other a decrease in added resistance with sloshing included may reflect a lower need in the engine power output and a less propeller thrust that is a save of energy as fig 12 shows it is interesting to see that the biggest difference of ship motion occurs in surge then the change of ship added resistance with and without sloshing may come from the change of surge motion which seems conflicting with the conclusion of gerritsma and beukelman 1972 actually it is not the case although there is no strong coupling between heave pitch and surge the pitch rao of surge fixed model is slightly larger compared with that of surge free model from the energy point of view a certain part of energy is dissipated through pitch motion if surge is fixed in the present study when 0 85 λ l 0 95 the liquid tank acts like a motion reducer it reduces surge most and then heave and pitch that is the liquid inside dissipates the energy so that the thrust with sloshing is smaller as well as added resistance in waves 5 concluding remarks this paper gives a preliminary analysis and pioneer work of effect of sloshing on added resistance in waves through experimental methods a lng carrier with one prismatic tank is considered and the model scale is 1 27 384 to make the test results more reliable free running tests are carried out so as to take the surge motion into account both solid ballast and liquid tank onboard are tested in calm water and regular head seas from the above experiment with one filling level 70 of tank height considered the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a whole procedure of free running test is developed and conducted for the study of sloshing effect on added resistance in waves it is trailblazing because no such model tests have been carried out until now 2 sloshing changes ship motion under the wave conditions listed in the model tests sloshing reduces both surge and pitch motion raos at the range of 0 85 λ l 0 95 3 sloshing changes added resistance in waves similarly to motion raos sloshing reduces δ nq and r aw it should be noted that this reduction could only be established under the specific test conditions above in this case engine power results from sea trial are underestimated if liquid ballast is used instead of solid ballast it is expected that this research can give an emphasis on the significance of sloshing effect on added resistance in waves since the added resistance takes one role in eedi calculation this work is valuable and necessary for both purchasers and designers of ships in the future more filling ratios of the liquid tank and more wave conditions including irregular seas could be taken into consideration and the proposed model test measurement

20514,engineering practice presents some impact of sloshing and ship motion interaction on added resistance in waves and this paper is an attempt to figure out the effect of such impact through experiment while theoretical investigation is troubling scholars due to the complexity of this problem a liquefied natural gas lng carrier scaled to 1 27 384 with one prismatic tank is modeled for free running tests in regular head waves of 6 different wavelengths in the deepwater towing tank of china scientific research center cssrc for each wave case the revolution rate of propeller the ship speed and corresponding torque and thrust are measured and the added resistance is thereafter obtained by subtracting the still water resistance from the mean total resistance on assumption of a constant thrust deduction the experimental results are comparatively discussed in conditions of sloshing and ballast weight it is found that under current test conditions internal sloshing affects ship motion by reducing its value and the added resistance in waves decreases accordingly while the energy consumption decreases the experimental results that liquid sloshing has an evident influence on the added resistance shall be a very important consideration for the development of green lng cargos keywords model test free running self propulsion sloshing added resistance 1 introduction in ship hydrodynamics the problem of liquefied natural gas lng ships sailing in waves is actually ship motion responses coupling with liquid tank sloshing when a ship with liquid tank sails in waves wave exciting force and moment will cause ship motion responses and ship motion responses will cause sloshing in liquid tank meanwhile sloshing exciting force and moment will affect ship motion responses this is a very complicated coupled process recently energy issues have caused more and more attention on one hand the demand for natural gas in the world energy market has been growing on the other hand international maritime organization imo introduced the concept of energy efficiency design index eedi which aims to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions from global shipping industry since the added resistance in waves takes one term in the eedi formula ship designers are seeking all kinds of ways to diminish it to make ships green strøm tejsen et al 1973 pointed out that accurate predictions of ship motion are more important than improvements in added resistance theory therefore it is necessary and meaningful to study the effect of internal sloshing on ship motion which may lead to a change of added resistance in waves research on sloshing phenomena and sloshing induced loads were extensively carried out from the 1970s abramson et al 1974 introduced the potentially dangerous loads on ship tanks faltinsen et al 2000 faltinsen and timokha 2001 and faltinsen et al 2005 came up with a modal system method for analytical approach since analytical solutions have limitations such as geometry restriction model testing has been considered as the most reliable method in predicting the maximum impact pressure due to violent sloshing yung et al 2009 studied sloshing model test and identified relevant dimensionless numbers necessary for the dynamic similarity of scaled model tests involving local pressures however some technical issues in the application of experimental data to actual tank designs are not yet completely resolved for example the scaling law from model test data to real ships is not yet clear kimmoun et al 2009 and bogaert et al 2010 carried out wave canal tests and the sloshel project respectively in order to see the difference of pressure scaling ratio with respect to different model test scaling ratios in recent years studies on the coupling analysis between sloshing flow and ship motion have been widely introduced this coupling effect is considerable in two aspects potential risks of violent sloshing loads on lng cargo containment system lng ccs and the change of ship motion francescutto and contento 1994 gave experimental results of coupling between roll and sloshing under a regular beam sea condition malenica et al 2003 newman 2005 kim and shin 2008 conducted coupling analysis in the linear regime by frequency domain method rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 studied partially filled tanks in waves both numerically and experimentally kim et al 2007 and lee et al 2007 applied the sola scheme kim 2001 to solve sloshing problem nam et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments on lng fpso with two tanks in regular waves besides they solved the coupling problem using a nonlinear sloshing solver and a linear impulse response function imf method for ship motion and got a good agreement with the model test data later li et al 2012 and jiang 2015 applied openfoam to deal with sloshing and linear ship motion in the time domain mitra et al 2012 simulated coupling problem using nonlinear sloshing and nonlinear ship motion and analyzed responses in complex sea conditions cercos pita et al 2016 performed a cfd approach based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph to solve the nonlinear ship motion coupled with sloshing added resistance in waves is one of the major factors affecting ship performance since it makes a significant difference in the selection of ship engine and propulsion system as well as the sustainable service speed and fuel consumption liu et al 2010 in the late 1950s the first far field approach was introduced by maruo 1957 and further elaborated by maruo 1960 1963 joosen 1966 and newman 1967 since 1970s this problem has been studied widely through experiments and numerical calculations boses 1970 introduced the first near field method with a highly simplified hydrodynamic pressure distribution gerritsma and beukelman 1972 used the radiated energy approach showed that added resistance varies linearly as the square of wave height and the influence of surge on added resistance may be negligible strøm tejsenet et al 1973 did a thorough evaluation on the discrepancies between numerical results from different theoretical approaches and experimental data from relevant model tests nakamura and naito 1977 performed the self propulsion model tests for a containership journee 1992 measured the added resistance on wigley hull forms ye and hsiung 1997 applied wave green function to solve the added resistance problem recently kashiwagi et al 2009 adopted maruo s approach to calculate added resistance by applying enhanced unified theory kuroda et al 2012 studied the effect of bow shape above the mean water level on added resistance kim and kim 2011 and kim et al 2012 applied a higher order rankine panel method with both the far and near field approaches although significant progress has been made in the analysis of sloshing and added resistance separately as far as the effect of sloshing on added resistance is concerned very limited studies exist till now seo et al 2017 conducted a computation analysis on a wigley hull with two sloshing tanks using three dimensional rankine panel method which is of great value to a deeper and broader study in the future nevertheless there is no published research so far concerning this problem using experimental methods the possible two main reasons are listed below firstly the added resistance itself is generally a small proportion in the ship total resistance in waves and it is quite difficult to be accurately predicted or measured furthermore the effect of coupling between ship motions and liquid tank sloshing on added resistance will be even less thus how to separate the tiny quantity out from the total added resistance in a model test is even more difficult secondly with respect to model test the usual method nowadays for added resistance of ship advancing in waves is to restrict the ship model to some extent especially using the restriction of surge motion this may cause some differences between the model test and the actual situation the restriction will affect the liquid tank sloshing inevitably and then affect ship motions and even added resistance in a word it is quite challenging for the model test study on the effect of sloshing on added resistance in waves therefore it is quite necessary and meaningful to do a pioneering attempt at analyzing this coupling effect on ship added resistance through experimental method in this paper a lng carrier with one prismatic sloshing tank is considered in order to include the sloshing effect on surge motion and then on the added resistance free running tests surge free are carried out in the deep water towing tank under regular head seas according to the international towing tank conference ittc recommendations the added resistance is investigated by subtracting the still water resistance from the mean total resistance in waves first ship motion response amplitude operators raos from experimental measurements are compared with numerical calculations using strip method then propeller thrust and added resistance results with liquid sloshing are compared with those without sloshing it is found that internal sloshing does make a difference on both ship motions and the added resistance in waves under the test conditions in present study interestingly the added resistance decreases with liquid sloshing included 2 experimental methods 2 1 testing facilities the model test is conducted in the deep water towing tank of china ship scientific research center cssrc as shown in fig 1 the towing tank is 474m long and the test section for our experiment is about 100m long except the accelerating and decelerating sections side absorbers and front beach are installed to absorb waves the 16 unit pedal type wave maker can generate regular and irregular waves in the frequency of 0 3 1 2hz and the wave height up to 0 4m the towing carriage runs in the speed range of 0 02 20 m s no 1 trailer and 0 01 15 m s no 3 trailer 2 2 model setup a wood model of lng carrier is manufactured in cssrc with a liquid tank made of plexiglass the model ship is 6 226m long so as to make the scale ratio as large as possible the main particulars of the ship and model are listed in table 1 the dimensions of the liquid tank model are 0 939m in length 0 747m in width and 0 526m in height respectively the liquid tank model is installed on the ship model and its center of gravity is located on station 7 the distance between the bottom of liquid tank model and baseline of ship model is 0 285m fig 2 shows the body plan of the lng carrier model and fig 3 gives the cross section and a photo of the liquid tank model fig 4 presents the ship model with 70 loading tank after set up 2 3 instrumentation and data acquisition fig 5 shows the measurement device used in the free running system it is composed of steering self propulsion acquisition and wireless communication system the ship model is equipped with a rudder and a propeller an electric motor with power supplied by storage batteries is used for driving the ship model an automatic pilot controller using gyroscope signals is applied to keep the designed heading of the self propelled ship model during tests the thrust and torque of the propeller as well as the rudder angle are obtained in real time by a remote acquisition system the self propulsion dynamometer measures the thrust and torque and the gyroscope records the 6 dof acceleration and ship motion raos in roll pitch and yaw directions the incoming waves are monitored and measured by a servo type wave probe table 2 shows the specification of instrumentations used in the model test one thing needs to be pointed out is that the gyroscope measures the degree of pitch motion directly however for the surge and heave motion only acceleration can be measured the surge and heave motion raos are then obtained by two successive integrals of the corresponding acceleration 2 4 testing procedure as mentioned before any restraint to the ship model may cause unpredicted additional disturbance to the experiment and might lead to a loss of some important factors thus ship model with free running mode is used in the present study the key issues lie in two aspects how to measure the added resistance of a free running ship model in waves and how to separate the coupling effect from the measured added resistance according to ittc 2011 regulations there are two steps in the procedure of resistance tests in regular waves 1 measurement of still water resistance r 0 at the test speed 2 measurement of the resistance in waves r w at the same speed after time averaging the measured value the added resistance can be obtained by subtracting still water resistance from the total resistance r a w r w r 0 as is known to all for a towing ship model the resistance can be measured directly by using a pull force transducer yet for a free running ship model there is no direct ways strictly speaking the self propulsion ship running freely in waves would be unsteady however for a distance or period long enough the ship model could be considered as quasi steady averagely the time averaged thrust of propeller and time averaged resistance of ship model should satisfy r 0 t 0 1 t 0 in calm water and r w t w 1 t w in waves where t 0 and t w represent the thrust deduction in calm water and waves respectively hence the resistance here can be obtained by measuring the thrust of the model propeller before the free running test in the present research a powering performance towing test of the same ship model has been done from the resistance test in calm water without propeller r 0 is obtained at the target speed v then by adjusting the revolution rotation of propeller the towing force is set to be zero and t 0 is measured thus the thrust deduction at the speed v can be calculated by t 0 1 r 0 t 0 in our study we assume that the thrust deduction contains the same for all test conditions that is t 0 t 0 s t w t w s the flowchart below in fig 6 provides the outline of the whole procedure for the self propulsion free running tests firstly model tests are carried out in calm water without liquid tank for a given distance which is long enough for the ship model to run steadily or quasi steadily the ship speeds v 1 v 2 v 3 and propeller thrust forces t 1 t 2 t 3 can be measured correspondingly at given propeller rotations n 1 n 2 and n 3 then the rotation n 0 torque q 0 and thrust force t 0 of the propeller at a certain target ship speed v can be obtained by using interpolation the resistance in calm water r 0 satisfying r 0 t 0 1 t 0 has already been gained from the towing test results secondly self propulsion tests with ballast weights are conducted in head waves thirdly free running tests with liquid sloshing are performed in calm water finally tests with liquid sloshing are conducted under the same wave conditions as in step 2 following the same process in the first step t w t 0s and t ws can be calculated by interpolation generally the thrust change due to incoming waves without and with sloshing can be expressed as δ t t w t 0 and δ t s t w s t 0 respectively here since both t 0 and t 0s are tested in calm water the thrust change with sloshing due to incoming waves can be calculated in two ways noted as δ t s 1 t w s t 0 and δ t s 2 t w s t 0 s next we can get the total resistance of the ship model in waves without sloshing named r w t w 1 t w and with sloshing r 0 s t 0 s 1 t 0 s in calm water r w s t w s 1 t w s in head seas then the added resistance without sloshing is presented as r a w r w r 0 while the added resistance with sloshing is r a w s r w s r 0 finally the effect of liquid sloshing on added resistance can be achieved by analyzing the difference between the two values regarded as δ r a w s r a w 2 5 testing matrix the design speed of the lng carrier in prototype is 16 9kn the target speed of the model lng carrier is set to be 1 448 m s in accordance with the prototype speed 15kn during the test the model ship is driven under different propeller rotations then the corresponding trusts torques and model speeds can be obtained next we use the interpolation method to get the above parameters under the target speed 1 448 m s the target speed shall be in the range of the ship advancing speeds corresponding to given propeller rotation speeds test conditions in calm water is shown in table 3 it should be pointed out that in order to precisely replace the liquid tank for the cases of ship model without sloshing proper ballast weights with the same mass placed on the same position is used besides the gravity height and longitudinal inertia radius of the ballast weights are also the same with those of replaced liquid the details of the replacement is shown in fig 7 a snapshot of ship model with ballast weight is shown in fig 8 after calm water analysis the model tests are then conducted in regular head sea condition filling level of 70 tank height is selected as the load condition and the tint water is used as the filling liquid instead of lng the added resistance is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude which means that the quality of wave making is very important to the accuracy of the added resistance results thus all the waves are calibrated carefully before model tests six regular waves combined with three different propeller rotation speeds with and without liquid sloshing are tested the periods

sloshing is considered in calm water as the baseline fig 14 shows the comparisons of thrust change increase due to incoming waves with and without internal sloshing the blue line with round marks represents δt without sloshing while the red and green lines show δts1 and δts2 with internal sloshing it is easy to see that both of the three curves have the same trend with those of δ nq first increasing with λ and then decreasing after λ l 1 1 similarly internal sloshing makes the thrust change in waves smaller in other words a save of energy under current test conditions besides as λ l becomes bigger δts1 tends to δt while δts2 still keeps a certain discrepancy that is to say when ship model runs in calm water liquid sloshing makes some differences on the ship motion resulting in that t0s is bigger than t0 when λ l 1 1 4 4 added resistance in waves using the procedure introduced in fig 6 above first we can get the thrust deduction in calm water from the previous powering performance towing model test t 0 1 r 0 t 0 1 25 573 31 449 0 1868 then by assuming the same thrust deduction in waves we can get the ship resistance from the measured propeller thrust under each wave condition both with and without liquid sloshing finally the added resistance in waves is given as r a w r w r 0 without sloshing and r a w s r w s r 0 with sloshing fig 15 below gives the comparisons in detail here the blue line with round marks represents r a w without sloshing while the red line with triangular marks shows r a w s with internal sloshing due to r a w δ t 1 t w and r a w s δ t s 1 1 t w we can see that the two curves show exactly the same trend with δt and δts1 besides the peak of added resistance in waves shifts to longer wave section after sloshing involved what is more under the determined test conditions in present study for all wavelengths r a w s r a w which means that the existence of sloshing makes the value of added resistance in waves lower by comparing figs 10 12 it is not difficult to say that those results match with each other a decrease in added resistance with sloshing included may reflect a lower need in the engine power output and a less propeller thrust that is a save of energy as fig 12 shows it is interesting to see that the biggest difference of ship motion occurs in surge then the change of ship added resistance with and without sloshing may come from the change of surge motion which seems conflicting with the conclusion of gerritsma and beukelman 1972 actually it is not the case although there is no strong coupling between heave pitch and surge the pitch rao of surge fixed model is slightly larger compared with that of surge free model from the energy point of view a certain part of energy is dissipated through pitch motion if surge is fixed in the present study when 0 85 λ l 0 95 the liquid tank acts like a motion reducer it reduces surge most and then heave and pitch that is the liquid inside dissipates the energy so that the thrust with sloshing is smaller as well as added resistance in waves 5 concluding remarks this paper gives a preliminary analysis and pioneer work of effect of sloshing on added resistance in waves through experimental methods a lng carrier with one prismatic tank is considered and the model scale is 1 27 384 to make the test results more reliable free running tests are carried out so as to take the surge motion into account both solid ballast and liquid tank onboard are tested in calm water and regular head seas from the above experiment with one filling level 70 of tank height considered the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a whole procedure of free running test is developed and conducted for the study of sloshing effect on added resistance in waves it is trailblazing because no such model tests have been carried out until now 2 sloshing changes ship motion under the wave conditions listed in the model tests sloshing reduces both surge and pitch motion raos at the range of 0 85 λ l 0 95 3 sloshing changes added resistance in waves similarly to motion raos sloshing reduces δ nq and r aw it should be noted that this reduction could only be established under the specific test conditions above in this case engine power results from sea trial are underestimated if liquid ballast is used instead of solid ballast it is expected that this research can give an emphasis on the significance of sloshing effect on added resistance in waves since the added resistance takes one role in eedi calculation this work is valuable and necessary for both purchasers and designers of ships in the future more filling ratios of the liquid tank and more wave conditions including irregular seas could be taken into consideration and the proposed model test measurement method could be improved so that more fruitful results could be achieved credit authorship contribution statement miaozi zheng conceptualization methodology investigation visualization writing
