2013 murali et al 2019 semadeni davies et al 2008 furthermore the widespread application of sustainable practices i e water conservation practices have resulted in decreased wastewater inflows and increased solid concentrations which have severely altered biochemical processes occurring in sewer networks butler 2018 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 marleni et al 2012 murali et al 2019 for example the increasing quantities of fat oil and grease discharged into the sewer systems can trap and accumulate sediments on sewer beds and eventually lead to fatberg formations butler 2018 ugarelli et al 2009 causing frequent blockages corrosion and odor problems in sewer pipes gosset et al 2016 gross et al 2017 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 blockages can lead to sewer overflows which would release raw sewage containing a range of contaminants in particulate and soluble forms to both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems rodríguez et al 2012 ten veldhuis et al 2010 to avoid sewer blockages and deteriorations sewer conditions should be frequently accessed currently there are a few technologies on the market including visual inspections using closed circuit television utility hole inspection camera dye testing smoke testing and acoustic technologies that are suitable for their respective niche applications panasiuk et al 2015 plihal et al 2014 however these technologies are low throughput time consuming labor intensive or lacking real time monitoring capabilities the need for high throughput robust cost effective sewer monitoring is mounting in many other fields battery free wireless sensing technologies have received increasing interest due to their unobtrusive nature energy efficient operation and minimal sensor costs edmondson et al 2018 potyrailo et al 2012 tanguy et al 2015 however such sensing technologies are still rare in the field of sewer monitoring and assessment radiofrequency identification rfid technology especially ultra high frequency uhf rfid 865 928 mhz has been widely applied in many industries and large scale internet of things iot applications due to its simple architecture real time sensing capability and versatile detection ranges arnaud et al 2015 cassel et al 2017b colin et al 2019 jun et al 2016 sun et al 2013 tanguy et al 2015 compared to battery operated sensor tags known as active tags passive rfid tags are much more popular because of their battery free nature longer life span small size and low cost jun et al 2016 however the application of rfid based sensors in environmental engineering particularly in water environments is still scarce because radio wave transmissions are extremely sensitive to air and water conductivity among a number of other essential factors benelli et al 2011 benelli and pozzebo 2013 bertoni et al 2010 chapuis et al 2014 tatiparthi et al 2020 for example studies have reported that a change in rfid tag orientation from horizontal to vertical resulted in a 26 76 reduction in tag detection ranges papangelakis et al 2019 tsakiris et al 2015 although possessing superb reading ranges uhf rfid is even more sensitive to water creating a challenge to apply this technology for sanitary or stormwater network monitoring this study aims to design and evaluate passive uhf rfid based sensors for sewer blockage and illicit connection monitoring applications we first investigated the performance of a suite of uhf rfid tags to determine their optimum reading ranges related to tag antenna interplay then we tested the tags in a laboratory hydraulic flume to determine the effect of water flow conditions on the received signal strength indication rssi values finally the rfid systems were field tested in both sanitary and stormwater networks through this study we demonstrated that low cost high throughput and non invasive approaches for monitoring buried utility service infrastructures are achievable the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present essential materials and methods of our experiments including identifying factors affecting rfid tags and reader antenna communications determining effective reading zones of the selected uhf rfid sensors and evaluating the performance of the uhf rfid sensors in field trials in section 3 we present and discuss experimental results focusing on the reading ranges field trial discoveries and cost analysis of the uhf rfid based sewer survey system finally in section 4 we drew conclusions from the work and propose future research directions 2 materials and methods in section 2 1 the rfid equipment used in our study is summarized in section 2 2 the determination of effective reading zones is presented finally in section 2 3 the evaluation method of uhf rfid based sensors in aquatic environments and field trial procedures are described additional experimental materials and methods used in this study are provided in the supporting information 2 1 rfid equipment the rfid equipment used in this study were obtained from two suppliers the first reader designated as m6e supporting information figure s1 a was a four channel thingmagic mercury 6e uhf rfid reader jadak usa the frequency range of the reader antenna was 865 928 mhz two antennae typologies from the mti wireless edge ltd usa were connected to the m6e reader i 9 dbic circular polarization antenna figure s1 b ii 12 5 dbi linear polarization antenna figure s1 c the second rfid reader shenzhen ruifan electronics china designated as szrf contained an inbuilt 8 dbic circular polarization antenna figure s1 d within the reader and an interface connected through a computer to rs232 serial communication additional details of the rfid equipment are presented in the supporting information section s1 1 2 2 determination of effective reading zones of uhf rfid sensor tags twelve types of uhf rfid sensor tags were tested for additional details of these tags see table s1 and section s1 2 in the supporting information with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae for the identification of the maximum reading distances z d five randomly selected sensor tags out of 20 from each type were measured at least ten times with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae respectively initially each tag was placed in the center of each antenna defined as x0 y0 then z d was measured by moving the tag away from the antenna center slowly supporting information figure s2 finally tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 were selected for further evaluation based on their better z d ranges and smaller physical sizes that are appropriate for sewer applications because the vertical and horizontal orientations of rfid tags can significantly affect their actual reading ranges creating a three dimensional space the detecting ranges of the selected tags were tested by rotating them from α 0 designated as the horizontal position h and α 90 designated as the vertical position v relative to the antenna plane xi yi zi also see in section s1 3 in the supporting information each of the selected tags was measured at least ten times with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae at 12 positions every 30 increment with respect to the antenna in the horizontal and vertical axes figure s3 2 3 evaluation of uhf rfid based sensors in aquatic environments testing in a controlled aquatic environment was conducted in a 19 m long 0 45 m wide and 0 5 m deep flume with a slope of 1 50 m m in the fluid mechanics laboratory at the university of auckland the detailed experimental setups of the reader antenna are provided in the supporting information section s1 4 s1 5 and figure s4 a series of tests were designed to assess the propagation of rf waves and their detection limits at changing flow rates 7 71 l s under turbulent flow conditions reynolds number re 10000 73000 in general ten of tag 7 and ten of tag 9 were fixed on a wooden board with a 5 cm interval figure s4 s6 and the signal strengths of both sensors under various flow rates and water depths below and above water levels were measured the tag 7 group and tag 9 group sensors were designated as tag 7 01 to 10 and tag 9 01 to 10 respectively based on their relative positions from the bottom to the top on the wooden board in the flume the identification number of each tag and its received signal strength indication rssi were continuously measured and recorded using ura universal reading assistance software at each run total 12 runs the tag signals were recorded for at least five minutes to attain several values of rssi in different water depths table s2 the rssi values in dbm and their descriptive data statistics were processed using origin lab software version 9 7 originlab corporation usa throughout each run three replicates of experiments were recorded in each test run table s2 and flow conditions were set identically in all the 12 runs finally two field trials were conducted in two catchment areas in the city of auckland new zealand to evaluate the performance of the designed rfid sensors in a segment of sanitary sewer and stormwater pipes the total material costs for fabricating uhf rfid based sensors and other equipment costs for the field trials are summarized in table 1 in each segment of the trial catchment one utility hole was opened for the temporary installation of the rfid system the rfid reader with two antennae 9 dbic was positioned according to the effective reading range design shown in fig 2 in two utility holes at a time during the field trials in all utility holes antennae were adjusted to be within the effective reading distance d f between 0 57 3 5 m which is based on the depth and actual water surface of the utility hole in one catchment rfid antennae were temporarily installed just below the rim level of a stormwater utility hole 2 m depth and a sanitary utility hole 2 5 m depth because their depths fall within the effective reading distance d f in another catchment an rfid antenna was temporarily installed deep inside a sanitary utility hole 6 m depth using a scaffold modified from a heavy duty tripod however in this particular catchment rfid antenna installation in the stormwater utility hole was not permitted by the on site manager due to accessibility and safety issues all antenna installations in this study were temporary because no permanent scaffold or modifications to the interior of the utility holes were allowed by the authority during our field trials afterward we flushed polylactic acid pla encapsulated tag 7 and tag 9 uhf rfid based sensors n 109 through a total of 39 household properties via their wastewater gully traps the sensors were released during low domestic sewage inflows in each catchment between 10 am and 4 pm and its percentage of detection rates were evaluated in downstream utility holes 3 results and discussion this section covers the key discoveries and evaluates the performance of the proposed rfid systems and uhf rfid sensors first in section 3 1 we present the performance and material cost of various uhf rfid tags then in section 3 2 we present effective reading ranges of uhf rfid tags relative to the orientation and specific antenna plane the experimental results on the uhf rfid performance at the water air interface are presented and discussed in section 3 3 in section 3 4 the effective reading ranges of tags on various supporting materials are discussed finally the field test results and a cost analysis of the rfid system are described in section 3 5 and section 3 6 respectively additional results and discussion can be found in the supporting information 3 1 determination of maximum reading distances of uhf rfid sensor tags the reading range i e backscattering sequence between the center of an rfid reader antenna and an rfid sensor tag is based on a number of factors and could be influenced by different environmental surroundings koo et al 2011 lee et al 2015 rao et al 2005 these factors include the tag response threshold orientation impedance matching between the tag dipole antenna and its integrated circuit ic chip therefore we tested 12 different types of uhf rfid sensor tags in order to identify their sensing ranges with different reader antenna combinations it can be clearly seen from fig 1 that sensor tags exhibited a broad spectrum of reading ranges anova p 0 05 when detected with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae respectively the sensing performance of all the measured sensor tags revealed that some types of tags have consistently longer reading ranges e g up to 8 m while others achieved no more than 4 m e g tags 1 5 due to the reflected signal morphology of a combination of amplitude and phase of sensor tags that changed the detection ranges however reading distances were considerably higher for all tags with the 12 5 dbi antenna than with the 9 dbic and 8 dbic antennae compared to other tags the highest mean reading ranges were achieved with tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 at 6 51 m 6 61 m and 7 95 m respectively as a result tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 were chosen for further study because of their low cost about usd 3 to 6 dollars per tag small sizes and satisfactory maximum reading distances fig 1 3 2 effective reading zones affected by rfid tags orientations and positions to an antenna the reading ranges of the rfid tags have been shown to depend heavily on the orientation of the tag relative to the antenna plane as reported in pebble tracking in rivers arnaud et al 2015 chapuis et al 2014 papangelakis et al 2019 food industry warehouses and logistics applications allan et al 2013 alyahya et al 2016 barge et al 2019 lim et al 2013 therefore the orientation effect of the tags used in this study must be known for better sensor design before deploying these sensors for field applications specific detection responses and sensitivity of the three rfid sensors tags 7 8 and 9 were determined for their respective horizontal and vertical orientations figure s3 as shown in fig 2 a a f sensing ranges were better with the 12 5 dbi antenna gain as compared to the 8 dbic or the 9 dbic antennae except for tag 8 which responded better to the 9 dbic antenna the highest reading ranges of the tags were achieved at approximately 120 and or 275 degrees overall when the tags were positioned along the bottom edge of an antenna the maximum reading distances decreased presumably due to the change in the signals reflection range this highlights that the orientation and the relative position of a tag to the antenna are crucial variables when assessing the detection limits in an application chapuis et al 2014 from fig 2a we noticed that as tags moved away from the bottom edge of the antenna a sharp reduction in reading detections was observed as a result of the change in tag orientation the sensitivity of the tags reduced and fell below the z d shown in fig 1 for example for tag 9 with a 12 5 dbic at the center antenna z d was 8 m while at the edge of the antenna this range drastically reduced to 3 5 m with α 0 and to 0 20 m with α 90 in practice the effective reading distance d f is the key performance index in determining the position of the rfid reader antenna and the method of deployment i e deep shaft v s shallow shaft sewer and stormwater utility holes it can also be deduced from the literature that space confinement effective depth water flowrate flow turbulence and other geometric parameters of a sewer or stormwater environment could alter the response of the electromagnetic waves between the rfid tag and the rfid reader antenna bekkali et al 2014 loo et al 2009 pillai 2006 thus an rfid tag antenna combination should be thoroughly evaluated for its effective reading ranges i e close to a 100 successful detection probability before any deployment fig 2b illustrates a schematic of an rfid reader positioning in a utility hole if the sensor is too close to the transmitting antenna zone 1 a near field electromagnetic inference phenomenon can occur resulting in blind spots on the other hand if the tag is far away from this antenna zone 3 insufficient forward link i e backscattered signal becomes the limiting factor that prevents the rfid sensor tag communication previous studies reported that in the near field region electromagnetic coupling between reader and tag antennas occurs due to different angular and radial dependence which limits the reading ranges of tags bekkali et al 2014 nikitin et al 2007 rao et al 2005 practically to avoid the reactive near field and the radiative near field interferences radiating near field distance r should be 2 d 2 λ where d is the maximum antenna dimension and λ is the wavelength which equal to the speed of light divided by signal frequency nikitin et al 2007 for example at a resonant frequency 915 mhz a center of 902 928 mhz and 0 45 m 12 5 dbic antenna dimensions the radiating near field distance r is 1 24 m the radiation pattern varies with the change of the size of the antenna and signal frequency therefore to avoid near field interference the deployment distance between tag and rfid reader antenna should be more than 1 24 m for the 12 5 dbic antenna and 0 57 m for the 9 dbic antenna our results fig 2a indicate that for a specific combination of an antenna and a type of rfid tag deployed into the field a specific reading range should be determined as depicted in zone 2 fig 2b the reading range dictates the installation position of an antenna in a utility hole for example sanitary sewers are designed for peak flows during high infiltration inflow conditions depth of flow diameter of the pipe 0 15 0 60 m with a probability value such as the 95th percentile water new zealand 2015 the system we developed can have an effective range of 0 57 3 5 m above the wastewater surface in the utility hole when using a 9 dbic antenna this means that the designed antenna position can still have a flexible range that allows it to reach the optimal option for a particular utility hole depending on its peak flow conditions of the catchment area in conclusion the optimum design of the rfid systems for sewer applications at the base of a utility hole where wastewater flows through should be within zone 2 between near field and far field also the orientation of an rfid sensor should be horizontal with respect to the reader antenna when carried by wastewater flow through the utility hole these criteria were used to design rfid sensors that ensure their horizontal position when passing the antenna and determine the antenna setup position within utility holes for real world applications 3 3 sensory evaluation in aquatic environments in the real sewer environment we expect to see unsteady sewer flows turbulence in pipes therefore to maximize the detection probability it becomes necessary to ensure the orientation of the tag remains horizontal this implies that with a proper tag position orientation to the antenna larger reading ranges can be achieved with uniform rf wave distribution in its reading area a statistically significant difference in terms of rssi values one way anova p 0 05 between the tag 7 group mean 69 96 dbm and tag 9 group sensors mean 66 02 dbm was observed with a dry flume condition figure s7 in the rest of the tests with a range of water velocities from 0 18 m s to 0 61 m s re from 10000 to 73000 the measured rssi values and standard deviation sd ranges exhibited significant differences among the tag 7 group fig 3 a and tag 9 group table s4 s5 tags respectively these rssi value variations were due to a combination of a few parameters including distances between the tag and reader antenna the tag position in the flume water depth and effect and potential interference from surrounding environmental conditions that cannot be controlled also to simplify data analysis we assumed an even distribution of rf signals from the antenna to both group sensors with the fixed antenna 9 dbic position at 45 figure s5 on the other hand increased reflection was observed with increased flow speeds 10000 re 41000 up to 3 for tag 7 01 to 03 tags anova p 0 05 the tag 7 04 and 05 tags were not significantly different p 0 2 in fully turbulent conditions re 41000 however in the fully turbulent conditions a significant increase in the percentage of rssi values was observed up to a certain point 18 before decreasing for both tag 7 04 and tag 7 05 tags the reason for this phenomenon remains unclear nevertheless these results indicate that the sensitivity of the uhf rfid tags used in this study somehow increased due to an increase in the turbulence intensity we hypothesize that this was caused by increased randomness in the flow itself caused by bubble frequency i e air inflow from the bed surface in highly turbulent conditions we further hypothesize that these effects resulted in the high permeability of electromagnetic signals that backscattered the rf wave and its communication between the rfid antenna and tags to a certain point it is worth noting that the penetration depth of uhf rfid at 915mhz in freshwater with a conductivity value of 200 ms m is 3 75 cm and in wastewater 50 ms m is 7 4 cm benelli and pozzebo 2013 this penetration depth typically decreases with an increase in water conductivity and frequency of radio signals however our results indicated that the rssi values of the tag 7 group tags were still detectable between the range of 10 17 cm below the water surface in continuous flows 7 71 l s 18 3 ms m the higher penetration depth values in our study compared to previously reported values call for further investigation arnaud et al 2015 cassel et al 2017a 3 4 effective sensing ranges affected by rfid sensor tags supporting materials the reflection of the radio wave of uhf rfid sensor tags tag 7 01 to 05 and tag 9 01 to 05 decreased when the water depth increased in the flume table s4 s5 due to the attenuation of electromagnetic waves across the water air interface the increasing water air interface between the antenna and the tag leads to impedance mismatches between the ic chip and antenna so the rfid tag averts the radar cross section resulting in diminished reflection arnaud et al 2015 benelli and pozzebo 2013 jun et al 2016 as demonstrated above the uhf rfid tag signals cannot be detected if their presence is more than 17 cm underwater therefore we needed a reliable mechanism to keep the tags floating if they are to be used in an aquatic environment e g in sanitary sewer systems several materials including wood surface the insulated paper substrate ips and polylactic acid pla plastic substrate were tested to provide buoyancy to the tags as depicted in fig 3b the maximum reading ranges of tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 on the water surface varied when attached to different materials for tag 7 and tag 8 the reliable detection limits on the wood substrate were 1 80 0 10 m and 1 30 0 06 m respectively whereas tag 9 was still detected at more than 3 50 0 02 m anova p 0 05 comparatively an increase was observed in the detection ranges when the tags were placed on the pla substrate in this case the tag absolute percentage of detection increased by up to 87 mean 3 33 m tag 7 and 114 mean 2 78 m tag 8 compared to detection ranges on the plane wood anova p 0 05 the performance of tag 9 detection heights across all cases was recorded at more than 3 50 m and exhibited enhancement in sensing performance to that of other sensor tags these variations in detection heights can be related to attenuation of signal intensity to the water air interface caused by tag antenna reactance and its chip impedance on the saturation of the wooden plank surface cassel et al 2017a che et al 2010 when tags were attached to different substrates a change in impedance state modulates causing a signal backscatter was believed to result in variations in the reading range additionally these variations may have caused a low loss in signal strengths on supporting materials e g pla substrate this indicates that pla can be used to design carriers to alter the buoyancy of rfid tags to ensure that they can float on the surface of the wastewater to summarize the results up to this point it is clear that using uhf rfid based sensors for applications in an aquatic environment is possible as long as two simple criteria can be fulfilled 1 sensor tags remain floating on the water surface and 2 sensors remain in a horizontal position to achieve larger reading ranges based on our results we designed the pla sensor tag encapsulations to ensure that encapsulated sensors meet the mentioned criteria one remaining question is whether these rfid based sensors can be detected under high flow rates particularly when a number of them passing underneath an antenna at the same time in the city of auckland sewer and stormwater systems are designed for peak wastewater flow of 7 5 10 l s and peak wet weather flow of 60 80 l s water new zealand 2015 to evaluate the effectiveness of our sensors in field scenarios these pla encapsulated uhf rfid based sensors were tested to understand the sensitivity and robustness at flow rates up to 71 l s flow velocity 0 18 0 61 m s in the flume fig 3c illustrates the responses of pla encapsulated tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 our results explicated that as the inflow turbulence intensity increased a lower sensitivity in sensor responses was found within the water air interface between reader antenna and tag communication measured at upstream of the flume with antenna 1 and downstream with antenna 2 a loss in rfid tag signals were observed with flow rates at 71 l s up to 9 and 12 n 66 respectively anova p 0 05 with the varying turbulence in a flume a few sensors exhibited sensitivity to water caused by the absence of rf waves communication with the antenna however sensor tags with pla encapsulations achieved a good level of signal responses which can be considered effective for the intended monitoring applications it is also suggested that for a single point application multiple sensors can be used to maximize the detection rates in networks 3 5 field test of the rfid based sensor system in sanitary and stormwater pipes for one field trial catchment we selected a segment of the gravity sewer with a diameter of 100 mm and a length ranging from 118 177 m of each household on the network fig 4 a out of the initial 101 uhf rfid based sensors three sensors per property except for one property flushed into sanitary sewer pipes 95 of them were detected and registered by our rfid sensing system deployed in the field fig 4b c e and figure s9 six sensors were missing which were subsequently attributed to two properties designated as property a property b we flushed another batch of three sensors per property down to the sanitary sewer the three sensors from property a were detected from the stormwater utility hole that is collecting stormwater from the catchment two more sensors were flushed again from the same property and detected again from the stormwater utility hole these results confirmed an illicit connection from this particular property on the other hand the other three sensors flushed from property b were still missing this indicated a potential severe blockage of the sewer lateral which shall be confirmed using cctv visual inspection out of the scope of the current study based on the in and out time stamps of each tag recorded by the detector the surface flow velocity and hydraulic retention time hrt of water in the sewer were determined which was varied from 0 28 0 97 m s and 3 7 min within the catchment respectively the rfid sensing mechanism provides a more accurate approach for assessing the in sewer conditions by computation of real time hrt and flow velocities which are useful for sewer system design in realistic conditions 3 6 rfid system cost analysis for field applications several conventional technologies on the market have been used to identify illicit connections and sewer blockages including utility hole visual inspection smoke testing dye testing cctv inspection infra red ir camera and the distributed temperature sensing dts method tables s6 7 although each technology has its niche market in identifying an illicit connection or blockage a suite of these technologies needs to be used in concert to locate these issues accurately whereas the uhf rfid based sensors can be used independently to pinpoint an illicit connection more efficiently as depicted in fig 5 for example comparing to conducting a survey on each individual property using dye testing or smoke testing multiple sensors can be flushed from many households within a community simultaneously these sensors can still be detected by the antenna downstream because the antenna can pick up around 500 tags simultaneously therefore using high throughput sensors can greatly reduce the time and labor cost if a large community needs to be surveyed moreover the running cost and accuracy of conventional technologies can vary significantly we estimated that the average cost including labor equipment consumables of using uhf rfid based sensors in the field trials is 21 per property the costs associated with the uhf rfid method is roughly a few times to an order of magnitude lower than the costs of using other sewer network survey methods i e dye testing or cctv inspection see tables s6 s7 in the supporting information for more details besides the rfid survey cost could be further reduced by up to 50 if the households could flush three sensors through their toilets directly by themselves also monitoring with rfid systems may require minimum traffic management because the only interruption time would be to install an rfid antenna in a utility hole for data collection a well trained technician can complete the installation within 30 minutes this can greatly reduce traffic control costs and congestion issues associated with methods like cctv inspection or dye testing where a utility hole must remain open all the time 4 conclusions in this study passive uhf rfid based sensors were designed to detect sewer blockage and illicit connections in networks for this purpose the detection ranges of 12 uhf rfid sensor tags were assessed with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 were selected for further study based on their low cost small sizes and satisfactory maximum reading distances at 6 5 m 6 6 m and 7 9 m respectively the experimental results also showed that the uhf rfid tags were sensitive to their relative positions to an rfid reader antenna and when exposed to water thus in house designed uhf rfid sensors encapsulated in 3d printed pla shells were evaluated using a suite of laboratory and field tests overall we selected the 9 dbic antenna to pair with the uhf rfid sensors for the field trials due to suitable dimensions and easy installation in utility holes with the 9 dbic antenna optimal detection ranges of 0 57 3 5 m were determined for tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 and successfully used in the field trials the sensors also achieved a good level of signal responses despite the varying flow conditions and solid wastes e g toilet paper in domestic wastewater the costs associated with the uhf rfid method would be roughly 21 and show 100 accuracy compared to the current practices overall the uhf rfid based sensors that we designed can deliver a high throughput robust and non invasive method to survey sewer systems almost real time the design ensures that the beneficial properties of uhf rfid e g accuracy long reading distance and large bandwidth are not compromised by abnormal flow conditions and the presence of other solids such as toilet paper and organic solids in a drain line as seen during the field trials therefore this study can provide a foundation for novel applications of these passive uhf rfid based wireless sensors in real time data collection or tracking hydraulic flow rates and solid velocities in sewer networks in the future we will use the uhf rfid sensors to measure the surface velocity of stormwater and wastewater in pipes and use the information to predict blockage and infiltration inflow events moreover the high throughput property of the sensors can allow us to efficiently re map existing networks that are dated the information can be used to correct geographic information system databases combined with the surface velocity data we can calibrate and re calculate current hydraulic models widely used in stormwater management practice or more precisely predict solid residential times in wastewater networks we can also predict the lead time for wastewater treatment facilities or local authorities more precisely if any toxic chemical spills or accidental discharges occur supplementary materials detailed information about experimental methods

2013 murali et al 2019 semadeni davies et al 2008 furthermore the widespread application of sustainable practices i e water conservation practices have resulted in decreased wastewater inflows and increased solid concentrations which have severely altered biochemical processes occurring in sewer networks butler 2018 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 marleni et al 2012 murali et al 2019 for example the increasing quantities of fat oil and grease discharged into the sewer systems can trap and accumulate sediments on sewer beds and eventually lead to fatberg formations butler 2018 ugarelli et al 2009 causing frequent blockages corrosion and odor problems in sewer pipes gosset et al 2016 gross et al 2017 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 blockages can lead to sewer overflows which would release raw sewage containing a range of contaminants in particulate and soluble forms to both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems rodríguez et al 2012 ten veldhuis et al 2010 to avoid sewer blockages and deteriorations sewer conditions should be frequently accessed currently there are a few technologies on the market including visual inspections using closed circuit television utility hole inspection camera dye testing smoke testing and acoustic technologies that are suitable for their respective niche applications panasiuk et al 2015 plihal et al 2014 however these technologies are low throughput time consuming labor intensive or lacking real time monitoring capabilities the need for high throughput robust cost effective sewer monitoring is mounting in many other fields battery free wireless sensing technologies have received increasing interest due to their unobtrusive nature energy efficient operation and minimal sensor costs edmondson et al 2018 potyrailo et al 2012 tanguy et al 2015 however such sensing technologies are still rare in the field of sewer monitoring and assessment radiofrequency identification rfid technology especially ultra high frequency uhf rfid 865 928 mhz has been widely applied in many industries and large scale internet of things iot applications due to its simple architecture real time sensing capability and versatile detection ranges arnaud et al 2015 cassel et al 2017b colin et al 2019 jun et al 2016 sun et al 2013 tanguy et al 2015 compared to battery operated sensor tags known as active tags passive rfid tags are much more popular because of their battery free nature longer life span small size and low cost jun et al 2016 however the application of rfid based sensors in environmental engineering particularly in water environments is still scarce because radio wave transmissions are extremely sensitive to air and water conductivity among a number of other essential factors benelli et al 2011 benelli and pozzebo 2013 bertoni et al 2010 chapuis et al 2014 tatiparthi et al 2020 for example studies have reported that a change in rfid tag orientation from horizontal to vertical resulted in a 26 76 reduction in tag detection ranges papangelakis et al 2019 tsakiris et al 2015 although possessing superb reading ranges uhf rfid is even more sensitive to water creating a challenge to apply this technology for sanitary or stormwater network monitoring this study aims to design and evaluate passive uhf rfid based sensors for sewer blockage and illicit connection monitoring applications we first investigated the performance of a suite of uhf rfid tags to determine their optimum reading ranges related to tag antenna interplay then we tested the tags in a laboratory hydraulic flume to determine the effect of water flow conditions on the received signal strength indication rssi values finally the rfid systems were field tested in both sanitary and stormwater networks through this study we demonstrated that low cost high throughput and non invasive approaches for monitoring buried utility service infrastructures are achievable the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present essential materials and methods of our experiments including identifying factors affecting rfid tags and reader antenna communications determining effective reading zones of the selected uhf rfid sensors and evaluating the performance of the uhf rfid sensors in field trials in section 3 we present and discuss experimental results focusing on the reading ranges field trial discoveries and cost analysis of the uhf rfid based sewer survey system finally in section 4 we drew conclusions from the work and propose future research directions 2 materials and methods in section 2 1 the rfid equipment used in our study is summarized in section 2 2 the determination of effective reading zones is presented finally in section 2 3 the evaluation method of uhf rfid based sensors in aquatic environments and field trial procedures are described additional experimental materials and methods used in this study are provided in the supporting information 2 1 rfid equipment the rfid equipment used in this study were obtained from two suppliers the first reader designated as m6e supporting information figure s1 a was a four channel thingmagic mercury 6e uhf rfid reader jadak usa the frequency range of the reader antenna was 865 928 mhz two antennae typologies from the mti wireless edge ltd usa were connected to the m6e reader i 9 dbic circular polarization antenna figure s1 b ii 12 5 dbi linear polarization antenna figure s1 c the second rfid reader shenzhen ruifan electronics china designated as szrf contained an inbuilt 8 dbic circular polarization antenna figure s1 d within the reader and an interface connected through a computer to rs232 serial communication additional details of the rfid equipment are presented in the supporting information section s1 1 2 2 determination of effective reading zones of uhf rfid sensor tags twelve types of uhf rfid sensor tags were tested for additional details of these tags see table s1 and section s1 2 in the supporting information with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae for the identification of the maximum reading distances z d five randomly selected sensor tags out of 20 from each type were measured at least ten times with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae respectively initially each tag was placed in the center of each antenna defined as x0 y0 then z d was measured by moving the tag away from the antenna center slowly supporting information figure s2 finally tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 were selected for further evaluation based on their better z d ranges and smaller physical sizes that are appropriate for sewer applications because the vertical and horizontal orientations of rfid tags can significantly affect their actual reading ranges creating a three dimensional space the detecting ranges of the selected tags were tested by rotating them from α 0 designated as the horizontal position h and α 90 designated as the vertical position v relative to the antenna plane xi yi zi also see in section s1 3 in the supporting information each of the selected tags was measured at least ten times with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae at 12 positions every 30 increment with respect to the antenna in the horizontal and vertical axes figure s3 2 3 evaluation of uhf rfid based sensors in aquatic environments testing in a controlled aquatic environment was conducted in a 19 m long 0 45 m wide and 0 5 m deep flume with a slope of 1 50 m m in the fluid mechanics laboratory at the university of auckland the detailed experimental setups of the reader antenna are provided in the supporting information section s1 4 s1 5 and figure s4 a series of tests were designed to assess the propagation of rf waves and their detection limits at changing flow rates 7 71 l s under turbulent flow conditions reynolds number re 10000 73000 in general ten of tag 7 and ten of tag 9 were fixed on a wooden board with a 5 cm interval figure s4 s6 and the signal strengths of both sensors under various flow rates and water depths below and above water levels were measured the tag 7 group and tag 9 group sensors were designated as tag 7 01 to 10 and tag 9 01 to 10 respectively based on their relative positions from the bottom to the top on the wooden board in the flume the identification number of each tag and its received signal strength indication rssi were continuously measured and recorded using ura universal reading assistance software at each run total 12 runs the tag signals were recorded for at least five minutes to attain several values of rssi in different water depths table s2 the rssi values in dbm and their descriptive data statistics were processed using origin lab software version 9 7 originlab corporation usa throughout each run three replicates of experiments were recorded in each test run table s2 and flow conditions were set identically in all the 12 runs finally two field trials were conducted in two catchment areas in the city of auckland new zealand to evaluate the performance of the designed rfid sensors in a segment of sanitary sewer and stormwater pipes the total material costs for fabricating uhf rfid based sensors and other equipment costs for the field trials are summarized in table 1 in each segment of the trial catchment one utility hole was opened for the temporary installation of the rfid system the rfid reader with two antennae 9 dbic was positioned according to the effective reading range design shown in fig 2 in two utility holes at a time during the field trials in all utility holes antennae were adjusted to be within the effective reading distance d f between 0 57 3 5 m which is based on the depth and actual water surface of the utility hole in one catchment rfid antennae were temporarily installed just below the rim level of a stormwater utility hole 2 m depth and a sanitary utility hole 2 5 m depth because their depths fall within the effective reading distance d f in another catchment an rfid antenna was temporarily installed deep inside a sanitary utility hole 6 m depth using a scaffold modified from a heavy duty tripod however in this particular catchment rfid antenna installation in the stormwater utility hole was not permitted by the on site manager due to accessibility and safety issues all antenna installations in this study were temporary because no permanent scaffold or modifications to the interior of the utility holes were allowed by the authority during our field trials afterward we flushed polylactic acid pla encapsulated tag 7 and tag 9 uhf rfid based sensors n 109 through a total of 39 household properties via their wastewater gully traps the sensors were released during low domestic sewage inflows in each catchment between 10 am and 4 pm and its percentage of detection rates were evaluated in downstream utility holes 3 results and discussion this section covers the key discoveries and evaluates the performance of the proposed rfid systems and uhf rfid sensors first in section 3 1 we present the performance and material cost of various uhf rfid tags then in section 3 2 we present effective reading ranges of uhf rfid tags relative to the orientation and specific antenna plane the experimental results on the uhf rfid performance at the water air interface are presented and discussed in section 3 3 in section 3 4 the effective reading ranges of tags on various supporting materials are discussed finally the field test results and a cost analysis of the rfid system are described in section 3 5 and section 3 6 respectively additional results and discussion can be found in the supporting information 3 1 determination of maximum reading distances of uhf rfid sensor tags the reading range i e backscattering sequence between the center of an rfid reader antenna and an rfid sensor tag is based on a number of factors and could be influenced by different environmental surroundings koo et al 2011 lee et al 2015 rao et al 2005 these factors include the tag response threshold orientation impedance matching between the tag dipole antenna and its integrated circuit ic chip therefore we tested 12 different types of uhf rfid sensor tags in order to identify their sensing ranges with different reader antenna combinations it can be clearly seen from fig 1 that sensor tags exhibited a broad spectrum of reading ranges anova p 0 05 when detected with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae respectively the sensing performance of all the measured sensor tags revealed that some types of tags have consistently longer reading ranges e g up to 8 m while others achieved no more than 4 m e g tags 1 5 due to the reflected signal morphology of a combination of amplitude and phase of sensor tags that changed the detection ranges however reading distances were considerably higher for all tags with the 12 5 dbi antenna than with the 9 dbic and 8 dbic antennae compared to other tags the highest mean reading ranges were achieved with tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 at 6 51 m 6 61 m and 7 95 m respectively as a result tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 were chosen for further study because of their low cost about usd 3 to 6 dollars per tag small sizes and satisfactory maximum reading distances fig 1 3 2 effective reading zones affected by rfid tags orientations and positions to an antenna the reading ranges of the rfid tags have been shown to depend heavily on the orientation of the tag relative to the antenna plane as reported in pebble tracking in rivers arnaud et al 2015 chapuis et al 2014 papangelakis et al 2019 food industry warehouses and logistics applications allan et al 2013 alyahya et al 2016 barge et al 2019 lim et al 2013 therefore the orientation effect of the tags used in this study must be known for better sensor design before deploying these sensors for field applications specific detection responses and sensitivity of the three rfid sensors tags 7 8 and 9 were determined for their respective horizontal and vertical orientations figure s3 as shown in fig 2 a a f sensing ranges were better with the 12 5 dbi antenna gain as compared to the 8 dbic or the 9 dbic antennae except for tag 8 which responded better to the 9 dbic antenna the highest reading ranges of the tags were achieved at approximately 120 and or 275 degrees overall when the tags were positioned along the bottom edge of an antenna the maximum reading distances decreased presumably due to the change in the signals reflection range this highlights that the orientation and the relative position of a tag to the antenna are crucial variables when assessing the detection limits in an application chapuis et al 2014 from fig 2a we noticed that as tags moved away from the bottom edge of the antenna a sharp reduction in reading detections was observed as a result of the change in tag orientation the sensitivity of the tags reduced and fell below the z d shown in fig 1 for example for tag 9 with a 12 5 dbic at the center antenna z d was 8 m while at the edge of the antenna this range drastically reduced to 3 5 m with α 0 and to 0 20 m with α 90 in practice the effective reading distance d f is the key performance index in determining the position of the rfid reader antenna and the method of deployment i e deep shaft v s shallow shaft sewer and stormwater utility holes it can also be deduced from the literature that space confinement effective depth water flowrate flow turbulence and other geometric parameters of a sewer or stormwater environment could alter the response of the electromagnetic waves between the rfid tag and the rfid reader antenna bekkali et al 2014 loo et al 2009 pillai 2006 thus an rfid tag antenna combination should be thoroughly evaluated for its effective reading ranges i e close to a 100 successful detection probability before any deployment fig 2b illustrates a schematic of an rfid reader positioning in a utility hole if the sensor is too close to the transmitting antenna zone 1 a near field electromagnetic inference phenomenon can occur resulting in blind spots on the other hand if the tag is far away from this antenna zone 3 insufficient forward link i e backscattered signal becomes the limiting factor that prevents the rfid sensor tag communication previous studies reported that in the near field region electromagnetic coupling between reader and tag antennas occurs due to different angular and radial dependence which limits the reading ranges of tags bekkali et al 2014 nikitin et al 2007 rao et al 2005 practically to avoid the reactive near field and the radiative near field interferences radiating near field distance r should be 2 d 2 λ where d is the maximum antenna dimension and λ is the wavelength which equal to the speed of light divided by signal frequency nikitin et al 2007 for example at a resonant frequency 915 mhz a center of 902 928 mhz and 0 45 m 12 5 dbic antenna dimensions the radiating near field distance r is 1 24 m the radiation pattern varies with the change of the size of the antenna and signal frequency therefore to avoid near field interference the deployment distance between tag and rfid reader antenna should be more than 1 24 m for the 12 5 dbic antenna and 0 57 m for the 9 dbic antenna our results fig 2a indicate that for a specific combination of an antenna and a type of rfid tag deployed into the field a specific reading range should be determined as depicted in zone 2 fig 2b the reading range dictates the installation position of an antenna in a utility hole for example sanitary sewers are designed for peak flows during high infiltration inflow conditions depth of flow diameter of the pipe 0 15 0 60 m with a probability value such as the 95th percentile water new zealand 2015 the system we developed can have an effective range of 0 57 3 5 m above the wastewater surface in the utility hole when using a 9 dbic antenna this means that the designed antenna position can still have a flexible range that allows it to reach the optimal option for a particular utility hole depending on its peak flow conditions of the catchment area in conclusion the optimum design of the rfid systems for sewer applications at the base of a utility hole where wastewater flows through should be within zone 2 between near field and far field also the orientation of an rfid sensor should be horizontal with respect to the reader antenna when carried by wastewater flow through the utility hole these criteria were used to design rfid sensors that ensure their horizontal position when passing the antenna and determine the antenna setup position within utility holes for real world applications 3 3 sensory evaluation in aquatic environments in the real sewer environment we expect to see unsteady sewer flows turbulence in pipes therefore to maximize the detection probability it becomes necessary to ensure the orientation of the tag remains horizontal this implies that with a proper tag position orientation to the antenna larger reading ranges can be achieved with uniform rf wave distribution in its reading area a statistically significant difference in terms of rssi values one way anova p 0 05 between the tag 7 group mean 69 96 dbm and tag 9 group sensors mean 66 02 dbm was observed with a dry flume condition figure s7 in the rest of the tests with a range of water velocities from 0 18 m s to 0 61 m s re from 10000 to 73000 the measured rssi values and standard deviation sd ranges exhibited significant differences among the tag 7 group fig 3 a and tag 9 group table s4 s5 tags respectively these rssi value variations were due to a combination of a few parameters including distances between the tag and reader antenna the tag position in the flume water depth and effect and potential interference from surrounding environmental conditions that cannot be controlled also to simplify data analysis we assumed an even distribution of rf signals from the antenna to both group sensors with the fixed antenna 9 dbic position at 45 figure s5 on the other hand increased reflection was observed with increased flow speeds 10000 re 41000 up to 3 for tag 7 01 to 03 tags anova p 0 05 the tag 7 04 and 05 tags were not significantly different p 0 2 in fully turbulent conditions re 41000 however in the fully turbulent conditions a significant increase in the percentage of rssi values was observed up to a certain point 18 before decreasing for both tag 7 04 and tag 7 05 tags the reason for this phenomenon remains unclear nevertheless these results indicate that the sensitivity of the uhf rfid tags used in this study somehow increased due to an increase in the turbulence intensity we hypothesize that this was caused by increased randomness in the flow itself caused by bubble frequency i e air inflow from the bed surface in highly turbulent conditions we further hypothesize that these effects resulted in the high permeability of electromagnetic signals that backscattered the rf wave and its communication between the rfid antenna and tags to a certain point it is worth noting that the penetration depth of uhf rfid at 915mhz in freshwater with a conductivity value of 200 ms m is 3 75 cm and in wastewater 50 ms m is 7 4 cm benelli and pozzebo 2013 this penetration depth typically decreases with an increase in water conductivity and frequency of radio signals however our results indicated that the rssi values of the tag 7 group tags were still detectable between the range of 10 17 cm below the water surface in continuous flows 7 71 l s 18 3 ms m the higher penetration depth values in our study compared to previously reported values call for further investigation arnaud et al 2015 cassel et al 2017a 3 4 effective sensing ranges affected by rfid sensor tags supporting materials the reflection of the radio wave of uhf rfid sensor tags tag 7 01 to 05 and tag 9 01 to 05 decreased when the water depth increased in the flume table s4 s5 due to the attenuation of electromagnetic waves across the water air interface the increasing water air interface between the antenna and the tag leads to impedance mismatches between the ic chip and antenna so the rfid tag averts the radar cross section resulting in diminished reflection arnaud et al 2015 benelli and pozzebo 2013 jun et al 2016 as demonstrated above the uhf rfid tag signals cannot be detected if their presence is more than 17 cm underwater therefore we needed a reliable mechanism to keep the tags floating if they are to be used in an aquatic environment e g in sanitary sewer systems several materials including wood surface the insulated paper substrate ips and polylactic acid pla plastic substrate were tested to provide buoyancy to the tags as depicted in fig 3b the maximum reading ranges of tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 on the water surface varied when attached to different materials for tag 7 and tag 8 the reliable detection limits on the wood substrate were 1 80 0 10 m and 1 30 0 06 m respectively whereas tag 9 was still detected at more than 3 50 0 02 m anova p 0 05 comparatively an increase was observed in the detection ranges when the tags were placed on the pla substrate in this case the tag absolute percentage of detection increased by up to 87 mean 3 33 m tag 7 and 114 mean 2 78 m tag 8 compared to detection ranges on the plane wood anova p 0 05 the performance of tag 9 detection heights across all cases was recorded at more than 3 50 m and exhibited enhancement in sensing performance to that of other sensor tags these variations in detection heights can be related to attenuation of signal intensity to the water air interface caused by tag antenna reactance and its chip impedance on the saturation of the wooden plank surface cassel et al 2017a che et al 2010 when tags were attached to different substrates a change in impedance state modulates causing a signal backscatter was believed to result in variations in the reading range additionally these variations may have caused a low loss in signal strengths on supporting materials e g pla substrate this indicates that pla can be used to design carriers to alter the buoyancy of rfid tags to ensure that they can float on the surface of the wastewater to summarize the results up to this point it is clear that using uhf rfid based sensors for applications in an aquatic environment is possible as long as two simple criteria can be fulfilled 1 sensor tags remain floating on the water surface and 2 sensors remain in a horizontal position to achieve larger reading ranges based on our results we designed the pla sensor tag encapsulations to ensure that encapsulated sensors meet the mentioned criteria one remaining question is whether these rfid based sensors can be detected under high flow rates particularly when a number of them passing underneath an antenna at the same time in the city of auckland sewer and stormwater systems are designed for peak wastewater flow of 7 5 10 l s and peak wet weather flow of 60 80 l s water new zealand 2015 to evaluate the effectiveness of our sensors in field scenarios these pla encapsulated uhf rfid based sensors were tested to understand the sensitivity and robustness at flow rates up to 71 l s flow velocity 0 18 0 61 m s in the flume fig 3c illustrates the responses of pla encapsulated tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 our results explicated that as the inflow turbulence intensity increased a lower sensitivity in sensor responses was found within the water air interface between reader antenna and tag communication measured at upstream of the flume with antenna 1 and downstream with antenna 2 a loss in rfid tag signals were observed with flow rates at 71 l s up to 9 and 12 n 66 respectively anova p 0 05 with the varying turbulence in a flume a few sensors exhibited sensitivity to water caused by the absence of rf waves communication with the antenna however sensor tags with pla encapsulations achieved a good level of signal responses which can be considered effective for the intended monitoring applications it is also suggested that for a single point application multiple sensors can be used to maximize the detection rates in networks 3 5 field test of the rfid based sensor system in sanitary and stormwater pipes for one field trial catchment we selected a segment of the gravity sewer with a diameter of 100 mm and a length ranging from 118 177 m of each household on the network fig 4 a out of the initial 101 uhf rfid based sensors three sensors per property except for one property flushed into sanitary sewer pipes 95 of them were detected and registered by our rfid sensing system deployed in the field fig 4b c e and figure s9 six sensors were missing which were subsequently attributed to two properties designated as property a property b we flushed another batch of three sensors per property down to the sanitary sewer the three sensors from property a were detected from the stormwater utility hole that is collecting stormwater from the catchment two more sensors were flushed again from the same property and detected again from the stormwater utility hole these results confirmed an illicit connection from this particular property on the other hand the other three sensors flushed from property b were still missing this indicated a potential severe blockage of the sewer lateral which shall be confirmed using cctv visual inspection out of the scope of the current study based on the in and out time stamps of each tag recorded by the detector the surface flow velocity and hydraulic retention time hrt of water in the sewer were determined which was varied from 0 28 0 97 m s and 3 7 min within the catchment respectively the rfid sensing mechanism provides a more accurate approach for assessing the in sewer conditions by computation of real time hrt and flow velocities which are useful for sewer system design in realistic conditions 3 6 rfid system cost analysis for field applications several conventional technologies on the market have been used to identify illicit connections and sewer blockages including utility hole visual inspection smoke testing dye testing cctv inspection infra red ir camera and the distributed temperature sensing dts method tables s6 7 although each technology has its niche market in identifying an illicit connection or blockage a suite of these technologies needs to be used in concert to locate these issues accurately whereas the uhf rfid based sensors can be used independently to pinpoint an illicit connection more efficiently as depicted in fig 5 for example comparing to conducting a survey on each individual property using dye testing or smoke testing multiple sensors can be flushed from many households within a community simultaneously these sensors can still be detected by the antenna downstream because the antenna can pick up around 500 tags simultaneously therefore using high throughput sensors can greatly reduce the time and labor cost if a large community needs to be surveyed moreover the running cost and accuracy of conventional technologies can vary significantly we estimated that the average cost including labor equipment consumables of using uhf rfid based sensors in the field trials is 21 per property the costs associated with the uhf rfid method is roughly a few times to an order of magnitude lower than the costs of using other sewer network survey methods i e dye testing or cctv inspection see tables s6 s7 in the supporting information for more details besides the rfid survey cost could be further reduced by up to 50 if the households could flush three sensors through their toilets directly by themselves also monitoring with rfid systems may require minimum traffic management because the only interruption time would be to install an rfid antenna in a utility hole for data collection a well trained technician can complete the installation within 30 minutes this can greatly reduce traffic control costs and congestion issues associated with methods like cctv inspection or dye testing where a utility hole must remain open all the time 4 conclusions in this study passive uhf rfid based sensors were designed to detect sewer blockage and illicit connections in networks for this purpose the detection ranges of 12 uhf rfid sensor tags were assessed with the 8 dbic 9 dbic and 12 5 dbi antennae tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 were selected for further study based on their low cost small sizes and satisfactory maximum reading distances at 6 5 m 6 6 m and 7 9 m respectively the experimental results also showed that the uhf rfid tags were sensitive to their relative positions to an rfid reader antenna and when exposed to water thus in house designed uhf rfid sensors encapsulated in 3d printed pla shells were evaluated using a suite of laboratory and field tests overall we selected the 9 dbic antenna to pair with the uhf rfid sensors for the field trials due to suitable dimensions and easy installation in utility holes with the 9 dbic antenna optimal detection ranges of 0 57 3 5 m were determined for tag 7 tag 8 and tag 9 and successfully used in the field trials the sensors also achieved a good level of signal responses despite the varying flow conditions and solid wastes e g toilet paper in domestic wastewater the costs associated with the uhf rfid method would be roughly 21 and show 100 accuracy compared to the current practices overall the uhf rfid based sensors that we designed can deliver a high throughput robust and non invasive method to survey sewer systems almost real time the design ensures that the beneficial properties of uhf rfid e g accuracy long reading distance and large bandwidth are not compromised by abnormal flow conditions and the presence of other solids such as toilet paper and organic solids in a drain line as seen during the field trials therefore this study can provide a foundation for novel applications of these passive uhf rfid based wireless sensors in real time data collection or tracking hydraulic flow rates and solid velocities in sewer networks in the future we will use the uhf rfid sensors to measure the surface velocity of stormwater and wastewater in pipes and use the information to predict blockage and infiltration inflow events moreover the high throughput property of the sensors can allow us to efficiently re map existing networks that are dated the information can be used to correct geographic information system databases combined with the surface velocity data we can calibrate and re calculate current hydraulic models widely used in stormwater management practice or more precisely predict solid residential times in wastewater networks we can also predict the lead time for wastewater treatment facilities or local authorities more precisely if any toxic chemical spills or accidental discharges occur supplementary materials detailed information about experimental methods

16991,optical sensors for fluorescence of chlorophyll a f chl a and phycocyanin f pc are increasingly used as a proxy for biomass of algae and cyanobacteria respectively they provide measurements at high frequency and modest cost these sensors require site specific calibration due to a range of interferences light intensity affects the fluorescence yield of cyanobacteria and algae through light harvesting regulation mechanisms but is often neglected as a potential source of error for in situ f chl a and f pc measurements we hypothesised that diel light variations would induce significant f chl a and f pc suppression when compared to dark periods we tested this hypothesis in a controlled experiment using three commercial fluorescence probes which continuously measured f chl a and f pc from a culture of the cyanobacterium dolichospermum variabilis as well as f chl a from a culture of the green alga ankistrodesmus gracilis in a simulated natural light regime under light all devices showed a significant p 0 01 suppression of f chl a and f pc compared to measurements in the dark f chl a decreased by up to 79 and f pc by up to 59 at maximum irradiance compared to dark adapted periods suppression levels were higher during the second phase of the diel cycle declining light indicating that quenching is dependent on previous light exposure diel variations in light intensity must be considered as a significant source of bias for fluorescence probes used for algal monitoring this is of high relevance as most monitoring activities take place during daytime and hence f chl a and f pc are likely to be systematically underestimated under bright conditions compensation models design modifications to fluorometers and sampling design are discussed as suitable alternatives to overcome light induced fluorescence quenching graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacteria real time monitoring fluorescence non photochemical quenching water resources

indicator of trophic state and ecosystem health changes in phytoplankton community composition and biomass are associated with eutrophication and can potentially result in harmful algal blooms habs often dominated by cyanobacteria heisler et al 2008 hab mitigation measures should be supported by proactive and continuous monitoring because cyanobacteria populations are spatially and temporally dynamic multiple methods can be used to estimate phytoplankton populations traditional methods include species enumeration using microscopy or estimates of chlorophyll a with solvent extraction of pigments millie et al 2010a which tend to be labor cost and time intensive continuous and high frequency monitoring is beneficial to advance our understanding of phytoplankton dynamics dubelaar et al 2004 through early and rapid detection of habs as well as by providing data to improve performance of predictive and forecasting models of habs rousso et al 2020 these factors have prompted a rapid increase in emerging technologies that provide high frequency monitoring of phytoplankton populations in an affordable and reliable manner after proper calibration recent advances in monitoring

organization of algae in colonies korak et al 2015 interference by turbid colored or organic rich waters bowling et al 2013 millie et al 2010b overlap of similar pigment fluorescence emission frequencies e g f chl a and f pc zamyadi et al 2016 water temperature hodges et al 2018 and variations in pigment content with growth stage chang et al 2012 ziegmann et al 2010 nutrient and light availability beutler et al 2003 erickson et al 2012 regular site specific calibration is therefore recognised as a critical part of field deployments using this technology zamyadi et al 2012 however sources of bias related to light induced fluorescence quenching are often ignored even though its occurrence has been extensively documented e g falkowski and woodhead 2013 fluorescence generally originates from a small proportion of the absorbed light by algae and cyanobacteria ibelings et al 1994 and is affected by variations in the light regime and photochemical processes i e photosynthesis including ability to dissipate excess energy as heat thus light harvesting regulation mechanisms in algae and cyanobacteria may affect the fluorescence yield and consequently f chl a and f pc estimates phytoplankton can optimize light harvesting during periods of low light exposure by increasing the proportion of energy directed through photochemical pathways compared to emitted fluorescence resulting in a decrease in the fluorescence yield i e photochemical quenching pq müller et al 2001 in contrast during high and variable irradiance periods excess energy may cause photoinhibition of photosynthesis generally resulting in increased energy dissipation as heat through non photochemical quenching npq which also leads to fluorescence yield decrease falkowski and woodhead 2013 karapetyan 2007 krause and jahns 2004 npq is often recognized as an energy thermal regulation response that occurs during periods of high intensity or transient light but other processes besides thermal dissipation can result in npq malnoë 2018 pq and npq occur in most photosynthetic organisms from land plants to cyanobacteria even though light harvesting regulation varies among different photosynthetic groups due to differences in pigments and physiological pathways stransky and hager 1970 the implications of light induced fluorescence quenching for real time algal and cyanobacteria sensor measurements have often been ignored or suspect values discarded partly due to a lack of appropriate methodologies to compensate for fluorescence quenching roesler et al 2017 leach et al 2018 with the increasing use of fluorescence probes for continuous monitoring or rapid discrete readings or profiles at multiple sites taken mostly during daytime a quantitative assessment of fluorescence reduction due to light variability would be valuable to address the limited literature on light variability as a potential source of error on f chl a and f pc we designed an experiment to assess the impact of diel light variability on measurements from widely employed fluorescence sensors for phytoplankton monitoring we hypothesised that diurnal light cycle variation could significantly affect fluorescence based estimates resulting in underestimation of these measurements during periods with higher light intensity we quantified the impact of light exposure on f chl a and f pc during simulated diel light cycles under controlled conditions three commercial fluorescence probes were assessed in order to rule out whether the light induced effects on fluorescence yield may differ among different sensors designs moreover we used two different algal cultures the cyanobacterium dolichospermum variabilis a genus widely distributed globally that has been known to produce anatoxins li et al 2016 and the chlorophyte ankistrodesmus gracilis in order to quantify potential differences between different eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup the cyanobacterium dolichospermum variabilis strain atcc 29413 from the american type culture collection and the green alga ankistrodesmus gracilis strain sag 278 2 from the culture collection of algae of the university of göttingen were initially cultured in erlenmeyer flasks at room temperature in modified wc media according to guillard and lorenzen 1972 one week before the experiments started the cultures were transferred to individual mesocosms length 56 cm width 78 cm depth 41 cm 150 l tank volume to begin mass culture see 2 1 2 mesocosms were placed in a climate chamber adjusted to maintain water temperature around 18 c the mesocosms were continuously mixed with a stirrer d variabilis culture and an aerator a gracilis culture constant gentle mixing and regulation to a constant temperature were employed in both mesocosms to exclude the possibility of stratification and interferences induced by gradients of temperature stratification and vertical movement of the cyanobacterium and green alga mesocosms were subjected to multiple light treatments see 2 1 2 trials were run for five days or until the culture in the mesocosm collapsed i e no

probes were placed at 15 cm below the water surface and measured f chl a for the a gracilis tank and f pc for the d variabilis tank at sampling intervals ranging from 5 s to 10 min exo2 aqt 500 and

to simulate a diel pattern of 12 h of daylight from darkness 12 h light intensity was progressively increased at 30 min intervals for 2 h until a constant maximum light intensity for 8 h followed by progressive decrease in light for 2 h before darkness fig 1 light treatments were categorized by phase of the cycle i e before maximum exposure increasing light phase or after maximum exposure decreasing light phase four trials were conducted for the green alga a gracilis three of four trials had maximum light intensity of 354 μmol m 2 s 1 and one trial had maximum light intensity of 665 μmol m 2 s 1 dilution was undertaken in a gracilis mesocosm in some trials to maintain similar levels of algal concentration throughout the experiment in contrast only 2 trials for d variabilis mesocosm were conducted because the culture collapsed on the third day for d variabilis trials one had maximum light intensity of 354 μmol m 2 s 1 and the other had 665 μmol m 2 s 1 trials with maximum light exposure of 665 μmol m 2 s 1 consisted of half diel cycles due to operational limitations i e pause of the experiment to setup preparation and culture dilution 2 1 3 pigment measurements based on chemical extraction and photometry chemical extraction of chl a c chl a and pc c pc for a gracilis and d variabilis respectively was performed for filtered water samples collected throughout trials fig 1b at similar depth 15 cm depth of fluorescence sensors water level in the mesocosms was constant and observations indicated that mesocosms were fully mixed vertically see 2 1 duplicate water samples were taken for both c chl a and c pc water samples were filtered through glass fiber filters whatman gf f and the filters stored in a freezer at 18 c until extraction and measurement c chl a was extracted in 90 ethanol and measured photometrically according to german laboratory standard din 38 412 din 1985 extraction of c pc from filters was done with a method adapted from horváth

remove cell debris photometric measurement at 620 nm was used for quantification based on calibration of photometric readings against a pc standard merck germany determination of c chl a was performed throughout the three trials for the green algae mesocosm determination of c pc was undertaken only during decreasing phase of the first trial and increasing phase of the second trial for the d variabilis mesocosm due to operational limitations 2 1 4 statistical analyses expected trends of normalized fluorescence based estimates for dark periods and light periods i e when there was a potential light quenching effect were calculated for each trial using local polynomial regression fitting loess function from r base package r core team 2020 the smoothed functions were assumed to mimic the theoretical population increase over the light phase as illustrated in fig 2 light induced quenching herein named normalized quenching was calculated as the absolute difference between the smoothed trends of normalized fluorescence based estimates f chl a or f pc from dark periods and light periods fig 2 and proportional quenching was calculated as the ratio between the calculated quenching i e vertical arrows length in fig 2 and the normalized estimate from dark period i e dashed black line in fig 2 direct comparison of f chl a and f pc in different stages of the diel cycle would introduce bias due to biomass changes from growth that occurred during the light period since the calculations performed to determine quenching levels require measurements taken during dark periods in the beginning and end the day and in our experiment the trials with 665 μmol m 2 s 1 consisted of half diel cycles see 2 1 2 quenching calculations were performed only for trials with maximum exposures of 354 μmol m 2 s 1 differences in f chl a and f pc between light and dark periods in the treatments were tested with welch s analysis of variance anova performed using the oneway test function from the r base package r core team 2020 if a statistical difference was observed between any of the light treatments pairwise differences between light treatments were tested with the post hoc games howell test using the oneway function from the package userfriendlyscience peters 2018 the welch s anova and games powell tests minimize type i errors fagerland 2012 and are recommended where data variances are not homogeneous and there is variable sample size between treatments which was the case for our data with different light exposure durations 3 results light induced a gradual decrease in f pc and f chl a in both the d variabilis and a gracilis mesocosms with greater suppression at higher light intensity the absolute fluorescence values varied according to the probe manufacturer indicating that calibration to other direct or proxy measures of phytoplankton or cyanobacteria biomass is required for each sensor type separately however normalized f pc and f chl a refer to equation 1 revealed similar patterns of fluorescence reduction during light exposure for all devices fig 3 and fig 4 respectively as illustrated in fig 3 the aqt 500 exhibited much higher variability for f pc than the bbe and exo2 probes but mean values showed a weaker light induced depression of f pc than the other sensors fig 5 d variabilis c pc was collected only during the second half cycle due to operational limitations as illustrated in fig 3 due to the high variability in aqt500 readings f pc measurements from this probe were not considered for quenching analysis for a gracilis f chl a all probes showed similar patterns and variability amongst devices was lower than for d variabilis f pc bbe based a gracilis f chl a appeared to be slightly higher than the exo2 and

indicative of intense growth during the light cycle supplementary material a a gracilis f chl a was systematically lower than a gracilis c chl a during periods with light table 2 d variabilis did not grow during the trials showing similar levels of f pc and c pc at the beginning and end of trials d variabilis f pc was lower than d variabilis c pc when light intensity was higher than 134 μmol m 2 s

occurred during light periods of the simulated diel light dark cycle f chl a and f pc were most reduced during maximum light intensities compared to values in the dark reductions up to 79 and 59 respectively these variations are large compared to other factors known to impact f chl a and f pc measurements such as changes in turbidity dissolved organic matter dom and species composition increased mineral turbidity was found by zamyadi et al 2012 to result in underestimation of cyanobacterial biovolume by up to 48 8 for three different commercial fluorometers and 5 cyanobacteria species increasing dom has been shown to cause underestimation in f pc and f chl a by up to 16 bertone et al 2019 mixed species cultures resulted in overestimation of f chl a and f pc by 14 and 18 when compared with estimates derived from single species calibration curves bertone et al 2019 seasonal variations in temperature variability can cause decreases in algal fluorescence with variability among measurements ranging from non significant to almost 50 according to sensor manufacturer and cell densities hodges et al 2018 many models have been suggested to compensate for the above mentioned interferences zamyadi et al 2012 mcbride rose 2018 choo et al 2019 conversely no appropriate method to compensate light induced quenching has yet been proposed for such devices even though error rates observed in our study exceed most of those derived from other interferences only a few studies have quantified light induced quenching impacts on f chl a kaylor et al 2018 showed a consistent discrepancy between f chl a estimates taken in situ in the shade versus directly under midday sun in 50 sites in grande ronde river basin oregon usa fluorescence in the shade were 5 to 113 higher than under sunlight exposures across the 50 sites the authors reported a consistent pattern of fluorescence increase with increased time in the shade after sun exposure with short recovery periods 6 to 14 min recovery duration longer than 30 min may be required only in cases where photodamage of cells has occurred maxwell and johnson 2000 kaylor et al 2018 also compared in situ f chl a and chemically extracted chl a similarly to our study fluorescence based estimates taken under intense irradiance were consistently lower than chemically extracted estimates serra et al 2009 assessed the occurrence of light induced quenching in sau reservoir spain where the phytoplankton community was dominated by diatoms f chl a in the surface layer was underestimated by up to 50 during daytime relative to c chl a measured at the same time during the night serra et al 2009 did not observe any significant difference between f chl a and c chl a which they concluded as an indication of npq occurrence during daytime similarly serôdio et al 2001 observed a maximum reduction of 45 9 f chl a for a p tricornutum culture exposed to irradiance of 2200 μmol m 2 s 1 at 35 c water temperature lower water temperatures resulted in lower fluorescence quenching indicating a positive correlation between them and corroborating with other studies that proposed correction methods for algal fluorescence according to temperature mcbride rose 2018 our study complements the findings from these studies and consolidates i the significant effect of light on fluorescence in the absence of other confounding factors ii the universality of this phenomenon due to a consistent suppression in all tested devices and iii substantial error up to 79 of light induced quenching in a green alga and cyanobacterium species under bright light studies assessing the impact of light induced quenching on f pc and implications for in situ monitoring are also scarce misumi et al 2015 identified that for six cyanobacteria species cultures the highest fluorescence suppression occurred when the cultures were exposed to light intensities higher than those during culturing attributing the suppression to npq in addition pigment composition varied among the six cyanobacteria species resulting in variable quantum yield values i e the theoretical maximum light energy available for inducing fluorescence nevertheless fluorescence suppression under strong light 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 was similar among the six assessed species around 20 to 25 misumi et al 2015 but lower than the maximum f pc suppression of 59 observed in our study the different light harvesting regulation mechanisms between cyanobacteria and green algae may explain the different responses of f pc for d variabilis and f chl a for a gracilis in our study while d variabilis f pc slightly increased for the cyanobacterium during the low light intensity treatments a gracilis f chl a did not decreases in f chl a for a gracilis during low irradiances i e 0 13 and 7 μmol m 2 s 1 may have been caused by pq as this alga attempted to optimize its photochemical antennae müller et al 2001 in contrast since cyanobacteria cannot activate the xanthophyll cycle to dissipate excess light energy stransky and hager 1970 state transition is often the main light harvesting regulation mechanism in cyanobacteria in state transition phycobilisomes migrate from photosystem i in the dark to the photosystem ii in the light resulting in rapid increases of the fluorescence yield under moderate irradiance bailey et al 2005 a slight and fast increase of f pc indicative of a state transition was observed during darkness or at the low irradiances used in our study 0 13 and 7 μmol m 2 s 1 which are much lower than in other studies where state transition occurred in irradiances up to 300 μmol m 2 s 1 irradiance bailey et al 2005 additionally we found significant reductions in f chl a indicative of light induced quenching for irradiances as low as 134 μmol m 2 s 1 previous light exposure affects the magnitude of fluorescence suppression and in our study identical light intensities during increasing and decreasing phases of a diurnal cycle have different quenching levels for both the cyanobacteria and green alga species fig 7 and 8 similar patterns of hysteresis were observed in the field where fluorescence and photosynthesis suppression in the afternoon was higher than in the morning periods for the same level of irradiance neale and richerson 1987 dandonneau and neveux 1997 kurzbaum et al 2007 in contrast other researchers did not identify diurnal periodicity of phytoplankton photoinhibition e g yoshikawa and furuya 2006 and have attributed changes to variations in mixing light and nutrients with depth in our study the prolonged exposure to high light i e stress to the photosynthetic apparatus may explains why the decreasing light phase has higher fluorescence suppression physiologically photoinhibition relates to a decrease in replenishment of the d1 recovery protein and an increased in the damage constant resulting in the observed diurnal hysteresis han et al 2000 the rapid fluorescence recovery and symmetry between increasing and decreasing phases indicates that photodamage was minimal kroon 1994 the magnitude of light induced fluorescence suppression may also be influenced by factors other than light intensity such as nutrients in our study we attempted to ensure that d variabilis and a gracilis were replete with nutrients including micronutrients by providing appropriate media used in laboratory cultures during culturing and throughout the experiment see 2 1 nutrient limitation may lead to variable occurrence and magnitude of light induced quenching for instance bailey et al 2005 observed that marine and freshwater synechococcus sp strains had larger light induced npq when cells were iron starved spijkerman et al 2016 observed fluctuations in the f chl a of the green alga chlamydomonas acidophila when it was subjected to variable p and c co limitation spijkerman et al 2016 observed a severe decrease in fluorescence with additions of inorganic phosphorus co2 h2o and nahco3 despite constant light intensity of 120 μmol m 2 s 1 similarly nutrient induced npq was observed for dark adapted and light adapted cyanobacteria aphanothece sp and synechococcus sp when sulfide 0 1 nm was added to the laboratory culture oren et al 1979 since the nutrient replete state of cultures in our study most likely is not representative of most often experienced nutrient status by phytoplankton in situ f chl a and f pc from field estimates could be subjected to even larger fluorescence quenching levels than observed in our study 4 2 implications for field monitoring and the water industry our results suggest that diel light variability can greatly supress f chl a and f pc with up to 79 and 59 reduction respectively during our highest tested irradiances marked diel light variability occurs in all regions of the world except for isolated waterbodies in extreme latitudes for some periods of the year this diel light variability needs to be considered in fluorescence based estimates of phytoplankton chl a and pc in situ failing to do so particularly when surface water fluorescence measurements are taken during times of the day when there is bright sunlight is likely to lead to f chl a and f pc readings that are inaccurate when used as proxies for phytoplankton or cyanobacteria biomass respectively hab monitoring plans and early warning systems based on high frequency fluorescence sensors will also be compromised in the absence of adjustments for variations in solar radiation for instance identification of daily vertical migration patterns of phytoplankton can be confounded with light induced quenching during times of the day with strong irradiance laviale et al 2016 additionally habs that are related to longer daylight hours and higher light intensities during summer could be underestimated or not accurately captured by monitoring conducted during daylight hours continuous fluorescence monitoring systems may use nighttime measurements to calibrate daytime measurements through similar calculations to those used in our study or may even disregard daytime measurements as being unreliable alternatively an irradiance threshold value could be used where npq begins and measurements taken during these periods removed as done by roesler et al 2017 however a clear cut irradiance threshold that triggers npq is not clear since various factors other than light intensity as previously discussed play a role in light induced quenching occurrence and magnitude even though threshold cut offs or the dismissal of daytime measurements would ultimately reduce the potential of high frequency monitoring of pigments by fluorescence sensors they can effectively reduce bias due to light induced quenching in contrast discrete multi site measurements or profiling taken in routine monitoring programs during daylight hours can be more problematic for correction using these approaches and other innovative ways of correction may be needed light induced quenching correction using compensation calibration models instead of excluding data potentially affected by light induced quenching can be a challenge for field conditions variable quenching levels for similar irradiance in the short timespans i e without considerable changes in the phytoplankton community water quality and nutrient status should be taken into consideration since our results indicate that fluorescence suppression is dependent on previous light exposure other factors e g vertical migration and diel variations in mixed layer depth imberger and patterson 1989 can lead to phytoplankton concentration variations in similar diel scale resulting in uncertainty about whether the recorded fluorescence fluctuations derive from biomass change or from light induced quenching as a result of diel light and stratification cycles the analysis of high frequency data with simulations using ecological models can assist with the differentiation of a sensor inaccuracy i e derived from the pq npq phenomena or movement of motile or buoyant phytoplankton e g hamilton et al 2015 the identification of the dominant species can be crucial to assess if vertical migration is possible e g presence of cyanobacteria that are strongly buoyant or can migrate vertically since vertical migration of several cyanobacteria and motility of green algae species has been extensively documented e g ibelings et al 1991 whittington et al 2000 phytoplankton species differentiation from fluorescence sensors is not yet possible even though alternatives have been suggested rousso et al 2019 resulting in the need to rely on traditional monitoring techniques such as microscopic enumeration for species identification vertical migration and light induced quenching are two adaptation strategies that may be caused by diel light variability and are likely to be closely linked or occur simultaneously laviale et al 2016 since their kinetics have been shown to have similar time scale responses other factors that simultaneously alter vertical changes in biomass and npq are mixing patterns diel stratification and nutrient levels laviale et al 2016 appropriate correction models for light induced quenching bias will need to take into account these potential drivers at subdaily timescales modifications to probe design or sampling methods could also help minimize light induced quenching npq can be rapidly reversed in some cases by placing the phytoplankton in the dark the return to maximum fluorescence yield is related to the extent of photodamage of the photosynthetic apparatus kolber and falkowski 1993 in cases where photodamage is minimal recovery rates are fast from seconds to minutes while cases with significant photochemical damage usually require hours of readaptation in the dark the recovery of optimal fluorescence yield after dark adaptation in natural phytoplankton communities has half lives on the order of 5 15 min when photodamage extent is minimal but has a half life of the order of 2 4 h when photodamage was significant kolber and falkowski 1993 however there is still no clear consensus on what levels of irradiance result in photodamage in different phytoplankton groups different algal classes have significantly different light requirements for growth and photosynthesis richardson et al 1983 and therefore have different tolerance levels for photodamage testing of recovery time from various phytoplankton groups e g cyanobacteria karapetyan 2007 red algae figueroa et al 1997 green algae neidhardt et al 1998 antarctic diatoms reeves et al 2011 has shown a range of recovery times from seconds to hours according to the light intensity and extent of photodamage to the photosynthetic apparatus this aspect of photoinhibition is also time dependent related to the damage and recovery of d1 protein in photosynthetic reaction center ii which may vary significantly between different species han et al 2000 thus recovery times are most likely not constant within species as preadaptation conditions also affect the fluorescence yield as shown in our study further studies examining recovery times among phytoplankton groups and species are required to quantify photodamage in natural phytoplankton communities isolation of samples in dark chambers may minimize npq these designs should be based around non invasive principles to least affect phytoplankton physiological responses well known issues in conventional monitoring techniques e g cell counts and biovolumes such as lysis of cells with preservation and sampling biases from phytoplankton net samples benfield et al 2007 erickson et al 2011 have been highlighted by the use of non invasive technologies such as autonomous vertical profiling systems with fluorometers acoustic sensors or microscopic imaging non invasive monitoring tools should minimize the introduction of these biases conclusions an experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that diel light variations would significantly suppress f chl a and f pc from commercial fluorescence sensors employed worldwide for phytoplankton monitoring the results have shown that diel light intensity variation significantly affected a gracilis f chl a and d variabilis f pc due to light induced quenching a consistent suppression of fluorescence based estimates was observed in all devices during light treatments with only small variations in quenching magnitude among devices maximum suppression of fluorescence based estimates were as large as 79 f chl a and 59 f pc the level of suppression was mostly larger than the errors observed from other factors known to affect f chl a and f pc e g turbidity phytoplankton species composition dom the universality of diel light intensity variation implies that fluorescence probe estimates will be subject to light induced quenching in surface waters of most waterbodies the ability to deploy robust and accurate high frequency sensors for monitoring phytoplankton communities has long been a goal of researchers and practitioners worldwide while our results indicate that the light induced quenching must be taken into account to achieve this goal further investigations on causes triggers and magnitude of pq and npq on f chl a and f pc estimates should be initiated considering different species and environmental conditions e g trophic state light availability and mixing conditions studies that combine controlled experiments field monitoring and innovative sensors design i e dark chambers should be undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that confound our understanding of phytoplankton photochemistry

16991,optical sensors for fluorescence of chlorophyll a f chl a and phycocyanin f pc are increasingly used as a proxy for biomass of algae and cyanobacteria respectively they provide measurements at high frequency and modest cost these sensors require site specific calibration due to a range of interferences light intensity affects the fluorescence yield of cyanobacteria and algae through light harvesting regulation mechanisms but is often neglected as a potential source of error for in situ f chl a and f pc measurements we hypothesised that diel light variations would induce significant f chl a and f pc suppression when compared to dark periods we tested this hypothesis in a controlled experiment using three commercial fluorescence probes which continuously measured f chl a and f pc from a culture of the cyanobacterium dolichospermum variabilis as well as f chl a from a culture of the green alga ankistrodesmus gracilis in a simulated natural light regime under light all devices showed a significant p 0 01 suppression of f chl a and f pc compared to measurements in the dark f chl a decreased by up to 79 and f pc by up to 59 at maximum irradiance compared to dark adapted periods suppression levels were higher during the second phase of the diel cycle declining light indicating that quenching is dependent on previous light exposure diel variations in light intensity must be considered as a significant source of bias for fluorescence probes used for algal monitoring this is of high relevance as most monitoring activities take place during daytime and hence f chl a

indicator of trophic state and ecosystem health changes in phytoplankton community composition and biomass are associated with eutrophication and can potentially result in harmful algal blooms habs

interference that may impact f chl a and f pc zamyadi et al 2016 bertone et al 2018 such factors include species specific geometry volume and pigment content bertone et al 2019 kong et al 2014 organization of algae in colonies korak et al 2015 interference by turbid colored or organic rich waters bowling et al 2013 millie et al 2010b overlap of similar pigment fluorescence emission

availability beutler et al 2003 erickson et al 2012 regular site specific calibration is therefore recognised as a critical part of field deployments using this technology zamyadi et al 2012 however sources of bias related to light induced fluorescence quenching are often ignored even though its occurrence has been extensively documented e g falkowski and woodhead 2013 fluorescence generally originates from a small proportion of the absorbed light by algae and cyanobacteria ibelings et al 1994 and is affected by variations in the light regime and photochemical processes i e photosynthesis including ability to dissipate excess energy as heat thus light harvesting regulation mechanisms in algae and cyanobacteria may affect the fluorescence yield and consequently f chl a and f pc estimates phytoplankton can optimize light harvesting during periods of low light exposure by increasing the proportion of energy directed through photochemical pathways compared to emitted fluorescence resulting in a decrease in the fluorescence yield i e photochemical quenching pq müller et al 2001 in contrast during high and variable irradiance periods excess energy may cause photoinhibition of photosynthesis generally resulting in increased energy dissipation as heat through non photochemical quenching npq which also leads to fluorescence yield decrease falkowski and woodhead 2013 karapetyan 2007 krause and jahns 2004 npq is often recognized as an energy thermal regulation response that occurs during periods of high intensity or transient light but other processes besides thermal dissipation can result in npq malnoë 2018 pq and npq occur in most photosynthetic organisms from land plants to cyanobacteria even though light harvesting regulation varies among different photosynthetic groups due to differences in pigments and physiological pathways stransky and hager 1970 the implications of light induced fluorescence quenching for real time algal and cyanobacteria sensor measurements have often been ignored or suspect values discarded partly due to a lack of appropriate methodologies to compensate for fluorescence quenching roesler et al 2017 leach et al 2018 with the increasing use of fluorescence probes for continuous monitoring or rapid discrete readings or profiles at multiple sites taken mostly during daytime a quantitative assessment of fluorescence reduction due to light variability would be valuable to address the limited literature on light variability as a potential source of error on f chl a and f pc we designed an experiment to assess the impact of diel light variability on measurements from widely employed fluorescence sensors for phytoplankton monitoring we hypothesised that diurnal light cycle variation could significantly affect fluorescence based estimates resulting in underestimation of these measurements during periods with higher light intensity we quantified the impact of light exposure on f chl a and f pc during simulated diel light cycles under controlled conditions three commercial fluorescence probes were assessed in order to rule out whether the light induced effects on fluorescence yield may differ among different sensors designs moreover we used two different algal cultures the cyanobacterium dolichospermum variabilis a genus widely distributed globally that has been known to produce anatoxins li et al 2016 and the chlorophyte ankistrodesmus gracilis in order to quantify potential differences between different eukaryotic and prokaryotic phytoplankters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment setup the cyanobacterium dolichospermum variabilis strain atcc 29413 from the american type culture collection and the green alga ankistrodesmus gracilis strain sag 278 2 from the culture collection of algae of the university of göttingen were initially cultured in erlenmeyer flasks at room temperature in modified wc media according to guillard and lorenzen 1972 one week before the experiments started the cultures were transferred to individual mesocosms length 56 cm width 78 cm depth 41 cm 150 l tank volume to begin mass culture see 2 1 2 mesocosms were placed in a climate chamber adjusted to maintain water temperature around 18 c the mesocosms were continuously mixed with a stirrer d variabilis culture and an aerator a gracilis culture constant gentle mixing and regulation to a constant temperature were employed in both mesocosms to exclude the possibility of stratification and interferences induced by gradients of temperature stratification and vertical movement of the cyanobacterium and green alga mesocosms were subjected to multiple light treatments see 2 1 2 trials were run for five days or until the culture in the mesocosm collapsed i e no

probes were placed at 15 cm below the water surface and measured f chl a for the a gracilis tank and f pc for the d variabilis tank at sampling intervals ranging from 5 s to 10 min exo2 aqt 500 and

to simulate a diel pattern of 12 h of daylight from darkness 12 h light intensity was progressively increased at 30 min intervals for 2 h until a constant maximum light intensity for 8 h followed by progressive decrease in light for 2 h before darkness fig 1 light treatments were categorized by phase of the cycle i e before maximum exposure increasing light phase or after maximum exposure decreasing light phase four trials were conducted for the green alga a gracilis three of four trials had maximum light intensity of 354 μmol m 2 s 1 and one trial had maximum light intensity of 665 μmol m 2 s 1 dilution was undertaken in a gracilis mesocosm in some trials to maintain similar levels of algal concentration throughout the experiment in contrast only 2 trials for d variabilis mesocosm were conducted because the culture collapsed on the third day for d variabilis trials one had maximum light intensity of 354 μmol m 2 s 1 and the other had 665 μmol m 2 s 1 trials with maximum light exposure of 665 μmol m 2 s 1 consisted of half diel cycles due to operational limitations i e pause of the experiment to setup preparation and culture dilution 2 1 3 pigment measurements based on chemical extraction and photometry chemical extraction of chl a c chl a and pc c pc for a gracilis and d variabilis respectively was performed for filtered water samples collected throughout trials fig 1b at similar depth 15 cm depth of fluorescence sensors water level in the mesocosms was constant and observations indicated that mesocosms were fully mixed vertically see 2 1 duplicate water samples were taken for both c chl a and c pc water samples were filtered through glass fiber filters whatman gf f and the filters stored in a freezer at 18 c until extraction and measurement c chl a was extracted in 90 ethanol and measured photometrically according to german laboratory standard din 38 412 din 1985 extraction of c pc from filters was done with a method adapted from horváth et al 2013 filters were immersed in 10 ml distilled water and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 90 s the suspension was filtered after 1 h through 0 2 µm pore size cellulose acetate filters in order to remove cell debris photometric measurement at 620 nm was used for quantification based on calibration of photometric readings against a pc standard merck germany determination of c chl a was performed throughout the three trials for the green algae mesocosm determination of c pc was undertaken only during decreasing phase of the first trial and increasing phase of the second trial for the d variabilis mesocosm due to operational limitations 2 1 4 statistical analyses expected trends of normalized fluorescence based estimates for dark periods and light periods i e when there was a potential light quenching effect were calculated for each trial using local polynomial regression fitting loess function from r base package r core team 2020 the smoothed functions were assumed to mimic the theoretical population increase over the light phase as illustrated in fig 2 light induced quenching herein named normalized quenching was calculated as the absolute difference between the smoothed trends of normalized fluorescence based estimates f chl a or f pc from dark periods and light periods fig 2 and proportional quenching was calculated as the ratio between the calculated quenching i e vertical arrows length in fig 2 and the normalized estimate from dark period i e dashed black line in fig 2 direct comparison of f chl a and f pc in different stages of the diel cycle would introduce bias due to biomass changes from growth that occurred during the light period since the calculations performed to determine quenching levels require measurements taken during dark periods in the beginning and end the day and in our experiment the trials with 665 μmol m 2 s 1 consisted of half diel cycles see 2 1 2 quenching calculations were performed only for trials with maximum exposures of 354 μmol m 2 s 1 differences in f chl a and f pc between light and dark periods in the treatments were tested with welch s analysis of variance anova performed using the oneway test function from the r base package r core team 2020 if a statistical difference was observed between any of the light treatments pairwise differences between light treatments were tested with the post hoc games howell test using the oneway function from the package userfriendlyscience peters 2018 the welch s anova and games powell tests minimize type i errors fagerland 2012 and are recommended where data variances are not homogeneous and there is variable sample size between treatments which was the case for our data with different light exposure durations 3 results light induced a gradual decrease in f pc and f chl a in both the d variabilis and a gracilis mesocosms with greater suppression at higher light intensity the absolute fluorescence values varied according to the probe manufacturer indicating that calibration to other direct or proxy measures of phytoplankton or cyanobacteria biomass is required for each sensor type separately however normalized f pc and f chl a refer to equation 1 revealed similar patterns of fluorescence reduction during light exposure for all devices fig 3 and fig 4 respectively as illustrated in fig 3 the aqt 500 exhibited much higher variability for f pc than the bbe and exo2 probes but mean values showed a weaker light induced depression of f pc than the other sensors fig 5 d variabilis c pc was collected only during the second half cycle due to operational limitations as illustrated in fig 3 due to the high variability in aqt500 readings f pc measurements from this probe were not considered for quenching analysis for a gracilis f chl a all probes showed similar patterns and variability amongst devices was lower than for d variabilis f pc bbe based a gracilis f chl a appeared to be slightly higher than the exo2 and aqt600 based a gracilis f chl a in treatments during the decreasing phase with light intensities 134 μmol m 2 s 1 fig 6 the f chl a from a gracilis strongly increased between the dark phases indicative of intense growth during the light cycle supplementary material a a gracilis f chl a was systematically lower than a gracilis c chl a during periods with light table 2 d variabilis did not grow during the trials showing similar levels of f pc and c pc at the beginning and end of trials d variabilis f pc was lower than d variabilis c pc when light intensity was higher than 134 μmol m 2 s

occurred during light periods of the simulated diel light dark cycle f chl a and f pc were most reduced during maximum light intensities compared to values in the dark reductions up to 79 and 59 respectively these variations are large compared to other factors known to impact f chl a and f pc measurements such as changes in turbidity dissolved organic matter dom and species composition increased mineral turbidity was found by zamyadi et al 2012 to result in underestimation of cyanobacterial biovolume by up to 48 8 for three different commercial fluorometers and 5 cyanobacteria species increasing dom has been shown to cause underestimation in f pc and f chl a by up to 16 bertone et al 2019 mixed species cultures resulted in overestimation of f chl a and f pc by 14 and 18 when compared with estimates derived from single species calibration curves bertone et al 2019 seasonal variations in temperature variability can cause decreases in algal fluorescence with variability among measurements ranging from non significant to almost 50 according to sensor manufacturer and cell densities hodges et al 2018 many models have been suggested to compensate for the above mentioned interferences zamyadi et al 2012 mcbride rose 2018 choo et al 2019 conversely no appropriate method to compensate light induced quenching has yet been proposed for such devices even though error rates observed in our study exceed most of those derived from other interferences only a few studies have quantified light induced quenching impacts on f chl a kaylor et al 2018 showed a consistent discrepancy between f chl a estimates taken in situ in the shade versus directly under midday sun in 50 sites in grande ronde river basin oregon usa fluorescence in the shade were 5 to 113 higher than under sunlight exposures across the 50 sites the authors reported a consistent pattern of fluorescence increase with increased time in the shade after sun exposure with short recovery periods 6 to 14 min recovery duration longer than 30 min may be required only in cases where photodamage of cells has occurred maxwell and johnson 2000 kaylor et al 2018 also compared in situ f chl a and chemically extracted chl a similarly to our study fluorescence based estimates taken under intense irradiance were consistently lower than chemically extracted estimates serra et al 2009 assessed the occurrence of light induced quenching in sau reservoir spain where the phytoplankton community was dominated by diatoms f chl a in the surface layer was underestimated by up to 50 during daytime relative to c chl a measured at the same time during the night serra et al 2009 did not observe any significant difference between f chl a and c chl a which they concluded as an indication of npq occurrence during daytime similarly serôdio et al 2001 observed a maximum reduction of 45 9 f chl a for a p tricornutum culture exposed to irradiance of 2200 μmol m 2 s 1 at 35 c water temperature lower water temperatures resulted in lower fluorescence quenching indicating a positive correlation between them and corroborating with other studies that proposed correction methods for algal fluorescence according to temperature mcbride rose 2018 our study complements the findings from these studies and consolidates i the significant effect of light on fluorescence in the absence of other confounding factors ii the universality of this phenomenon due to a consistent suppression in all tested devices and iii substantial error up to 79 of light induced quenching in a green alga and cyanobacterium species under bright light studies assessing the impact of light induced quenching on f pc and implications for in situ monitoring are also scarce misumi et al 2015 identified that for six cyanobacteria species cultures the highest fluorescence suppression occurred when the cultures were exposed to light intensities higher than those during culturing attributing the suppression to npq in addition pigment composition varied among the six cyanobacteria species resulting in variable quantum yield values i e the theoretical maximum light energy available for inducing fluorescence nevertheless fluorescence suppression under strong light 1200 μmol m 2 s 1 was similar among the six assessed species around 20 to 25 misumi et al 2015 but lower than the maximum f pc suppression of 59 observed in our study the different light harvesting regulation mechanisms between cyanobacteria and green algae may explain the different responses of f pc for d variabilis and f chl a for a gracilis in our study while d variabilis f pc slightly increased for the cyanobacterium during the low light intensity treatments a gracilis f chl a did not decreases in f chl a for a gracilis during low irradiances i e 0 13 and 7 μmol m 2 s 1 may have been caused by pq as this alga attempted to optimize its photochemical antennae müller et al 2001 in contrast since cyanobacteria cannot activate the xanthophyll cycle to dissipate excess light energy stransky and hager 1970 state transition is often the main light harvesting regulation mechanism in cyanobacteria in state transition phycobilisomes migrate from photosystem i in the dark to the photosystem ii in the light resulting in rapid increases of the fluorescence yield under moderate irradiance bailey et al 2005 a slight and fast increase of f pc indicative of a state transition was observed during darkness or at the low irradiances used in our study 0 13 and 7 μmol m 2 s 1 which are much lower than in other studies where state transition occurred in irradiances up to 300 μmol m 2 s 1 irradiance bailey et al 2005 additionally we found significant reductions in f chl a indicative of light induced quenching for irradiances as low as 134 μmol m 2 s 1 previous light exposure affects the magnitude of fluorescence suppression and in our study identical light intensities during increasing and decreasing phases of a diurnal cycle have different quenching levels for both the cyanobacteria and green alga species fig 7 and 8 similar patterns of hysteresis were observed in the field where fluorescence and photosynthesis suppression in the afternoon was higher than in the morning periods for the same level of irradiance neale and richerson 1987 dandonneau and neveux 1997 kurzbaum et al 2007 in contrast other researchers did not identify diurnal periodicity of phytoplankton photoinhibition e g yoshikawa and furuya 2006 and have attributed changes to variations in mixing light and nutrients with depth in our study the prolonged exposure to high light i e stress to the photosynthetic apparatus may explains why the decreasing light phase has higher fluorescence suppression physiologically photoinhibition relates to a decrease in replenishment of the d1 recovery protein and an increased in the damage constant resulting in the observed diurnal hysteresis han et al 2000 the rapid fluorescence recovery and symmetry between increasing and decreasing phases indicates that photodamage was minimal kroon 1994 the magnitude of light induced fluorescence suppression may also be influenced by factors other than light intensity such as nutrients in our study we attempted to ensure that d variabilis and a gracilis were replete with nutrients including micronutrients by providing appropriate media used in laboratory cultures during culturing and throughout the experiment see 2 1 nutrient limitation may lead to variable occurrence and magnitude of light induced quenching for instance bailey et al 2005 observed that marine and freshwater synechococcus sp strains had larger light induced npq when cells were iron starved spijkerman et al 2016 observed fluctuations in the f chl a of the green alga chlamydomonas acidophila when it was subjected to variable p and c co limitation spijkerman et al 2016 observed a severe decrease in fluorescence with additions of inorganic phosphorus co2 h2o and nahco3 despite constant light intensity of 120 μmol m 2 s 1 similarly nutrient induced npq was observed for dark adapted and light adapted cyanobacteria aphanothece sp and synechococcus sp when sulfide 0 1 nm was added to the laboratory culture oren et al 1979 since the nutrient replete state of cultures in our study most likely is not representative of most often experienced nutrient status by phytoplankton in situ f chl a and f pc from field estimates could be subjected to even larger fluorescence quenching levels than observed in our study 4 2 implications for field monitoring and the water industry our results suggest that diel light variability can greatly supress f chl a and f pc with up to 79 and 59 reduction respectively during our highest tested irradiances marked diel light variability occurs in all regions of the world except for isolated waterbodies in extreme latitudes for some periods of the year this diel light variability needs to be considered in fluorescence based estimates of phytoplankton chl a and pc in situ failing to do so particularly when surface water fluorescence measurements are taken during times of the day when there is bright sunlight is likely to lead to f chl a and f pc readings that are inaccurate when used as proxies for phytoplankton or cyanobacteria biomass respectively hab monitoring plans and early warning systems based on high frequency fluorescence sensors will also be compromised in the absence of adjustments for variations in solar radiation for instance identification of daily vertical migration patterns of phytoplankton can be confounded with light induced quenching during times of the day with strong irradiance laviale et al 2016 additionally habs that are related to longer daylight hours and higher light intensities during summer could be underestimated or not accurately captured by monitoring conducted during daylight hours continuous fluorescence monitoring systems may use nighttime measurements to calibrate daytime measurements through similar calculations to those used in our study or may even disregard daytime measurements as being unreliable alternatively an irradiance threshold value could be used where npq begins and measurements taken during these periods removed as done by roesler et al 2017 however a clear cut irradiance threshold that triggers npq is not clear since various factors other than light intensity as previously discussed play a role in light induced quenching occurrence and magnitude even though threshold cut offs or the dismissal of daytime measurements would ultimately reduce the potential of high frequency monitoring of pigments by fluorescence sensors they can effectively reduce bias due to light induced quenching in contrast discrete multi site measurements or profiling taken in routine monitoring programs during daylight hours can be more problematic for correction using these approaches and other innovative ways of correction may be needed light induced quenching correction using compensation calibration models instead of excluding data potentially affected by light induced quenching can be a challenge for field conditions variable quenching levels for similar irradiance in the short timespans i e without considerable changes in the phytoplankton community water quality and nutrient status should be taken into consideration since our results indicate that fluorescence suppression is dependent on previous light exposure other factors e g vertical migration and diel variations in mixed layer depth imberger and patterson 1989 can lead to phytoplankton concentration variations in similar diel scale resulting in uncertainty about whether the recorded fluorescence fluctuations derive from biomass change or from light induced quenching as a result of diel light and stratification cycles the analysis of high frequency data with simulations using ecological models can assist with the differentiation of a sensor inaccuracy i e derived from the pq npq phenomena or movement of motile or buoyant phytoplankton e g hamilton et al 2015 the identification of the dominant species can be crucial to assess if vertical migration is possible e g presence of cyanobacteria that are strongly buoyant or can migrate vertically since vertical migration of several cyanobacteria and motility of green algae species has been extensively documented e g ibelings et al 1991 whittington et al 2000 phytoplankton species differentiation from fluorescence sensors is not yet possible even though alternatives have been suggested rousso et al 2019 resulting in the need to rely on traditional monitoring techniques such as microscopic enumeration for species identification vertical migration and light induced quenching are two adaptation strategies that may be caused by diel light variability and are likely to be closely linked or occur simultaneously laviale et al 2016 since their kinetics have been shown to have similar time scale responses other factors that simultaneously alter vertical changes in biomass and npq are mixing patterns diel stratification and nutrient levels laviale et al 2016 appropriate correction models for light induced quenching bias will need to take into account these potential drivers at subdaily timescales modifications to probe design or sampling methods could also help minimize light induced quenching npq can be rapidly reversed in some cases by placing the phytoplankton in the dark the return to maximum fluorescence yield is related to the extent of photodamage of the photosynthetic apparatus kolber and falkowski 1993 in cases where photodamage is minimal recovery rates are fast from seconds to minutes while cases with significant photochemical damage usually require hours of readaptation in the dark the recovery of optimal fluorescence yield after dark adaptation in natural phytoplankton communities has half lives on the order of 5 15 min when photodamage extent is minimal but has a half life of the order of 2 4 h when photodamage was significant kolber and falkowski 1993 however there is still no clear consensus on what levels of irradiance result in photodamage in different phytoplankton groups different algal classes have significantly different light requirements for growth and photosynthesis richardson et al 1983 and therefore have different tolerance levels for photodamage testing of recovery time from various phytoplankton groups e g cyanobacteria karapetyan 2007 red algae figueroa et al 1997 green algae neidhardt et al 1998 antarctic diatoms reeves et al 2011 has shown a range of recovery times from seconds to hours according to the light intensity and extent of photodamage to the photosynthetic apparatus this aspect of photoinhibition is also time dependent related to the damage and recovery of d1 protein in photosynthetic reaction center ii which may vary significantly between different species han et al 2000 thus recovery times are most likely not constant within species as preadaptation conditions also affect the fluorescence yield as shown in our study further studies examining recovery times among phytoplankton groups and species are required to quantify photodamage in natural phytoplankton communities isolation of samples in dark chambers may minimize npq these designs should be based around non invasive principles to least affect phytoplankton physiological responses well known issues in conventional monitoring techniques e g cell counts and biovolumes such as lysis of cells with preservation and sampling biases from phytoplankton net samples benfield et al 2007 erickson et al 2011 have been highlighted by the use of non invasive technologies such as autonomous vertical profiling systems with fluorometers acoustic sensors or microscopic imaging non invasive monitoring tools should minimize the introduction of these biases conclusions an experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that diel light variations would significantly suppress f chl a and f pc from commercial fluorescence sensors employed worldwide for phytoplankton monitoring the results have shown that diel light intensity variation significantly affected a gracilis f chl a and d variabilis f pc due to light induced quenching a consistent suppression of fluorescence based estimates was observed in all devices during light treatments with only small variations in quenching magnitude among devices maximum suppression of fluorescence based estimates were as large as 79 f chl a and 59 f pc the level of suppression was mostly larger than the errors observed from other factors known to affect f chl a and f pc e g turbidity phytoplankton species composition dom the universality of diel light intensity variation implies that fluorescence probe estimates will be subject to light induced quenching in surface waters of most waterbodies the ability to deploy robust and accurate high frequency sensors for monitoring phytoplankton communities has long been a goal of researchers and practitioners worldwide while our results indicate that the light induced quenching must be taken into account to achieve this goal further investigations on causes triggers and magnitude of pq and npq on f chl a and f pc estimates should be initiated considering different species and environmental conditions e g trophic state light availability and mixing conditions studies that combine controlled experiments field monitoring and innovative sensors design i e dark chambers should be undertaken to provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that confound our understanding of phytoplankton photochemistry including photoprotective npq and light readaptation mechanisms for both sudden and prolonged exposure to light intensity besides environmental triggers e g water temperature stratification and

2014 martins et al 2011 vane et al 2011 estuarine and coastal sediments are usually regarded as sinks for terrigenous pahs where they become preserved bianchi allison and cai 2013 fontenelle et al 2019 liu et al 2021 sutilli et al 2019 the concentrations composition profiles and diagnostic ratios of sedimentary pahs and their geographical variations in estuarine coastal systems are usually examined based on the concentration monitoring approach this can provide the first insight into their origins land sea transport and relative impacts of fluvial transport wang et al 2015 wu et al 2019a however the geochemical signals based on pah concentration datasets can be modified during weathering processes in the environment due to selective losses in chemical biological reactions and thereby causing ambiguous pah source results katsoyiannis sweetman and jones 2011 ya et al 2020 zhang et al 2005 radiocarbon 14c t1 2 5730 ys data based on compound specific radiocarbon analysis csra can characterize the sources and transport of ambient pahs independent of their history regarding degradation conditions ingalls and pearson 2005 ya et al 2018 in the past twenty years an increasing amount of research has been devoted to exploring the source information in the 14c signatures of pahs bosch et al 2015 kumata et al 2006 sheesley et al 2009 tang et al 2020 zencak et al 2007 expanding the application of the 14c signature as an indicator can provide an important reference for clarifying the transport and fate of organic pollutants at the land sea interface in addition csra can also provide information based on molecular level 14c analysis to further complement or validate the traditional use of the biomarkers as biogeochemical tracers eglinton et al 1997 perylene a typical five ring pah could potentially be used for source allocation of terrigenous organic matter in aquatic sediments hanke et al 2019 jiang et al 2000 zhang et al 2014 its origin shows a markedly different historical record from anthropogenic and natural pahs resulting in a longstanding debate in geochemical research and pollutant forensics bertrand et al 2013 grice et al 2009 hanke et al 2019 jiang et al 2000 marynowski et al 2013 varnosfaderany et al 2014 venkatesan 1988 zhang et al 2014 first in contrast to other unsubstituted pahs combustion only produces trace or small amounts of perylene because of its extreme thermodynamic instability and higher reactivity bakhtiari et al 2009 grice et al 2009 jenkins et al 1996 second perylene has been identified as a diagenetic product of wood derived fungi i e terrigenous production in forest soils through isotopic tracing hanke et al 2019 silliman et al 2000 third in marine sediments perylene can be generated by microbially mediated in situ diageneses of organic carbon suzuki et al 2010 venkatesan 1988 finally fossil fuels e g coal and crude oils are also one of the sources of perylene in sediment grice et al 2009 jiang et al 2000 although the sources of perylene have largely been clarified the quantitative land sea transport processes of perylene as a typical terrestrial biomarker have not been further studied based on the above mentioned generation processes of perylene a combination of soil and fluvial erosion hanke et al 2019 varnosfaderany et al 2014 microbially mediated in situ diageneses suzuki yessalina and kikuchi 2010 venkatesan 1988 and anthropogenic inputs in particular oil and coal spills in coastal cities and harbors grice et al 2009 jiang et al 2000 are the predominant sources of perylene in estuarine coastal systems and collectively regulate the input mixing and burial of perylene therefore considering the geochemical significance of perylene in the connectivity between terrestrial and marine ecosystems hanke et al 2019 the compound specific 14c of perylene and the 14c end member mixing model can provide critical information for quantitatively evaluating the origins and land sea transport of perylene from terrestrial systems through estuaries and to adjacent coasts the iulong river estuary jre and adjacent western aiwan strait wts is a representative subtropical estuarine coastal system that is heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities and the east asian monsoon wu et al 2016 2019a therefore it can be used as a natural laboratory for studying the land sea transport of perylene and other pahs based on the expanded application of csra in this study we examined the concentrations profiles and 14c contents of sedimentary pahs as potential biogeochemical tracers to quantitatively reveal the influence of land sea interactions first we assessed the impact of the land sea interactions on the spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary pahs second as well as aiding in the source appointment of pahs the spatial 14c variations of pahs were used to track additional geochemical information such as the transport and fate of sedimentary pahs the compound specific 14c approach can help further clarify the environmental implication of pah isotopes finally based on the 14c of perylene we built a 14c end member mixing model to quantitatively evaluate the land sea transport of perylene overall this study provides a quantitative description of the origin and transport of perylene and other pahs in an estuarine coastal sedimentary system 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling surface sediments from the jre and wts were collected onboard r v haiyang 2 in may 2015 and r v yanping 2 in june 2015 respectively the sampling sites were divided into four regions upstream jre jre u a1 to a8 n 6 downstream jre jre d jy0 jy3 n 4 wts coast just north of the jre wts n xa0 x5 01 x02 n 7 and wts coast just south of the jre wts s x50 x73 n 8 fig 1 the top 5 cm of sediment was collected at each sampling site using a stainless steel grab sampler and then placed in pre baked aluminum containers sealed and frozen at 20 c until further analysis 2 2 pah

strained through an 80 mesh sieve after adding excessive activated copper powder 10 g of sediment was spiked with five deuterated pah surrogates and then ultrasonically extracted using n hexane acetone 1 1 v v three times after rotary evaporation the concentrated extract was purified using pretreated alumina silica gel chromatography text s1 of supporting information si finally the eluate was evaporated to 100 μl under a gentle stream of n2 gas 99 99 purity and stored at 20 c prior to instrumental analysis pahs were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms using an agilent 6890 series gc and an agilent 5973 ms detailed instrumental conditions have been described in our previous papers si text s1 ya et al 2017a 2017b the targeted compounds included 15 priority pahs designated by the us epa without naphthalene and perylene m z 252 their abbreviations are listed in table s1 sedimentary total organic carbon toc concentrations were analyzed using a vario el iii elemental analyzer the procedures are described in detail in our previous paper wu et al 2019b the reported pah and toc concentrations were based on dry weight dw 2 3 bulk sample preparation for 14c analysis to satisfy the carbon content required for δ14c measurements of pahs we combined equivalent amounts of sifted sediments from all the jre stations 680 g total sites a1 to a8 and jy0 jy3 and equivalent amounts of sediments from all the wts stations 620 g total sites xa0 x5 01 x02 and x50 x73 into two bulk samples named jre and wts the pretreatment flow diagram for the 14c measurements of the targeted pahs in the sediments is shown in fig s1 sediment samples were freeze dried and strained through an 80 mesh sieve after adding excessive activated copper powder the sediments were ultrasonically extracted with dichloromethane methanol 9 1 v v three times the extracts were combined evaporated to 10 ml and then saponified with 10 ml of a 0 5 mol l 1 koh solution in methanol water 4 1 v v for 2 h at 80 c the neutral fraction containing pahs was extracted with n hexane three times and was evaporated to 1 ml before being chromatographically separated in a glass column packed with activated silica gel activated at 500 c for 4 h and deactivated with 5 water the elution solvents were n hexane and n hexane dichloromethane 1 1 v v the n hexane dichloromethane phase containing pahs was evaporated to 1 ml cleaned by partitioning with n pentane dimethylformamide dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate mandalakis zebühr and gustafsson 2004b ya et al 2018 and reduced to 0 5 ml with a gentle stream of n2 chromatograms of the gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid before and after purification by n pentane dimethylformamide are shown in fig s2 after chemical purification preparative capillary gas chromatography pcgc was used to isolate and prepare the targeted pahs for csra we presented the details of the pcgc procedure in a previous paper text s2 ya et al 2018 in this study targeted pahs were initially separated using an agilent j w hp 5 ms column 60 m length 0 53 mm i d film thickness 0 25 μm and collected using a preparative fraction collector pfc the initially prepared pahs were combined and subjected to a second separation step using an agilent j w db 17 ms polar column 30 m length 0 32 mm i d film thickness 0 25 μm and were again collected by the pfc after being trapped the targeted pahs were transferred to 4 ml vials after rinsing with n pentane four times finally the samples were passed through a silica gel column to remove the column bleed a small aliquot was taken from each trap to check the purity of the targeted pahs using a gc fid equipped with a high resolution agilent j w vf 5 ms column 25 m length 0 2 mm i d film thickness 0 33 µm limited by the sample size of the individual pahs we utilized the sum of phenanthrene and anthracene phen an fluoranthene and pyrene fluo py five and six ring pahs including benzo b j k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene indeno 1 2 3 c d pyrene dibenz a h anthracene and benzo g h i perylene and perylene per as the four targeted pah groups for 14c analysis the final chromatograms of the targeted pahs from the jre and wts are shown in fig s3 δ14c analysis of toc in the surface sediments of the jre and wts was also performed at the national ocean sciences accelerator mass spectrometry nosams facility of woods hole oceanographic institute whoi the following offline combustion and graphite preparation processes for δ14c measurement were conducted at the nosams facility at whoi pearson et al 1997 briefly after catalytic oxidation of the targeted pahs and toc the generated co2 was purified and quantified in the vacuum glass line and reduced to graphite finally δ14c was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry ams at the nosams facility pearson et al 1997 the detailed procedures have been presented in shah and pearson 2007 and xu et al 2012 the reported δ14c values based on the sampling year were compared to the nbs oxalic acid i nist srm 4990 standard after normalizing the radiocarbon content of a sample to the same δ13c value 25 and year 1950 stuiver and polach 1977 2 4 quality assurance and control the analytical procedures were carefully performed to ensure quality control six laboratory blanks were measured to monitor potential contamination during sample handling in the laboratory the pah concentrations in the lab blank samples were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those in the samples based on a sample weight of 10 g dw see table s2 indicating that the background pahs from the laboratory could be largely ignored deuterated surrogate standards were used to correct for losses that occurred during the pretreatment procedures pah recoveries ranged from 60 120 with a mean of 97 19 table s2 the method detection limits mdls were calculated as the mean plus three times the standard deviation of the lab blanks rauert et al 2020 if an analyte was not detected in the blanks the concentration of a peak with a signal to noise ratio of 10 1 was inserted for mdls rauert et al 2020 the mdls of pahs ranged from 0 01 1 04 ng g 1 dw with a mean of 0 27 0 32 ng g 1 dw table s2 for the 14c analysis of bulk samples pah and external carbon contamination was avoided throughout the entire process all glassware aluminum foil and anhydrous sodium sulfate were baked at 500 c for 4 h prior to use detailed quality assurance procedures are described in our previous paper ya et al 2018 briefly the concentration of pahs in process blanks of extraction and purification procedures was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of field samples table s2 during the pcgc process deviations in retention times were strictly controlled to avoid the introduction of impure components and isotope fractionation of the targeted pahs xu et al 2012 ya et al 2018 we employed column bleed removal steps to avoid additional carbon contamination from the stationary phase the solvent n pentene used in the column bleed removal step was blown to dryness in a baked quartz tube finally the estimated purities of the isolated pahs based on the chromatogram as determined by gc fid ranged from 90 100 table s3 overall the quality assurance measures satisfied the small sample 2 µmol 14c test requirements of the nosams facility at whoi pearson et al 1997 for reference we report the carbon impurity corrected δ14c results based on the assumption that all impurities were derived from fossil or modern carbon detailed procedures and results are given in si text s3 and table s3 respectively the statistical analysis method is introduced in si text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary pahs the total concentrations of the 15 us epa designated priority pahs in surface sediments of the jre and wts ranged from 14 452 126 116 ng g 1 dw with a median concentration of 75 ng g 1 dw fig 2 and table s4 fluo ranging from 1 8 96 ng g 1 dw with median and mean concentrations of 18 and 28 26 ng g 1 dw respectively py range 1 5 101 median 12 mean 26 28 ng g 1 dw followed by phen range 5 3 50 median 12 mean 16 12 ng g 1 dw were present in the highest relative abundances with mean percent contributions to the total pahs of 22 3 6 18 4 7 and 16 6 9 respectively table s4 and fig s4 the amounts of these three pahs in the jre wts sedimentary system were higher than those in the continental shelf sediments of china fluo 8 0 py 6 4 phen 11 ng g 1 dw liu et al 2012 and the amazon coastal zone fluo 3 7 py 4 1 phen 2 9 ng g 1 dw pichler et al 2021 close to the levels found in the mediterranean lagoon in the northern adriatic sea italy fluo 59 py 33 phen 21 ng g 1 dw acquavita et al 2014 the estuarine sediments over china fluo

those found in the lenga estuary central chile and the south pacific fluo 356 py 342 phen 142 ng g 1 dw pozo et al 2011 in total sedimentary pahs in the jre and wts were at relatively low or moderate levels compared with other estuarine and coastal regions worldwide acquavita et al 2014 li et al 2021 liu et al 2012 2021 pichler et al 2021 pozo et al 2011 compared with two decades ago pah concentrations in the jre have gradually decreased and their composition has dramatically changed maskaoui et al 2002 zhang et al 2000 which partly reflects changes in energy efficiency frequent utilization of cleaning technologies and emission controls lu et al 2019 as a typical class of environmental tracers the spatial heterogeneity of surface sedimentary pahs can provide an insight into the short term influence of the river on the estuary and coast in the jre wts system pah concentrations decreased by several to ten times from the estuary to the coastal areas fig 2 and table s4 as reported in the western south atlantic upper continental margin santos et al 2020 both total and individual pah concentrations especially the predominant fluo py and phen showed significant negative correlations with the offshore distance km from the jre towards the wts p 0 01 spearman s rank table s5 pahs also showed a significant positive correlation with toc concentrations table s4 in jre wts sedimentary system p 0 01 spearman s rank this revealed that fluvial transport by hydrodynamic forces was one of the crucial driving forces of sedimentary pah distribution along with surface runoff lin et al 2013 ya et al 2018 during transport into the estuary and sea pahs are dispersed degraded and finally buried in the estuarine coastal sedimentary system liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in contrast to decreased concentrations the percentages of pah species were relatively constant from upstream to downstream reaches and finally to wts s with differences seen at wts n fig s4 the decreasing concentration and constant composition can partly reflect the stronger influence of jre diluted water on the southern coast of the wts than on the northern coast over the past decade the time scale can be calculated by the sampling depth of 5 cm and a mean linear sedimentation rate of 0 4 cm year 1 huh et al 2011 besides the jre long range alongshore transport of river derived materials from the yangtze river and other coastal rivers such as the qiantang ou and min rivers driven by the min zhe coastal current mzcc hu et al 2014 could be another significant factor affecting the spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary pahs in coastal wts lin et al 2013 ya et al 2018 previous studies have revealed that the mzcc can substantially affect the balance of black carbon and pah budgets of the coastal wts li et al 2016 wu et al 2019b overall the spatial heterogeneity of both pah concentrations and compositions can reflect regional differences in the intensity of land sea interactions of terrigenous pahs and also be used as auxiliary evidence from the perspective of sedimentary pahs for determining regional short term average deposition characteristics of the river plume discharging into the wts wang zheng and hu 2013 3 2 sources and transport of pahs determined by their 14c signatures the 14c signatures of individual pahs were measured to identify their sources and transport from the estuary to adjacent coasts based on the available carbon masses of the compounds table s3 δ14c measurements were performed on four groups of combined pahs phen an fluo py perylene five six ring pahs the total amounts of carbon in the corresponding pah samples available for δ14c analysis ranged from 2 1 6 0 μmol c and the purities of the isolated pah groups ranged from 90 100 table s3 overall the measured δ14c values of phen an δ14cphen an were 670 5 and 418 5 fluo py δ14cfluo py were 679 5 and 745 5 and five six ring pahs δ14c5 6 rings were 778 3 and 849 3 in the jre and wts respectively fig 3 and table s3 as a reference the carbon impurity corrected δ14c results are also listed in table s3 and shown in fig 3 the global comparison of 14c signatures of pahs in sediment can reflect the source differences of buried pahs derived from the surrounding anthropogenic activities ya et al 2020 the 14c signatures of the targeted pahs in the surface sediments of the jre wts system are comparable to those in sediment cores from siskiwit lake located on isle royale michigan 783 to 388 slater et al 2013 and in surface sediments from the waterways of the stockholm metropolitan area 934 to 585 mandalakis et al 2004a these values are much higher than those reported in sediment cores from the peace athabasca delta in the vicinity of the rapidly developing oil sand industry in northern alberta canada 962 to 849 jautzy et al 2015 and those from an urban reservoir located in the central tokyo metropolitan area japan 934 to 824 kanke et al 2004 moreover the 14c signatures of toc i e δ14ctoc were 218 and 329 in the jre and wts respectively fig 3 and table s3 which are comparable to those in the adjacent areas reported by bao et al 2016 these δ14ctoc values were also much higher than the targeted pahs in the jre and wts fig 3 this is not surprising as a higher proportion of modern carbon components was expected in the toc pool such as inputs from terrestrial higher plants li et al 2017 furthermore we estimated the fractional contributions of pahs from biomass burning c3 and c4 plants fbiomass and fossil fuels coal combustion and petroleum related emissions ffossil 1 fbiomass using a 14c end member mixing model of pahs expressed as δ14cpah δ14cbiomass fbiomass δ14cfossil 1 fbiomass jautzy et al 2015 tang et al 2020 xu et al 2012 ya et al 2018 the δ14c value of the fossil fuel end member δ14cfossil was 1000 xu et al 2012 there were at least two components of the biomass burning signature i e δ14cbiomass one was the wood burning of perennial trees with a δ14c value of 225 that grew over the past 30 50 years in an atmosphere with elevated 14c contents mandalakis et al 2005 zencak et al 2007 the second was from the burning of materials produced during the current year such as leaves and annual grass i e δ14c of contemporary co2 which had a mean value of 8 7 around xiamen city in 2014 as reported by niu et al 2016 these two components represent the maximum and minimum values of the modern end member in the environment respectively in this study we used these end members to estimate the ranges of fractional contributions of pahs from biomass burning and fossil fuels in the jre and wts table s3 according to the 14c end member mixing model the calculated fractional contributions from biomass burning of phen an fluo py and five six ring pahs were 29 35 27 33 and 20 24 respectively in the jre and 49 60 21 26 and 13 16 respectively in the wts fig 3 and table s3 this is closer to the contribution rate of biomass sources 23 to sedimentary black carbon in the east china sea wang 2020 correspondingly fossil fuel sources ffossil 1 fbiomass contributed 65 71 of phen an 67 73 of fluo py and 76 80 of five six ring pahs in the jre and 40 51 74 79 and 84 87 respectively in the wts due to the high contemporary anthropogenic activity derived emissions from surrounding cities and harbors e g industry shipping traffic and oil spills anthropogenic fossil fuel derived pahs including direct input and combustion processes of oil and coal are the predominant contributor to pahs in the jre and wts ya et al 2018 interestingly the contributions of fossil fuels to pahs in sediments were lower than the contributions of fossil fuels to pahs in the adjacent surface seawater 89 reported in our previous work ya et al 2018 in this study surface sediments top 5 cm reflected the burial of pahs over the past decade huh et al 2011 whereas the surrounding surface seawater only represented the transitory pah sources during the sampling period in our previous study therefore the discrepancy in the proportion of fossil fuel derived pahs between sediment and surface seawater indirectly reflects the gradual increase in fossil fuel consumption along with rapid urbanization chen teng and wang 2012 zhang and lin 2012 at the molecular level δ14c values showed a decreasing trend with increasing pah molecular weight phen an fluo py five six ring pahs in both the jre and wts fig 3 this reflects a decrease in biomass sourced pahs or an increase of fossil fuel derived pahs e g coal and petroleum related emissions as the molecular weight increases spatially δ14cfluo py and δ14c5 6 rings values decreased during transport from the jre to the wts which was consistent with the decreasing δ14c values of toc from 218 to 329 fig 3 because of the high sedimentation rate 0 4 cm year 1 huh et al 2011 the lower δ14c values of pahs in the surface sediments of the wts could not have been caused by in situ 14c decay during long term burial therefore we deduce that the lower 14c contents of pahs and toc along the coast compared to the estuary can be attributed to a combination of three factors 1 dilution weakening of estuarine inputs wu et al 2019a 2 atmospheric contribution fang et al 2016 wu et al 2019b yu et al 2018 and 3 ocean current driven inputs wu et al 2013 ya et al 2017a 2018 undoubtedly the decreasing pah concentrations fig 2 reflect the continued decreasing impact of the jre diluted water on the wts in addition the high contribution of atmospheric deposition to the burial of black carbon in the wts wu et al 2019b also reflects the non negligible impact on the co migration of pahs fang et al 2016 the fossil fuel dominated aerosol inputs to china s marginal seas yu et al 2018 means that atmospheric deposition could input a small percentage of low 14c pahs into the coastal environment ya et al 2018 for ocean current driven inputs the long range horizontal transport of coastal organic matter driven by the mzcc also carries lower 14c contents of pahs ya et al 2018 and lower 14c contents of toc δ14c 431 29 in the inner shelf of the east china sea wu et al 2013 in contrast the much lower 14c content of phen an in the jre than in the wts fig 3 may be related to releases of petroleum and its degradation products from xiamen and zhangzhou harbors which may contribute more fossil phen a biomarker of petroleum residue fang et al 2016 conventionally diagnostic ratios of pahs have been widely used to distinguish potential sources of pahs in marine environments tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 wu et al 2011 yunker et al 2002 because of the selective degradation of pah isomers during the transport of pahs and final burials into the sediment zhang et al 2005 the degradation differences of the isomers should be fully considered to identify the sources of pahs ya et al 2017b from the jre to wts the decreased ratios of an an phen and baa baa chry and the increased ratios of fluo fluo py fig s5 were in line with their degradation half life in the environment lu et al 2005 this reflected the continuous degradation occurrence of pahs from the estuary to coasts however the decrease in the ratios of ip ip bgp contradicted the fact that ip has a longer half life than bgp tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 the unforeseen degradation degree of pah isomers is one of the most important factors that cause the uncertainty of the diagnostic ratios in source identification of pahs ya et al 2018 2020 however the source identification of pahs by csra shows its effectiveness in avoiding the uncertainties of degradation factors ya et al 2020 our previous study also emphasized the significant advantages in the quantitative source apportionment of pahs compared with other approaches e g diagnostic ratios and receptor models ya et al 2020 3 3 land sea transport of sedimentary perylene concentrations 14c contents and end member mixing models as an important terrigenous biomarker varnosfaderany et al 2014 perylene and spatial variations in its concentration and 14c content can reflect changes in terrigenous inputs from rivers to coasts varnosfaderany et al 2014 ya et al 2017b from the jre to the wts concentrations of sedimentary perylene gradually decreased from 183 to 3 6 ng g 1 dw with mean concentrations of 125 33 86 12 52 29 and 35 28 ng g 1 dw in the jre u jre d wts s and wts n respectively fig 4 a 4b and table s4 these values are comparable to those of previous studies on the estuarine inner shelf of the yangtze estuarine area 4 2 186 4 ng g 1 dw and the east china sea 7 4 141 1 ng g 1 dw with a mean of 86 3 34 7 ng g 1 dw bouloubassi fillaux and saliot 2001 hu et al 2014 furthermore perylene concentrations were proportional to the overall amount of terrigenous inputs and showed a significant decreasing trend with increasing distance from the jre to wts r 0 80 p 0 01 fig 4a a negative relationship between perylene levels and transport distances from the estuary to the coasts has also been found in previous studies jiang et al 2000 ya et al 2017b perylene was a major pah component in surface sediments from both the jre and wts table s4 compared with other unsubstituted pahs the combustion process can only produce trace or small amounts of perylene owing to its thermodynamic instability and higher reactivity bakhtiari et al 2009 grice et al 2009 jenkins et al 1996 conventionally when the percentage of perylene relative to total unsubstituted pahs is 4 and that relative to five ring pahs m z 252 is 10 the origin of perylene is usually thought to be biogenic or diagenetic varnosfaderany et al 2014 in the jre wts sedimentary system perylene represented 20 62 with a mean of 39 10 of total unsubstituted pahs and 70 93 of five ring pahs with a mean of 82 6 0 table s4 these diagnostic ratios which are far above the above mentioned thresholds reflect the predominance of biogenic or diagenetic perylene and its precursors which most likely originated from the following 1 terrigenous inputs via surface runoff hanke et al 2019 varnosfaderany et al 2014 2 in situ diagenesis of organic carbon by microbial communities in the ocean suzuki yessalina and kikuchi 2010 venkatesan 1988 and 3 petroleum from unintentional oil spills grice et al 2009 jiang et al 2000 from the perspective of radiocarbon values the measured δ14cper values decreased from 535 5 to 735 4 from the jre to the wts fig 4a and table s3 the carbon impurity corrected δ14cper values ranged from 617 to 485 and 791 to 720 in the jre and wts respectively the decreasing δ14cper and δ14c5 6 rings fig 3 accompanied by the decreasing concentrations table s4 collectively indicated a decrease in the input intensity of land based pahs or 14c dilution by in situ perylene production the 14c contents of perylene in the jre and wts were higher than those in sediment cores from northern alberta canada 873 jautzy et al 2015 and lower than those in sediment cores from siskiwit lake on isle royale michigan 296 to 199 slater et al 2013 the regional differences in δ14cper values reflect the differences in the carbon age of its precursors generation conditions and aging time to further quantitatively evaluate the sources and land sea transport intensity of surficial sedimentary perylene from the jiulong jr basin through the jre and finally to the wts we built a 14c end member mixing model of perylene in connection with geography and hydrodynamics fig 4c in the jre diagenetic products of soil derived fungi carried by fluvial erosion from the jr basin were one of the predominant sources of sedimentary perylene fig 4c we defined this source or end as terrigenous and expressed its 14c content as δ14cterr fossil fuels e g coal and crude oils grice et al 2009 jiang et al 2000 from cities especially the harbors were another predominant source of perylene in the jre fig 4c we defined this as an anthropogenic source or end caused by anthropogenic activities and its 14c content was expressed as δ14canth i e δ14cfossil these two appointed ends i e terrigenous and anthropogenic are also consistent with the biogenic or diagenetic indication deduced by the much higher ratios of perylene concentrations to total unsubstituted pah and five ring pah concentrations mentioned above based on the above description fractional contributions of the terrigenous fanth and anthropogenic fanth sources to sedimentary perylene in the jre can be expressed as fterr 1 δ14cjre per 1 δ14cterr and fanth 1 fterr respectively for the detailed calculation process please see equations 2 3 and 4 in si text s5 according to this expression we can further deduce that the mean δ14cterr value of perylene from fluvial erosion of the jr basin is larger than the δ14cper value in the jre i e δ14cterr δ14cjre per 535 fig 4c and the corresponding 14c ages is 6087 yr a previous study in a forest covered stream in the pettaquamscutt river basin rhode island also reported much lower δ14cper values of 255 to 78 hanke et al 2019 this pre aged perylene also indicates a diagenetic product of wood derived fungi in soils grice et al 2009 if we took the δ14c value of 225 for perennial trees that grew over the past 30 50 years as the upper line of the δ14cterr value mandalakis et al 2005 zencak et al 2007 the ranges of fterr from the jr basin should be 38 and the corresponding ranges of fanth should be 62 fig 4c estuarine input is an important source of perylene in offshore sediment ya et al 2017b regarding the variation of the 14c signature of perylene from the jre 535 5 to the wts 735 4 in situ 14c decay of post depositional perylene in surface sediments is not possible on the short timescales of fluvial transport huh et al 2011 there is evidence that long range alongshore transport of the mzcc plays an important role in conveying pollutants to the coastal sediments of the wts hu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 wu et al 2019b similar to the lateral movement of old sediments along the shelf judged by radioisotopic tracers santschi et al 2001 meanwhile continued generation of perylene during long range transport also occurs by microbially mediated diagenesis from precursors silliman et al 2000 therefore a combination of long range transport by the mzcc and accompanying microbially mediated in situ diageneses of perylene collectively referred to as ocean current driven inputs was another factor that affected the 14c signature of perylene in the wts based on the above discussion discharge from the jre and the ocean current driven inputs predominantly by the mzcc defined as δ14cmzcc were the two predominant sources of sedimentary perylene in the wts and can be defined as δ14cjre per and δ14cmzcc per respectively in addition we found a significant positive correlation between the perylene and toc concentrations r 0 86 p 0 01 table s5 many other studies have also observed similar relationships between the concentrations of perylene and toc and their isotopic distributions hanke et al 2019 itoh et al 2012 jiang et al 2000 which are generally attributed to the co migration characteristics of perylene and toc in estuarine coastal systems fang et al 2016 hu et al 2014 therefore the jre and mzcc are the two sources of surficial sedimentary toc and co migration perylene in the wts the measured 14c contents of toc in the jre δ14cjre toc and wts δ14cwts toc are shown in fig 3 and table s3 the 14c contents of toc in the surficial sediments of mzcc δ14cmzcc toc were reported as 431 29 wu et al 2013 based on the 14c end member mixing model of toc the calculated fractional contributions of toc and co migration perylene from the jre and mzcc defined as fjre and fmzcc fmzcc 1 fjre to the wts averaged fjre 47 8 and fmzcc 53 8 respectively fig 4c for the detailed calculation process please see equations 5 and 6 in si text s5 this fractional contribution of perylene and toc from the mzcc fmzcc 53 8 was comparable to that of black carbon 52 wu et al 2019b which is one of the most important carriers of pahs fang et al 2016 wu et al 2019b this further supports the use of perylene as a potential tracer for organic matter in marine environments zhang et al 2014 furthermore according to the 14c end member mixing model of perylene in the wts see equation 7 in si text s5 the 14c content of perylene in the mzcc δ14cmzcc per can be estimated as 919 53 fig 4c and the corresponding 14c ages should be 20 000 yr the mud belt system of the mzcc is dynamically affected by the fluvial sources of which the yangtze river is the primary source liu et al 2018 therefore the nearly 14c depleted perylene implies that sedimentary perylene from the mzcc underwent over ten thousand years of diagenesis before undergoing long range transport to the wts coast by inner shelf sediment transport processes owing to the coupled transport of coastal current driven perylene and particle organic matter the carbon age of perylene provides important geochemical information to reflect the time scale of fine grained particle movement from the yangtze river plume to the wts driven by the south westward mzcc conclusions the expanded application of csra reveals the advantages of the molecular level 14c approach in source appointment especially for indicating the land sea transport of pahs it can not only effectively avoid ambiguous pah source results of the conventional methods but can also expand the object of source appointment to a single sample and even a single pah species our results show that fossil fuels including direct input and combustion processes contributed 65 of medium high molecular weight pahs in the jre and wts sediment and that the fractional contributions of fossil fuel and biomass burning to pah species were different in addition to the accurate source identification the coherent variations of 14c contents of pah species and toc from the jre to wts confirm that the 14c signature can be used as a biogeochemical tracer of the land sea transport of pahs in estuarine coastal sedimentary systems in particular for a significant biomarker in the source allocation of terrigenous organic matter in this case perylene the 14c end member mixing model provides an effective approach to quantitatively describe the land sea transport of perylene from the basin through the estuary and finally to the coasts that are impacted by anthropogenic activities and coastal currents finally the 14c content is a useful geochemical tool for studying the transport and burial of organic pollutants in land sea interfacial sediments in the future this approach will contribute to providing more organic geochemical information regarding multiphase partitioning multimedia migration interface transport

16992,as typical chemical indicators of the anthropocene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and their environmental behavior in urban estuaries can reveal the influence of anthropogenic activities on coastal zones worldwide in contrast to conventional approaches based on concentration datasets we provide a compound specific radiocarbon 14c perspective to quantitatively evaluate the sources and land sea transport of pahs in an estuarine coastal surficial sedimentary system impacted by anthropogenic activities and coastal currents compound specific 14c of pahs and their 14c end member mixing models showed that 67 73 of fluoranthene and pyrene and 76 80 of five and six ring pahs in the jiulong river estuary jre china originated from fossil fuels e g coal oil spill and petroleum related emissions in the adjacent western taiwan strait wts the contributions of fossil fuel to these pah groups were higher at 74 79 and 84 87 respectively furthermore as a significant biomarker for source allocation of terrigenous organic matter perylene a typical five ring pah and its land sea transport from the basin through the jre and finally to the wts was quantitatively evaluated based on the 14c transport models in the jre fluvial erosions and anthropogenic emissions affected the 14c signature of perylene δ14cperylene 535 5 with contributions of 38 and 62 respectively from the jre to the wts the decreased δ14cperylene 735 4 could be attributed to the long range transport of ocean current driven perylene 919 53 with a contribution of 53 8 this compound specific 14c approach and pah

released large quantities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs into the global environment tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 causing pahs to be widely distributed in terrestrial ecosystems gregg prahl and simoneit 2015 inomata et al 2012 therefore pahs are chemical signatures that can be used to mark the onset of the anthropocene in an estuary bigus tobiszewski and namieśnik 2014 leorri et al 2014 martins et al 2011 vane et al 2011 estuarine and coastal sediments are usually regarded as sinks for terrigenous pahs where they become preserved bianchi allison and cai 2013 fontenelle et al 2019 liu et al 2021 sutilli et al 2019 the concentrations composition profiles and diagnostic ratios of sedimentary pahs and their geographical variations in estuarine coastal systems are usually examined based on the concentration monitoring approach this can provide the first insight into their origins land sea transport and relative impacts of fluvial transport wang et al 2015 wu et al 2019a however the geochemical signals based on pah concentration datasets can be modified during weathering processes in the environment due to selective losses in chemical biological reactions and thereby causing ambiguous pah source results katsoyiannis sweetman and jones 2011 ya et al 2020 zhang et al 2005 radiocarbon 14c t1 2 5730 ys data based on compound specific radiocarbon analysis csra can characterize the sources and transport of ambient pahs independent of their history regarding degradation conditions ingalls and pearson 2005 ya et al 2018 in the past twenty years an increasing amount of research has been devoted to exploring the source information in the 14c signatures of pahs bosch et al 2015 kumata et al 2006 sheesley et al 2009 tang et al 2020 zencak et al 2007 expanding the application of the 14c signature as an indicator can provide an important reference for clarifying the transport and fate of organic pollutants at the land sea interface in addition csra can also provide information based on molecular level 14c analysis to further complement or validate the traditional use of the biomarkers as biogeochemical tracers eglinton et al 1997 perylene a typical five ring pah could potentially be used for source allocation of terrigenous organic matter in aquatic sediments hanke et al 2019 jiang et al 2000 zhang et al 2014 its origin shows a markedly different historical record from anthropogenic and natural pahs resulting in a longstanding debate in geochemical research and pollutant forensics bertrand et al 2013 grice et al 2009 hanke et al 2019 jiang et al 2000 marynowski et al 2013 varnosfaderany et al 2014 venkatesan 1988 zhang et al 2014 first in contrast to other unsubstituted pahs combustion only produces trace or small amounts of perylene because of its extreme thermodynamic instability and higher reactivity bakhtiari et al 2009 grice et al 2009 jenkins et al 1996 second perylene has been identified as a diagenetic product of wood derived fungi i e terrigenous production in forest soils through isotopic tracing hanke et al 2019 silliman et al 2000 third in marine sediments perylene can be generated by microbially mediated in situ diageneses of organic carbon suzuki et al 2010 venkatesan 1988 finally fossil fuels e g coal and crude oils are also one of the sources of perylene in sediment grice et al 2009 jiang et al 2000 although the sources of perylene have largely been clarified the quantitative land sea transport processes of perylene as a typical terrestrial biomarker have not been further studied based on the above mentioned generation processes of perylene a combination of soil and fluvial erosion hanke et al 2019 varnosfaderany et al 2014 microbially mediated in situ diageneses suzuki yessalina and kikuchi 2010 venkatesan 1988 and anthropogenic inputs in particular oil and coal spills in coastal cities and harbors grice et al 2009 jiang et al 2000 are the predominant sources of perylene in estuarine coastal systems and collectively regulate the input mixing and burial of perylene therefore considering the geochemical significance of perylene in the connectivity between terrestrial and marine ecosystems hanke et al 2019 the compound specific 14c of perylene and the 14c end member mixing model can provide critical information for quantitatively evaluating the origins and land sea transport of perylene from terrestrial systems through estuaries and to adjacent coasts the iulong river estuary jre and adjacent western aiwan strait wts is a representative subtropical estuarine coastal system that is heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities and the east asian monsoon wu et al 2016 2019a therefore it can be used as a natural laboratory for studying the land sea transport of perylene and other pahs based on the expanded application of csra in this study we examined the concentrations profiles and 14c contents of sedimentary pahs as potential biogeochemical tracers to quantitatively reveal the influence of land sea interactions first we assessed the impact of the land sea interactions on the spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary pahs second as well as aiding in the source appointment of pahs the spatial 14c variations of pahs were used to track additional geochemical information such as the transport and fate of sedimentary pahs the compound specific 14c approach can help further clarify the environmental implication of pah isotopes finally based on the 14c of perylene we built a 14c end member mixing model to quantitatively evaluate the land sea transport of perylene overall this study provides a quantitative description of the origin and transport of perylene and other pahs in an estuarine coastal sedimentary system 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling surface sediments from the jre and wts were collected onboard r v haiyang 2 in may 2015 and r v yanping 2 in june 2015 respectively the sampling sites were divided into four

strained through an 80 mesh sieve after adding excessive activated copper powder 10 g of sediment was spiked with five deuterated pah surrogates and then ultrasonically extracted using n hexane acetone 1 1 v v three times after rotary evaporation the concentrated extract was purified using pretreated alumina silica gel chromatography text s1 of supporting information si finally the eluate was evaporated to 100 μl under a gentle stream of n2 gas 99 99 purity and stored at 20 c prior to instrumental analysis pahs were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms using an agilent 6890 series gc and an agilent 5973 ms detailed instrumental conditions have been described in our previous papers si text s1 ya et al 2017a 2017b the targeted compounds included 15 priority pahs designated by the us epa without naphthalene and perylene m z 252 their abbreviations are listed in table s1 sedimentary total organic carbon toc concentrations were analyzed using a vario el iii elemental analyzer the procedures are described in detail in our previous paper wu et al 2019b the reported pah and toc concentrations were based on dry weight dw 2 3 bulk sample preparation for 14c analysis to satisfy the carbon content required for δ14c measurements of pahs we combined equivalent amounts of sifted sediments from all the jre stations 680 g total sites a1 to a8 and jy0 jy3 and equivalent amounts of sediments from all the wts stations 620 g total sites xa0 x5 01 x02 and x50 x73 into two bulk samples named jre and wts the pretreatment flow diagram for the 14c measurements of the targeted pahs in the sediments is shown in fig s1 sediment samples were freeze dried and strained through an 80 mesh sieve after adding excessive activated copper powder the sediments were ultrasonically extracted with dichloromethane methanol 9 1 v v three times the extracts were combined evaporated to 10 ml and then saponified with 10 ml of a 0 5 mol l 1 koh solution in methanol water 4 1 v v for 2 h at 80 c the neutral fraction containing pahs was extracted with n hexane three times and was evaporated to 1 ml before being chromatographically separated in a glass column packed with activated silica gel activated at 500 c for 4 h and deactivated with 5 water the elution solvents were n hexane and n hexane dichloromethane 1 1 v v the n hexane dichloromethane phase containing pahs was evaporated to 1 ml cleaned by partitioning with n pentane dimethylformamide dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate mandalakis zebühr and gustafsson 2004b ya et al 2018 and reduced to 0 5 ml with a gentle stream of n2 chromatograms of the gas chromatography flame ionization detector gc fid before and after purification by n pentane dimethylformamide are shown in fig s2 after chemical purification preparative capillary gas chromatography pcgc was used to isolate and prepare the targeted pahs for csra we presented the details of the pcgc procedure in a previous paper text s2 ya et al 2018 in this study targeted pahs were initially separated using an agilent j w hp 5 ms column 60 m length 0 53 mm i d film thickness 0 25 μm and collected using a preparative fraction collector pfc the initially prepared pahs were combined and subjected to a second separation step using an agilent j w db 17 ms polar column 30 m length 0 32 mm i d film thickness 0 25 μm and were again collected by the pfc after being trapped the targeted pahs were transferred to 4 ml vials after rinsing with n pentane four times finally the samples were passed through a silica gel column to remove the column bleed a small aliquot was taken from each trap to check the purity of the targeted pahs using a gc fid equipped with a high resolution agilent j w vf 5 ms column 25 m length 0 2 mm i d film thickness 0 33 µm limited by the sample size of the individual pahs we utilized the sum of phenanthrene and anthracene phen an fluoranthene and pyrene fluo py five and six ring pahs including benzo b j k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene indeno 1 2 3 c d pyrene dibenz a h anthracene and benzo g h i perylene and perylene per as the four targeted pah groups for 14c analysis the final chromatograms of the targeted pahs from the jre and wts are shown in fig s3 δ14c analysis of toc in the surface sediments of the jre and wts was also performed at the national ocean sciences accelerator mass spectrometry nosams facility of woods hole oceanographic institute whoi the following offline combustion and graphite preparation processes for δ14c measurement were conducted at the nosams facility at whoi pearson et al 1997 briefly after catalytic oxidation of the targeted pahs and toc the generated co2 was purified and quantified in the vacuum glass line and reduced to graphite finally δ14c was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry ams at the nosams facility pearson et al 1997 the detailed procedures have been presented in shah and pearson 2007 and xu et al 2012 the reported δ14c values based on the sampling year were compared to the nbs oxalic acid i nist srm 4990 standard after normalizing the radiocarbon content of a sample to the same δ13c value 25 and year 1950 stuiver and polach 1977 2 4 quality assurance and control the analytical procedures were carefully performed to ensure quality control six laboratory blanks were measured to monitor potential contamination during sample handling in the laboratory the pah concentrations in the lab blank samples were 2 orders of magnitude lower than those in the samples based on a sample weight of 10 g dw see table s2 indicating that the background pahs from the laboratory could be largely ignored deuterated surrogate standards were used to correct for losses that occurred during the pretreatment procedures pah recoveries ranged from 60 120 with a mean of 97 19 table s2 the method detection limits mdls were calculated as the mean plus three times the standard deviation of the lab blanks rauert et al 2020 if an analyte was not detected in the blanks the concentration of a peak with a signal to noise ratio of 10 1 was inserted for mdls rauert et al 2020 the mdls of pahs ranged from 0 01 1 04 ng g 1 dw with a mean of 0 27 0 32 ng g 1 dw table s2 for the 14c analysis of bulk samples pah and external carbon contamination was avoided throughout the entire process all glassware aluminum foil and anhydrous sodium sulfate were baked at 500 c for 4 h prior to use detailed quality assurance procedures are described in our previous paper ya et al 2018 briefly the concentration of pahs in process blanks of extraction and purification procedures was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of field samples table s2 during the pcgc process deviations in retention times were strictly controlled to avoid the introduction of impure components and isotope fractionation of the targeted pahs xu et al 2012 ya et al 2018 we employed column bleed removal steps to avoid additional carbon contamination from the stationary phase the solvent n pentene used in the column bleed removal step was blown to dryness in a baked quartz tube finally the estimated purities of the isolated pahs based on the chromatogram as determined by gc fid ranged from 90 100 table s3 overall the quality assurance measures satisfied the small sample 2 µmol 14c test requirements of the nosams facility at whoi pearson et al 1997 for reference we report the carbon impurity corrected δ14c results based on the assumption that all impurities were derived from fossil or modern carbon detailed procedures and results are given in si text s3 and table s3 respectively the statistical analysis method is introduced in si text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary pahs the total concentrations of the 15 us epa designated priority pahs in surface sediments of the jre and wts ranged from 14 452 126 116 ng g 1 dw with a median concentration of 75 ng g 1 dw fig 2 and table s4 fluo ranging from 1 8 96 ng g 1 dw with median and mean concentrations of 18 and 28 26 ng g 1 dw respectively py range 1 5 101 median 12 mean 26 28 ng g 1 dw followed by phen range 5 3 50 median 12 mean 16 12 ng g 1 dw were present in the highest relative abundances with mean percent contributions to the total pahs of 22 3 6 18 4 7 and 16 6 9 respectively table s4 and fig s4 the amounts of these three pahs in the jre wts sedimentary system were higher than those in the continental shelf sediments of china fluo 8 0 py 6 4 phen 11 ng g 1 dw liu et al 2012 and the amazon coastal zone fluo 3 7 py 4 1 phen 2 9 ng g 1 dw

those found in the lenga estuary central chile and the south pacific fluo 356 py 342 phen 142 ng g 1 dw pozo et al 2011 in total sedimentary pahs in the jre and wts were at relatively low or moderate levels compared with other estuarine and coastal regions worldwide acquavita et al 2014 li et al 2021 liu et al 2012 2021 pichler et al 2021 pozo et al 2011 compared with two decades ago pah concentrations in the jre have gradually decreased and their composition has dramatically changed maskaoui et al 2002 zhang et al 2000 which partly reflects changes in energy efficiency frequent utilization of cleaning technologies and emission controls lu et al 2019 as a typical class of environmental tracers the spatial heterogeneity of surface sedimentary pahs can provide an insight into the short term influence of the river on the estuary and coast in the jre wts system pah concentrations decreased by several to ten times from the estuary to the coastal areas fig 2 and table s4 as reported in the western south atlantic upper continental margin santos et al 2020 both total and individual pah concentrations especially the predominant fluo py and phen showed significant negative correlations with the offshore distance km from the jre towards the wts p 0 01 spearman s rank table s5 pahs also showed a significant positive correlation with toc concentrations table s4 in jre wts sedimentary system p 0 01 spearman s rank this revealed that fluvial transport by hydrodynamic forces was one of the crucial driving forces of sedimentary pah distribution along with surface runoff lin et al 2013 ya et al 2018 during transport into the estuary and sea pahs are dispersed degraded and finally buried in the estuarine coastal sedimentary system liu et al 2012 wang et al 2015 in contrast to decreased concentrations the percentages of pah species were relatively constant from upstream to downstream reaches and finally to wts s with differences seen at wts n fig s4 the decreasing concentration and constant composition can partly reflect the stronger influence of jre diluted water on the southern coast of the wts than on the northern coast over the past decade the time scale can be calculated by the sampling depth of 5 cm and a mean linear sedimentation rate of 0 4 cm year 1 huh et al 2011 besides the jre long range alongshore transport of river derived materials from the yangtze river and other coastal rivers such as the qiantang ou and min rivers driven by the min zhe coastal current mzcc hu et al 2014 could be another significant factor affecting the spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary pahs in coastal wts lin et al 2013 ya et al 2018 previous studies have revealed that the mzcc can substantially affect the balance of black carbon and pah budgets of the coastal wts li et al 2016 wu et al 2019b overall the spatial heterogeneity of both pah concentrations and compositions can reflect regional differences in the intensity of land sea interactions of terrigenous pahs and also be used as auxiliary evidence from the perspective of sedimentary pahs for determining regional short term average deposition characteristics of the river plume discharging into the wts wang zheng and hu 2013 3 2 sources and transport of pahs determined by their 14c signatures the 14c signatures of individual pahs were measured to identify their sources and transport from the estuary to adjacent coasts based on the available carbon masses of the compounds table s3 δ14c measurements were performed on four groups of combined pahs phen an fluo py perylene five six ring pahs the total amounts of carbon in the corresponding pah samples available for δ14c analysis ranged from 2 1 6 0 μmol c and the purities of the isolated pah groups ranged from 90 100 table s3 overall the measured δ14c values of phen an δ14cphen an were 670 5 and 418 5 fluo py δ14cfluo py were 679 5 and 745 5 and five six ring pahs δ14c5 6 rings were 778 3 and 849 3 in the jre and wts respectively fig 3 and table s3 as a reference the carbon impurity corrected δ14c results are also listed in table s3 and shown in fig 3 the global comparison of 14c signatures of pahs in sediment can reflect the source differences of buried pahs derived from the surrounding anthropogenic activities ya et al 2020 the 14c signatures of the targeted pahs in the surface sediments of the jre wts system are comparable to those in sediment cores from siskiwit lake located on isle royale michigan 783 to 388 slater et al 2013 and in surface sediments from the waterways of the stockholm metropolitan area 934 to 585 mandalakis et al 2004a these values are much higher than those reported in sediment cores from the peace athabasca delta in the vicinity of the rapidly developing oil sand industry in northern alberta canada 962 to 849 jautzy et al 2015 and those from an urban reservoir located in the central tokyo metropolitan area japan 934 to 824 kanke et al 2004 moreover the 14c signatures of toc i e δ14ctoc were 218 and 329 in the jre and wts respectively fig 3 and table s3 which are comparable to those in the adjacent areas reported by bao et al 2016 these δ14ctoc values were also much higher than the targeted pahs in the jre and wts fig 3 this is not surprising as a higher proportion of modern carbon components was expected in the toc pool such as inputs from terrestrial higher plants li et al 2017 furthermore we estimated the fractional contributions of pahs from biomass burning c3 and c4 plants fbiomass and fossil fuels coal combustion and petroleum related emissions ffossil 1 fbiomass using a 14c end member mixing model of pahs expressed as δ14cpah δ14cbiomass fbiomass δ14cfossil 1 fbiomass jautzy et al 2015 tang et al 2020 xu et al 2012 ya et al 2018 the δ14c value of the fossil fuel end member δ14cfossil was 1000 xu et al 2012 there were at least two components of the biomass burning signature i e δ14cbiomass one was the wood burning of perennial trees with a δ14c value of 225 that grew over the past 30 50 years in an atmosphere with elevated 14c contents mandalakis et al 2005 zencak et al 2007 the second was from the burning of materials produced during the current year such as leaves and annual grass i e δ14c of contemporary co2 which had a mean value of 8 7 around xiamen city in 2014 as reported by niu et al 2016 these two components represent the maximum and minimum values of the modern end member in the environment respectively in this study we used these end members to estimate the ranges of fractional contributions of pahs from biomass burning and fossil fuels in the jre and wts table s3 according to the 14c end member mixing model the calculated fractional contributions from biomass burning of phen an fluo py and five six ring pahs were 29 35 27 33 and 20 24 respectively in the jre and 49 60 21 26 and 13 16 respectively in the wts fig 3 and table s3 this is closer to the contribution rate of biomass sources 23 to sedimentary black carbon in the east china sea wang 2020 correspondingly fossil fuel sources ffossil 1 fbiomass contributed 65 71 of phen an 67 73 of fluo py and 76 80 of five six ring pahs in the jre and 40 51 74 79 and 84 87 respectively in the wts due to the high contemporary anthropogenic activity derived emissions from surrounding cities and harbors e g industry shipping traffic and oil spills anthropogenic fossil fuel derived pahs including direct input and combustion processes of oil and coal are the predominant contributor to pahs in the jre and wts ya et al 2018 interestingly the contributions of fossil fuels to pahs in sediments were lower than the contributions of fossil fuels to pahs in the adjacent surface seawater 89 reported in our previous work ya et al 2018 in this study surface sediments top 5 cm reflected the burial of pahs over the past decade huh et al 2011 whereas the surrounding surface seawater only represented the transitory pah sources during the sampling period in our previous study therefore the discrepancy in the proportion of fossil fuel derived pahs between sediment and surface seawater indirectly reflects the gradual increase in fossil fuel consumption along with rapid urbanization chen teng and wang 2012 zhang and lin 2012 at the molecular level δ14c values showed a decreasing trend with increasing pah molecular weight phen an fluo py five six ring pahs in both the jre and wts fig 3 this reflects a decrease in biomass sourced pahs or an increase of fossil fuel derived pahs e g coal and petroleum related emissions as the molecular weight increases spatially δ14cfluo py and δ14c5 6 rings values decreased during transport from the jre to the wts which was consistent with the decreasing δ14c values of toc from 218 to 329 fig 3 because of the high sedimentation rate 0 4 cm year 1 huh et al 2011 the lower δ14c values of pahs in the surface sediments of the wts could not have been caused by in situ 14c decay during long term burial therefore we deduce that the lower 14c contents of pahs and toc along the coast compared to the estuary can be attributed to a combination of three factors 1 dilution weakening of estuarine inputs wu et al 2019a 2 atmospheric contribution fang et al 2016 wu et al 2019b yu et al 2018 and 3 ocean current driven inputs wu et al 2013 ya et al 2017a 2018 undoubtedly the decreasing pah concentrations fig 2 reflect the continued decreasing impact of the jre diluted water on the wts in addition the high contribution of atmospheric deposition to the burial of black carbon in the wts wu et al 2019b also reflects the non negligible impact on the co migration of pahs fang et al 2016 the fossil fuel dominated aerosol inputs to china s marginal seas yu et al 2018 means that atmospheric deposition could input a small percentage of low 14c pahs into the coastal environment ya et al 2018 for ocean current driven inputs the long range horizontal transport of coastal organic matter driven by the mzcc also carries lower 14c contents of pahs ya et al 2018 and lower 14c contents of toc δ14c 431 29 in the inner shelf of the east china sea wu et al 2013 in contrast the much lower 14c content of phen an in the jre than in the wts fig 3 may be related to releases of petroleum and its degradation products from xiamen and zhangzhou harbors which may contribute more fossil phen a biomarker of petroleum residue fang et al 2016 conventionally diagnostic ratios of pahs have been widely used to distinguish potential sources of pahs in marine environments tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 wu et al 2011 yunker et al 2002 because of the selective degradation of pah isomers during the transport of pahs and final burials into the sediment zhang et al 2005 the degradation differences of the isomers should be fully considered to identify the sources of pahs ya et al 2017b from the jre to wts the decreased ratios of an an phen and baa baa chry and the increased ratios of fluo fluo py fig s5 were in line with their degradation half life in the environment lu et al 2005 this reflected the continuous degradation occurrence of pahs from the estuary to coasts however the decrease in the ratios of ip ip bgp contradicted the fact that ip has a longer half life than bgp tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 the unforeseen degradation degree of pah isomers is one of the most important factors that cause the uncertainty of the diagnostic ratios in source identification of pahs ya et al 2018 2020 however the source identification of pahs by csra shows its effectiveness in avoiding the uncertainties of degradation factors ya et al 2020 our previous study also emphasized the significant advantages in the quantitative source apportionment of pahs compared with other approaches e g diagnostic ratios and receptor models ya et al 2020 3 3 land sea transport of sedimentary perylene concentrations 14c contents and end member mixing models as an important terrigenous biomarker varnosfaderany et al 2014 perylene and spatial variations in its concentration and 14c content can reflect changes in terrigenous inputs from rivers to coasts varnosfaderany et al 2014 ya et al 2017b from the jre to the wts concentrations of sedimentary perylene gradually decreased from 183 to 3 6 ng g 1 dw with mean concentrations of 125 33 86 12 52 29 and 35 28 ng g 1 dw in the jre u jre d wts s and wts n respectively fig 4 a 4b and table s4 these values are comparable to those of previous studies on the estuarine inner shelf of the yangtze estuarine area 4 2 186 4 ng g 1 dw and the east china sea 7 4 141 1 ng g 1 dw with a mean of 86 3 34 7 ng g 1 dw bouloubassi fillaux and saliot 2001 hu et al 2014 furthermore perylene concentrations were proportional to the overall amount of terrigenous inputs and showed a significant decreasing trend with increasing distance from the jre to wts r 0 80 p 0 01 fig 4a a negative relationship between perylene levels and transport distances from the estuary to the coasts has also been found in previous studies jiang et al 2000 ya et al 2017b perylene was a major pah component in surface sediments from both the jre and wts table s4 compared with other unsubstituted pahs the combustion process can only produce trace or small amounts of perylene owing to its thermodynamic instability and higher reactivity bakhtiari et al 2009 grice et al 2009 jenkins et al 1996 conventionally when the percentage of perylene relative to total unsubstituted pahs is 4 and that relative to five ring pahs m z 252 is 10 the origin of perylene is usually thought to be biogenic or diagenetic varnosfaderany et al 2014 in the jre wts sedimentary system perylene represented 20 62 with a mean of 39 10 of total unsubstituted pahs and 70 93 of five ring pahs with a mean of 82 6 0 table s4 these diagnostic ratios which are far above the above mentioned thresholds reflect the predominance of biogenic or diagenetic perylene and its precursors which most likely originated from the following 1 terrigenous inputs via surface runoff hanke et al 2019 varnosfaderany et al 2014 2 in situ diagenesis of organic carbon by microbial communities in the ocean suzuki yessalina and kikuchi 2010 venkatesan 1988 and 3 petroleum from unintentional oil spills grice et al 2009 jiang et al 2000 from the perspective of radiocarbon values the measured δ14cper values decreased from 535 5 to 735 4 from the jre to the wts fig 4a and table s3 the carbon impurity corrected δ14cper values ranged from 617 to 485 and 791 to 720 in the jre and wts respectively the decreasing δ14cper and δ14c5 6 rings fig 3 accompanied by the decreasing concentrations table s4 collectively indicated a decrease in the input intensity of land based pahs or 14c dilution by in situ perylene production the 14c contents of perylene in the jre and wts were higher than those in sediment cores from northern alberta canada 873 jautzy et al 2015 and lower than those in sediment cores from siskiwit lake on isle royale michigan 296 to 199 slater et al 2013 the regional differences in δ14cper values reflect the differences in the carbon age of its precursors generation conditions and aging time to further quantitatively evaluate the sources and land sea transport intensity of surficial sedimentary perylene from the jiulong jr basin through the jre and finally to the wts we built a 14c end member mixing model of perylene in connection with geography and hydrodynamics fig 4c in the jre diagenetic products of soil derived fungi carried by fluvial erosion from the jr basin were one of the predominant sources of sedimentary perylene fig 4c we defined this source or end as terrigenous and expressed its 14c content as δ14cterr fossil fuels e g coal and crude oils grice et al 2009 jiang et al 2000 from cities especially the harbors were another predominant source of perylene in the jre fig 4c we defined this as an anthropogenic source or end caused by anthropogenic activities and its 14c content was expressed as δ14canth i e δ14cfossil these two appointed ends i e terrigenous and anthropogenic are also consistent with the biogenic or diagenetic indication deduced by the much higher ratios of perylene concentrations to total unsubstituted pah and five ring pah concentrations mentioned above based on the above description fractional contributions of the terrigenous fanth and anthropogenic fanth sources to sedimentary perylene in the jre can be expressed as fterr 1 δ14cjre per 1 δ14cterr and fanth 1 fterr respectively for the detailed calculation process please see equations 2 3 and 4 in si text s5 according to this expression we can further deduce that the mean δ14cterr value of perylene from fluvial erosion of the jr basin is larger than the δ14cper value in the jre i e δ14cterr δ14cjre per 535 fig 4c and the corresponding 14c ages is 6087 yr a previous study in a forest covered stream in the pettaquamscutt river basin rhode island also reported much lower δ14cper values of 255 to 78 hanke et al 2019 this pre aged perylene also indicates a diagenetic product of wood derived fungi in soils grice et al 2009 if we took the δ14c value of 225 for perennial trees that grew over the past 30 50 years as the upper line of the δ14cterr value mandalakis et al 2005 zencak et al 2007 the ranges of fterr from the jr basin should be 38 and the corresponding ranges of fanth should be 62 fig 4c estuarine input is an important source of perylene in offshore sediment ya et al 2017b regarding the variation of the 14c signature of perylene from the jre 535 5 to the wts 735 4 in situ 14c decay of post depositional perylene in surface sediments is not possible on the short timescales of fluvial transport huh et al 2011 there is evidence that long range alongshore transport of the mzcc plays an important role in conveying pollutants to the coastal sediments of the wts hu et al 2014 liu et al 2018 wu et al 2019b similar to the lateral movement of old sediments along the shelf judged by radioisotopic tracers santschi et al 2001 meanwhile continued generation of perylene during long range transport also occurs by microbially mediated diagenesis from precursors silliman et al 2000 therefore a combination of long range transport by the mzcc and accompanying microbially mediated in situ diageneses of perylene collectively referred to as ocean current driven inputs was another factor that affected the 14c signature of perylene in the wts based on the above discussion discharge from the jre and the ocean current driven inputs predominantly by the mzcc defined as δ14cmzcc were the two predominant sources of sedimentary perylene in the wts and can be defined as δ14cjre per and δ14cmzcc per respectively in addition we found a significant positive correlation between the perylene and toc concentrations r 0 86 p 0 01 table s5 many other studies have also observed similar relationships between the concentrations of perylene and toc and their isotopic distributions hanke et al 2019 itoh et al 2012 jiang et al 2000 which are generally attributed to the co migration characteristics of perylene and toc in estuarine coastal systems fang et al 2016 hu et al 2014 therefore the jre and mzcc are the two sources of surficial sedimentary toc and co migration perylene in the wts the measured 14c contents of toc in the jre δ14cjre toc and wts δ14cwts toc are shown in fig 3 and table s3 the 14c contents of toc in the surficial sediments of mzcc δ14cmzcc toc were reported as 431 29 wu et al 2013 based on the 14c end member mixing model of toc the calculated fractional contributions of toc and co migration perylene from the jre and mzcc defined as fjre and fmzcc fmzcc 1 fjre to the wts averaged fjre 47 8 and fmzcc 53 8 respectively fig 4c for the detailed calculation process please see equations 5 and 6 in si text s5 this fractional contribution of perylene and toc from the mzcc fmzcc 53 8 was comparable to that of black carbon 52 wu et al 2019b which is one of the most important carriers of pahs fang et al 2016 wu et al 2019b this further supports the use of perylene as a potential tracer for organic matter in marine environments zhang et al 2014 furthermore according to the 14c end member mixing model of perylene in the wts see equation 7 in si text s5 the 14c content of perylene in the mzcc δ14cmzcc per can be estimated as 919 53 fig 4c and the corresponding 14c ages should be 20 000 yr the mud belt system of the mzcc is dynamically affected by the fluvial sources of which the yangtze river is the primary source liu et al 2018 therefore the nearly 14c depleted perylene implies that sedimentary perylene from the mzcc underwent over ten thousand years of diagenesis before undergoing long range transport to the wts coast by inner shelf sediment transport processes owing to the coupled transport of coastal current driven perylene and particle organic matter the carbon age of perylene provides important geochemical information to reflect the time scale of fine grained particle movement from the yangtze river plume to the wts driven by the south westward mzcc conclusions the expanded application of csra reveals the advantages of the molecular level 14c approach in source appointment especially for indicating the land sea transport of pahs it can not only effectively avoid ambiguous pah source results of the conventional methods but can also expand the object of source appointment to a single sample and even a single pah species our results show that fossil fuels including direct input and combustion processes contributed 65 of medium high molecular weight pahs in the jre and wts sediment and that the fractional contributions of fossil fuel and biomass burning to pah species were different in addition to the accurate source identification the coherent variations of 14c contents of pah species and toc from the jre to wts confirm that the 14c signature can be used as a biogeochemical tracer of the land sea transport of pahs in estuarine coastal sedimentary systems in particular for a significant biomarker in the source allocation of terrigenous organic matter in this case perylene the 14c end member mixing model provides an effective approach to quantitatively describe the land sea transport of perylene from the basin through the estuary and finally to the coasts that are impacted by anthropogenic activities and coastal currents finally the 14c content is a useful geochemical tool for studying the transport and burial of organic pollutants in land sea interfacial sediments in the future this approach will contribute to providing more organic geochemical information regarding multiphase partitioning multimedia migration interface transport

16993,fluoroquinolone fq antibiotics are a group of contaminants of emerging environmental concern in the present study we demonstrated that norfloxacin norf and ofloxacin oflo two typical fqs have photochemical reactivity analogous to chromophoric dissolved natural organic matter dom in surface waters and can sensitize the photodegradation of isoproturon ipu a phenylurea herbicide such photochemical reactivity is ascribed to the quinolone chromophore that is excited to a triplet state 3fq upon uv a irradiation 3fq further reacts with dissolved oxygen to give rise to singlet oxygen 3fq steady state concentrations of 6 72 10 15 and 1 27 10 15 m were measured in 10 μm norf and oflo solutions respectively under uv365nm irradiation the degradation of ipu was due to the reaction with 3fq with bimolecular rate constants of 6 07 109 and 1 51 1010 for 3norf and 3oflo respectively intriguingly norf and oflo per se were unstable and photolyzed during uv a irradiation but the photochemical reactivities of the solutions were not lost accordingly high resolution mass spectrometry analysis revealed that defluorination and piperazine moiety oxidation were the main photolysis pathways while the core quinolone structure remained intact thus the photolysis products largely inherited the photochemical reactivity of the parent compounds since all fqs share the same quinolone structure similar photochemical reactivity is expected the presence of fqs in surface water would affect the transformation and fate of coexisting compounds to the best of our knowledge this is the first study examining the environmental behavior of fqs as photosensitizers the findings greatly advance the understandings of the influence of fqs in aquatic environment graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoroquinolone photosensitizer excited triplets isoproturon 1 introduction the presence of antibiotic pharmaceuticals in the environment can induce the development and spread of antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes which has raised growing concern to the public and regulatory agencies garner et al 2018 robinson et al 2005 fluoroquinolones fqs are a family of synthetic antimicrobial agents they act by inhibition of two essential enzymes produced by bacteria topoisomerase iv and dna gyrase thus preventing the repair and replication of dna ferguson 1995 lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 mann 2005 fqs currently used in clinic include ciprofloxacin cip gemifloxacin levofloxacin moxifloxacin enrofloxacin enr norfloxacin norf ofloxacin oflo etc they all bear a common quinolone backbone with a fluorine substituted on the c6 position fqs are incompletely metabolized in bodies and excreted into wastewaters lorian 2004 he et al found that the average removal efficiency of fqs was approximately 65 in three wastewater treatment plants in maryland usa he et al 2015 fqs concentrations from 0 01 to 0 58 μg l were reported in the sewage treatment plant effluents in italy france greece and sweden andreozzi et al 2003 even higher concentrations up to 3 87 μg l were detected in hospital wastewaters in south germany by hartmann et al 1998 because of the incomplete removal in conventional wastewater treatment facilities fqs are released to the environment via wastewater discharge on a continuous basis their occurrence in surface waters was found worldwide in a wastewater effluent impacted surface water in new jersey usa 10 80 ng l cip 3 15 ng l enr and 50 900 ng l oflo were detected by gibs et al 2013 as antibacterial agents fqs are resistant to biodegradation kuemmerer et al 2000 photodegradation was found to be an important mechanism responsible for their loss in surface waters albini and monti 2003 fqs all contain a quinolone chromophore which enables the molecules to absorb uv a light efficiently cardoza et al 2005 knapp et al 2005 quantum yields of 0 013 0 043 0 0021 0 0030 and 0 0015 0 051 were reported for the photolysis of norf oflo and enr respectively under sunlight irradiation wammer et al 2013 ge et al 2010 studied the photodegradation of eight fqs under simulated sunlight finding that their half life times ranged from 15 6 to 140 9 min in pure water 19 3 to 770 7 min in freshwater and 22 5 to 1404 5 min in seawater the photolysis rates are ph dependent following the order of zwitterionic form fh anionic form f cationic form fh2 ge et al 2018 sturini et al 2010 wammer et al 2013 photodegradation of fqs was found to be a self sensitized process ge et al 2010 monti and sortino 2002 niu et al 2016 upon absorbing sunlight a fq molecule is excited to a singlet state 1 fq which immediately undergoes intersystem crossing to a triplet state 3fq formation of 3fq has been verified by laser flash photolysis in several studies monti and sortino 2002 navaratnam and claridge 2000 the photolytic degradation mainly occurs through the 3fq that undergoes defluorination dealkylation and piperazine moiety oxidation albini and monti 2003 fasani et al 1998 sukul and spiteller 2007 3fq also reacts with dissolved oxygen to generate 1o2 which in turn attacks the piperazine moiety of fqs liang et al 2015 niu et al 2016 therefore exposure of fqs to sunlight can induce the formation of a suite of reactive species such as 3fq and 1o2 they are expected to react with other organic and inorganic constituents in water especially co existing organic contaminants in other words we hypothesize that fqs can act as photosensitizers resulting in the degradation of other organic contaminants that are less prone to direct photolysis which comprises an important aspect of their environmental behavior in fact the photochemical reactivity of fqs has been well recognized in clinical biochemistry fqs increase the sensitivity of skin to the sun and may cause severe sunburn and even skin cancer on exposed areas of skin this is mainly due to the formation of 3fq and 1o2 upon light irradiation de guidi et al 2011 lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 they can react with various biotargets including dna membrane lipids and amino acids proteins resulting in phototoxic photoallergenic and even photomutagenic and phototumorigenic effects lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 for example excited 3fq with energy above a threshold value 265 269 kj mol can induce the dimerization of thymine forming cyclobutene by energy transfer from the excited sensitizer to thymine lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 guanine can be directly oxidized by both 3fq type ⅰ mechanism and 1o2 type ⅱ mechanism owing to its lowest oxidation potential among dna bases both mechanisms generate 8 oxo 7 8 dihydro 2 deoxyguanosine as the oxidation product lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 fqs can also induce the oxidation of amino acids e g tyrosine and tryptophan through type ⅰ and type ⅱ mechanisms under sunlight irradiation zhang et al 2010 the photo reactivity of fq drugs is endowed by the quinolone structure which is similar to an aromatic ketone a number of studies have demonstrated that aromatic ketone chromophores are responsible for the photochemical reactivity of dissolved natural organic matter dom mcneill and canonica 2016 zhou et al 2020 triplet energies of 3fqs were estimated to be 260 280 kj mol albini and monti 2003 which fall into the distribution of triplet energies of activated triplet dom average 250 kj mol zepp et al 1985 hence fq molecules have the potential to affect the fate and transformation of co existing contaminants in sunlit surface waters nonetheless studies in this perspective are rare though a lot of efforts have been devoted to understanding the photodegradation process of fqs per se sturini et al 2012 wammer et al 2013 wei et al 2013 in the present study photodegradation of isoproturon ipu sensitized by two typical fqs i e norf and oflo was comprehensively examined ipu is a phenylurea herbicide widely used in agriculture and detected in surface waters it is resistant to direct photolysis in surface waters gerecke et al 2001 for the first time we demonstrated that norf and oflo have photochemical reactivity analogous to chromophoric dom that can induce indirect photodegradation of ipu the findings shed light on the environmental behavior of fqs in surface waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals norf

stakpure omniatap water purification system niederahr germany 2 2 reaction setup photochemical reactions were conducted in a perfectlight discover pcx 50b multichannel photochemical reaction system beijing china this instrument has 9 channels and in each channel a cylindrical quartz vial is placed vertically above a led lamp 5 w emitting radiation at 365 nm the lamp module was rotated during the reaction to eliminate any inconsistency in the light fluence among different channels the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 25 c by an integrated cooling system the photon flux of each reaction channel was measured to be 9 19 10 8 einstein cm 2 s 1 using p nitroanisole pyridine as the actinometer dulin and mill 1982 a total of 50 ml reaction solution containing 10 µm ipu and an individual fq norf or oflo 10 µm was poured into a quartz vial and irradiated for comparison parallel treatments spiked with 2 5 mm tba or tmp or with nitrogen gas purging were run concurrently no buffer was added because buffer salts can alter the lifetimes of triplet excited states mcneill and canonica 2016 the ph of solutions was measured to be 6 2 the fluctuation was within 0 1 unit during the reaction at pre set time intervals 0 5 ml reaction solution was collected from each vial filtered through 0 45 µm pvdf membrane kept in a 4 c refrigerator and analyzed within 24 h all the treatments were prepared in duplicates a control with ipu only was run concurrently photodegradation of norf and oflo in the absence of ipu was also performed the initial fq concentration was 10 µm at every 1 h during an 8 h period 5 ml sample was withdrawn for the measurement of absorbance spectrum using a varian cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer santa clara usa in addition 10 µm ipu was spiked into each fq solution already subjected to 8 h irradiation the degradation of ipu was monitored in the following 6 h outdoor experiments were performed on the roof of resources environmental science building at nanjing agricultural university 32 2 6 25 n and 118 50 23 47 e in august 2020 the reaction solutions consisting of an individual fq norf or oflo 10 µm and ipu 10 µm were placed in 100 ml conical flasks sealed with teflon tape for natural sunlight irradiation between 9 00 to 16 00 at every 1 h 1 ml solution was withdrawn from each conical flask to measure the residual ipu the pre treatment of samples was same as above 2 3 measurement of the steady state concentrations of excited triplet state fqs the steady state concentrations of excited triplet state fq 3fq were determined following the method by zhou et al 2017 and chen et al 2020 assume r f 3 f q m s 1 and r d i p u are the formation rate of 3fq and the decay rate of ipu respectively and no direct photolysis of ipu occurs upon uv365nm radiation considering the competition for 3fq between ipu and the other deactivation processes k q and applying the steady state approximation to 3fq the decay rate of ipu can be expressed as follow 1 r d i p u r f 3 f q k i p u 3 f q i p u k i p u 3 f q i p u k q where k i p u 3 f q m 1s 1 is the second order rate constant for the reaction between 3fq and ipu and i p u is the concentration of ipu using r d i p u k o b s i p u i p u and rearranging eq 1 yield the following linear equation 2 1 k obs ipu i p u r f 3 f q k q r f 3 f q k i p u 3 f q where k q is the pseudo first order rate constant for deactivation of 3fq other than reacting with ipu including unimolecular attenuation k d by both radiative and nonradiative pathways self quenching k s e l f and quenching by dissolved oxygen k o 2 the values for different fqs have been measured using laser flash photolysis and documented in several papers zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 the k d values were estimated to be 2 1 105 and 3 2 105 s 1 for norf zhang et al 2010 and oflo zhao et al 2016 respectively k s e l f is the second order rate constant of the triplet state quenched by the ground state which were chosen as 4 108 m 1s 1 and 6 72 108 m 1s 1 for norf zhang et al 2010 and oflo zhao et al 2016 respectively the o2 concentration was approximately 250 μm under the reaction conditions and the rate constants for the o2 dependent deactivation pathway given by k o 2 o 2 were 7 105 and 7 5 105 s 1 for norf zhang et al 2010 and oflo zhao et al 2016 respectively thus the k q values for norf and oflo were calculated as 9 14 105 and 1 08 106 s 1 respectively according to eq 3 3 k q k d k s e l f f q k o 2 o 2 plotting 1 k obs ipu against i p u and by derivation of slope and y intercept r f 3 f q and k i p u 3 f q can be determined the steady state concentrations of 3 f q are determined by the following equation 4 3 f q r f 3 f q k q the triplet quantum yields of fqs are calculated by eq 5 where r a is the rate of light absorption by an individual fq 5 φ r f 3 f q r a r f 3 f q and 3 f q s s at 4 different fq concentrations i e 1 2 5 5 and 10 μm were measured solutions of norf or oflo amended with ipu were photolyzed in the photoreactor the decay of ipu was monitored over a period of 2 h 2 4 analytical methods norf oflo and ipu in the samples were quantified using a shimadzu lc 20 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc kyoto japan equipped with a diode array detector dad the separation was performed in an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 reverse phase column 4 6 250 mm 5 µm the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile water v v 50 50 with 0 1 formic acid the flow rate was 1 ml min the detection wavelengths were 279 nm for norf 294 nm for oflo 242 nm for ipu respectively concentrations of the analytes were determined by 5 points external calibration curves to determine the transformation products of fqs and ipu samples 100 ml after reaction were passed through waters oasis hlb cartridges 60 mg 3cc preconditioned with methanol after rinsing with 10 ml water and allowing to dry under vacuum for 20 min the cartridges were eluted with 2 ml methanol the samples thus obtained were analyzed using an ab sciex foster city ca usa high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer hrms triple tof 5600 at positive electron spray ionization esi and full

80 v and collision energy 10 v 3 results and discussion 3 1 fqs sensitized photodegradation of ipu several studies have demonstrated that ipu is resistant to direct photolysis under sunlight gerecke et al 2001 in accordance with previous studies no appreciable attenuation of ipu was observed after exposure to uv365nm irradiation fig 1 however significant removal of ipu was found upon irradiation in the presence of norf or oflo fig 1 indicating that the fqs served as photosensitizers leading to the degradation of ipu similar results were obtained in outdoor experiments with natural sunlight irradiation performed on nau campus in mid summer of 2020 figure s1 linear regression of ln c c0 vs time showed that the photosensitized degradation of ipu followed pseudo first order kinetics the rate constants k o b s half life times t1 2 and r2 values at varying conditions are tabulated in table 1 oflo appeared more efficient than norf as a photosensitizer the pseudo first order rate constants for the removal of ipu in the presence of 10 μm oflo or norf were determined to be 0 103 and 0 086 h 1 respectively which are approximately half of those of dom sensitized photolysis 0 272 h 1 in a natural lake water under simulated sunlight reported by zeng and arnold 2013 some studies have shown that the photo reactivity of fqs arises from the quinolone chromophore which can be excited upon absorbing a photon and gives rise to a suite of reactive species such as oh 1o2 etc liang et al 2015 niu et al 2016 oh reacts with ipu rapidly at a bimolecular rate constant of 6 70 109 m 1s 1 zeng and arnold 2013 in this study however the contribution of oh can be excluded because the degradation of ipu was not affected by the presence of tba an effective oh quencher fig 1 both laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated that phenylurea herbicides are prone to indirect photochemical degradation induced by excited triplet dom 3dom which comprises a major transformation pathway of this type of herbicides in sunlit surface waters canonica et al 2006b gerecke et al 2001 it is also well recognized that the photochemical reactivity of dom primarily arises from the aromatic ketone chromophores that are excited to form a reactive triplet state upon uv a irradiation leenheer et al 1987 mcneill and canonica 2016 fluoroquinolone molecules share a common quinolone backbone which is extensively conjugated and essentially an aromatic ketone thus we suppose that norf and oflo sensitized the photolysis of ipu through a mechanism analogous to chromophoric dom i e they were excited to a reactive triplet state 3fq upon uv irradiation and the removal of ipu was ascribed to the reaction with 3fq to test this hypothesis an experiment was performed in the presence of tmp as a quencher of excited triplets of aromatic ketones canonica et al 2000 golanoski et al 2012 it turned out that the degradation of ipu was almost completely suppressed fig 1 which strongly indicates that excited 3fq was formed and responsible for the removal of ipu fig 1 also shows that the degradation of ipu was significantly enhanced in deoxygenated water with nitrogen gas purging the k o b s values increased by 76 5 and 99 3 for norf and oflo respectively table 1 similar observation was reported for dom or aromatic ketones e g benzophenone bp sensitized photodegradation of ipu canonica et al 2006b gerecke et al 2001 this serves as an additional evidence that 3fq played a key role in ipu degradation because 3fq rapidly reacts with dissolved oxygen to form 1o2 liang et al 2015 niu et al 2016 while ipu was inert to 1o2 text s1 figure s2 zeng and arnold 2013 the photochemical reactivity of the quinolone moiety was further verified by examining the photochemical reactivities of different sub moieties of the fq molecules the structure of fqs consists of a piperazine ring and a fluorine substituted quinolone flu is basically the core quinolone moiety of fqs figure s4 fpp only contains the fluorobenzene ring and the piperazine moiety figure s4 from the uv vis spectra figure s5 flu shares a similar absorbance band centered at 340 nm with fqs while fpp has no absorbance in the uv a range at all absorbing light is a premise for a photochemical reaction to occur as illustrated in figure s6 flu could sensitize photodegradation of ipu although the reaction rate was lower k o b s 0 063 h 1 than those by norf or oflo in contrast no ipu removal was found in the presence of fpp all the data clearly indicate that the photochemical reactivity of fqs is derived from the quinolone moiety 3 2 characterization of 3fq like chromophoric dom a fq molecule is presumed to be excited after absorbing a photon to a high energy singlet state 1fq which immediately undergoes intersystem crossing and yields a relatively stable 3fq lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 monti and sortino 2002 navaratnam and claridge 2000 the steady state concentrations of 3fq 3 f q s s were determined by assuming unimolecular attenuation k d self quenching k s e l f and quenching by dissolved oxygen k o 2 as the main deactivation pathways of 3fq other than reaction with ipu as described in the method as illustrated in table 2 a positive relationship can be seen between 3 f q s s and the concentration of norf and oflo 3 f q s s of 8 23 10 16 and 5 32 10 16 m were measured for norf and oflo respectively at concentration of 1 µm the respective values increased to 6 72 10 15 and 1 27 10 15 m when the fqs increased to 10 µm for comparison 3dom steady state concentrations are between 10 13 and 10 16 m under noon time clear summer sky conditions in surface waters chen et al 2020 erickson et al 2018 grebel et al 2011 zhou et al 2017 such concentrations levels 10 18 10 9 m of photon generated reactive species in natural waters are considered sufficient to initiate photodegradation of contaminants zafiriou et al 1984 zeng and arnold 2013 accordingly the quantum yields φ were calculated to be 0 0079 and 0 0016 for norf and oflo respectively the values are comparable to those of 3dom 0 0068 0 0096 documented in literature zhou et al 2017 the second order rate constants for reactions of ipu with 3fq were determined as 6 07 109 m 1s 1 for norf and 1 51 1010 m 1s 1 for oflo table 2 these values are also comparable to those of the oxidation of ipu by 3dom 9 60 109 m 1s 1 zeng and arnold 2013 and triplet state bp 3 20 109 m 1s 1 canonica et al 2006b 3dom reacts with ipu by electron transfer zeng and arnold 2013 similarly ipu is presumed to be oxidized by 3fq triplet energies of 3norf and 3oflo were reported as 269 and 262 kj mol table 2 lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 respectively the values are above the average of 3dom 250 kj mol zepp et al 1985 triplet state reduction potential is the sum of the ground state potential and the excited state energy divided by faraday constant 96 485 kj v mcneill and canonica 2016 e 3 s s e s s e t f the reduction potentials of the excited triplets are calculated to be 1 47 and 1 54 v respectively for 3norf and 3oflo table 2 which are slightly lower than the value of triplet bp 1 66 v mcneill and canonica 2016 a typical proxy of dom that can also sensitize the degradation of ipu the reduction potential of 3norf and 3oflo are higher than the reported redox potential of ipu 1 36 v arnold 2014 thus the oxidation of ipu by 3fq sensitizers is thermodynamically allowed 3 3 photochemical reactivities of the photolysis products of norf and oflo fqs per se are not stable under uv a irradiation which represents an important mechanism of their attenuation in sunlit surface waters and has been reported in several studies sturini et al 2012 wammer et al 2013 wei et al 2013 in this study norf and oflo were also degraded along with the degradation of ipu with less than 20 remaining after 6 h inserts in fig 1 nonetheless the degradation of ipu appeared to be little affected by the loss of norf or oflo the virtual pseudo first order degradation of ipu implies that the steady state concentrations of key reactive species i e 3fq remained relatively stable despite the degradation of norf or oflo this can only be explained by assuming that the degradation products of norf and oflo were still photochemically reactive and could still sensitize the degradation of ipu in other words the photochemical reactivities of the parent fqs were not eliminated with their degradation the photochemical reactivity of the photolysis products of fqs was further evidenced by the photodegradation of ipu spiked to the norf or oflo solution already subjected to 365 nm irradiation for 8 h where more than 85 of the norf or oflo was removed as shown in figure s3 ipu was still effectively degraded with first order rate constants that were approximately half of those found in the systems without pre irradiation 0 059 and 0 095 h 1 for norf and oflo respectively obviously such high photochemical reactivity could not be explained by the residual norf or oflo some of their degradation products must inherit the photochemical reactivities of the parent compounds fig 2 shows the time dependent evolution of uv spectra of norf and oflo solutions during 365 nm irradiation it is evident that the absorbance band located at 330 400 nm especially the absorbance at 365 nm was not completely removed after 8 h the band at 330 340 nm corresponds to the n π transition characteristic of aromatic ketones schwarzenbach et al 2003 hence the quinolone chromophores of norf or oflo were not destroyed by 365 nm irradiation completely the photodegradation products of norf and oflo were concentrated by spe and analyzed by hrms a total of 8 degradation products for norf and 11 degradation products for oflo were identified their structures are proposed and listed in table 3 according to the molecular formulas determined by accurate masses and previous reported degradation products baena nogueras et al 2017 niu et al 2016 it can be found that defluorination and oxidation cleavage of the piperazine moiety were the main transformation routes while the core quinolone structure remained intact photolytic defluorination of fqs has been repeatedly observed in previous studies and believed to be characteristic to the photodegradation of fqs fasani et al 1999 fasani et al 1998 a c f bond is extremely strong and usually not readily broken however the c f bond in a fq is dramatically weakened when the molecule is excited to a triplet state upon irradiation with the bond energy decreasing from approximately 120 kcal mol at the ground state to only 69 kcal mol fasani et al 1999 substitution of the f with an oh group yielded the product n1 m z 318 for norf the defluorination of oflo yielded the products o1 m z 360 and o2 m z 344 the other pathway was the oxidative degradation on the piperazine ring that was relatively electron rich the amine n atoms containing lone pair electrons were readily oxidized giving rise to a series of oxygenated and ring opening intermediates and finally the cleavage of the entire piperazine moiety forming primary amine products n5 m z 251 for norf and o11 m z 279 for oflo the identified fqs photoproducts agreed well with previous studies on the photolytic degradation of fqs baena nogueras et al 2017 niu et al 2016 note that the quinolone structure was preserved in almost all these intermediates products thus these products probably inherited the photochemical reactivities of the parent compounds only one product with the quinolone structure destroyed m z 238 was found during norf photodegradation similar products were not found for oflo according to the evolution profile based on hplc ms peak areas of the products figure s8 the degradation pathways are depicted in fig 3 3 4 degradation pathways of ipu the main products of ipu photolysis sensitized by norf and oflo were also identified by hrms table s1 hydroxylation on the aromatic ring n alkyl oxidation n dealkylation and dimerization are proposed as the major transformation pathways fig 4 like 3dom 3fq could promote oxidation on the aromatic ring yielding a hydroxylated product m z 223 alternatively the oxidation could occur at one of the n methyl groups converting it to an aldehyde m z 221 which cleaved subsequently to produce the n dealkylation product m z 193 this is possible because 3fq could promote hydrogen or alkyl abstraction from ipu through homolytic cleavage of c h or c c bonds canonica et al 2006a canonica et al 1995 gerecke et al 2001 3fq also cleaved the urea group giving rise to 4 isopropylaniline m z 136 which coupled to each other subsequently to form a dimerized product m z 267 the formation of the dimerized product suggests the formation of anilino radical which involves electron transfer reaction all these identified products and pathways have been found during the photodegradation of ipu sensitized by dom or aromatic ketones which further corroborates the argument that norf and oflo have similar photochemical reactivity as chromophoric dom in surface waters fabbri et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that norf and oflo possess photochemical reactivity analogous to chromophoric dom that can sensitize the degradation of coexisting pollutants such as ipu such photochemical reactivity is attributed to the quinolone chromophore which also makes norf and oflo susceptible to photodegradation however during the photodegradation of norf and oflo the core quinolone structure is preserved the products largely inherit the photochemical reactivity of the parent compounds we assume that other fqs possess similar photochemical reactivity since they all share a same quinolone chromophore therefore once they enter surface waters fq molecules are expected to generate a series of reactive species such as triplet fqs 1o2 oh etc thus affecting the transformation and fate of other organic and inorganic constituents in water such influence would last even though the fqs are photodegraded thus pollutants susceptible to chromophoric dom sensitized photooxidation will also be degraded due to the presence of fqs and their photo transformation products many emerging contaminants fall into this category such as steroid estrogens bearing phenolic functionality sulfonamides tetracyclines etc boreen et al 2005 canonica et al 1995 hua et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 their transformation in surface waters would be accelerated due to the co existence of fqs it should be noted that such an influence should not be overestimated given the concentrations of fqs are usually orders of magnitude lower than that of chromophoric dom in typical water environment however these reactions comprise an important aspect of the environmental behavior of fqs in aquatic environment and deserve further exploration in addition one can take the advantage of the high concentrations of fqs in certain pharmaceutical wastewaters to design sunlight photodegradation as a pretreatment strategy before biodegradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16993,fluoroquinolone fq antibiotics are a group of contaminants of emerging environmental concern in the present study we demonstrated that norfloxacin norf and ofloxacin oflo two typical fqs have photochemical reactivity analogous to chromophoric dissolved natural organic matter dom in surface waters and can sensitize the photodegradation of isoproturon ipu a phenylurea herbicide such photochemical reactivity is ascribed to the quinolone chromophore that is excited to a triplet state 3fq upon uv a irradiation 3fq further reacts with dissolved oxygen to give rise to singlet oxygen 3fq steady state concentrations of 6 72 10 15 and 1 27 10 15 m were measured in 10 μm norf and oflo solutions respectively under uv365nm irradiation the degradation of ipu was due to the reaction with 3fq with bimolecular rate constants of 6 07 109 and 1 51 1010 for 3norf and 3oflo respectively intriguingly norf and oflo per se were unstable and photolyzed during uv a irradiation but the photochemical reactivities of the solutions were not lost accordingly high resolution mass spectrometry analysis revealed that defluorination and piperazine moiety oxidation were the main photolysis pathways while the core quinolone structure remained intact thus the photolysis products largely inherited the photochemical reactivity of the parent compounds since all fqs share the same quinolone structure similar photochemical reactivity is expected the presence of fqs in surface water would affect the transformation and fate of coexisting compounds to the best of our knowledge this is the first study examining the environmental behavior of fqs as photosensitizers the findings greatly advance the understandings of the influence of fqs in aquatic environment graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoroquinolone photosensitizer excited triplets isoproturon 1 introduction the presence of antibiotic pharmaceuticals in the environment can induce the development and spread of antibiotic resistance bacteria and genes which has raised growing concern to the public and regulatory agencies garner et al 2018 robinson et al 2005 fluoroquinolones fqs are a family of synthetic antimicrobial agents they act by inhibition of two essential enzymes produced by bacteria topoisomerase iv and dna gyrase thus preventing the repair and replication of dna ferguson 1995 lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 mann 2005 fqs currently used in clinic include ciprofloxacin cip gemifloxacin levofloxacin moxifloxacin enrofloxacin enr norfloxacin norf ofloxacin oflo etc they all bear a common quinolone backbone with a fluorine substituted on the c6 position fqs are incompletely metabolized in bodies and excreted into wastewaters lorian 2004 he et al found that the average removal efficiency of fqs was approximately 65 in three wastewater treatment plants in maryland usa he et al 2015 fqs concentrations from 0 01 to 0 58 μg l were reported in the sewage treatment plant effluents in italy france greece and sweden andreozzi et al 2003 even higher concentrations up to 3 87 μg l were detected in hospital wastewaters in south germany by hartmann et al 1998 because of the incomplete removal in conventional wastewater treatment facilities fqs are released to the environment via wastewater discharge on a continuous basis their occurrence in surface waters was found worldwide in a wastewater effluent impacted surface water in new jersey usa 10 80 ng l cip 3 15 ng l enr and 50 900 ng l oflo were detected by gibs et al 2013 as antibacterial agents fqs are resistant to biodegradation kuemmerer et al 2000 photodegradation was found to be an important mechanism responsible for their loss in surface waters albini and monti 2003 fqs all contain a quinolone chromophore which enables the molecules to absorb uv a light efficiently cardoza et al 2005 knapp et al 2005 quantum yields of 0 013 0 043 0 0021 0 0030 and 0 0015 0 051 were reported for the photolysis of norf oflo and enr respectively under sunlight irradiation wammer et al 2013 ge et al 2010 studied the photodegradation of eight fqs under simulated sunlight finding that their half life times ranged from 15 6 to 140 9 min in pure water 19 3 to 770 7 min in freshwater and 22 5 to 1404 5 min in seawater the photolysis rates are ph dependent following the order of zwitterionic form fh anionic form f cationic form fh2 ge et al 2018 sturini et al 2010 wammer et al 2013 photodegradation of fqs was found to be a self sensitized process ge et al 2010 monti and sortino 2002 niu et al 2016 upon absorbing sunlight a fq molecule is excited to a singlet state 1 fq which immediately undergoes intersystem crossing to a triplet state 3fq formation of 3fq has been verified by laser flash photolysis in several studies monti and sortino 2002 navaratnam and claridge 2000 the photolytic degradation mainly occurs through the 3fq that undergoes defluorination dealkylation and piperazine moiety oxidation albini and monti 2003 fasani et al 1998 sukul and spiteller 2007 3fq also reacts with dissolved oxygen to generate 1o2 which in turn attacks the piperazine moiety of fqs liang et al 2015 niu et al 2016 therefore exposure of fqs to sunlight can induce the formation of a suite of reactive species such as 3fq and 1o2 they are expected to react with other organic and inorganic constituents in water especially co existing organic contaminants in other words we hypothesize that fqs can act as photosensitizers resulting in the degradation of other organic contaminants that are less prone to direct photolysis which comprises an important aspect of their environmental behavior in fact the photochemical reactivity of fqs has been well recognized in clinical biochemistry fqs increase the sensitivity of skin to the sun and may cause severe sunburn and even skin cancer on exposed areas of skin this is mainly due to the formation of 3fq and 1o2 upon light irradiation de guidi et al 2011 lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 zhang et al 2010 they can react with various biotargets including dna membrane lipids and amino acids proteins resulting in phototoxic photoallergenic and even photomutagenic and phototumorigenic effects lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 zhang et al 2010 for example excited 3fq with energy above a threshold value 265 269 kj mol can induce the dimerization of thymine forming cyclobutene by energy transfer from the excited sensitizer to thymine lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 guanine can be directly oxidized by both 3fq type ⅰ mechanism and 1o2 type ⅱ mechanism owing to its lowest oxidation potential among dna bases both mechanisms generate 8 oxo 7 8 dihydro 2 deoxyguanosine as the oxidation product lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 fqs can also induce the oxidation of amino acids e g tyrosine and tryptophan through type ⅰ and type ⅱ mechanisms under sunlight irradiation zhang et al 2010 the photo reactivity of fq drugs is endowed by the quinolone structure which is similar to an aromatic ketone a number of studies have demonstrated that aromatic ketone chromophores are responsible for the photochemical reactivity of dissolved natural organic matter dom mcneill and canonica 2016 zhou et al 2020 triplet energies of 3fqs were estimated to be 260 280 kj mol albini and monti 2003 which fall into the distribution of triplet energies of activated triplet dom average 250 kj mol zepp et al 1985 hence fq molecules have the potential to affect the fate and transformation of co existing contaminants in sunlit surface waters nonetheless studies in this perspective are rare though a lot of efforts have been devoted to understanding the photodegradation process of fqs per se sturini et al 2012 wammer et al 2013 wei et al 2013 in the present study photodegradation of isoproturon ipu sensitized by two typical fqs i e norf and oflo was comprehensively examined ipu is a phenylurea herbicide widely used in agriculture and detected in surface waters it is resistant to direct photolysis in surface waters gerecke et al 2001 for the first time we demonstrated that norf and oflo have photochemical reactivity analogous to chromophoric dom that can induce indirect photodegradation of ipu the findings shed light on the environmental behavior of fqs in surface waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals norf

beijing china this instrument has 9 channels and in each channel a cylindrical quartz vial is placed vertically above a led lamp 5 w emitting radiation at 365 nm the lamp module was rotated during the reaction to eliminate any inconsistency in the light fluence among different channels the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 25 c by an integrated cooling system the photon flux of each reaction channel was measured to be 9 19 10 8 einstein cm 2 s 1 using p nitroanisole pyridine as the actinometer dulin and mill 1982 a total of 50 ml reaction solution containing 10 µm ipu and an individual fq norf or oflo 10 µm was poured into a quartz vial and irradiated for comparison parallel treatments spiked with 2 5 mm tba or tmp or with nitrogen gas purging were run concurrently no buffer was added because buffer salts can alter the lifetimes of triplet excited states mcneill and canonica 2016 the ph of solutions was measured to be 6 2 the fluctuation was within 0 1 unit during the reaction at pre set time intervals 0 5 ml reaction solution was collected from each vial filtered through 0 45 µm pvdf membrane kept in a 4 c refrigerator and analyzed within 24 h all the treatments were prepared in duplicates a control with ipu only was run concurrently photodegradation of norf and oflo in the absence of ipu was also performed the initial fq concentration was 10 µm at every 1 h during an 8 h period 5 ml sample was withdrawn for the measurement of absorbance spectrum using a varian cary 50 uv vis spectrophotometer santa clara usa in addition 10 µm ipu was spiked into each fq solution already subjected to 8 h irradiation the degradation of ipu was monitored in the following 6 h outdoor experiments were performed on the roof of resources environmental science

conical flasks sealed with teflon tape for natural sunlight irradiation between 9 00 to 16 00 at every 1 h 1 ml solution was withdrawn from each conical flask to measure the residual ipu the pre treatment of samples was same as above 2 3 measurement of the steady state concentrations of excited triplet state fqs the steady state concentrations of excited triplet state fq 3fq were determined following the method by zhou et al 2017 and chen et al 2020 assume r f 3 f q m s 1 and r d i p u are the formation rate of 3fq and the decay rate of ipu respectively and no direct photolysis of ipu occurs upon uv365nm radiation considering the competition for 3fq between ipu and the other deactivation processes k q and applying the steady state approximation to 3fq the decay rate of ipu can be expressed as follow 1 r d i p u r f 3 f q k i p u 3 f q i p u k i p u 3 f q i p u k q where k i p u 3 f q m 1s 1 is the second order rate constant for the reaction between 3fq and ipu and i p u is the concentration of ipu using r d i p u k o b s i p u i p u and rearranging eq 1 yield the following linear equation 2 1 k obs ipu i p u r f 3 f q k q r f 3 f q k i p u 3 f q where k q is the pseudo first order rate constant for deactivation of 3fq other than reacting with ipu including unimolecular attenuation k d by both radiative and nonradiative pathways self quenching k s e l f and quenching by dissolved oxygen k o 2 the values for different fqs have been measured using laser flash photolysis and documented in several papers zhang et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 the k d values were estimated to be 2 1 105 and 3 2 105 s 1 for norf zhang et al 2010 and oflo zhao et al 2016 respectively k s e l f is the second order rate constant of the triplet state quenched by the ground state which were chosen as 4 108 m 1s 1 and 6 72 108 m 1s 1 for norf zhang et al 2010 and oflo zhao et al 2016 respectively the o2 concentration was approximately 250 μm under the reaction conditions and the rate constants for the o2 dependent deactivation pathway given by k o 2 o 2 were 7 105 and 7 5 105 s 1 for norf zhang et al 2010 and oflo zhao et al 2016 respectively thus the k q values for norf and oflo were calculated as 9 14 105 and 1 08 106 s 1 respectively according to eq 3 3 k q k d k s e l f f q k o 2 o 2 plotting 1 k obs ipu against i p u and by derivation of slope and y intercept r f 3 f q and k i p u 3 f q can be determined the steady state concentrations of 3 f q are determined by the following equation 4 3 f q r f 3 f q k q the triplet quantum yields of fqs are calculated by eq 5 where r a is the rate of light absorption by an individual fq 5 φ r f 3 f q r a r f 3 f q and 3 f q s s at 4 different fq concentrations i e 1 2 5 5 and 10 μm were measured solutions of norf or oflo amended with ipu were photolyzed in the photoreactor the decay of ipu was monitored over a period of 2 h 2 4 analytical methods norf oflo and ipu in the samples were quantified using a shimadzu lc 20

the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile water v v 50 50 with 0 1 formic acid the flow rate was 1 ml min the detection wavelengths were 279 nm for norf 294 nm for oflo 242 nm for ipu respectively concentrations of the analytes were determined by 5 points external calibration curves to determine the transformation products of fqs and ipu samples 100 ml after reaction were passed through waters

et al 2001 in accordance with previous studies no appreciable attenuation of ipu was observed after exposure to uv365nm irradiation fig 1 however significant removal of ipu was found upon irradiation in the presence of norf or oflo fig 1 indicating that the fqs served as photosensitizers leading to the degradation of ipu similar results were obtained in outdoor experiments with natural sunlight irradiation performed on nau campus in mid summer of 2020 figure s1 linear regression of ln c c0 vs time showed that the photosensitized degradation of ipu followed pseudo first order kinetics the rate constants k o b s half life times t1 2 and r2 values at varying conditions are tabulated in table 1 oflo appeared more efficient than norf as a photosensitizer the pseudo first order rate constants for the removal of ipu in the presence of 10 μm oflo or norf were determined to be 0 103 and 0 086 h 1 respectively which are approximately half of those of dom sensitized photolysis 0 272 h 1 in a natural lake water under simulated sunlight reported by zeng and arnold 2013 some studies have shown that the photo reactivity of fqs arises from the quinolone chromophore which can be excited upon absorbing a photon and gives rise to a suite of reactive species such as oh 1o2 etc liang et al 2015 niu et al 2016 oh reacts with ipu rapidly at a bimolecular rate constant of 6 70 109 m 1s 1 zeng and arnold 2013 in this study however the contribution of oh can be excluded because the degradation of ipu was not affected by the presence of tba an effective oh quencher fig 1 both laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated that phenylurea herbicides are prone to indirect photochemical degradation induced by excited triplet dom 3dom which comprises a major transformation pathway of this type of herbicides in sunlit surface waters canonica et al 2006b gerecke et al 2001 it is also well recognized that the photochemical reactivity of dom primarily arises from the aromatic ketone chromophores that are excited to form a reactive triplet state upon uv a irradiation leenheer et al 1987 mcneill and canonica 2016 fluoroquinolone molecules share a common quinolone backbone which is extensively conjugated and essentially an aromatic ketone thus we suppose that norf and oflo sensitized the photolysis of ipu through a mechanism analogous to chromophoric dom i e they were excited to a reactive triplet state 3fq upon uv irradiation and the removal of ipu was ascribed to the reaction with 3fq to test this hypothesis an experiment was performed in the presence of tmp as a quencher of excited triplets of aromatic ketones canonica et al 2000 golanoski et al 2012 it turned out that the degradation of ipu was almost completely suppressed fig 1 which strongly indicates that excited 3fq was formed and responsible for the removal of ipu fig 1 also shows that the degradation of ipu was significantly enhanced in deoxygenated water with nitrogen gas purging the k o b s values increased by 76 5 and 99 3 for norf and oflo respectively table 1 similar observation was reported for dom or aromatic ketones e g benzophenone bp sensitized photodegradation of ipu canonica et al 2006b gerecke et al 2001 this serves as an additional evidence that 3fq played a key role in ipu degradation because 3fq rapidly reacts with dissolved oxygen to form 1o2 liang et al 2015 niu et al 2016 while ipu was inert to 1o2 text s1 figure s2 zeng and arnold 2013 the photochemical reactivity of the quinolone moiety was further verified by examining the photochemical reactivities of different sub moieties of the fq molecules the structure of fqs consists of a piperazine ring and a fluorine substituted quinolone flu is basically the core quinolone moiety of fqs figure s4 fpp only contains the fluorobenzene ring and the piperazine moiety figure s4 from the uv vis spectra figure s5 flu shares a similar absorbance band centered at 340 nm with fqs while fpp has no absorbance in the uv a range at all absorbing light is a premise for a photochemical reaction to occur as illustrated in figure s6 flu could sensitize photodegradation of ipu although the reaction rate was lower k o b s 0 063 h 1 than those by norf or oflo in contrast no ipu removal was found in the presence of fpp all the data clearly indicate that the photochemical reactivity of fqs is derived from the quinolone moiety 3 2 characterization of 3fq like chromophoric dom a fq molecule is presumed to be excited after absorbing a photon to a high energy singlet state 1fq which immediately undergoes intersystem crossing and yields a relatively stable 3fq lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 monti and sortino 2002 navaratnam and claridge 2000 the steady state concentrations of 3fq 3 f q s s were determined by assuming unimolecular attenuation k d self quenching k s e l f and quenching by dissolved oxygen k o 2 as the main deactivation pathways of 3fq other than reaction with ipu as described in the method as illustrated in table 2 a positive relationship can be seen between 3 f q s s and the concentration of norf and oflo 3 f q s s of 8 23 10 16 and 5 32 10 16 m were measured for norf and oflo respectively at concentration of 1 µm the respective values increased to 6 72 10 15 and 1 27 10 15 m when the fqs increased to 10 µm for comparison 3dom steady state concentrations are between 10 13 and 10 16 m under noon time clear summer sky conditions in surface waters chen et al 2020 erickson et al 2018 grebel et al 2011 zhou et al 2017 such concentrations levels 10 18 10 9 m of photon generated reactive species in natural waters are considered sufficient to initiate photodegradation of contaminants zafiriou et al 1984 zeng and arnold 2013 accordingly the quantum yields φ were calculated to be 0 0079 and 0 0016 for norf and oflo respectively the values are comparable to those of 3dom 0 0068 0 0096 documented in literature zhou et al 2017 the second order rate constants for reactions of ipu with 3fq were determined as 6 07 109 m 1s 1 for norf and 1 51 1010 m 1s 1 for oflo table 2 these values are also comparable to those of the oxidation of ipu by 3dom 9 60 109 m 1s 1 zeng and arnold 2013 and triplet state bp 3 20 109 m 1s 1 canonica et al 2006b 3dom reacts with ipu by electron transfer zeng and arnold 2013 similarly ipu is presumed to be oxidized by 3fq triplet energies of 3norf and 3oflo were reported as 269 and 262 kj mol table 2 lhiaubet vallet et al 2009 lhiaubet vallet et al 2007 respectively the values are above the average of 3dom 250 kj mol zepp et al 1985 triplet state reduction potential is the sum of the ground state potential and the excited state energy divided by faraday constant 96 485 kj v mcneill and canonica 2016 e 3 s s e s s e t f the reduction potentials of the excited triplets are calculated to be 1 47 and 1 54 v respectively for 3norf and 3oflo table 2 which are slightly lower than the value of triplet bp 1 66 v mcneill and canonica 2016 a typical proxy of dom that can also sensitize the degradation of ipu the reduction potential of 3norf and 3oflo are higher than the reported redox potential of ipu 1 36 v arnold 2014 thus the oxidation of ipu by 3fq sensitizers is thermodynamically allowed 3 3 photochemical reactivities of the photolysis products of norf and oflo fqs per se are not stable under uv a irradiation which represents an important mechanism of their attenuation in sunlit surface waters and has been reported in several studies sturini et al 2012 wammer et al 2013 wei et al 2013 in this study norf and oflo were also degraded along with the degradation of ipu with less than 20 remaining after 6 h inserts in fig 1 nonetheless the degradation of ipu appeared to be little affected by the loss of norf or oflo the virtual pseudo first order degradation of ipu implies that the steady state concentrations of key reactive species i e 3fq remained relatively stable despite the degradation of norf or oflo this can only be explained by assuming that the degradation products of norf and oflo were still photochemically reactive and could still sensitize the degradation of ipu in other words the photochemical reactivities of the parent fqs were not eliminated with their degradation the photochemical reactivity of the photolysis products of fqs was further evidenced by the photodegradation of ipu spiked to the norf or oflo solution already subjected to 365 nm irradiation for 8 h where more than 85 of the norf or oflo was removed as shown in figure s3 ipu was still effectively degraded with first order rate constants that were approximately half of those found in the systems without pre irradiation 0 059 and 0 095 h 1 for norf and oflo respectively obviously such high photochemical reactivity could not be explained by the residual norf or oflo some of their degradation products must inherit the photochemical reactivities of the parent compounds fig 2 shows the time dependent evolution of uv spectra of norf and oflo solutions during 365 nm irradiation it is evident that the absorbance band located at 330 400 nm especially the absorbance at 365 nm was not completely removed after 8 h the band at 330 340 nm corresponds to the n π transition characteristic of aromatic ketones schwarzenbach et al 2003 hence the quinolone chromophores of norf or oflo were not destroyed by 365 nm irradiation completely the photodegradation products of norf and oflo were concentrated by spe and analyzed by hrms a total of 8 degradation products for norf and 11 degradation products for oflo were identified their structures are proposed and listed in table 3 according to the molecular formulas determined by accurate masses and previous reported degradation products baena nogueras et al 2017 niu et al 2016 it can be found that defluorination and oxidation cleavage of the piperazine moiety were the main transformation routes while the core quinolone structure remained intact photolytic defluorination of fqs has been repeatedly observed in previous studies and believed to be characteristic to the photodegradation of fqs fasani et al 1999 fasani et al 1998 a c f bond is extremely strong and usually not readily broken however the c f bond in a fq is dramatically weakened when the molecule is excited to a triplet state upon irradiation with the bond energy decreasing from approximately 120 kcal mol at the ground state to only 69 kcal mol fasani et al 1999 substitution of the f with an oh group yielded the product n1 m z 318 for norf the defluorination of oflo yielded the products o1 m z 360 and o2 m z 344 the other pathway was the oxidative degradation on the piperazine ring that was relatively electron rich the amine n atoms containing lone pair electrons were readily oxidized giving rise to a series of oxygenated and ring opening intermediates and finally the cleavage of the entire piperazine moiety forming primary amine products n5 m z 251 for norf and o11 m z 279 for oflo the identified fqs photoproducts agreed well with previous studies on the photolytic degradation of fqs baena nogueras et al 2017 niu et al 2016 note that the quinolone structure was preserved in almost all these intermediates products thus these products probably inherited the photochemical reactivities of the parent compounds only one product with the quinolone structure destroyed m z 238 was found during norf photodegradation similar products were not found for oflo according to the evolution profile based on hplc ms peak areas of the products figure s8 the degradation pathways are depicted in fig 3 3 4 degradation pathways of ipu the main products of ipu photolysis sensitized by norf and oflo were also identified by hrms table s1 hydroxylation on the aromatic ring n alkyl oxidation n dealkylation and dimerization are proposed as the major transformation pathways fig 4 like 3dom 3fq could promote oxidation on the aromatic ring yielding a hydroxylated product m z 223 alternatively the oxidation could occur at one of the n methyl groups converting it to an aldehyde m z 221 which cleaved subsequently to produce the n dealkylation product m z 193 this is possible because 3fq could promote hydrogen or alkyl abstraction from ipu through homolytic cleavage of c h or c c bonds canonica et al 2006a canonica et al 1995 gerecke et al 2001 3fq also cleaved the urea group giving rise to 4 isopropylaniline m z 136 which coupled to each other subsequently to form a dimerized product m z 267 the formation of the dimerized product suggests the formation of anilino radical which involves electron transfer reaction all these identified products and pathways have been found during the photodegradation of ipu sensitized by dom or aromatic ketones which further corroborates the argument that norf and oflo have similar photochemical reactivity as chromophoric dom in surface waters fabbri et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that norf and oflo possess photochemical reactivity analogous to chromophoric dom that can sensitize the degradation of coexisting pollutants such as ipu such photochemical reactivity is attributed to the quinolone chromophore which also makes norf and oflo susceptible to photodegradation however during the photodegradation of norf and oflo the core quinolone structure is preserved the products largely inherit the photochemical reactivity of the parent compounds we assume that other fqs possess similar photochemical reactivity since they all share a same quinolone chromophore therefore once they enter surface waters fq molecules are expected to generate a series of reactive species such as triplet fqs 1o2 oh etc thus affecting the transformation and fate of other organic and inorganic constituents in water such influence would last even though the fqs are photodegraded thus pollutants susceptible to chromophoric dom sensitized photooxidation will also be degraded due to the presence of fqs and their photo transformation products many emerging contaminants fall into this category such as steroid estrogens bearing phenolic functionality sulfonamides tetracyclines etc boreen et al 2005 canonica et al 1995 hua et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 their transformation in surface waters would be accelerated due to the co existence of fqs it should be noted that such an influence should not be overestimated given the concentrations of fqs are usually orders of magnitude lower than that of chromophoric dom in typical water environment however these reactions comprise an important aspect of the environmental behavior of fqs in aquatic environment and deserve further exploration in addition one can take the advantage of the high concentrations of fqs in certain pharmaceutical wastewaters to design sunlight photodegradation as a pretreatment strategy before biodegradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16994,intensified sanitization practices during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 led to the release of chlorine based disinfectants in surface water potentially triggering the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in the presence of dissolved organic nitrogen don thus a comprehensive investigation of don s spatial distribution and its association with dbp occurrence in the surface water is urgently needed in this study a total of 51 water samples were collected from two rivers and four lakes in may 2020 in wuhan to explore the regional variation of nitrogen n species don s compositional characteristics and the three classes of dbp occurrence in lakes 53 0 to 86 3 of n existed as don with its concentration varying between 0 3 4 0 mg n l in contrast no3 n was the dominant

dom this fraction comprises easily decomposable mineralizable nitrogen n which provides available substrates for microbial utilization wang et al 2018 as the available pool of n don has a rapid turnover and plays a vital role in the n cycle don is ubiquitous in surface water typical don concentration in surface water lies in the range of 0 02 10 0 mg n l with a mean of approximately 0 3 mg n l seitzinger and sanders 1997 westerhoff and mash 2002 xu et al 2010 yao et al 2020 excessive don can lead to eutrophication and acidification yao et al 2020 furthermore when surface water is treated for drinking purposes don can react with chlorinated disinfectants to form disinfection byproducts dbps gu et al 2011 mazhar et al 2020 the presence of don in surface water will proliferate the formation potential of dbps posing a considerable threat to human health population growth and large scale anthropogenic activities have increased the discharge of exogenous don such as chemical fertilizer animal and human excrement sewage and litter amount in surface water rivers and lakes chen et al 2019 hu et al 2016 considerable variations are expected in the amount and compositional characteristics of don in surface water due to diverse sources although the concentration of don has been reported in a few surface water bodies data on the spatial variation of don at a regional scale are still limited besides identification of the chemical components of don is challenging owing to its extremely complicated structural composition as is well known determining the composition and structure of don is the characterization of dom with a particular focus on the n fraction he et al 2015 hu et al 2020 multiple technologies are often used in conjunction to analyze the compositional structure of dom zhang et al 2020c specific ultraviolet visible uv vis adsorption spectrum is widely used as an index to reflect the aromatic content of dom he et al 2011 hudson et al 2008 li et al 2000 recent studies have demonstrated the use of three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem to observe the fluorescence peaks of dom carstea et al 2019 maqbool et al 2020 the fluorescence peaks represent five typical fluorophores including tyrosine like tryptophan like fulvic acid like soluble microbial product like and humic acid like wuhan a metropolitan is the capital of the hubei province with a population of 11 2 million fu et al 2020 this city is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river specifically at the convergence point of the yangtze river and its largest tributary the han river in wuhan the centralized surface water for drinking is mainly procured from the yangtze river the han river and some lakes which is crucial for human survival however rapid urbanization poses a significant risk to the quality of water in these pristine water bodies the recent outbreak of the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 covid 19 has proliferated the use of chlorine based disinfectants for eliminating pathogenic microorganisms in contaminated environments e g hospitals sewage disposal plants throughout wuhan city zhang et al 2020a residual disinfectants might enter natural water bodies and facilitate dbp formation depending upon the availability of don most research articles before the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic indicated that dbps could not be detected in surface water recently li et al 2021 reported the presence of dbps in surface water after the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic discussing the effects of disinfected water including wastewater effluents and tap water on dbps occurrence nevertheless the occurrence of dbps in surface water in the presence of don after the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic is still unclear to investigate don contamination in surface waters and its correlation with dbp occurrence influenced by the covid 19 pandemic typical surface water bodies two rivers and four lakes of wuhan city were selected our primary objective is to 1 characterize the spatial and compositional variation of don in surface water resources in wuhan 2 investigate the occurrence of dbps in surface waters during the covid 19 pandemic 3 explore the relationship between don concentration properties and dbp occurrence 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is located in wuhan city hubei province in central china 29 58 n 31 22 n 113 41 e 115 05 e fig 1 the yangtze river catchment of wuhan city with one main tributary han river is the most important river with an annual water supply of 8 4 108 m3 out of the hundreds of lakes in this city four lakes tangxun lake east lakes hou lake and liangzi lake were selected for further assessment tangxun lake and east lake are the largest and second largest urban lakes in china with water areas of 47 6 and 33 0 km2 hou lake and liangzi lake are located in the northwest and southeast of wuhan city the study area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with four distinct seasons the mean annual temperature is 15 8 17 5 with 40 of total rainfall occurring during the rainy season from june to august 2 2 sample collection and preparation water samples were collected from 51 sampling sites located in two rivers the yangtze river catchment of wuhan and han river and four lakes tangxun lake dong lake liangzi lake and hou lake in may 2020 fig 2 we ensured that the sampling points covered the entire study area the yangtze river and han river contained a total of 10 and 6 sampling locations respectively the number of sampling sites in tangxun lake dong lakes liangzi lake and hou lake was 10 8 11 and 6 respectively the samples were packed in amber glass bottles without allowing any headspace and refrigerated immediately later the samples were brought back to the laboratory filtered using whatman nylon membrane filters pore size of 0 2 μm 47 mm diameter germany and stored at 4 for subsequent analysis 2 3 analytical methods ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and turbidity of the samples were measured in situ using a multi parameter monitor hq40d

the concentration of each dbps below the method detection limit mdl was treated as zero to avoid incorrect conclusion and bias the results were reported as the mean and the standard deviation computed from three replicates statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 26 0 software package for windows 10 the significance of the differences among the distinct water bodies was ascertained using the analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to identify the relationships among the levels of dbps don related indices and physicochemical characteristics for this study a correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0 7 r 0 7 was defined as a strong correlation correlation coefficient values between 0 4 and 0 7 0 4 r 0 7 were considered moderately strong and below 0 4 r 0 4 were considered weak haldar et al 2020 principal component analysis pca was also performed to provide a rough overview of the reduced dimensions of parameters and sample clustering using origin 2021 the differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variation of water quality in wuhan surface water resources the physical and chemical properties of water samples collected from two rivers and four lakes including ph ec do turbidity cod doc tocl tobr and n species were summarized in table s1 and fig 3 3 1 1 basic physiochemical indexes the results indicated different levels of variation in water quality among different water resources a significant variation was demonstrated by statistical analysis anova p 0 05 for ph ec turbidity cod doc tocl and tobr most water quality parameters in lakes exhibited significantly higher levels than in rivers for example the results showed that doc concentrations were 1 5 4 4 mg l in rivers and 1 5 9 8 mg l in lakes respectively average doc concentrations in different surface water resources were in the order hou lake tangxun lake east lake liangzi lake han river yangtze river yangtze river had the lowest doc concentrations 1 5 3 3 mg l while hou lake had the highest doc values 3 4 9 8 mg l among all water resources generally the lakes in this study were characterized by higher ec turbidity cod doc and tocl values indicating that their water quality was worse than rivers this could be mainly attributed to discharge from different pollutant sources such as rainfall surface runoff overuse of fertilizers sewage and domestic effluents hu et al 2016 maqbool et al 2020 to further identify primary sources of spatial variability in water quality pca of the water quality parameters was performed fig 4 detailed information about pollutants was summarized in table s2 s6 as shown in fig 4 the different types of water samples showed distinct clusters with the two principal components accounting for 62 7 of the variances rivers and lakes clustered in different quadrants due to their distinct pollutant sources pc1 explained 42 3 of the total variance with strong positive loadings of don cod and nh4 tangxun lake and hou lake exhibited higher values on the pc1 axes which can be associated to large discharges of sewage and industrial waste directly unloaded into lakes especially in hou lake table s5 the direct discharge of domestic sewage and dumping of animal and industrial waste in the nearby areas were the major pollutant sources due to the poor drainage pipe network pc2 explained 20 4 of the variance and had high positive loadings of do no3 n and no2 n rivers showed higher values on the pc2 axes which was probably due to the application of organic and inorganic n fertilizers into rivers table s2 also showed that the amount of nh4 and cod from agricultural runoff was higher than from other sources 3 1 2 spatial variation of n species the different predominant n forms don no3 n nh4 n no2 n in surface water resources were analyzed in this study fig 3 don no3 n nh4 n and no2 n concentrations varied from 0 to 4 0 0 to 1 4 0 06 to 0 5 and 0 to 0 02 mg n l exhibiting a substantial spatial variation in distinct water resources and a slight change in the same water resource the tn content of the rivers and lakes varied between 0 9 to 2 0 and 0 4 to 4 6 mg n l respectively the ranking order of the average tn concentrations of the six surface water resources was hou lake tangxun lake yangtze river liangzi lake han river east lake based on the results of pca the primary source of pollution in rivers was agricultural runoff while the primary sources of pollution in lakes were domestic sewage and industrial discharge notably hou lake had the highest tn concentrations among the six surface water resources direct discharge of domestic sewage and dumping of animal and industrial waste in nearby areas was responsible for introducing a large quantity of n containing pollutants table s5 site hh 3 in hou lake had the maximum tn concentration which was significantly higher than other sampling sites it was probably related to nearby industrial and residential activities yang et al 2009 which released a large amount of domestic sewage and aquaculture waste into the hou lake the n species differed significantly between rivers and lakes for both rivers and lakes don and no3 n were the most dominant n species that accounted for 0 to 86 2 and 0 to 93 6 of the tn respectively the no3 n content in rivers varied from 0 4 to 1 4 mg n l and the proportion to tn ranged from 30 0 to 93 6 which were much higher than in lakes the results indicate that no3 n was the most significant component of tn in rivers chen et al 2019 also reported that dissolved inorganic n was the dominant n form in many rivers and its amount was strongly linked to n input on land e g the use of synthetic n fertilizer manure n input human excreta n discharge biological fixation atmospheric deposition in spring the primary source of n input in the yangtze river was the synthetic n fertilizer which might contain a lot of no3 n chen et al 2019 besides higher do values in rivers were observed in this study the nitrification could be highly promoted in rivers because of sufficient do supply facilitating no3 n production yabusaki et al 2017 the don concentrations in lakes were in the range of 0 3 4 0 mg n l which was higher don than in rivers moreover don accounted for 53 0 86 2 of the tn in all lakes implying that don was the dominant n form in these water bodies excessive don in the surface water resources may deteriorate water quality in several ways on the one hand don under oxic conditions can be further be transformed into no3 n aggravating no3 n contamination in aquatic systems de vera et al 2017 in this study the measured do values in lakes varied from 9 0 to 10 8 mg l nitrification could occur in lakes because of sufficient do supply facilitating no3 n contamination yabusaki et al 2017 on the other hand as n enriched dom don is regarded as the precursor for dbp formation gu et al 2011 high don content in lakes may increase dbp formation potential and threaten water quality 3 2 characteristics of n enriched dom investigated using spectral technologies the chemical properties of don can affect its bioavailability and transformation in aquatic ecosystems carstea et al 2019 to clarify the relationship between don components and dbps understanding the composition of don is essential as is well known don is the nitrogenous fraction of dom the structural and compositional characteristics of don should be highly related to dom a254 and a253 a203 are crucial parameters to characterize the aromaticity of dom li et al 2014b a higher a254 value indicates higher aromatic content in dom conversely a lower a254 value indicates lower aromaticity with more hydrophilic compounds a higher a253 a203 ratio reflects that the substitution groups contain more aromatic rings in this study a254 and a253 a203 were analyzed and illustrated in fig 5 the results showed that the a254 and a253 a203 ranged from 0 0 1 and 0 0 3 respectively a significant difference was observed in the a254 and a253 a203 values of rivers and lakes in general the rivers had lower a254 and a253 a203 values compared to lakes it indicated that don in rivers with lower contents was made of more hydrophilic compounds in contrast don in lakes with higher content contained more aromatic substances the a254 values and a253 a203 ratios in the hou lake and tangxun lake were higher than those in east lake and liangzi lake differences in the anthropogenic discharge into the lakes could explain the differences in the aromaticity levels of dom lorite herrera et al 2009 nai et al 2020 notably the values of a254 and a253 a203 at different sampling sites in the same water resource were nearly similar it demonstrated that don in the same water resource had similar constituents according to the results mentioned above the contents and constitutes of don in the same water resource did not differ significantly thus we chose the sampling station with the highest don content in each water resource to characterize the 3d eem spectra fig 6 according to excitation and emission wavelength boundaries the 3d eem spectra were divided into five areas jacquin et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b in summary peaks at shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and shorter excitation wavelengths 250 nm were attributed to region i and region ii pi and pii indicating simple aromatic protein like substances such as tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances peaks at shorter excitation wavelengths 250 nm and longer emission wavelengths 380 nm were related to region iii piii representing fulvic acid like compounds peaks in region iv piv indicating soluble microbial product like substances occurred at shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and longer excitation 250 nm peaks of region v pv characterized by longer emission wavelengths 380 nm and longer excitation wavelengths 250 nm indicated humic acid like compounds the percent distribution of the five regions for don based on the fluorescence peak characteristics has been presented in table 1 don in wuhan surface water resources mainly comprised protein like and fulvic acid like substances with fewer soluble microbial product like and humic acid like compounds reflected by its high pi ii iv of 57 7 75 1 this suggested that microorganisms efficiently utilized the dominant component of don in wuhan s surface water resources notably tangxun lake and hou lake had higher piii v than others in addition piii v pi ii iv ratios of don and suva254 were also calculated to reflect the humification degree table 1 the piii v pi ii iv ratios were 0 6 and 0 7 in tangxun lake and hou lake which were higher than those in other water resources the results illustrated that these two lakes had a higher humification degree of don with higher contents of the humic and fulvic materials this result was in agreement with the a254 and a253 a203 results reported in the study additionally the suva254 values of rivers and lakes varied from 0 3 to 1 6 l mg m and 1 0 to 1 7 l mg m respectively overall the suva254 values for don in different surface water resources were significantly lower than 3 0 l mg m illustrating that don in the surface water mainly comprised hydrophilic substances zhang et al 2020c 3 3 comparision of the levels of dbps in wuhan surface waters before and after the covid 19 pandemic due to the observation of don in surface waters we speculated that the extensive use of disinfectants during the covid 19 pandemic might lead to the increased production of dbps thus the sampling site with the highest don content in each water resource was selected to investigate the distribution of dbps fig 7 showed the three typical speciations of dbps in different surface water resources the concentrations of thms hans and n nitrosamines varied from 0 5 to 6 8 μg l average 2 2 μg l 0 to 0 1 μg l average 0 02 μg l 23 1 to 97 4 ng l average 60 8 ng l respectively thms hans and n nitrosamines contributed up to 90 0 98 5 0 1 8 and 1 0 10 0 to the total dbps thms were the most abundant dbps followed by n nitrosamines and hans dbcm average 1 2 μg l and tcm average 1 0 μg l were the key thms species while tcan average 0 02 μg l was the dominant hans species in this study ndma average 25 8 ng l accounting for 10 4 83 8 was the dominant species among the seven measured n nitrosamines china regulates the levels of some of the dbps in centralized surface water resources for instance the regulatory standards for tcm and tbm are 60 and 100 μg l respectively zhou et al 2019 in this study tcm and tbm concentrations complied with the standards even after the covid 19 pandemic notably most countries including china have not developed guidelines to limit dbps in surface water kristiana et al 2017 until now the levels of dbps in drinking water have garnered attention while their occurrence in natural water bodies has been assumed to be insignificant the current understanding of the dbp distribution in china s surface water is highly inadequate to address this knowledge gap we gathered the observation data on the concentrations of dbps in surface water in china from published reports table s7 data from previous research showed that dbp concentrations in surface water remained steady at a very low level before the covid 19 pandemic the levels of most dbps after the covid 19 pandemic were within the range of data previously reported while some dbps were higher than the reported data for example previous studies showed that the total nitrosamines concentration in rivers was in the range of 1 6 62 4 ng l a recent study reported that the mean concentration of n nitrosamines in the surface water was 29 2 ng l after covid 19 which was not higher than the reported data li et al 2021 in contrast the concentration of n nitrosamines varied from 23 1 to 97 4 ng l in the current study increased levels of n nitrosamines may be associated with the elevated use of disinfectants during the covid 19 pandemic increased n nitrosamines could come from two sources 1 wastewater treatment plant effluents and industrial domestic wastewaters containing n nitrosamines may directly be discharged into the surface water wang et al 2016 2 n nitrosamines could be generated when the surface water received residual chlorine although most dbps did not increase significantly in surface water after the covid 19 pandemic their potential health risks in surface water can not be overlooked 3 4 relationship between don related indices and the occurrence of dbps in order to elucidate the effects of compositional characteristics of don on dbp formation the relationships among don related indices doc don a203 a253 a254 a253 a203 suva254 piii v pi ii iv pi pii piii piv and pv primary water quality parameters tocl and tobr and different types of dbp contents were determined fig 8 spearman s rank correlation illustrated that tocl was strongly positively correlated with some n nitrosamines including ndpa and ndpha r 0 7 p 0 05 r 0 7 p 0 05 suggesting that tocl participated in oxidation reactions in the presence of don beita sandí et al 2020 some n nitrosamines ndea showed significantly positive correlations with don r 0 8 p 0 05 suggesting that higher don contents generated higher amounts of ndea this result demonstrated that don served as a crucial ndea precursor which agreed with reported studies chang et al 2013 hua et al 2020 with regard to optical properties suva254 exhibited strong negative correlations with total n nitrosamines and some specific species of n nitrosamines including npip ndpa and ndba r 0 7 p 0 05 r 0 7 p 0 05 r 0 8 p 0 05 r 0 8 p 0 05 the results implied that hydrophilic substances with low suva254 values could be precursors for npip ndpa ndba or total n nitrosamines further thms showed a significant positive with pv humic acid like components r 0 7 p 0 05 indicating that the humidified don was a dominant thms precursor unexpectedly total n nitrosamines had no significant relationship with don but had a strong positive correlation with pⅱ protein like substances r 0 9 p 0 05 this suggested that don fraction containing more protein like components favored the formation of n nitrosamines krasner et al 2013 has proposed that amine precursor is the dominant mechanism responsible for the formation of nitrosamines for protein like fraction amines carboxylic and aliphatic structures are considered as basic fluorescent units chen et al 2015 li et al 2014a liu et al 2017 in this study the amines structures in the protein like components may serve as n nitrosamines precursors overall the key factor influencing the occurrence of thms in surface water was humificated don on the other hand amines in don played a vital role in forming n nitrosamines some don components exhibited significant relationships with dbps and can serve as effective indicators to track dbp formation it was worth noting that no significant association was detected between some dbps and don components in the present study this may be because of the following two reasons 1 some dbps in surface water might have been directly discharged from sewage treatment plants 2 the physical conditions e g ph temperature ionic strength in surface water environment may influence the dbp formation undoubtedly covid 19 will have a long lasting impact on the environment highlighting the need for new research perspectives and policy needs this study confirmed that the presence of don in surface water could result in dbp formation especially n nitrosamines when disinfectants were discharged into surface water during the covid 19 pandemic this study highlights that don contamination in surface water indeed increased dbp formation threatening water quality routine assessment of surface water quality should include don and dbps as the necessary parameters especially for formulating effective policies during covid 19 4 conclusion during the covid 19 pandemic the use of chlorine based disinfectants was elevated for eliminating pathogens in contaminated environments residual disinfectants may enter natural water bodies and facilitate dbp formation depending on the availability of don results showed that a significant correlation between don components and dbps highlighting that don can serve as effective indicators to track dbp formation humificated don was a crucial precursor for thms formation while the amines structures in don played a vital role in forming n nitrosamines this study highlights that don contamination in surface water indeed increased dbp formation threatening water quality routine assessment of surface water quality should include don and dbps as the necessary parameters especially for formulating

16994,intensified sanitization practices during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 led to the release of chlorine based disinfectants in surface water potentially triggering the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps in the presence of dissolved organic nitrogen don thus a comprehensive investigation of don s spatial distribution and its association with dbp occurrence in the surface water is urgently needed in this study a total of 51 water samples were collected from two rivers and four lakes in may 2020 in wuhan to explore the regional variation of nitrogen n species don s compositional characteristics and the three classes of dbp occurrence in lakes 53 0 to 86 3 of n existed as don with its concentration varying between 0 3 4 0 mg n l in contrast no3 n was the dominant n species in rivers spectral analysis revealed that don in the lakes contained higher humic and fulvic materials with higher a254 a253 a203 suva254 and piii iv pi ii v ratios while rivers had higher levels of hydrophilic compounds trihalomethanes thms were the most prevalent dbps in the surface waters followed by n nitrosamines and haloacetonitriles hans the levels of n nitrosamines 23 1 97 4 ng l increased significantly after the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic excessive don in the surface waters was responsible for the formation of n nitrosamines this study confirmed that the presence of

dom this fraction comprises easily decomposable mineralizable nitrogen n which provides available substrates for microbial utilization wang et al 2018 as the available pool of n don has a rapid turnover and plays a vital role in the n cycle don is ubiquitous in surface water typical don concentration in surface water lies in the range of 0 02 10 0 mg n l with a mean of approximately 0 3 mg n l seitzinger and sanders 1997 westerhoff and mash 2002 xu et al 2010 yao et al 2020 excessive don can lead to eutrophication and acidification yao et al 2020 furthermore when surface water is treated for drinking purposes don can react with chlorinated disinfectants to form disinfection byproducts dbps gu et al 2011 mazhar et al 2020 the presence of don in surface water will proliferate the formation potential of dbps posing a considerable threat to human health population growth and large scale anthropogenic activities have increased the discharge of exogenous don such as chemical fertilizer animal and human excrement sewage and litter amount in surface water rivers and lakes chen et al 2019 hu et al 2016 considerable variations are expected in the amount and compositional characteristics of don in surface water due to diverse sources although the concentration of don has been reported in a few surface water bodies data on the spatial variation of don at a regional scale are still limited besides identification of the chemical components of don is challenging owing to its extremely complicated structural composition as is well known determining the composition and structure of don is the characterization of dom with a particular focus on the n fraction he et al 2015 hu et al 2020 multiple technologies are often used in conjunction to analyze the compositional structure of dom zhang et al 2020c specific ultraviolet visible uv vis adsorption spectrum is widely used as an index to reflect the aromatic content of dom he et al 2011 hudson et al 2008 li et al 2000 recent studies have demonstrated the use of three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem to observe the fluorescence peaks of dom carstea et al 2019 maqbool et al 2020 the fluorescence peaks represent five typical fluorophores including tyrosine like tryptophan like fulvic acid like soluble microbial product like and humic acid like wuhan a metropolitan is the capital of the hubei province with a population of 11 2 million fu et al 2020 this city is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river specifically at the convergence point of the yangtze river and its largest tributary the han river in wuhan the centralized surface water for drinking is mainly procured from the yangtze river the han river and some lakes which is crucial for human survival however rapid urbanization poses a significant risk to the quality of water in these pristine water bodies the recent outbreak of the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 covid 19 has proliferated the use of chlorine based disinfectants for eliminating pathogenic microorganisms in contaminated environments e g hospitals sewage disposal plants throughout wuhan city zhang et al 2020a residual disinfectants might enter natural water bodies and facilitate dbp formation depending upon the availability of don most research articles before the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic indicated that dbps could not be detected in surface water recently li et al 2021 reported the presence of dbps in surface water after the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic discussing the effects of disinfected water including wastewater effluents and tap water on dbps occurrence nevertheless the occurrence of dbps in surface water in the presence of don after the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic is still unclear to investigate don contamination in surface waters and its correlation with dbp occurrence influenced by the covid 19 pandemic typical surface water bodies two rivers and four lakes of wuhan city were selected our primary objective is to 1 characterize the spatial and compositional variation of don in surface water resources in wuhan 2 investigate the occurrence of dbps in surface waters during the covid 19 pandemic 3 explore the relationship between don concentration properties and dbp occurrence 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study area is located in wuhan city hubei province in central china 29 58 n 31 22 n 113 41 e 115 05 e fig 1 the yangtze river catchment of wuhan city with one main tributary han river is the most important river with an annual water supply of 8 4 108 m3 out of the hundreds of lakes in this city four lakes tangxun lake east lakes hou lake and liangzi lake were selected for further assessment tangxun lake and east lake are the largest and second largest urban lakes in china with water areas of 47 6 and 33 0 km2 hou lake and liangzi lake are located in the northwest and southeast of wuhan city the study area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate with four distinct seasons the mean annual temperature is 15 8 17 5 with 40 of total rainfall occurring during the rainy season from june to august 2 2 sample collection and preparation water samples were collected from 51 sampling sites located in two rivers the yangtze river catchment of wuhan and han river and four lakes tangxun lake dong lake liangzi lake and hou lake in may 2020 fig 2 we ensured that the sampling points covered the entire study area the yangtze river and han river contained a total of 10 and 6 sampling locations respectively the number of sampling sites in tangxun lake dong lakes liangzi lake and hou lake was 10 8 11 and 6 respectively the samples were packed in amber glass bottles without allowing any headspace and refrigerated immediately later the samples were brought back to the laboratory filtered using whatman nylon membrane filters pore size of 0 2 μm 47 mm diameter germany and stored at 4 for subsequent analysis 2 3 analytical methods ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and turbidity of the samples were measured in situ using a multi parameter monitor hq40d hach usa and a turbidimeter 2100n hach usa respectively chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by reflux digestion with potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 and excess k2cr2o7 was titrated against ferrous ammonium sulfate li et al 2018 dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed using a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan total organic chlorine tocl and total organic bromide tobr were identified using a precombustion station aqf 2100h mitsubishi chemical analytech japan with an ion chromatography ics 5000 dionex usa ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total nitrogen tn were quantified using nessler s reagent spectrophotometry and the potassium persulfate digestion ultraviolet visible spectrophotometric method uv1601 beijing rayleigh china nitrite nitrogen no2 n and nitrate nitrogen no3 n were determined by an ion chromatography ics 2000 dionex usa equipped with an anion exchange column shenghan sh ac 5 250 mm 4 6 mm and a conductivity detector long et al 2019 total inorganic nitrogen tin was calculated as the sum of nh4 no2 and no3 don was computed from the difference between tn and tin liu et al 2012 specific ultraviolet absorbances at 203 253 and 254 nm a203 a253 a254 were recorded using a 1 cm quartz cuvette to identify the chemical components of don uv1601 beijing rayleigh china suva254 was calculated from the 100 fold ratio of the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm to the corresponding doc concentration a253 a203 is the ratio of ultraviolet absorbance at 253 nm to that at 203 nm a fluorescence spectrometer f 2500 hitachi japan was used to characterize the 3 dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem the spectrum was acquired at excitation ex and emission em wavelengths of 200 400 and 200 500 nm respectively at 5 nm intervals and a 1200 nm min scan rate due to the physicochemical properties of n enriched dom carbonated dbps c dbps and nitrogenous dbps n dbps may be produced when chlorine based disinfectant enters surface water thus three typical classes of dbps trihalomethanes thms and haloacetonitriles hans n nitrosamines were quantified in this study thms including chloroform tcm bromoform tbm dibromochloromethane dbcm and bromodichloromethane bdcm were detected directly by purge and trap concentrator gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7890b 5977c aglent usa hans which included trichloroacetonitrile tcan was

phase extraction spe and liquid chromatography mass spectrometer mass spectrometer lc ms ms lcms 8060 shimadzu japan tbm bdcm nmor and nmea were not detected in the samples 2 4 statistical analysis the concentration of each dbps below the method detection limit mdl was treated as zero to avoid incorrect conclusion and bias the results were reported as the mean and the standard deviation computed from three replicates statistical analysis was performed using ibm spss statistics 26 0 software package for windows 10 the significance of the differences among the distinct water bodies was ascertained using the analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated to identify the relationships among the levels of dbps don related indices and physicochemical characteristics for this study a correlation coefficient greater than or equal to 0 7 r 0 7 was defined as a strong correlation correlation coefficient values between 0 4 and 0 7 0 4 r 0 7 were considered moderately strong and below 0 4 r 0 4 were considered weak haldar et al 2020 principal component analysis pca was also performed to provide a rough overview of the reduced dimensions of parameters and sample clustering using origin 2021 the differences were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variation of water quality in wuhan surface water resources the physical and chemical properties of water samples collected from two rivers and four lakes including ph ec do turbidity cod doc tocl tobr and n species were summarized in table s1 and fig 3 3 1 1 basic physiochemical indexes the results indicated different levels of variation in water quality among different water resources a significant variation was demonstrated by statistical analysis anova p 0 05 for ph ec turbidity cod doc tocl and tobr most water quality parameters in lakes exhibited significantly higher levels than in rivers for example the results showed that doc concentrations were 1 5 4 4 mg l in rivers and 1 5 9 8 mg l in lakes respectively average doc concentrations in different surface water resources were in the order hou lake tangxun lake east lake liangzi lake han river yangtze river yangtze river had the lowest doc concentrations 1 5 3 3 mg l while hou lake had the highest doc values 3 4 9 8 mg l among all water resources generally the lakes in this study were characterized by higher ec turbidity cod doc and tocl values indicating that their water quality was worse than rivers this could be mainly attributed to discharge from different pollutant sources such as rainfall surface runoff overuse of fertilizers sewage and domestic effluents hu et al 2016 maqbool et al 2020 to further identify primary sources of spatial variability in water quality pca of the water quality parameters was performed fig 4 detailed information about pollutants was summarized in table s2 s6 as shown in fig 4 the different types of water samples showed distinct clusters with the two principal components accounting for 62 7 of the variances rivers and lakes clustered in different quadrants due to their distinct pollutant sources pc1 explained 42 3 of the total variance with strong positive loadings of don cod and nh4 tangxun lake and hou lake exhibited higher values on the pc1 axes which can be associated to large discharges of sewage and industrial waste directly unloaded into lakes especially in hou lake table s5 the direct discharge of domestic sewage and dumping of animal and industrial waste in the nearby areas were the major pollutant sources due to the poor drainage pipe network pc2 explained 20 4 of the variance and had high positive loadings of do no3 n and no2 n rivers showed higher values on the pc2 axes which was probably due to the application of organic and inorganic n fertilizers into rivers table s2 also showed that the amount of nh4 and cod from agricultural runoff was higher than from other sources 3 1 2 spatial variation of n species the different predominant n forms don no3 n nh4 n no2 n in surface water resources were analyzed in this study fig 3 don no3 n nh4 n and no2 n concentrations varied from 0 to 4 0 0 to 1 4 0 06 to 0 5 and 0 to 0 02 mg n l exhibiting a substantial spatial variation in distinct water resources and a slight change in the same water resource the tn content of the rivers and lakes varied between 0 9 to 2 0 and 0 4 to 4 6 mg n l respectively the ranking order of the average tn concentrations of the six surface water resources was hou lake tangxun lake yangtze river liangzi lake han river east lake based on the results of pca the primary source of pollution in rivers was agricultural runoff while the primary sources of pollution in lakes were domestic sewage and industrial discharge notably hou lake had the highest tn concentrations among the six surface water resources direct discharge of domestic sewage and dumping of animal and industrial waste in nearby areas was responsible for introducing a large quantity of n containing pollutants table s5 site hh 3 in hou lake had the maximum tn concentration which was significantly higher than other sampling sites it was probably related to nearby industrial and residential activities yang et al 2009 which released a large amount of domestic sewage and aquaculture waste into the hou lake the n species differed significantly between rivers and lakes for both rivers and lakes don and no3 n were the most dominant n species that accounted for 0 to 86 2 and 0 to 93 6 of the tn respectively the no3 n content in rivers varied from 0 4 to 1 4 mg n l and the proportion to tn ranged from 30 0 to 93 6 which were much higher than in lakes the results indicate that no3 n was the most significant component of tn in rivers chen et al 2019 also reported that dissolved inorganic n was the dominant n form in many rivers and its amount was strongly linked to n input on land e g the use of synthetic n fertilizer manure n input human excreta n discharge biological fixation atmospheric deposition in spring the primary source of n input in the yangtze river was the synthetic n fertilizer which might contain a lot of no3 n chen et al 2019 besides higher do values in rivers were observed in this study the nitrification could be highly promoted in rivers because of sufficient do supply facilitating no3 n production yabusaki et al 2017 the don concentrations in lakes were in the range of 0 3 4 0 mg n l which was higher don than in rivers moreover don accounted for 53 0 86 2 of the tn in all lakes implying that don was the dominant n form in these water bodies excessive don in the surface water resources may deteriorate water quality in several ways on the one hand don under oxic conditions can be further be transformed into no3 n aggravating no3 n contamination in aquatic systems de vera et al 2017 in this study the measured do values in lakes varied from 9 0 to 10 8 mg l nitrification could occur in lakes because of sufficient do supply facilitating no3 n contamination yabusaki et al 2017 on the other hand as n enriched dom don is regarded as the precursor for dbp formation gu et al 2011 high don content in lakes may increase dbp formation potential and threaten water quality 3 2 characteristics of n enriched dom investigated using spectral technologies the chemical properties of don can affect its bioavailability and transformation in aquatic ecosystems carstea et al 2019 to clarify the relationship between don components and dbps understanding the composition of don is essential as is well known don is the nitrogenous fraction of dom the structural and compositional characteristics of don should be highly related to dom a254 and a253 a203 are crucial parameters to characterize the aromaticity of dom li et al 2014b a higher a254 value indicates higher aromatic content in dom conversely a lower a254 value indicates lower aromaticity with more hydrophilic compounds a higher a253 a203 ratio reflects that the substitution groups contain more aromatic rings in this study a254 and a253 a203 were analyzed and illustrated in fig 5 the results showed that the a254 and a253 a203 ranged from 0 0 1 and 0 0 3 respectively a significant difference was observed in the a254 and a253 a203 values of rivers and lakes in general the rivers had lower a254 and a253 a203 values compared to lakes it indicated that don in rivers with lower contents was made of more hydrophilic compounds in contrast don in lakes with higher content contained more aromatic substances the a254 values and a253 a203 ratios in the hou lake and tangxun lake were higher than those in east lake and liangzi lake differences in the anthropogenic discharge into the lakes could explain the differences in the aromaticity levels of dom lorite herrera et al 2009 nai et al 2020 notably the values of a254 and a253 a203 at different sampling sites in the same water resource were nearly similar it demonstrated that don in the same water resource had similar constituents according to the results mentioned above the contents and constitutes of don in the same water resource did not differ significantly thus we chose the sampling station with the highest don content in each water resource to characterize the 3d eem spectra fig 6 according to excitation and emission wavelength boundaries the 3d eem spectra were divided into five areas jacquin et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b in summary peaks at shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and shorter excitation wavelengths 250 nm were attributed to region i and region ii pi and pii indicating simple aromatic protein like substances such as tyrosine like and tryptophan like substances peaks at shorter excitation wavelengths 250 nm and longer emission wavelengths 380 nm were related to region iii piii representing fulvic acid like compounds peaks in region iv piv indicating soluble microbial product like substances occurred at shorter emission wavelengths 380 nm and longer excitation 250 nm peaks of region v pv characterized by longer emission wavelengths 380 nm and longer excitation wavelengths 250 nm indicated humic acid like compounds the percent distribution of the five regions for don based on the fluorescence peak characteristics has been presented in table 1 don in wuhan surface water resources mainly comprised protein like and fulvic acid like substances with fewer soluble microbial product like and humic acid like compounds reflected by its high pi ii iv of 57 7 75 1 this suggested that microorganisms efficiently utilized the dominant component of don in wuhan s surface water resources notably tangxun lake and hou lake had higher piii v than others in addition piii v pi ii iv ratios of don and suva254 were also calculated to reflect the humification degree table 1 the piii v pi ii iv ratios were 0 6 and 0 7 in tangxun lake and hou lake which were higher than those in other water resources the results illustrated that these two lakes had a higher humification degree of don with higher contents of the humic and fulvic materials this result was in agreement with the a254 and a253 a203 results reported in the study additionally the suva254 values of rivers and lakes varied from 0 3 to 1 6 l mg m and 1 0 to 1 7 l mg m respectively overall the suva254 values for don in different surface water resources were significantly lower than 3 0 l mg m illustrating that don in the surface water mainly comprised hydrophilic substances zhang et al 2020c 3 3 comparision of the levels of dbps in wuhan surface waters before and after the covid 19 pandemic due to the observation of don in surface waters we speculated that the extensive use of disinfectants during the covid 19 pandemic might lead to the increased production of dbps thus the sampling site with the highest don content in each water resource was selected to investigate the distribution of dbps fig 7 showed the three typical speciations of dbps in different surface water resources the concentrations of thms hans and n nitrosamines varied from 0 5 to 6 8 μg l average 2 2 μg l 0 to 0 1 μg l average 0 02 μg l 23 1 to 97 4 ng l average 60 8 ng l respectively thms hans and n nitrosamines contributed up to 90 0 98 5 0 1 8 and 1 0 10 0 to the total dbps thms were the most abundant dbps followed by n nitrosamines and hans dbcm average 1 2 μg l and tcm average 1 0 μg l were the key thms species while tcan average 0 02 μg l was the dominant hans species in this study ndma average 25 8 ng l accounting for 10 4 83 8 was the dominant species among the seven measured n nitrosamines china regulates the levels of some of the dbps in centralized surface water resources for instance the regulatory standards for tcm and tbm are 60 and 100 μg l respectively zhou et al 2019 in this study tcm and tbm concentrations complied with the standards even after the covid 19 pandemic notably most countries including china have not developed guidelines to limit dbps in surface water kristiana et al 2017 until now the levels of dbps in drinking water have garnered attention while their occurrence in natural water bodies has been assumed to be insignificant the current understanding of the dbp distribution in china s surface water is highly inadequate to address this knowledge gap we gathered the observation data on the concentrations of dbps in surface water in china from published reports table s7 data from previous research showed that dbp concentrations in surface water remained steady at a very low level before the covid 19 pandemic the levels of most dbps after the covid 19 pandemic were within the range of data previously reported while some dbps were higher than the reported data for example previous studies showed that the total nitrosamines concentration in rivers was in the range of 1 6 62 4 ng l a recent study reported that the mean concentration of n nitrosamines in the surface water was 29 2 ng l after covid 19 which was not higher than the reported data li et al 2021 in contrast the concentration of n nitrosamines varied from 23 1 to 97 4 ng l in the current study increased levels of n nitrosamines may be associated with the elevated use of disinfectants during the covid 19 pandemic increased n nitrosamines could come from two sources 1 wastewater treatment plant effluents and industrial domestic wastewaters containing n nitrosamines may directly be discharged into the surface water wang et al 2016 2 n nitrosamines could be generated when the surface water received residual chlorine although most dbps did not increase significantly in surface water after the covid 19 pandemic their potential health risks in surface water can not be overlooked 3 4 relationship between don related indices and the occurrence of dbps in order to elucidate the effects of compositional characteristics of don on dbp formation the relationships among don related indices doc don a203 a253 a254 a253 a203 suva254 piii v pi ii iv pi pii piii piv and pv primary water quality parameters tocl and tobr and different types of dbp contents were determined fig 8 spearman s rank correlation illustrated that tocl was strongly positively correlated with some n nitrosamines including ndpa and ndpha r 0 7 p 0 05 r 0 7 p 0 05 suggesting that tocl participated in oxidation reactions in the presence of don beita sandí et al 2020 some n nitrosamines ndea showed significantly positive correlations with don r 0 8 p 0 05 suggesting that higher don contents generated higher amounts of ndea this result demonstrated that don served as a crucial ndea precursor which agreed with reported studies chang et al 2013 hua et al 2020 with regard to optical properties suva254 exhibited strong negative correlations with total n nitrosamines and some specific species of n nitrosamines including npip ndpa and ndba r 0 7 p 0 05 r 0 7 p 0 05 r 0 8 p 0 05 r 0 8 p 0 05 the results implied that hydrophilic substances with low suva254 values could be precursors for npip ndpa ndba or total n nitrosamines further thms showed a significant positive with pv humic acid like components r 0 7 p 0 05 indicating that the humidified don was a dominant thms precursor unexpectedly total n nitrosamines had no significant relationship with don but had a strong positive correlation with pⅱ protein like substances r 0 9 p 0 05 this suggested that don fraction containing more protein like components favored the formation of n nitrosamines krasner et al 2013 has proposed that amine precursor is the dominant mechanism responsible for the formation of nitrosamines for protein like fraction amines carboxylic and aliphatic structures are considered as basic fluorescent units chen et al 2015 li et al 2014a liu et al 2017 in this study the amines structures in the protein like components may serve as n nitrosamines precursors overall the key factor influencing the occurrence of thms in surface water was humificated don on the other hand amines in don played a vital role in forming n nitrosamines some don components exhibited significant relationships with dbps and can serve as effective indicators to track dbp formation it was worth noting that no significant association was detected between some dbps and don components in the present study this may be because of the following two reasons 1 some dbps in surface water might have been directly discharged from sewage treatment plants 2 the physical conditions e g ph temperature ionic strength in surface water environment may influence the dbp formation undoubtedly covid 19 will have a long lasting impact on the environment highlighting the need for new research perspectives and policy needs this study confirmed that the presence of don in surface water could result in dbp formation especially n nitrosamines when disinfectants were discharged into surface water during the covid 19 pandemic this study highlights that don contamination in surface water indeed increased dbp formation threatening water quality routine assessment of surface water quality should include don and dbps as the necessary parameters especially for formulating effective policies during covid 19 4 conclusion during the covid 19 pandemic the use of chlorine based disinfectants was elevated for eliminating pathogens in contaminated environments residual disinfectants may enter natural water bodies and facilitate dbp formation depending on the availability of don results showed that a significant correlation between don components and dbps highlighting that don can serve as effective indicators to track dbp formation humificated don was a crucial precursor for thms formation while the amines structures in don played a vital role in forming n nitrosamines this study highlights that don contamination in surface water indeed increased dbp formation threatening water quality routine assessment of surface water quality should include don and dbps as the necessary parameters especially for formulating
