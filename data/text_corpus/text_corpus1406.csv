7030,understanding the interaction between groundwater and surface water is of vital significance for the sustainable management of water resources in arid and semi arid areas in this study multi environmental tracers hydrochemical parameters stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and radioactive 222rn were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers tiangeli river and nomhon river in the nomhon area southeast of the arid qaidam basin northwest china here we observed that the 222rn concentration of waters were distinctly different with a decrease order of groundwater spring river in this area along the tiangeli river the 222rn concentrations of groundwater springs and river water were about 12 120 17 407 3013 15 819 and 809 8205 bq m3 respectively this river was characterized by the high 222rn concentration of the river water and was investigated to be mainly fed by springs and groundwater discharge along the nomhon river 222rn concentration of groundwater and river water was about 6772 60 369 and 14 519 bq m3 respectively an average background of the 222rn concentration in the upstream of the river was determined to be about 43 bq m3 a high 222rn concentration zone along the river appeared in the midstream with a peak value of 519 bq m3 and a distance about 10 km indicating that groundwater discharged to the nomhon river in the alluvial plain a 222rn mass balance model was constructed to estimate the groundwater discharge into the river showing a maximum groundwater discharge of 0 37 m3 s in the midstream of nomhon river during the sampling period the stable isotopic compositions δd and δ18o and hydrochemical characteristics hydrochemical type tds and ec showed corresponding changes along these two rivers which also provided evidences for the groundwater surface water interactions in the nomhon area keywords groundwater surface water interactions 222rn stable isotopes hydrochemistry qaidam basin 1 introduction the groundwater surface water interactions are pretty common in large inland basins playing an absolutely necessary role in maintaining the ecosystem of river basins kalbus et al 2006 it is crucial to understand the relationship between groundwater and surface water for sustainable utilization and management of the precious water resources especially in the arid and semi arid areas numerous researches have been conducted on the groundwater surface water interactions reviews see kalbus et al 2006 unland et al 2013 generally focusing on areas such as sources identification hydrologic dynamics of interchanges and exchange characteristics of water quality and quantity etc stellato et al 2008 xu et al 2017 liao et al 2018 various methods and techniques have been developed making great contributions to promoting advances in above studies the most frequently used approaches include the environmental isotopic tracers hydrogen and oxygen lambs 2004 chen et al 2006 xu et al 2017 strontium negrel et al 2003 paces and wurster 2014 radium kraemer 2005 and radon cook et al 2003 wu et al 2004 martinez et al 2015 su et al 2015 chemical components such as anions and cations cook et al 2003 electrical conductivity carey and quinton 2005 kalbus et al 2006 heat tracing becker et al 2004 anderson 2005 xu et al 2017 by distributed temperature sensing dts westhoff et al 2010 hydrologic parameters monitoring by piezometer kelly and murdoch 2003 and seepage meters landon et al 2001 as well as numerical modeling or simulations liang et al 2003 scibek et al 2007 fleckenstein et al 2010 conclusions have been drawn that limitations and uncertainties of different methods and the measurement scale effects should be taken into considerations when selecting appropriate methods and materials kalbus et al 2006 therefore the multi scale approaches combining different techniques that can considerably reduce uncertainties are highly recommended in the studies on groundwater and surface water interactions radioactive isotope 222rn with short half life 3 83 days is a natural conservative tracer widely used to investigate the exchange between groundwater and surface water cook et al 2003 santos et al 2010 dimova et al 2013 the sources of 222rn in groundwater include the recoil supply from the decay of 226ra in the aquifer production from 226ra adsorbed and in solution however the latter were insignificant and often neglected carvalho et al 2014 the 222rn in groundwater is mainly removed by decay for surface water without recharge from groundwater the sources of 222rn are production from 226ra in water and sediment diffusion which were often insignificant wu et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 the sinks of 222rn in surface water include decay and atmospheric losses the 222rn concentration in groundwater is often 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in surface water dimova and burnett 2011 this significant difference enables researchers to identify the exchange between groundwater and surface water stable isotopes of hydrogen deuterium or d and oxygen 18o carry the information of water circulation recharge and discharge that makes these two common stable isotopes quite useful to identify the sources of different types of water which are widely used in hydrological and hydrogeological studies in recent decades clark and fritz 1997 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 gat 2010 gu et al 2011 qian et al 2014 xu et al 2017 like those in many other places in the arid qaidam basin qb water shortage has been becoming an increasing concern in the sustainable development in the nomhon area which calls for an integrated and optimized management and utilization of groundwater and surface water resources a good understanding of groundwater surface water interactions would be of great significance for such efforts in the present study we employed natural radioactive isotope of radon 222rn together with stable isotopes of hydrogen d and oxygen 18o and hydrochemical parameters to identify the interactions between groundwater and surface water in the nomhon area one of the alluvial lacustrine plains in se qb 2 study area the study area is located in the southeast of the qaidam basin northwest china the basin is a huge endorheic basin that covers an area of approximately 120 000 km2 kezao and bowler 1986 rohrmann et al 2013 in the northwest of the tibetan plateau tp fig 1 the nomhon area is extremely arid with an average annual evaporation of about 2651 2 mm the mean annual air temperature and precipitation in the plain 2700 3000 m asl are about 4 5 c and 42 7 mm respectively water in nomhon comes mainly from precipitation melting glacier and snow from the southern mountainous area 3200 5300 m asl the burhan budai mountain in summer the burhan budai mountain is a part of the east kunlun mountains which acts as the origin of various resources and the south barrier of the qaidam basin in the nomhon area the strata were mainly made up of the bedrock of granite and granodiorite in the mountainous area in the south and the quaternary layers from the piedmont area to the plain area for the current known depth wang et al 2008 the quaternary sediments of clay with poor permeability gravel and sand with good permeability act as the aquitard and aquifer respectively fig 2 the quaternary aquifers changed from the single layered unconfined aquifer in the piedmont area and the alluvial proluvial fan to multi layered confined aquifers in the alluvial lacustrine plain from south to north wang et al 2008 groundwater got recharged mainly from precipitation and melt water runoff of glacier and snow of the mountainous area in the south and flowed toward northwest into the terminal lake the salt northern and southern huobuxun lakes groundwater discharged by means of evaporation springs recharging rivers and human pumping the depth of groundwater table changed from about 100 m to less than 5 m from the piedmont area in the south to the lower plain in the north yang et al 2016 according to the geomorphic and hydrogeological features the study area could be divided into the following zones from south to north i the mountainous zone where the recharge areas were located ii the alluvial proluvial fan located in the piedmont area where the aquifer was mainly comprised of gravel and poorly graded sand with the phreatic groundwater of low water table iii the alluvial plain located in the lower plain where the aquifers featured by multi layered confined and semi confined groundwater in intermediate and well graded sand iv the lacustrine plain located in the central plain where the aquifers characterized by multi layered confined groundwater in fine sand fig 2 there are two major rivers in the nomhon area one is the nomhon river in the central axis of the alluvial lacustrine plain and the other is the tiangeli river in the west edge of the plain the two rivers are about 15 20 km apart fig 1 both of the rivers are perennial rivers and flow from south to north taking the salt huobuxun lakes to the northwest as the terminal discharge the nomhon river is one of the water resources that provide the irrigation water for the nomhon farmland in front edge of the alluvial plain where the red and black wolfberries were cultivated the average annual runoff depth of the nomhon river is about 41 6 mm which relatively equals to the mean annual precipitation but less than the average annual evaporation wang et al 2008 besides the qaidam river a regional intermittent river of the qaidam basin to the north of nomhon which flows from southeast to the huobuxun lakes runs through the study area during the flood periods 3 material and methods 3 1 field sampling forty sets of samples of groundwater rain river and spring were collected in the nomhon area in august and september 2017 along two hydrogeological sections approximately along the two rivers section n and section t fig 1 along the nomhon river in section n 23 samples were collected including river water samples from the mountain pass to the river bend toward to west groundwater samples from the phreatic water wells with the well depth about 80 150 m along the midstream and artesian wells with the well depth about 150 400 m and along the tiangeli river in section t 16 sampling sites contained river sites spring and shallow domestic wells about 25 m in depth of local herdsman the only sample of rain was collected in sampling site of w4 in the nomhon farmland during the fieldwork periods fig 1 in the afternoon of 8th sept 2017 groundwater samples of artesian wells were directly collected by tubes and groundwater samples of shallow and phreatic water wells were taken after at least 5 times volume of stagnant water in the borehole was pumped out at the same time parameters such as the electrical conductivity ec and ph of groundwater were observed to be relatively stable before sampling to make sure that the pumped water can be representative river water samples were collected at the depth of about 10 15 cm below the surface of water spring water samples were collected under the surface of water as close to the overflowing point with rising air bubbles as possible 3 2 in situ measurements and lab analysis the electrical conductivity of water was measured in situ by eureka manta 2 portable multi parameter instrument for water quality the analyses of major ions of water samples were performed with thermo scientific dionex ion chromatograph ics 1100 the anion cation charge balance was checked to be of 5 for all samples water samples of δd and δ18o were analyzed by lgr water vapor isotope analyzer berman et al 2009 in china university of geosciences beijing and reported relative to the vsmow standard vienna standard mean ocean water in permil the analytical error is less than 0 2 and 0 06 for δd and δ18o respectively some of the samples were also analyzed with picarro l2130 i isotope analyzer at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology shijiazhuang the results showed that the data difference is less than 2 between these two analyzers which also guaranteed the reliability of isotopic data in this paper in this paper we used the latter results during analysis and discussion the analysis of 222rn concentrations were performed by a portable radon instrumentation rad 7 durridge usa via α decay accounts the in situ water sample of 250 ml was collected to detect the radon activity concentration in groundwater by rad h2o system schmidt et al 2010 luo et al 2016 the internal pump of the rad 7 extracts radon from groundwater and the radon circulates to the rad 7 detector in the rad h2o system for radon concentration analysis in surface water big bottle system 2 5 l an accessory to the rad 7 radon monitor was used the analyses of 222rn samples were performed in situ or within 12 h after sampled indoor the measuring error is about 13 for groundwater and about 34 for surface water with low concentrations of 222rn 600 bq m3 3 3 222rn mass balance model to estimate the groundwater discharge into rivers a 222rn mass balance model was constructed in river stretches between river sampling sites in the midstream of nomhon river based on the 222rn mass conservation theory danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 in which the gas exchange and radioactive decay of 222rn in both river and groundwater discharge were taken into account the model can be expressed as follows stellato et al 2008 su et al 2015 1 r n d q r r n gw 1 exp α l l α q gw r n u exp α l q r q gw 2 α λ v d 0 5 v 0 5 h 1 5 where rnd rnu and rngw are 222rn concentrations measured in the downstream upstream river and groundwater respectively bq m3 qr and qgw are river and groundwater discharge respectively m3 s α is 222rn loss coefficient caused by both radioactive decay and gas exchange and it was explained by the surface renewal theory danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 for the gas exchange part l is the distance between two stream sampling sites m v is the average stream velocity between two stream sampling sites m s h is the stream depth m λ is 222rn radioactive decay coefficient λ 2 08 10 6 s 1 d is radon molecular diffusivity cm2 s log d 980 t 1 59 and t is absolute water temperature k thus the groundwater discharge qgw and its proportion in river discharge qgw qr can be calculated by solving the equation 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical distribution characteristics the data of in situ measured ph and ec lab analyzed tds and hydrochemical types of all water samples were shown in table 1 the major ions of water samples were shown with a piper diagram fig 3 in general most samples plotted together with similar hydrochemical types except 7 samples of section n g01 m164 and ck8 and t w9 s5 s7 and s8 in the nomhon area the major hydrochemical types were the cl hco3 na mg ca cl so4 hco3 na ca mg and cl hco3 na ca types for major anions chloride cl ranked the highest proportion followed by bicarbonate hco3 and sulfate so4 2 and for major cations sodium na ranked the highest proportion followed by calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 the rest 7 samples showed two hydrochemcal types one was the cl na type and the other was the cl hco3 na or hco3 cl na type those 7 samples were collected in the groundwater middle downgradient and longtime water rock interaction such as lixiviation with salt sediments might contribute to the formation of groundwater chemistry sheng et al 2017 the ph of all water samples ranged from 7 2 to 9 0 with an average of 8 2 indicating that the water in this area was mainly alkaline water in the study area tds varied with a wide range from 413 2 fresh to 19 604 4 mg l brackish and averaged 1373 5 mg l for all water samples table 1 so did ec measured in situ which varied from 600 9 to 31 620 0 μs cm with an average of about 2585 9 μs cm besides tds and ec data derived a very good linear relationship fig 4 a with r2 0 9988 p 0 001 indicating that the parameters measured in the field and lab matched very well thus we can use tds data to represent corresponding changes of ec along the tiangeli river tds or ec of all surface water and groundwater including spring samples had quite similar values with a slightly increasing trend along the river stretch except w9 and s5 fig 4 a it varied from 413 2 to 788 5 mg l with an average of 540 7 mg l they also had similar hydrochemical types that characterized by cl hco3 na ca mg and cl hco3 na ca types the hydrochemical similarities may reflect the fact that the tiangeli river was mainly fed by springs and groundwater in other forms groundwater sample w9 and spring sample s5 had relatively higher tds 1536 1 mg l and 2215 9 mg l respectively with the hydrochemical types of cl na table 1 fig 3 indicating that the sampled water might have extra salt sources from the lixiviation of minerals in the underlying subsurface sheng et al 2017 along the nomhon river tds or ec of surface water and groundwater varied along the river stretch fig 4 b the average tds of river water samples about 671 8 mg l was a little bit higher than that of groundwater about 559 1 mg l along the upstream and midstream except w6 of 2010 7 mg l which might be caused by the lixiviation and evaporation but was much lower than that of artesian groundwater in the lacustrine plain about 8913 9 mg l besides in the beginning of the midstream the river tds represented a sharp decrease from r5 638 4 mg l to r6 539 1 mg l compared with the last sample r4 655 8 mg l of the upstream within this distance groundwater with lower tds also showed a sharp decrease from w4 598 4 mg l to w5 491 7 mg l compared with the last groundwater sample w3 628 4 mg l along the upstream thus the midstream tds decrease might probably be attributed to the mixing with low tds groundwater in the beginning of the midstream moreover the hydrochemical type of river changed from cl so4 na ca type r4 to cl so4 hco3 na ca r5 and cl so4 hco3 ca na mg types r6 showing an increase of hco3 and mg2 proportions that might be due to the mixing with groundwater of cl hco3 na mg ca and cl hco3 na ca mg types within the same distance hence these hydrochemical changes might probably reflect that groundwater discharged into the river in the midstream segment 4 2 stable isotopic compositions of hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o the stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δd of water samples in the study area were shown in fig 5 and table 1 in general the isotopic values of all water samples ranged from 92 0 to 22 4 for δd and from 12 8 to 4 1 for δ18o in the study area all samples plotted along both the global craig 1961 and local sun 1990 meteoric water lines gmwl and lmwl indicating that the precipitation modern or and pre modern was the recharge source of waters in nomhon the equation for the lmwl δd 7 862 δ18o 11 05 is similar to that of gmwl δd 8 δ18o 10 but with a much lower slope showing an arid area feature clark and fritz 1997 in the nomhon area different types of waters showed distinct isotopic compositions fig 5 i the rain water sample rain1 was with enriched isotopic composition δd 22 4 δ18o 4 1 and plotted on the top right of the lmwl showing a quite distinct characteristics with other samples fig 5 it might be due to the sampling date in summer ii the surface river water samples were plotted in two centralized locations in fig 5 the enriched location for the nomhon river and the depleted location for the tiangeli river the difference of isotopic compositions between these two locations could be resulted from the diffident recharge sources with different altitude or and recharge temperature note that the groundwater and some of spring samples had similar isotopic compositions to that of the tiangeli river samples with depleted locations which could be an evidence of groundwater discharge to the river iii groundwater and spring samples scattered along the gmwl and lmwl from the alluvial proluvial fan to the alluvial lacustrine plain the isotopic compositions of groundwater became more and more depleted which could be attributed to different recharge conditions from warm temperature or and low altitude to cool temperature or and high altitude what s more the groundwater residence time from young to old and microbial communities also showed corresponding changes liu et al 2014 sheng et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 the deuterium excess d excess which was defined by d excess δd 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was commonly used as one of the useful tools to study the features of water vapor sources such as the humidity of vapor source region or the evaporation effect during rainfall clark and fritz 1997 in the nomhon area d excess of all water samples varied with a large scale from 3 2 to 15 7 and with an average of 13 0 it was larger than the intercept of gmwl 10 for most samples 10 3 15 7 except r8 7 4 ck8 8 0 and m164 3 2 which might indicate that the primary evaporation was controlled by the low humidity in the vapor source region kendall and mcdonnell 1998 sample r8 was likely affected by the evaporation effect on river samples of ck8 and m164 were both from artesian wells in the lacustrine plain featured by the long residence time more than 18 ka bp liu et al 2014 and high tds 6515 2 19604 4 mg l they might be attributed by the water rock interactions with a deep groundwater circulation and other complex effects e g different water vapor source with high humidity which made these two samples characterized by an 18o shift like change clark and fritz 1997 fig 6 showed that sections n and t also had different features of the δd and δ18o compositions of all water samples along the tiangeli river fig 6 a and nomhon river fig 6 b respectively for the range of isotopic composition samples of section n scattered with a large scale from 92 0 to 64 6 for δd and 12 5 to 9 0 for δ18o whereas samples of section t centralized with a relatively small scale from 88 5 to 77 3 for δd and 12 8 to 11 6 for δ18o fig 5 table 1 heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are relatively enriched in the former section but depleted in the latter for most of water samples in section t most of samples except s7 and s8 lied together with relatively depleted heavy isotopes fig 5 along the tiangeli river flow path δd and δ18o of all samples seemed to be rarely changed fig 6 a samples of groundwater spring and river water shared relatively similar distributions of δd from 83 2 to 77 3 and δ18o from 12 2 to 11 6 moreover the δd and δ18o changes along the river stretch represented an obvious relationship among different types of water groundwater spring river though the difference was not large according to the isotopic data table 1 the average δd was about 82 5 80 2 and 79 9 respectively and the average δ18o was about 12 1 11 9 and 11 8 respectively as the tiangeli river was mainly fed by springs groundwater the above phenomenon could be resulted from the isotopic fractionation due to the evaporation effect from a close to open system which enriched the heavy isotopic compositions from groundwater to river water s7 and s8 were two spring samples from top of the shell bar that beside the downstream to the north fig 1 these two spring samples showed quite depleted isotopic compositions that were similar to that of confined groundwater in the lacustrine plain the previous studies indicated that the two springs were with a long residence time about 21 ka bp apparent age recorded by low radioactive isotopes of 14c 7 92 pmc percent modern carbon and tritium 1 tu tritium unit liu et al 2014 hence the springs on the shell bar were inferred to be recharged from groundwater of confined aquifers with an ancient age in section n samples of river water and groundwater have distinct compositions of δd and δ18o along the nomhon river figs 5 and 6 b i the river water was with more enriched heavy isotopes than groundwater ii the river water samples showed a generally increasing trend from 74 0 to 64 6 for δd and 10 9 to 10 0 for δ18o which indicated an evaporation effect clark and fritz 1997 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 along the river stretch iii groundwater samples generally presented a decreasing trend with more depleted heavy isotopes from 92 0 to 73 9 for δd and 12 5 to 10 7 for δ18o iv in the beginning of the midstream a drop of river isotopic values from 26 km could be attributed to the mixing with groundwater discharge featured by more negative isotopic values which was shown by the similar isotopic compositions of δd and δ18o between the midstream r5 r6 and r9 and groundwater w4 w5 and w6 v phreatic groundwater samples from the relatively shallow wells along the upstream and midstream were more enriched of heavy isotopes than that of confined groundwater samples from artesian wells along the downstream and in the lacustrine plain vi the phreatic groundwater also showed a slight evaporation effect with relatively increasing δd and δ18o 4 3 222rn concentrations in surface water and groundwater in the study area the 222rn concentration in water samples showed a very wide scale ranging from 26 to 60 369 bq m3 it was about 14 8205 3013 15 819 and 3013 60 369 bq m3 for samples of river springs and groundwater respectively table 1 and the average 222rn concentration was about 1342 9686 and 16 849 bq m3 for samples of river groundwater and springs respectively the distributions of the 222rn concentration were shown with graphs fig 7 along the tiangeli river fig 7 a and nomhon river fig 7 b all water samples could be divided into two groups one group with relatively high 222rn concentration reaching several thousand bq m3 809 60 369 bq m3 about 11 078 bq m3 for the average and the other group with comparatively low 222rn concentration less than 600 bq m3 14 519 bq m3 about 120 bq m3 for the average the former group consists of groundwater samples along the nomhon river in section n and the whole water samples along the tiangeli river in section t whereas the latter group is only comprised of samples of the nomhon river in section n usually the natural river without extra recharge of 222rn or 226ra from groundwater or lithology of geological layers has very low 222rn concentration in the present study the average 222rn concentration of samples of the nomhon river from the mountain pass to the alluvial proluvial fan from r1 to r4 fig 2 about 43 bq m3 from 36 to 50 bq m3 could be regarded as the background concentration of 222rn in natural river in the nomhon area by contrast other river samples were about several to thousand times higher than the background 222rn concentration in river water suggesting very obvious differences detailed distribution characteristics and reasons of the differences would be discussed as follows along the tiangeli river in section t the 222rn concentration is quite similar between groundwater including springs and river water fig 7 a the 222rn concentration of all water samples generally decreased from 17 407 bq m3 to 809 bq m3 for groundwater it decreased from 17 407 to 12 120 bq m3 with an average value of 15 380 bq m3 for springs it varied from 15 819 to 3013 bq m3 with an average value of 9686 bq m3 for river water it drops from 8205 to 809 bq m3 along the flow path with an average of about 3583 bq m3 the 222rn concentration of the tiangeli river was about ten to hundred times higher than that of the nomhon river indicating that the tiangeli river is mainly formed by groundwater discharge our field investigation showed that the original source of this river was a spring no any other riverheads or sources were found to the south and other directions bubbles could be seen clearly going out of the bottom of deposits in the spring together with outcropped groundwater within about 5 km north from the first springhead more springheads with larger area and quantity were found along the river stretch besides the tiangeli river keeps running for all seasons showing a quite steady recharge quantity from the underground aquifer hence the tiangeli river could be determined to be a spring fed river moreover the 222rn concentration represented a relationship among different types water along the river stretch groundwater spring river fig 7 a and it showed a decreasing trend along the flow path for all types of water this phenomenon could be attributed to 222rn loss from the radioactive decay and gas exchange 222rn loss in groundwater was mainly affected by the 222rn radioactive decay however when groundwater flowed out from a close system to an open system of the outcropped springs and river the dissolved 222rn concentration would decrease due to 222rn loss from both radioactive decay and gas exchange with ambient air and the 222rn concentration in river water showed more 222rn loss than that in spring water along the nomhon river in section n the river water and groundwater had quite distinct 222rn concentrations fig 7 b i the river 222rn concentration ranged from 14 to 519 bq m3 and it generally increased firstly and then decreased with a peak value reaching up to 519 bq m3 from south to north the groundwater 222rn concentration ranged from 6772 to 60 369 bq m3 with an average of about 17 582 bq m3 and it was about 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the river ii the 222rn concentration of the nomhon river showed different characteristics in the upstream midstream and downstream for different distances of flow path in the upstream about 0 26 km from the mountain pass it increased from 36 to 50 bq m3 showing no extra recharge of 222rn in the midstream the 222rn concentration increased from 14 7 to 519 177 bq m3 at about 26 31 6 km and then decreased to 56 15 bq m3 at about 31 9 36 km higher than that of the background concentration of the nomhon river indicating that extra recharge of 222rn had joined into the river water in this zone in the downstream from about 36 km north to the river bend no sample was collected because it was so hard to get close to the river the various changes in the different parts of stream revealed that for about 10 km in the midstream 26 36 km the nomhon river received the groundwater discharge as one of its recharge origins iii the 222rn concentration of groundwater presented a relatively decreasing trend from south sample w4 10 396 bq m3 to north sample g01 6772 bq m3 and from phreatic to artesian groundwater which might be resulted from the distinct 226ra contents in aquifer materials in different locations along groundwater flow path the maximum 222rn concentration was found in sample m164 60 369 bq m3 suggesting that 222rn of groundwater about 200 m deep underground in the north part of the lacustrine plain might have different source that had high level of 222rn or and 226ra concentration 4 4 interactions between groundwater and surface water in the nomhon area the groundwater and surface river water interactions were mainly recognized by 222rn isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and hydrochemical parameters combining with hydrogeological characteristics along two rivers the groundwater discharge to surface water was observed along both the tiangeli and nomhon rivers two river gaining zones zones that river gained water from groundwater discharge featured by both patterns of total and partial recharge to river from groundwater were recognized the former one was along the tiangeli river and the latter one was along the midstream of the nomhon river on the one hand a total river gaining zone was observed along the tiangeli river it was about 10 15 km long from south to north where the springs and groundwater discharge formed a total and only recharge to river along the river stretch all river water samples showed nearly the same characteristics of 222rn concentration stable isotopic compositions δd and δ18o and hydrochemical parameters with groundwater from shallow wells and springs except s7 and s8 to the downstream away from other sampling sites moreover this river keeps running with a relatively steady water level and runoff in all seasons hence we could know that the tiangeli river was totally recharged by groundwater and springs in other words we could call the tiangeli river a spring fed river on the other hand a partial river gaining zone was obtained along the nomhon river it was about 10 km long 26 to 36 km in the alluvial plain where the river was partially recharged by groundwater as evidenced by the measurements of 222rn stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen as well as hydrochemical items firstly the 222rn concentration in river water sharply increased that could be due to the mixing with groundwater of high 222rn concentration secondly the stable isotopic compositions of river water became more depleted that might be due to the mixing with groundwater of relatively depleted isotopic values thirdly the hydrochemical parameters also showed probably changes that might be affected by this kind of interaction the hydrochemical type of river water changed from the cl so4 na ca type to the cl so4 hco3 na ca and cl so4 hco3 ca na mg types showing an increasing of hco3 and mg2 proportions that might be due to the mixing with groundwater of the cl hco3 na mg ca and cl hco3 na ca mg types whereas the river tds represented a decrease after mixing with low tds groundwater in the beginning part of this zone what s more the groundwater table was 0 5 m deep and outcropped groundwater was found aside the midstream of nomhon river showing a potential for groundwater discharge into the river in this zone according to the above discussions the river gaining zone in this section was determined it should be noticed that the recharge from groundwater was not a total pattern but a partial one which was distinct from the situation along the tiangeli river to illustrate the highest river 222rn concentration only reached at about 519 bq m3 much less than that of the tiangeli river average about 3583 bq m3 which represented the total recharge pattern otherwise the 222rn concentration of river water samples would be similar to that of groundwater about several thousand bq m3 so were the isotopic compositions and hydrochemical parameters just like what the tiangeli river showed thus we could infer that the groundwater discharge was only a partial and non dominant recharge to the nomhon river to sum up a partial river gaining zone along the nomhon river for about 10 km was determined in order to quantify the groundwater discharge qgw and its proportion in river discharge qgw qr a 222rn mass balance model was constructed in the midstream of nomhon river according to eqs 1 and 2 during calculation d was calculated to be 1 17 10 9 m2 s at 293 15 k 20 c α was calculated to be 5 9 10 4 m 1 from eq 2 rngw was represented by the average 222rn concentration 10 607 bq m3 of phreatic groundwater in w4 10 369 bq m3 and w6 10 818 bq m3 and qr 1 5 22 5 m3 s was calculated by the stream velocity and measured cross sectional area the groundwater discharge qgw ranged from 0 003 to 0 37 m3 s along the midstream of nomhon river and the proportion of groundwater discharge in river discharge qgw qr ranged from 0 2 to 8 2 the maximum groundwater discharge 0 37 m3 s for qgw and 8 2 for qgw qr to the nomhon river occurred from r8 to r10 for about 2 1 km during the sampling period in other words the max average groundwater discharge flux per distance for the width of about 30 m was 1 76 10 4 m3 s m in the midstream of nomhon river in this study the uncertainties of estimation on groundwater discharge to river could result from the analyses errors of 222rn concentration in river water 34 and groundwater 13 as well as uncertainties from manually measurement of stream parameters the study demonstrated that the radioactive tracer 222rn played a dominant role in the determination of the groundwater discharge to river it was mainly because the inert chemical characteristic of 222rn itself and also the quite large concentration difference between the groundwater and surface water which both made it an ideal tool in the investigation of groundwater and surface water interaction the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and hydrochemical parameters also provided evidences in the recognition of the interaction though it seemed not to be as sensitive or evident as that of 222rn in response to such interaction in the present cases to sum up the combination of multi tracers seems to be an ideal way to study the groundwater surface water interactions in this study area and other similar areas 5 conclusions the measurements of multi hydrochemical and environmental isotopes d 18o and 222rn tracers were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers tiangeli river and nomhon river in the nomhon area southeast qaidam basin northwest china the average 222rn concentration of groundwater springs and river water was about 16 849 9686 and 1342 bq m3 respectively in the area with a decrease order of groundwater spring river a background of the 222rn concentration in the upstream of the nomhon river was determined to be with a relatively low level about 43 bq m3 in contrast the 222rn concentration of river water was high and reached up to 519 bq m3 in the midstream of nomhon river and 8205 bq m3 in the tiangeli river showing a distinct difference two interaction zones between groundwater and surface water were deduced from 222rn measurements combining with stable isotopic compositions δd and δ18o and hydrochemical parameters hydrochemical type tds and ec one is a total recharge zone about 10 15 km along the tiangeli river in the west edge of the nomhon alluvial lacustrine plain where the river was totally fed by springs and groundwater discharge the other is a partial recharge zone about 10 km at 26 to 36 km along the nomhon river in the alluvial plain where the river got its partial recharge from groundwater discharge the maximum groundwater discharge estimated using 222rn mass balance model was 0 37 m3 s in a distance of approximately 2 1 km along the river stretches in the midstream of nomhon river during the sampling period accounting for 8 2 of the river discharge this study demonstrated the combined use of multi tracers and the results of the study could be useful to the

7030,understanding the interaction between groundwater and surface water is of vital significance for the sustainable management of water resources in arid and semi arid areas in this study multi environmental tracers hydrochemical parameters stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and radioactive 222rn were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers tiangeli river and nomhon river in the nomhon area southeast of the arid qaidam basin northwest china here we observed that the 222rn concentration of waters were distinctly different with a decrease order of groundwater spring river in this area along the tiangeli river the 222rn concentrations of groundwater springs and river water were about 12 120 17 407 3013 15 819 and 809 8205 bq m3 respectively this river was characterized by the high 222rn concentration of the river water and was investigated to be mainly fed by springs and groundwater discharge along the nomhon river 222rn concentration of groundwater and river water was about 6772 60 369 and 14 519 bq m3 respectively an average background of the 222rn concentration in the upstream of the river was determined to be about 43 bq m3 a high 222rn concentration zone along the river appeared in the midstream with a peak value of 519 bq m3 and a distance about 10 km indicating that groundwater discharged to the nomhon river in the alluvial plain a 222rn mass balance model was constructed to estimate the groundwater discharge into the river showing a maximum groundwater discharge of 0 37 m3 s in the midstream of nomhon river during the sampling period the stable isotopic compositions δd and δ18o and hydrochemical characteristics hydrochemical type tds and ec showed corresponding changes along these two rivers which also provided evidences for the groundwater surface water interactions in the nomhon area keywords groundwater surface water interactions 222rn stable isotopes hydrochemistry qaidam basin 1 introduction the groundwater surface water interactions are pretty common in large inland basins playing an absolutely necessary role in maintaining the ecosystem of river basins kalbus et al 2006 it is crucial to understand the relationship between groundwater and surface water for sustainable utilization and management of the precious water resources especially in the arid and semi arid areas numerous researches have been conducted on the groundwater surface water interactions reviews see kalbus et al 2006 unland et al 2013 generally focusing on areas such as sources identification hydrologic dynamics of interchanges and exchange characteristics of water quality and quantity etc stellato et al 2008 xu et al 2017 liao et al 2018 various methods and techniques have been developed making great contributions to promoting advances in above studies the most frequently used approaches include the environmental isotopic tracers hydrogen and oxygen lambs 2004 chen et al 2006 xu et al 2017 strontium negrel et al 2003 paces and wurster 2014 radium kraemer 2005 and radon cook et al 2003 wu et al 2004 martinez et al 2015 su et al 2015 chemical components such as anions and cations

hydrologic parameters monitoring by piezometer kelly and murdoch 2003 and seepage meters landon et al 2001 as well as numerical modeling or simulations liang et al 2003 scibek et al 2007 fleckenstein et al 2010 conclusions have been drawn that limitations and uncertainties of different methods and the measurement scale effects should be taken into considerations when selecting appropriate methods and materials kalbus et al 2006 therefore the multi scale approaches combining different techniques that can considerably reduce uncertainties are highly recommended in the studies on groundwater and surface water interactions radioactive isotope 222rn with short half life 3 83 days is a natural conservative tracer widely used to investigate the exchange between groundwater and surface water cook et al 2003 santos et al 2010 dimova et al 2013 the sources of 222rn in groundwater include the recoil supply from the decay of 226ra in the aquifer production from 226ra adsorbed and in solution however the latter were insignificant and often neglected carvalho et al 2014 the 222rn in groundwater is mainly removed by decay for surface water without recharge from groundwater the sources of 222rn are production from 226ra in water and sediment diffusion which were often insignificant wu et al 2004 zhang et al 2015 the sinks of 222rn in surface water include decay and atmospheric losses the 222rn concentration in groundwater is often 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that in surface water dimova and burnett 2011 this significant difference enables researchers to identify the exchange between groundwater and surface water stable isotopes of hydrogen deuterium or d and oxygen 18o carry the information of water circulation recharge and discharge that makes these two common stable isotopes quite useful to identify the sources of different types of water which are widely used in hydrological and hydrogeological studies in recent decades clark and fritz 1997 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 gat 2010 gu et al 2011 qian et al 2014 xu et al 2017 like those in many other places in the arid qaidam basin qb water shortage has been becoming an increasing concern in the sustainable development in the nomhon area which calls for an integrated and optimized management and utilization of groundwater and surface water resources a good understanding of groundwater surface water interactions would be of great significance for such efforts in the present study we employed natural radioactive isotope of radon 222rn together with stable isotopes of hydrogen d and oxygen 18o and hydrochemical parameters to identify the interactions between groundwater and surface water in the nomhon area one of the alluvial lacustrine plains in se qb 2 study area the study area is located in the southeast of the qaidam basin northwest china the basin is a huge endorheic basin that covers an area of approximately 120 000 km2 kezao and bowler 1986 rohrmann et al 2013 in the northwest of the tibetan plateau tp fig 1 the nomhon area is extremely arid with an average annual evaporation of about 2651 2 mm the mean annual air temperature and precipitation in the plain 2700 3000 m asl are about 4 5 c and 42 7 mm respectively water in nomhon comes mainly from precipitation melting glacier and snow from the southern mountainous area 3200 5300 m asl the burhan budai mountain in summer the burhan budai mountain is a part of the east kunlun mountains which acts as the origin of various resources and the south barrier of the qaidam basin in the nomhon area the strata were mainly made up of the bedrock of granite and granodiorite in the mountainous area in the south and the quaternary layers from the piedmont area to the plain area for the current known depth wang et al 2008 the quaternary sediments of clay with poor permeability gravel and sand with good permeability act as the aquitard and aquifer respectively fig 2 the quaternary aquifers changed from the single layered unconfined aquifer in the piedmont area and the alluvial proluvial fan to multi layered confined aquifers in the alluvial lacustrine plain from south to north wang et al 2008 groundwater got recharged mainly from precipitation and melt water runoff of glacier and snow of the mountainous area in the south and flowed toward northwest into the terminal lake the salt northern and southern huobuxun lakes groundwater discharged by means of evaporation springs recharging rivers and human pumping the depth of groundwater table changed from about 100 m to less than 5 m from the piedmont area in the south to the lower plain in the north yang et al 2016 according to the geomorphic and hydrogeological features the study area could be divided into the following zones from south to north i the mountainous zone where the recharge areas were located ii the alluvial proluvial fan located in the piedmont area where the aquifer was mainly comprised of gravel and poorly graded sand with the phreatic groundwater of low water table iii the alluvial plain located in the lower plain where the aquifers featured by multi layered confined and semi confined groundwater in intermediate and well graded sand iv the lacustrine plain located in the central plain where the aquifers characterized by multi layered confined groundwater in fine sand fig 2 there are two major rivers in the nomhon area one is the nomhon river in the central axis of the alluvial lacustrine plain and the other is the tiangeli river in the west edge of the plain the two rivers are about 15 20 km apart fig 1 both of the rivers are perennial rivers and flow from south to north taking the salt huobuxun lakes to the northwest as the terminal discharge the nomhon river is one of the water resources that provide the irrigation water for the nomhon farmland in front edge of the alluvial plain where the red and black wolfberries were cultivated the average annual runoff depth of the nomhon river is about 41 6 mm which relatively equals to the mean annual precipitation but less than the average annual evaporation wang et al 2008 besides the qaidam river a regional intermittent river of the qaidam basin to the north of nomhon which flows from southeast to the huobuxun lakes runs through the study area during the flood periods 3 material and methods 3 1 field sampling forty sets of samples of groundwater rain river and spring were collected in the nomhon area in august and september 2017 along two hydrogeological sections approximately along the two rivers section n and section t fig 1 along the nomhon river in section n 23 samples were collected including river water samples from the mountain pass to the river bend toward to west groundwater samples from the phreatic water wells with the well depth about 80 150 m along the midstream and artesian wells with the well depth about 150 400 m and along the tiangeli river in section t 16 sampling sites contained river sites spring and shallow domestic wells about 25 m in depth of local herdsman the only sample of rain was collected in sampling site of w4 in the nomhon farmland during the fieldwork periods fig 1 in the afternoon of 8th sept 2017 groundwater samples of artesian wells were directly collected by tubes and groundwater samples of shallow and phreatic water wells were taken after at least 5 times volume of stagnant water in the borehole was pumped out at the same time parameters such as the electrical conductivity ec and ph of groundwater were observed to be relatively stable before sampling to make sure that the pumped water can be representative river water samples were collected at the depth of about 10 15 cm below the surface of water spring water samples were collected under the surface of water as close to the overflowing point with rising air bubbles as possible 3 2 in situ measurements and lab analysis the electrical conductivity of water was measured in situ by eureka manta 2 portable multi parameter instrument for water quality the analyses of major ions of water samples were performed with thermo scientific dionex ion chromatograph ics 1100 the anion cation charge balance was checked to be of 5 for all samples water samples of δd and δ18o were analyzed by lgr water vapor isotope analyzer berman et al 2009 in china university of geosciences beijing and reported relative to the vsmow standard vienna standard mean ocean water in permil the analytical error is less than 0 2 and 0 06 for δd and δ18o respectively some of the samples were also analyzed with picarro l2130 i isotope analyzer at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology shijiazhuang the results showed that the data difference is less than 2 between these two analyzers which also guaranteed the reliability of isotopic data in this paper in this paper we used the latter results during analysis and discussion the analysis of 222rn concentrations were performed by a portable radon instrumentation rad 7 durridge usa via α decay accounts the in situ water sample of 250 ml was collected to detect the radon activity concentration in groundwater by rad h2o system schmidt et al 2010 luo et al 2016 the internal pump of the rad 7 extracts radon from groundwater and the radon circulates to the rad 7 detector in the rad h2o system for radon concentration analysis in surface water big bottle system 2 5 l an accessory to the rad 7 radon monitor was used the analyses of 222rn samples were performed in situ or within 12 h after sampled indoor the measuring error is about 13 for groundwater and about 34 for surface water with low concentrations of 222rn 600 bq m3 3 3 222rn mass balance model to estimate the groundwater discharge into rivers a 222rn mass balance model was constructed in river stretches between river sampling sites in the midstream of nomhon river based on the 222rn mass conservation theory danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 in which the gas exchange and radioactive decay of 222rn in both river and groundwater discharge were taken into account the model can be expressed as follows stellato et al 2008 su et al 2015 1 r n d q r r n gw 1 exp α l l α q gw r n u exp α l q r q gw 2 α λ v d 0 5 v 0 5 h 1 5 where rnd rnu and rngw are 222rn concentrations measured in the downstream upstream river and groundwater respectively bq m3 qr and qgw are river and groundwater discharge respectively m3 s α is 222rn loss coefficient caused by both radioactive decay and gas exchange and it was explained by the surface renewal theory danckwerts 1951 o connor and dobbins 1958 for the gas exchange part l is the distance between two stream sampling sites m v is the average stream velocity between two stream sampling sites m s h is the stream depth m λ is 222rn radioactive decay coefficient λ 2 08 10 6 s 1 d is radon molecular diffusivity cm2 s log d 980 t 1 59 and t is absolute water temperature k thus the groundwater discharge qgw and its proportion in river discharge qgw qr can be calculated by solving the equation 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical distribution characteristics the data of in situ measured ph and ec lab analyzed tds and hydrochemical types of all water samples were shown in table 1 the major ions of water samples were shown with a piper diagram fig 3 in general most samples plotted together with similar hydrochemical types except 7 samples of section n g01 m164 and ck8 and t w9 s5 s7 and s8 in the nomhon area the major hydrochemical types were the cl hco3 na mg ca cl so4 hco3 na ca mg and cl hco3 na ca types for major anions chloride cl ranked the highest proportion followed by bicarbonate hco3 and sulfate so4 2 and for major cations sodium na ranked the highest proportion followed by calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 the rest 7 samples showed two hydrochemcal types one was the cl na type and the other was the cl hco3 na or hco3 cl na type those 7 samples were collected in the groundwater middle downgradient and longtime water rock interaction such as lixiviation with salt sediments might contribute to the formation of groundwater chemistry sheng et al 2017 the ph of all water samples ranged from 7 2 to 9 0 with an average of 8 2 indicating that the water in this area was mainly alkaline water in the study area tds varied with a wide range from 413 2 fresh to 19 604 4 mg l brackish and averaged 1373 5 mg l for all water samples table 1 so did ec measured in situ which varied from 600 9 to 31 620 0 μs cm with an average of about 2585 9 μs cm besides tds and ec data derived a very good linear relationship fig 4 a with r2 0 9988 p 0 001 indicating that the parameters measured in the field and lab matched very well thus we can use tds data to represent corresponding changes of ec along the tiangeli river tds or ec of all surface water and groundwater including spring samples had quite similar values with a slightly increasing trend along the river stretch except w9 and s5 fig 4 a it varied from 413 2 to 788 5 mg l with an average of 540 7 mg l they also had similar hydrochemical types that characterized by cl hco3 na ca mg and cl hco3 na ca types the hydrochemical similarities may reflect the fact that the tiangeli river was mainly fed by springs and groundwater in other forms groundwater sample w9 and spring sample s5 had relatively higher tds 1536 1 mg l and 2215 9 mg l respectively with the hydrochemical types of cl na table 1 fig 3 indicating that the sampled water might have extra salt sources from the lixiviation of minerals in the underlying subsurface sheng et al 2017 along the nomhon river tds or ec of surface water and groundwater varied along the river stretch fig 4 b the average tds of river water samples about 671 8 mg l was a little bit higher than that of groundwater about 559 1 mg l along the upstream and midstream except w6 of 2010 7 mg l which might be caused by the lixiviation and evaporation but was much lower than that of artesian groundwater in the lacustrine plain about 8913 9 mg l besides in the beginning of the midstream the river tds represented a sharp decrease from r5 638 4 mg l to r6 539 1 mg l compared with the last sample r4 655 8 mg l of the upstream within this distance groundwater with lower tds also showed a sharp decrease from w4 598 4 mg l to w5 491 7 mg l compared with the last groundwater sample w3 628 4 mg l along the upstream thus the midstream tds decrease might probably be attributed to the mixing with low tds groundwater in the beginning of the midstream moreover the hydrochemical type of river changed from cl so4 na ca type r4 to cl so4 hco3 na ca r5 and cl so4 hco3 ca na mg types r6 showing an increase of hco3 and mg2 proportions that might be due to the mixing with groundwater of cl hco3 na mg ca and cl hco3 na ca mg types within the same distance hence these hydrochemical changes might probably reflect that groundwater discharged into the river in the midstream segment 4 2 stable isotopic compositions of hydrogen δd and oxygen δ18o the stable isotopic compositions δ18o and δd of water samples in the study area were shown in fig 5 and table 1 in general the isotopic values of all water samples ranged from 92 0 to 22 4 for δd and from 12 8 to 4 1 for δ18o in the study area all samples plotted along both the global craig 1961 and local sun 1990 meteoric water lines gmwl and lmwl indicating that the precipitation modern or and pre modern was the recharge source of waters in nomhon the equation for the lmwl δd 7 862 δ18o 11 05 is similar to that of gmwl δd 8 δ18o 10 but with a much lower slope showing an arid area feature clark and fritz 1997 in the nomhon area different types of waters showed distinct isotopic compositions fig 5 i the rain water sample rain1 was with enriched isotopic composition δd 22 4 δ18o 4 1 and plotted on the top right of the lmwl showing a quite distinct characteristics with other samples fig 5 it might be due to the sampling date in summer ii the surface river water samples were plotted in two centralized locations in fig 5 the enriched location for the nomhon river and the depleted location for the tiangeli river the difference of isotopic compositions between these two locations could be resulted from the diffident recharge sources with different altitude or and recharge temperature note that the groundwater and some of spring samples had similar isotopic compositions to that of the tiangeli river samples with depleted locations which could be an evidence of groundwater discharge to the river iii groundwater and spring samples scattered along the gmwl and lmwl from the alluvial proluvial fan to the alluvial lacustrine plain the isotopic compositions of groundwater became more and more depleted which could be attributed to different recharge conditions from warm temperature or and low altitude to cool temperature or and high altitude what s more the groundwater residence time from young to old and microbial communities also showed corresponding changes liu et al 2014 sheng et al 2017 xiao et al 2017 the deuterium excess d excess which was defined by d excess δd 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 was commonly used as one of the useful tools to study the features of water vapor sources such as the humidity of vapor source region or the evaporation effect during rainfall clark and fritz 1997 in the nomhon area d excess of all water samples varied with a large scale from 3 2 to 15 7 and with an average of 13 0 it was larger than the intercept of gmwl 10 for most samples 10 3 15 7 except r8 7 4 ck8 8 0 and m164 3 2 which might indicate that the primary evaporation was controlled by the low humidity in the vapor source region kendall and mcdonnell 1998 sample r8 was likely affected by the evaporation effect on river samples of ck8 and m164 were both from artesian wells in the lacustrine plain featured by the long residence time more than 18 ka bp liu et al 2014 and high tds 6515 2 19604 4 mg l they might be attributed by the water rock interactions with a deep groundwater circulation and other complex effects e g different water vapor source with high humidity which made these two samples characterized by an 18o shift like change clark and fritz 1997 fig 6 showed that sections n and t also had different features of the δd and δ18o compositions of all water samples along the tiangeli river fig 6 a and nomhon river fig 6 b respectively for the range of isotopic composition samples of section n scattered with a large scale from 92 0 to 64 6 for δd and 12 5 to 9 0 for δ18o whereas samples of section t centralized with a relatively small scale from 88 5 to 77 3 for δd and 12 8 to 11 6 for δ18o fig 5 table 1 heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are relatively enriched in the former section but depleted in the latter for most of water samples in section t most of samples except s7 and s8 lied together with relatively depleted heavy isotopes fig 5 along the tiangeli river flow path δd and δ18o of all samples seemed to be rarely changed fig 6 a samples of groundwater spring and river water shared relatively similar distributions of δd from 83 2 to 77 3 and δ18o from 12 2 to 11 6 moreover the δd and δ18o changes along the river stretch represented an obvious relationship among different types of water groundwater spring river though the difference was not large according to the isotopic data table 1 the average δd was about 82 5 80 2 and 79 9 respectively and the average δ18o was about 12 1 11 9 and 11 8 respectively as the tiangeli river was mainly fed by springs groundwater the above phenomenon could be resulted from the isotopic fractionation due to the evaporation effect from a close to open system which enriched the heavy isotopic compositions from groundwater to river water s7 and s8 were two spring samples from top of the shell bar that beside the downstream to the north fig 1 these two spring samples showed quite depleted isotopic compositions that were similar to that of confined groundwater in the lacustrine plain the previous studies indicated that the two springs were with a long residence time about 21 ka bp apparent age recorded by low radioactive isotopes of 14c 7 92 pmc percent modern carbon and tritium 1 tu tritium unit liu et al 2014 hence the springs on the shell bar were inferred to be recharged from groundwater of confined aquifers with an ancient age in section n samples of river water and groundwater have distinct compositions of δd and δ18o along the nomhon river figs 5 and 6 b i the river water was with more enriched heavy isotopes than groundwater ii the river water samples showed a generally increasing trend from 74 0 to 64 6 for δd and 10 9 to 10 0 for δ18o which indicated an evaporation effect clark and fritz 1997 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 along the river stretch iii groundwater samples generally presented a decreasing trend with more depleted heavy isotopes from 92 0 to 73 9 for δd and 12 5 to 10 7 for δ18o iv in the beginning of the midstream a drop of river isotopic values from 26 km could be attributed to the mixing with groundwater discharge featured by more negative isotopic values which was shown by the similar isotopic compositions of δd and δ18o between the midstream r5 r6 and r9 and groundwater w4 w5 and w6 v phreatic groundwater samples from the relatively shallow wells along the upstream and midstream were more enriched of heavy isotopes than that of confined groundwater samples from artesian wells along the downstream and in the lacustrine plain vi the phreatic groundwater also showed a slight evaporation effect with relatively increasing δd and δ18o 4 3 222rn concentrations in surface water and groundwater in the study area the 222rn concentration in water samples showed a very wide scale ranging from 26 to 60 369 bq m3 it was about 14 8205 3013 15 819 and 3013 60 369 bq m3 for samples of river springs and groundwater respectively table 1 and the average 222rn concentration was about 1342 9686 and 16 849 bq m3 for samples of river groundwater and springs respectively the distributions of the 222rn concentration were shown with graphs fig 7 along the tiangeli river fig 7 a and nomhon river fig 7 b all water samples could be divided into two groups one group with relatively high 222rn concentration reaching several thousand bq m3 809 60 369 bq m3 about 11 078 bq m3 for the average and the other group with comparatively low 222rn concentration less than 600 bq m3 14 519 bq m3 about 120 bq m3 for the average the former group consists of groundwater samples along the nomhon river in section n and the whole water samples along the tiangeli river in section t whereas the latter group is only comprised of samples of the nomhon river in section n usually the natural river without extra recharge of 222rn or 226ra from groundwater or lithology of geological layers has very low 222rn concentration in the present study the average 222rn concentration of samples of the nomhon river from the mountain pass to the alluvial proluvial fan from r1 to r4 fig 2 about 43 bq m3 from 36 to 50 bq m3 could be regarded as the background concentration of 222rn in natural river in the nomhon area by contrast other river samples were about several to thousand times higher than the background 222rn concentration in river water suggesting very obvious differences detailed distribution characteristics and reasons of the differences would be discussed as follows along the tiangeli river in section t the 222rn concentration is quite similar between groundwater including springs and river water fig 7 a the 222rn concentration of all water samples generally decreased from 17 407 bq m3 to 809 bq m3 for groundwater it decreased from 17 407 to 12 120 bq m3 with an average value of 15 380 bq m3 for springs it varied from 15 819 to 3013 bq m3 with an average value of 9686 bq m3 for river water it drops from 8205 to 809 bq m3 along the flow path with an average of about 3583 bq m3 the 222rn concentration of the tiangeli river was about ten to hundred times higher than that of the nomhon river indicating that the tiangeli river is mainly formed by groundwater discharge our field investigation showed that the original source of this river was a spring no any other riverheads or sources were found to the south and other directions bubbles could be seen clearly going out of the bottom of deposits in the spring together with outcropped groundwater within about 5 km north from the first springhead more springheads with larger area and quantity were found along the river stretch besides the tiangeli river keeps running for all seasons showing a quite steady recharge quantity from the underground aquifer hence the tiangeli river could be determined to be a spring fed river moreover the 222rn concentration represented a relationship among different types water along the river stretch groundwater spring river fig 7 a and it showed a decreasing trend along the flow path for all types of water this phenomenon could be attributed to 222rn loss from the radioactive decay and gas exchange 222rn loss in groundwater was mainly affected by the 222rn radioactive decay however when groundwater flowed out from a close system to an open system of the outcropped springs and river the dissolved 222rn concentration would decrease due to 222rn loss from both radioactive decay and gas exchange with ambient air and the 222rn concentration in river water showed more 222rn loss than that in spring water along the nomhon river in section n the river water and groundwater had quite distinct 222rn concentrations fig 7 b i the river 222rn concentration ranged from 14 to 519 bq m3 and it generally increased firstly and then decreased with a peak value reaching up to 519 bq m3 from south to north the groundwater 222rn concentration ranged from 6772 to 60 369 bq m3 with an average of about 17 582 bq m3 and it was about 2 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the river ii the 222rn concentration of the nomhon river showed different characteristics in the upstream midstream and downstream for different distances of flow path in the upstream about 0 26 km from the mountain pass it increased from 36 to 50 bq m3 showing no extra recharge of 222rn in the midstream the 222rn concentration increased from 14 7 to 519 177 bq m3 at about 26 31 6 km and then decreased to 56 15 bq m3 at about 31 9 36 km higher than that of the background concentration of the nomhon river indicating that extra recharge of 222rn had joined into the river water in this zone in the downstream from about 36 km north to the river bend no sample was collected because it was so hard to get close to the river the various changes in the different parts of stream revealed that for about 10 km in the midstream 26 36 km the nomhon river received the groundwater discharge as one of its recharge origins iii the 222rn concentration of groundwater presented a relatively decreasing trend from south sample w4 10 396 bq m3 to north sample g01 6772 bq m3 and from phreatic to artesian groundwater which might be resulted from the distinct 226ra contents in aquifer materials in different locations along groundwater flow path the maximum 222rn concentration was found in sample m164 60 369 bq m3 suggesting that 222rn of groundwater about 200 m deep underground in the north part of the lacustrine plain might have different source that had high level of 222rn or and 226ra concentration 4 4 interactions between groundwater and surface water in the nomhon area the groundwater and surface river water interactions were mainly recognized by 222rn isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and hydrochemical parameters combining with hydrogeological characteristics along two rivers the groundwater discharge to surface water was observed along both the tiangeli and nomhon rivers two river gaining zones zones that river gained water from groundwater discharge featured by both patterns of total and partial recharge to river from groundwater were recognized the former one was along the tiangeli river and the latter one was along the midstream of the nomhon river on the one hand a total river gaining zone was observed along the tiangeli river it was about 10 15 km long from south to north where the springs and groundwater discharge formed a total and only recharge to river along the river stretch all river water samples showed nearly the same characteristics of 222rn concentration stable isotopic compositions δd and δ18o and hydrochemical parameters with groundwater from shallow wells and springs except s7 and s8 to the downstream away from other sampling sites moreover this river keeps running with a relatively steady water level and runoff in all seasons hence we could know that the tiangeli river was totally recharged by groundwater and springs in other words we could call the tiangeli river a spring fed river on the other hand a partial river gaining zone was obtained along the nomhon river it was about 10 km long 26 to 36 km in the alluvial plain where the river was partially recharged by groundwater as evidenced by the measurements of 222rn stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen as well as hydrochemical items firstly the 222rn concentration in river water sharply increased that could be due to the mixing with groundwater of high 222rn concentration secondly the stable isotopic compositions of river water became more depleted that might be due to the mixing with groundwater of relatively depleted isotopic values thirdly the hydrochemical parameters also showed probably changes that might be affected by this kind of interaction the hydrochemical type of river water changed from the cl so4 na ca type to the cl so4 hco3 na ca and cl so4 hco3 ca na mg types showing an increasing of hco3 and mg2 proportions that might be due to the mixing with groundwater of the cl hco3 na mg ca and cl hco3 na ca mg types whereas the river tds represented a decrease after mixing with low tds groundwater in the beginning part of this zone what s more the groundwater table was 0 5 m deep and outcropped groundwater was found aside the midstream of nomhon river showing a potential for groundwater discharge into the river in this zone according to the above discussions the river gaining zone in this section was determined it should be noticed that the recharge from groundwater was not a total pattern but a partial one which was distinct from the situation along the tiangeli river to illustrate the highest river 222rn concentration only reached at about 519 bq m3 much less than that of the tiangeli river average about 3583 bq m3 which represented the total recharge pattern otherwise the 222rn concentration of river water samples would be similar to that of groundwater about several thousand bq m3 so were the isotopic compositions and hydrochemical parameters just like what the tiangeli river showed thus we could infer that the groundwater discharge was only a partial and non dominant recharge to the nomhon river to sum up a partial river gaining zone along the nomhon river for about 10 km was determined in order to quantify the groundwater discharge qgw and its proportion in river discharge qgw qr a 222rn mass balance model was constructed in the midstream of nomhon river according to eqs 1 and 2 during calculation d was calculated to be 1 17 10 9 m2 s at 293 15 k 20 c α was calculated to be 5 9 10 4 m 1 from eq 2 rngw was represented by the average 222rn concentration 10 607 bq m3 of phreatic groundwater in w4 10 369 bq m3 and w6 10 818 bq m3 and qr 1 5 22 5 m3 s was calculated by the stream velocity and measured cross sectional area the groundwater discharge qgw ranged from 0 003 to 0 37 m3 s along the midstream of nomhon river and the proportion of groundwater discharge in river discharge qgw qr ranged from 0 2 to 8 2 the maximum groundwater discharge 0 37 m3 s for qgw and 8 2 for qgw qr to the nomhon river occurred from r8 to r10 for about 2 1 km during the sampling period in other words the max average groundwater discharge flux per distance for the width of about 30 m was 1 76 10 4 m3 s m in the midstream of nomhon river in this study the uncertainties of estimation on groundwater discharge to river could result from the analyses errors of 222rn concentration in river water 34 and groundwater 13 as well as uncertainties from manually measurement of stream parameters the study demonstrated that the radioactive tracer 222rn played a dominant role in the determination of the groundwater discharge to river it was mainly because the inert chemical characteristic of 222rn itself and also the quite large concentration difference between the groundwater and surface water which both made it an ideal tool in the investigation of groundwater and surface water interaction the stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and hydrochemical parameters also provided evidences in the recognition of the interaction though it seemed not to be as sensitive or evident as that of 222rn in response to such interaction in the present cases to sum up the combination of multi tracers seems to be an ideal way to study the groundwater surface water interactions in this study area and other similar areas 5 conclusions the measurements of multi hydrochemical and environmental isotopes d 18o and 222rn tracers were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers tiangeli river and nomhon river in the nomhon area southeast qaidam basin northwest china the average 222rn concentration of groundwater springs and river water was about 16 849 9686 and 1342 bq m3 respectively in the area with a decrease order of groundwater spring river a background of the 222rn concentration in the upstream of the nomhon river was determined to be with a relatively low level about 43 bq m3 in contrast the 222rn concentration of river water was high and reached up to 519 bq m3 in the midstream of nomhon river and 8205 bq m3 in the tiangeli river showing a distinct difference two interaction zones between groundwater and surface water were deduced from 222rn measurements combining with stable isotopic compositions δd and δ18o and hydrochemical parameters hydrochemical type tds and ec one is a total recharge zone about 10 15 km along the tiangeli river in the west edge of the nomhon alluvial lacustrine plain where the river was totally fed by springs and groundwater discharge the other is a partial recharge zone about 10 km at 26 to 36 km along the nomhon river in the alluvial plain where the river got its partial recharge from groundwater discharge the maximum groundwater discharge estimated using 222rn mass balance model was 0 37 m3 s in a distance of approximately 2 1 km along the river stretches in the midstream of nomhon river during the sampling period accounting for 8 2 of the river discharge this study demonstrated the combined use of multi tracers and the results of the study could be useful to the

7031,in tropical karstic regions knowledge about the timing and quantity of land ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes is important as those nutrients may affect sensitive coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs high permeability of karst aquifers combined with high discharge during heavy rain events lead to a close connectivity between groundwater in the hinterland and the coastal zone alteration between dry and wet periods can lead to a temporal variability of groundwater discharge volume and its associated nutrient fluxes we studied the seasonal variability of land ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes in the tropical karstic region of gunung kidul southern java indonesia from november 2015 to december 2016 satellite thermal infrared imagery revealed two major areas of direct submarine and coastal groundwater discharge nutrient fluxes were estimated at the largest coastal spring using a discharge dataset from a subsurface river dam and a monthly record of nutrient concentrations sampled from the spring nitrate fluxes ranged from 6 106 245 106 mol day dissolved silicon fluxes from 58 106 546 106 mol day and phosphate fluxes from 17 103 1571 103 mol day nutrient fluxes are mostly controlled by discharge and show a high variability through time extraordinarily high nitrate and phosphate fluxes were observed after a period of constant and heavy rain most likely a nutrient pool in the top soil in the hinterland from untreated sewage or fertilizer is flushed during rain events through the aquifer to the coast in tropical karstic regions sudden inputs of large amounts of nutrients via groundwater discharge may affect coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs making them especially vulnerable during high discharge events keywords groundwater discharge nutrients tropical karst ecosystems sgd seasonal 1 introduction groundwater discharge into the coastal ocean occurs along the worlds coastlines at the land ocean interface and has been identified as an important source of nutrients to many coastal ecosystems szymczycha et al 2012 rodellas et al 2015 tamborski et al 2017 nutrients delivered to coastal ecosystem via groundwater discharge can lead to a shift in phytoplankton community structure degradation of health of coral reefs and seagrass beds as reported in a number of locations all over the world lapointe 1997 lecher et al 2015 amato et al 2016 in tropical karstic regions high groundwater discharge is expected due to high aquifer permeability coupled to a high recharge during the wet season and heavy rain events combined with high groundwater nutrient concentrations e g transported from the unsaturated soil into the aquifer and low retention times of nutrients in the aquifer these conditions lead to high groundwater nutrient fluxes moosdorf et al 2015 nutrient inputs into groundwater from anthropogenic sources in the hinterland such as fertilizers or sewage may thus rapidly reach the coastal ocean tamborski et al 2017 these conditions may further lead to temporal variations with high and low land ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes arandacirerol et al 2006 mallast et al 2013 sensitive coastal ecosystems along tropical karstic coasts e g coral reefs may thus be affected by sudden inputs of large amounts of nutrients via groundwater discharge several studies describe the transport of nutrients via groundwater towards

1994 barbados lewis 1987 and guam redding et al 2013 while some studies investigated their temporal variability lewis 1987 lapointe et al 1990 arandacirerol et al 2006 tapia gonzález et al 2008 southeast asia belongs to one of the regions with the strongest human modifications in the coastal zone elvidge et al 1997 where significant groundwater nutrient fluxes to the coastal zone were observed in bangkok manila and jepara burnett et al 2007 taniguchi et al 2008 adyasari et al 2018 however a seasonal record of groundwater nutrient fluxes from a karstic region in southeast asia has not yet been investigated even though one of the strongest impacts on coastal ecosystems can be expected in these regions hence at the example of the tropical karstic coastal area of gunung kidul southern java indonesia we investigated the seasonal behavior of groundwater nutrient fluxes to the ocean 2 study site 2 1 climate geology and land use the karstic region of gunung kidul is located in southern central java indonesia the area has a tropical climate with a mean annual temperature of 27 c haryono and day 2004 a high humidity of 80 flathe and pfeiffer 1965 and an annual precipitation of up to 2000 mm brunsch et al 2011 the amount of precipitation is controlled by the australian indonesian summer monsoon brunsch et al 2011 the wet season lasts from november until april with precipitation rates of 150 350 mm per month during dry season may until october precipitation rates are much lower with 25 150 mm per month brunsch et al 2011 the el niño southern oscillation enso has a considerable impact on the amount of annual rainfall aldrian and dwi susanto 2003 while during el niño years the wet season starts later in the year and during the dry season precipitation is below average aldrian and dwi susanto 2003 during la niña the rainy season lasts longer with larger amounts of rainfall brunsch et al 2011 three different geological sections can be distinguished in the study area the north and north east section comprise mountain ranges fig 1 which mainly consist of sediments and volcanic deposits of eocene and miocene age further to the south the miocene wonosari formations represent the second section which mainly consists of bedded lagoonal limestones sir macdonald and partners 1984 the third section the gunung sewu area is morphologically known for its mature kegelkarst hills common to all is the southward dipping towards the indian ocean at the coast cliffs with heights of 25 100 m are composed of strongly karstified massive coral reef limestone with intercalated clay and volcanic ash lenses van bemmelen 1949 flathe and pfeiffer 1965 waltham et al 1983 haryono and day 2004 the combination of low rainfall amounts during dry season and quick infiltration due to strong karstification leads to severe water scarcity mainly in the southern kegelkarst area consequently more than 250 000 people depend on onshore coastal and submarine karstic springs rain water cisterns water trucks or subsurface rivers as water resource sir macdonald and partners 1984 matthies et al 2016 moosdorf and oehler 2017 this is one reason why the region is considered to be one of the poorest regions in indonesia with a relatively low population density of 388 inhabitants per km2 in the coastal area dittmann et al 2011 at bribin sindon the karst river is dammed up by a concrete barrage which completely closed the elliptic cross section of the cave creating an underground water storage which is managed by means of a hydropower driven pumping system this hydropower plant supplies water for more than 75 000 people in the area more than 90 of the population depends on agriculture often with less than 0 3 ha land per family dry farming with soy corn peanuts and cassava is the dominant type of land use some families additionally have cattle to work on the fields and as source for manure artificial fertilizer is mainly applied in addition to cattle manure to balance the nutrient deficiency of the soils wastewater in gunung kidul is partly discharged directly into the subsurface or collected in unsealed septic tanks fach and fuchs 2010 nayono et al 2010 additionally solid waste enters into the underground river system via sinkholes nayono 2014 2 2 subsurface hydrology perennial rivers are absent in the coastal area and scarce in the whole gunung kidul due to high karst permeability considerable surface runoff only takes place after major rain events in the underground however a complex network of caves and conduits has developed due to karstification consequently subsurface discharge dominates the area groundwater flow paths and discharge rates in the area were mapped in the recent years sir macdonald and partners 1984 eiche et al 2012 fig 1 and electronic supplementary material also flow paths between subsurface rivers and coastal springs could be negotiated fig 1 red dotted lines the coastal freshwater spring at pantai baron is connected with the wonosari bribin baron aquifer system in the hinterland which is fed by different small rivers from the volcanic panggung masif in the north sir macdonald and partners 1984 discharge measured at the 25 km upstream located subsurface river dam bribin sindon reaches pantai baron with a travel time of 14 days during dry season sir macdonald and partners 1984 and 4 days during wet season as deduced from a tracer test eiche et al 2012 in addition several smaller tributaries feed the freshwater spring see electronic supplementary material discharge rates have been measured continuously every 10 min at the subsurface river dam bribin sindon since 2010 and discharge varies between 1 m3 s in the dry and up to 12 m3 s in the wet season oberle et al 2016 groundwater in gunung kidul was classified as ca hco3 dominated with varying hydrochemistry between the wet and the dry season eiche et al 2016 during the dry season diffuse matrix flow is dominant and assures a year round flow of water during wet season matrix flow is regularly overprinted by piston flow and recharge occurs dominantly through larger cracks and sinkholes these conditions are also reflected in the physio chemistry of the groundwater with higher electrical conductivity ec values during matrix flow conditions and a rapid decline in ec as discharge increases eiche et al 2016 3 material and methods 3 1 investigation of groundwater discharge to the ocean groundwater discharge towards and into the ocean was investigated based on precipitation data discharge measured at the subsurface river dam bribin sindon remote sensing and by physio chemistry ec t of groundwater and coastal water rainfall data was obtained from four climate stations fig 1 operated by the indonesian governmental agency bmkg on a daily interval from october 2015 until december 2016 stations were chosen in a way that they most likely reflect the recharge area of the wonosari bribin baron hydrogeological system the first station nglipar fig 1 is located in the northern part of the wonosari plateau at an elevation of 190 m above sea level the second climate station ponjong is located at an elevation of 242 m above sea level next to the subsurface river gunung kendil and close to the subsurface river dam bribin sindon fig 1 the third station semanu fig 1 is located close to the subsurface river kali suci at an elevation of 198 m above sea level while the fourth station tepus is located closer to the coast at an elevation of 198 m above sea level groundwater discharge was monitored at the subsurface river dam bribin sindon with 10 min intervals from october 2015 until december 2016 discharge was monitored in a way that a defined flume was present and the water level behind the dam was measured discharge areas into the coastal ocean were identified using a multi temporal satellite based thermal infrared approach and validated using in situ offshore electrical conductivity measurements the multi temporal satellite based thermal infrared approach exploits thermal radiance information of the sea surface given in five landsat tirs scenes wrs path row 120 065 all applied scenes reflect the local wet season and represent low tide status in the years 2013 2014 the pre processing chain and the automatic and tide based scene selection is described in mallast et al 2014 given the assumption of sea surface temperature sst stabilization over time small temporal variability at groundwater discharge sites against a high temporal sst variability in areas which are not influenced by groundwater discharge siebert et al 2014 we perform a variance analysis to detect potential groundwater discharge areas it includes calculating the median of the absolute differences per pixel between each sst scene this reduces influences of potential outliers evoked through e g thin clouds and represents an advancement described in mallast et al 2014 the final result is a sst variance image in which small variance values represent potential groundwater discharge areas fig 2 these potential groundwater discharge areas were validated with in situ offshore ec and temperature measurements measurements were taken on the 14th 16th and 19th of november 2015 and on the 18th 19th and 20th of april 2016 at a depth of 10 cm below water level with a wtwtm tetracon 925 p conductivity probe from a small fishing boat 3 2 hydrochemical sampling hydrochemical samples were obtained from three subsurface rivers in the hinterland and from two coastal springs pantai baron pantai ngrumput fig 1 which were identified based on the remote sensing approach fig 2 at most sites samples were taken in november 2015 and on a nearly monthly interval from april 2016 until december 2016 the total number of samples amounts to 40 of which 10 were taken at pantai baron 8 at pantai ngrumput 9 at goa pindul 5 at gunung kendil and 8 at kali suci all listed in table 1 ec temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured directly in the field using calibrated handheld probes conductivity measuring cell wtw tetracon 925 p dissolved oxygen wtw fdo 925 water samples for nutrient analyses were obtained with syringes and filtered whatman filters ca 0 45 µm into 20 ml hdpe bottles samples were preserved either by freezing or by poisoning with 50 µl of saturated hgcl2 in november 2015 april may june july and december 2016 the water samples for nutrient analyses nitrate nitrite ammonium phosphate dissolved silicon dsi were transported to germany and measured at the laboratory of the leibniz centre for marine tropical research in bremen using standard photometrical methods grasshoff et al 2009 with an accuracy of 0 1 µmol l 1 for phosphate 2 4 µmol l 1 for nox 0 02 µmol l 1 for no2 0 04 µmol l 1 for nh4 and 1 6 µmol l 1 for dsi in august 2016 september 2016 october 2016 and november 2016 nitrate was determined on fresh groundwater samples within a couple of days after sampling at the geochemistry laboratory dept of geological engineering faculty of engineering ugm yogyakarta indonesia using an ion chromatograph metroohm ic 850 with an accuracy of 0 01 µm 3 3 calculation of groundwater nutrient fluxes in order to capture the temporal variability in groundwater nutrient fluxes the temporal variability in groundwater nutrient concentrations and the temporal variability in groundwater discharge was considered a range of a groundwater nutrient flux at the coastal spring pantai baron was calculated for each groundwater sampling event in total 10 sampling events see table 1 a range of groundwater discharge at pantai baron was calculated with minimum qmin eq 1 and maximum qmax eq 2 discharge rates based on all known tributaries marked as qg qh qi and qj see supplementary material which feed the spring direct measurements were taken at bribin sindon taking into account a travel time of 14 2 days during matrix flow dominated conditions and 4 2 days during piston flow dominated conditions the type of flow was deduced from the physio chemistry of the groundwater sampled at pantai baron while a higher ec of more than 500 µs cm was indicative for matrix flow conditions and a lower ec was typical for piston flow conditions eiche et al 2016 furthermore smaller tributaries which feed pantai baron were included in the discharge estimate including buhputih baron fig 1g with 0 02 m3 s in dry season seropan baron fig 1i with 0 4 0 5 m3 s during dry season and 0 5 to 3 m3 s during wet season grubug baron fig 1j with 0 7 1 m3 s during dry season and 2 m3 s during rain season and then the connection ngreneng baron with 0 1 m3 s during dry season and 0 2 m3 s during wet season 1 q min q g m i n q h m i n q i m i n q j m i n 2 q max q g m a x q h m a x q i m a x q j m a x a minimum and maximum groundwater nutrient flux for each respective sampling event was then calculated by multiplying the groundwater nutrient concentration which was measured at pantai baron at a time with the minimum qmin and maximum qmax estimated groundwater discharge rate 4 results 4 1 identification of groundwater discharge into the ocean two sites with particularly high groundwater discharge potential were identified based on low sst variability values of 0 24 blue colors in fig 2 the first site was observed within an embayment and corresponds to the coastal karstic freshwater spring of pantai baron with ec values of 0 3 0 8 ms cm at its outlet up to 500 m into the sea freshening was still detectable due to lower ec values the second site matches the location of an intertidal spring located at pantai ngrumput fig 2 the spring was accessible during low tide with brackish groundwater discharge into a backbarrier reef along the beach in the intertidal area groundwater ec values varied over the seasonal cycle with around 5 95 8 38 ms cm in the wet season and 7 51 9 53 ms cm during the dry season low sst variability was as well observed along the coast between pantai baron and pantai ngrumput due to steep cliffs strong currents and heavy waves these sites were not accessible from land or from boat the area may represent a site where discharge via multiple coastal springs or diffuse groundwater discharge through the coastal sediments occurs they may also reflect longshore coastal currents which transport groundwater from pantai baron along the coast 4 2 seasonal variability of groundwater flow a seasonal trend influenced by the enso in the year 2015 2016 was observed in rainfall and groundwater discharge data fig 3 typical for an el niño year the wet season started delayed in 2015 with no rainfall in october 2015 low precipitation rates in november 2015 followed by an onset of higher precipitation rates in december 2015 which lasted until april 2016 the driest months were july 2016 and august 2016 as expected for a la niña year the wet season started early at the end of september 2016 high precipitation rates during mid of april 2016 were followed by an increase in discharge rates at bribin sindon a period with low precipitation and discharge rates was observed from end of april 2016 until the end of july 2016 fig 3 which was followed by a sudden but then constant increase in discharge until october 2016 at the end of november 2016 discharge rates increased from 3 0 m3 s to 8 0 m3 s and then further increased by the beginning of december up to 16 1 m3 s during this time constant and high precipitation was observed at all climate stations nglipar ponjong semanu and tepus fig 3 electronic supplementary material on a shorter time scale of days events with heavy rain and high discharge were observed which were in general also indicated by a lower groundwater temperature and ec at pantai baron and partly in other subsurface rivers in the hinterland table 1 for example on the 21st of june 2016 a short and heavy rain event was followed by an increase in discharge which was also indicated by lower ec and temperature values similarly on the 19th of april 2016 the 30th of november 2016 and the 13th of december 2016 events with higher precipitation and discharge rates were also indicated by a lower ec and temperature at pantai baron table 1 4 3 seasonal variability of nutrient concentrations and fluxes a temporal variability of nutrient concentrations was observed in groundwater sampled in the hinterland and at coastal springs table 1 dissolved inorganic nitrogen dominantly occurred in the form of nitrate which ranged from 0 to 300 µmol l at pantai baron nitrate concentrations were high in the wet season 2015 2016 and in december 2016 nitrate concentrations decreased at the beginning of the dry season from april until june 2016 at pantai baron pantai ngrumput goa pindul and gunung kendil highest nitrate concentrations were observed in august 2016 at pantai baron goa pindul and kali suci after the increase from a period of very low discharge to a period with a constantly higher discharge nitrate concentrations at the coastal spring pantai ngrumput followed the same pattern and were positively correlated with nitrate concentrations at pantai baron spearman correlation 0 9 phosphate concentrations were in general very low 0 1 µmol l with the only exception measured in december 2016 when concentrations increased to 0 9 µmol l and 1 µmol l at pantai baron and pantai ngrumput respectively dsi concentrations were in general lower when discharge was higher fig 4 orange dots indicating a dilution effect during periods with higher discharge fig 4 an increase in dsi concentrations at pantai baron pantai ngrumput goa pindul and kali suci was observed at the transition from the wet season to the dry season from april 2016 until june 2016 nitrate concentrations did not show any trend between concentration and discharge while phosphate concentrations were only elevated during the highest discharge event the temporal variability of groundwater nutrient concentrations and discharge lead to the temporal variability of groundwater nutrient fluxes fig 5 high nitrate concentrations coupled to high groundwater discharge rates lead to high fluxes in the wet season 2015 2016 with 63 74 106 mol day and 94 129 106 mol day in november 2015 and april 2016 respectively at the beginning of the dry season a lower discharge and lower nitrate concentrations lead to lower nitrate fluxes e g 7 11 106 mol day on the 24th of may 2016 during the dry season a peak discharge event on the 21st of june 2016 did not lead to elevated nitrate fluxes due to low nitrate concentrations fig 5 in august 2016 the increase in groundwater discharge and nitrate concentrations lead to a high nitrate flux of 111 123 106 mol day while the highest nitrate flux of 133 245 106 mol day was observed in december 2016 after the period of heavy rain during this time a high phosphate flux of 852 1571 103 mol day was observed as well dsi fluxes were higher during the wet season when compared to the dry season but a temporal variability was not as pronounced as for nitrate fluxes 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal variability of land ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes correlating discharge rates at karstic springs with nutrient concentrations can help identifying and characterizing the flow behavior and the source of a nutrient a negative correlation between discharge and nutrient concentration for example indicates a constant source of nutrients which is diluted during times of high discharge a positive correlation between discharge rates and nutrient concentrations point towards a surface source of nutrients which is enriched during dry season and washed into the aquifer as a pulse in the rainy season in gunung kidul higher groundwater ec and temperature indicate diffuse matrix flow conditions in the subsurface aquifer system eiche et al 2016 which was also reflected in higher dsi concentrations table 1 this was for example observed during the onset of the dry season from april 2016 until june 2016 when groundwater dsi concentrations increased both in some subsurface rivers in the hinterland as well as coastal springs lower dsi concentrations during times of higher discharge indicated a dilution effect in the aquifer during wet season due to piston flow conditions fig 4 such as on the 21st of june 2016 however total dsi fluxes were still higher during times of high groundwater discharge thus a further source of dsi has to be present this further dsi source might be volcanic material from the mountain ranges in the north fig 1 and from agricultural fields nearby which may be washed into the aquifer during heavy rain events the transport of colloidal material in the karstic area during the wet season was also indicated by brownish water color during flash floods and can often be observed in the area after heavy rain events in surface and subsurface rivers eiche et al 2016 during wet season nutrient fluxes were mostly controlled by discharge during some sampling events nutrient concentrations e g phosphate nitrate sampled at subsurface rivers in the hinterland and at the coastal springs varied in a similar way with time the variation indicated nutrient inputs into groundwater to occur in the hinterland which are transported through the aquifer directly towards the coast especially nitrate fluxes were high during the wet season which might be due to nitrogen leaching from a surface source like fertilizers animal waste and general urban waste which can also be observed in other karstic areas guo and jiang 2009 during wet season high groundwater nitrogen fluxes towards the coastal ocean were for example also observed in florida keys lapointe et al 1990 and in bermudas possibly due to the use of fertilizers in the hinterland lewis 1987 in gunung kidul major crops such as rice corn and soy are mainly fertilized during wet season from october until march when water availability is high katam 2017 in general three different types of fertilizer are used in the area of gunung kidul including urea sp 36 as well as potassium chloride urea contains large amounts of nitrogen in the form of ammonium which might be oxidized to nitrate in oxic groundwater within the aquifer table 1 and the soil heckmann 2011 furthermore large amounts of nutrients and contaminants may reach the subsurface aquifer system via direct infiltration and via sinkholes from sewage due to a lack of wastewater treatment in the area heckmann 2011 nayono et al 2016 in gunung kidul about 21 of the population total population of 722 500 inhabitants badan pusat statistik kabupaten gunungkidul 2017a does not have access to wastewater treatment facilities badan pusat statistik kabupaten gunungkidul 2017b septic tanks often leak and sewage is often spilled uncontrolled into the environment heckmann 2011 nayono et al 2016 during dry season nutrient fluxes were besides groundwater discharge also controlled by nutrient concentrations in the aquifer low nitrate fluxes such as during the flood recession period from april to july 2016 may be attributed to a temporal depleted nitrate pool in the hinterland after the wet season e g due to leaching of nitrate from the soil and sinkholes during the wet season the peak discharge event on the 21st of june 2016 fig 5 did not lead to elevated nitrate fluxes due to low groundwater nitrate concentrations high nitrate fluxes in august followed an increase in discharge after an extended dry period in july during which time a nutrient pool in the hinterland may have been build up while fertilizers are not being used in the area during dry season nutrients and pollutants may have accumulated in the top soil and in sinkholes from sewage heckmann 2011 nayono et al 2016 in general coastal managers and ecosystem studies should consider that during the wet season nutrient fluxes will in general be high due to a high groundwater discharge coupled to a nutrient source in the hinterland while during dry season occasional events may occur during which nutrient fluxes can be temporarily high 5 2 effects on coastal ecosystems groundwater nutrient inputs into coastal waters may lead to severe effects on coastal ecosystems such as eutrophication adyasari et al 2018 or the occurrence of harmful alga blooms lapointe et al 2005 in tropical karstic regions an increase in groundwater discharge e g after heavy rain events may suddenly transport large amounts of nutrients into sensitive coastal ecosystems along the coastline of gunung kidul various barrier reefs and seagrass beds are situated in the vicinity of groundwater discharge sites at pantai ngrumput groundwater directly discharges into a barrier reef which was only affected by high groundwater nitrate concentrations during the wet season in november 2015 and december 2016 table 1 visually seagrass beds and macroalgae were observed within the reef which are likely affected by nutrient concentrations from groundwater furthermore large mats of macroalgae were observed along some of the beaches in the area while the coastal ecosystems along the karstic coast of gunung kidul still need to be researched in more detail our study indicates that significant terrestrial nutrient sources exist in the area especially sudden inputs of phosphate such as in december 2016 fig 5 table 1 may trigger algae blooms as coastal waters around carbonates are often phosphate limiting because calcium carbonate scavenges phosphate brand 2002 brackish groundwater discharge and associated phosphate fluxes from a karst aquifer in florida bay was for example hypothesized explain the occurrence of alga blooms in the nearshore area blakey et al 2015 in many other tropical karstic regions groundwater discharge was identified as a major nutrient source for coastal ecosystems with elevated groundwater nutrient concentrations often due to anthropogenic activities in the hinterland lapointe and o connell 1989 arandacirerol et al 2006 tapia gonzález et al 2008 amato et al 2016 in the tropical karstic region of yucatan groundwater is a dominant source of dsi and nitrate to lagoons herrera silveira 1994 with high fresh groundwater inputs and high nutrient fluxes during wet season tapia gonzález et al 2008 groundwater nitrate concentrations in yucatan range from 2 to 300 µmol l arandacirerol et al 2006 and thus vary in a similar way as in southern java in barbados groundwater discharge into a coral reef was twice as high during wet season than during dry season lewis 1987 nutrients were only measured during wet season and nitrate was clearly elevated in fresh groundwater lewis 1987 in bermuda groundwater discharge associated anthropogenic nitrogen fluxes may support coastal alga blooms lapointe and o connell 1989 simmons and lyons 1994 but seasonal trends were not investigated in guam groundwater discharge was associated with anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into coastal waters which lead to alga blooms marsh 1977 and a decline in coral reef health redding et al 2013 salinity and nox concentrations from 75 to 144 µmol l in brackish beach seep water in guam fluctuated after heavy rain events with a lower salinity during the wet season matson 1993 the high nutrient fluxes with a high temporal variability found in the gunung kidul karst area highlight the importance of monitoring groundwater discharge and its associated nutrient fluxes from karst areas particularly in the vicinity of sensitive ecosystems globally coastal segments with a length of 0 27 106 km contain karstic areas defined as carbonate rocks mapped in hartmann and moosdorf 2012 following the approach of chen et al 2017 up to 500 m away from the coast these areas are here named as potentially karstic coasts this amounts to 14 of the total global coast length coastal shapes according to isciences l l c 2009 karstic coasts are particularly abundant in the mediterranean carribean and in southeast asia fig 6 of the global potentially karstic coasts 41 are situated in tropical areas they are often in the immediate vicinity of coral reefs fig 6 which in some locations have been shown to be impacted by groundwater discharge derived nutrient inputs d elia et al 1981 senal et al 2011 dadhich et al 2017 the abundance of karstic coasts in tropical climatic regimes highlights that the here shown pathway deserves attention in order to understand its regional impacts on the sensitive ecology of tropical coasts climatic conditions but also anthropogenic factors in areas as the one portrayed here in detail are different from better studied temperate regions in order to understand the implications of groundwater discharge in these areas more studies are needed that particularly recognize the strong temporal variability of nutriend fluxes demonstrated at the example of the gunung kidul area 6 conclusions we studied the seasonal variability of groundwater nutrient fluxes into the coastal ocean in the tropical karstic region of gunung kidul indonesia while in many porous coastal aquifers the transport of terrestrial groundwater towards the ocean is slow in the karstic region of gunung kidul transport of groundwater can be fast with tens of kilometers from the hinterland within a few days and also highly variable throughout the year during the wet season the variability of groundwater nitrate fluxes was mostly controlled by discharge while during dry season nutrient concentrations in the aquifer also played a key role for groundwater nitrate fluxes extreme rain events lead to extraordinarily high nitrate fluxes as well as to high phosphate fluxes which are otherwise low throughout the year however peak discharge events in the dry season did not lead to elevated nutrient fluxes due to dilution effect in the aquifer and a temporal exhaust of the surface nutrient pool fertilizers untreated sewage and waste in the hinterland in developing countries such as indonesia groundwater is often polluted with nutrients due to the lack of wastewater treatment facilities and the high population density while large parts of the coastline consists of karst rocks and coral reefs coastal ecosystems along these coastlines may thus be affected by short and sudden pulses of high groundwater nutrient fluxes during times of high discharge which has to be considered by coastal managers and ecosystem studies

7031,in tropical karstic regions knowledge about the timing and quantity of land ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes is important as those nutrients may affect sensitive coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs high permeability of karst aquifers combined with high discharge during heavy rain events lead to a close connectivity between groundwater in the hinterland and the coastal zone alteration between dry and wet periods can lead to a temporal variability of groundwater discharge volume and its associated nutrient fluxes we studied the seasonal variability of land ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes in the tropical karstic region of gunung kidul southern java indonesia from november 2015 to december 2016 satellite thermal infrared imagery revealed two major areas of direct submarine and coastal groundwater discharge nutrient fluxes were estimated at the largest coastal spring using a discharge dataset from a subsurface river dam and a monthly record of nutrient concentrations sampled from the spring nitrate fluxes ranged from 6 106 245 106 mol day dissolved silicon fluxes from 58 106 546 106 mol day and phosphate fluxes from 17 103 1571 103 mol day nutrient fluxes are mostly controlled by discharge and show a high variability through time extraordinarily high nitrate and phosphate fluxes were observed after a period of constant and heavy rain most likely a nutrient pool in the top soil in the hinterland from untreated sewage or fertilizer is flushed during rain events through the aquifer to the coast in tropical karstic regions sudden inputs of large amounts of nutrients via groundwater discharge may affect coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs making them especially vulnerable during high discharge events keywords groundwater discharge nutrients tropical karst ecosystems sgd seasonal 1 introduction groundwater discharge into the coastal ocean occurs along the worlds coastlines at the land ocean interface and has been identified as an important source of nutrients to many coastal ecosystems szymczycha et al 2012 rodellas et al 2015 tamborski et al 2017 nutrients delivered to coastal ecosystem via groundwater discharge can lead to a shift in phytoplankton community structure degradation of health of coral reefs and seagrass beds as reported in a number of locations all over the world lapointe 1997 lecher et al 2015 amato et al 2016 in tropical karstic regions high groundwater discharge is expected due to high aquifer permeability coupled to a high recharge during the wet season and heavy rain events combined with high groundwater nutrient concentrations e g transported from the unsaturated soil into the aquifer and low retention times of nutrients in the aquifer these conditions lead to high groundwater nutrient fluxes moosdorf et al 2015 nutrient inputs into groundwater from anthropogenic sources in the hinterland such as fertilizers or sewage may thus rapidly reach the coastal ocean tamborski et al 2017 these conditions may further lead to temporal variations with high and low land ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes arandacirerol et al 2006 mallast et al 2013 sensitive coastal ecosystems along tropical karstic coasts e g coral reefs may thus be affected by sudden inputs of large amounts of nutrients via groundwater discharge several studies describe the transport of nutrients via groundwater towards the ocean in tropical karstic regions as in northwest yucatan mexico hanshaw and back 1980 herrera silveira 1998 young et al 2008 null et al 2014 bermuda lapointe and o connell 1989 simmons and lyons 1994 barbados lewis 1987 and guam redding et al 2013 while some studies investigated their temporal variability lewis 1987 lapointe et al 1990 arandacirerol et al 2006 tapia gonzález et al 2008 southeast asia belongs to one of the regions with the strongest human modifications in the coastal zone elvidge et al 1997 where significant groundwater nutrient fluxes to the coastal zone were observed in bangkok manila and jepara burnett et al 2007 taniguchi et al 2008 adyasari et al 2018 however a seasonal record of groundwater nutrient fluxes from a karstic region in southeast asia has not yet been investigated even though one of the strongest impacts on coastal ecosystems can be expected in these regions hence at the example of the tropical karstic coastal area of gunung kidul southern java indonesia we investigated the seasonal behavior of groundwater nutrient fluxes to the ocean 2 study site 2 1 climate geology and land use the karstic region of gunung kidul is located in southern central java indonesia the area has a tropical climate with a mean annual temperature of 27 c haryono and day 2004 a high humidity of 80 flathe and pfeiffer 1965 and an annual precipitation of up to 2000 mm brunsch et al 2011 the amount of precipitation is controlled by the australian indonesian summer monsoon brunsch et al 2011 the wet season lasts from november until april with precipitation rates of 150 350 mm per month during dry season may until october precipitation rates are much lower with 25 150 mm per month brunsch et al 2011 the el niño southern oscillation enso has a considerable impact on the amount of annual rainfall aldrian and dwi susanto 2003 while during el niño years the wet season starts later in the year and during the dry season precipitation is below average aldrian and dwi susanto 2003 during la niña the rainy season lasts longer with larger amounts of rainfall brunsch et al 2011 three different geological sections can be distinguished in the study area the north and north east section comprise mountain ranges fig 1 which mainly consist of sediments and volcanic deposits of eocene and miocene age further to the south the miocene wonosari formations represent the second section which mainly consists of bedded lagoonal limestones sir macdonald and partners 1984 the third section the gunung sewu area is morphologically known for its mature kegelkarst hills common to all is the southward dipping towards the indian ocean at the coast cliffs with heights of 25 100 m are composed of strongly karstified massive coral reef limestone with intercalated clay and volcanic ash lenses van bemmelen 1949 flathe and pfeiffer 1965 waltham et al 1983 haryono and day 2004 the combination of low rainfall amounts during dry season and quick infiltration due to strong karstification leads to severe water scarcity mainly in the southern kegelkarst area consequently more than 250 000 people depend on onshore coastal and submarine karstic springs rain water cisterns water trucks or subsurface rivers as water resource sir macdonald and partners 1984 matthies et al 2016 moosdorf and oehler 2017 this is one reason why the region is considered to be one of the poorest regions in indonesia with a relatively low population density of 388 inhabitants per km2 in the coastal area dittmann et al 2011 at bribin sindon the karst river is dammed up by a concrete barrage which completely closed the elliptic cross section of the cave creating an underground water storage which is managed by means of a hydropower driven pumping system this hydropower plant supplies water for more than 75 000 people in the area more than 90 of the population depends on agriculture often with less than 0 3 ha land per family dry farming with soy corn peanuts and cassava is the dominant type of land use some families additionally have cattle to work on the fields and as source for manure artificial fertilizer is mainly applied in addition to cattle manure to balance the nutrient deficiency of the soils wastewater in gunung kidul is partly discharged directly into the subsurface or collected in unsealed septic tanks fach and fuchs 2010 nayono et al 2010 additionally solid waste enters into the underground river system via sinkholes nayono 2014 2 2 subsurface hydrology perennial rivers are absent in the coastal area and scarce in the whole gunung kidul due to high karst permeability considerable surface runoff only takes place after major rain events in the underground however a complex network of caves and conduits has developed due to karstification consequently subsurface discharge dominates the area groundwater flow paths and discharge rates in the area were mapped in the recent years sir macdonald and partners 1984 eiche et al 2012 fig 1 and electronic supplementary material also flow paths between subsurface rivers and coastal springs could be negotiated fig 1 red dotted lines the coastal freshwater spring at pantai baron is connected with the wonosari bribin baron aquifer system in the hinterland which is fed by different small rivers from the volcanic panggung masif in the north sir macdonald and partners 1984 discharge measured at the 25 km upstream located subsurface river dam bribin sindon reaches pantai baron with a travel time of 14 days during dry season sir macdonald and partners 1984 and 4 days during wet season as deduced from a tracer test eiche et al 2012 in addition several smaller tributaries feed the freshwater spring see electronic supplementary material discharge rates have been measured continuously every 10 min at the subsurface river dam bribin sindon since 2010 and discharge varies between 1 m3 s in the dry and up to 12 m3 s in the wet season oberle et al 2016 groundwater in gunung kidul was classified as ca hco3 dominated with varying hydrochemistry between the wet and the dry season eiche et al 2016 during the dry season diffuse matrix flow is dominant and assures a year round flow of water during wet season matrix flow is regularly overprinted by piston flow and recharge occurs dominantly through larger cracks and sinkholes these conditions are also reflected in the physio chemistry of the groundwater with higher electrical conductivity ec values during matrix flow conditions and a rapid decline in ec as discharge increases eiche et al 2016 3 material and methods 3 1 investigation of groundwater discharge to the ocean groundwater discharge towards and into the ocean was investigated based on precipitation data discharge measured at the subsurface river dam bribin sindon remote sensing and by physio chemistry ec t of groundwater and coastal water rainfall data was obtained from four climate stations fig 1 operated by the indonesian governmental agency bmkg on a daily interval from october 2015 until december 2016 stations were chosen in a way that they most likely reflect the recharge area of the wonosari bribin baron hydrogeological system the first station nglipar fig 1 is located in the northern part of the wonosari plateau at an elevation of 190 m above sea level the second climate station ponjong is located at an elevation of 242 m above sea level next to the subsurface river gunung kendil and close to the subsurface river dam bribin sindon fig 1 the third station semanu fig 1 is located close to the subsurface river kali suci at an elevation of 198 m above sea level while the fourth station tepus is located closer to the coast at an elevation of 198 m above sea level groundwater discharge was monitored at the subsurface river dam bribin sindon with 10 min intervals from october 2015 until december 2016 discharge was monitored in a way that a defined flume was present and the water level behind the dam was measured discharge areas into the coastal ocean were identified using a multi temporal satellite based thermal infrared approach and validated using in situ offshore electrical conductivity measurements the multi temporal satellite based thermal infrared approach exploits thermal radiance information of the sea surface given in five landsat tirs scenes wrs path row 120 065 all applied scenes reflect the local wet season and represent low tide status in the years 2013 2014 the pre processing chain and the automatic and tide based scene selection is described in mallast et al 2014 given the assumption of sea surface temperature sst stabilization over time small temporal variability at groundwater discharge sites against a high temporal sst variability in areas which are not influenced by groundwater discharge siebert et al 2014 we perform a variance analysis to detect potential groundwater discharge areas it includes calculating the median of the absolute differences per pixel between each sst scene this reduces influences of potential outliers evoked through e g thin clouds and represents an advancement described in mallast et al 2014 the final result is a sst variance image in which small variance values represent potential groundwater discharge areas fig 2 these potential groundwater discharge areas were validated with in situ offshore ec and temperature measurements measurements were taken on the 14th 16th and 19th of november 2015 and on the 18th 19th and 20th of april 2016 at a depth of 10 cm below water level with a wtwtm tetracon 925 p conductivity probe from a small fishing boat 3 2 hydrochemical sampling hydrochemical samples were obtained from three subsurface rivers in the hinterland and from two coastal springs pantai baron pantai ngrumput fig 1 which were identified based on the remote sensing approach fig 2 at most sites samples were taken in november 2015 and on a nearly monthly interval from april 2016 until december 2016 the total number of samples amounts to 40 of which 10 were taken at pantai baron 8 at pantai ngrumput 9 at goa pindul 5 at gunung kendil and 8 at kali suci all listed in table 1 ec temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured directly in the field using calibrated handheld probes conductivity measuring cell wtw tetracon 925 p dissolved oxygen wtw fdo 925 water samples for nutrient analyses were obtained with syringes and filtered whatman filters ca 0 45 µm into 20 ml hdpe bottles samples were preserved either by freezing or by poisoning with 50 µl of saturated hgcl2 in november 2015 april may june july and december 2016 the water samples for nutrient analyses nitrate nitrite ammonium phosphate dissolved silicon dsi were transported to germany and measured at the laboratory of the leibniz centre for marine tropical research in bremen using standard photometrical methods grasshoff et al 2009 with an accuracy of 0 1 µmol l 1 for phosphate 2 4 µmol l 1 for nox 0 02 µmol l 1 for no2 0 04 µmol l 1 for nh4 and 1 6 µmol l 1 for dsi in august 2016 september 2016 october 2016 and november 2016 nitrate was determined on fresh groundwater samples within a couple of days after sampling at the geochemistry laboratory dept of geological engineering faculty of engineering ugm yogyakarta indonesia using an ion chromatograph metroohm ic 850 with an accuracy of 0 01 µm 3 3 calculation of groundwater nutrient fluxes in order to capture the temporal variability in groundwater nutrient fluxes the temporal variability in groundwater nutrient concentrations and the temporal variability in groundwater discharge was considered a range of a groundwater nutrient flux at the coastal spring pantai baron was calculated for each groundwater sampling event in total 10 sampling events see table 1 a range of groundwater discharge at pantai baron was calculated with minimum qmin eq 1 and maximum qmax eq 2 discharge rates based on all known tributaries marked as qg qh qi and qj see supplementary material which feed the spring direct measurements were taken at bribin sindon taking into account a travel time of 14 2 days during matrix flow dominated conditions and 4 2 days during piston flow dominated conditions the type of flow was deduced from the physio chemistry of the groundwater sampled at pantai baron while a higher ec of more than 500 µs cm was indicative for matrix flow conditions and a lower ec was typical for piston flow conditions eiche et al 2016 furthermore smaller tributaries which feed pantai baron were included in the discharge estimate including buhputih baron fig 1g with 0 02 m3 s in dry season seropan baron fig 1i with 0 4 0 5 m3 s during dry season and 0 5 to 3 m3 s during wet season grubug baron fig 1j with 0 7 1 m3 s during dry season and 2 m3 s during rain season and then the connection ngreneng baron with 0 1 m3 s during dry season and 0 2 m3 s during wet season 1 q min q g m i n q h m i n q i m i n q j m i n 2 q max q g m a x q h m a x q i m a x q j m a x a minimum and maximum groundwater nutrient flux for each respective sampling event was then calculated by multiplying the groundwater nutrient concentration which was measured at pantai baron at a time with the minimum qmin and maximum qmax estimated groundwater discharge rate 4 results 4 1 identification of groundwater discharge into the ocean two sites with particularly high groundwater discharge potential were identified based on low sst variability values of 0 24 blue colors in fig 2 the first site was observed within an embayment and corresponds to the coastal karstic freshwater spring of pantai baron with ec values of 0 3 0 8 ms cm at its outlet up to 500 m into the sea freshening was still detectable due to lower ec values the second site matches the location of an intertidal spring located at pantai ngrumput fig 2 the spring was accessible during low tide with brackish groundwater discharge into a backbarrier reef along the beach in the intertidal area groundwater ec values varied over the seasonal cycle with around 5 95 8 38 ms cm in the wet season and 7 51 9 53 ms cm during the dry season low sst variability was as well observed along the coast between pantai baron and pantai ngrumput due to steep cliffs strong currents and heavy waves these sites were not accessible from land or from boat the area may represent a site where discharge via multiple coastal springs or diffuse groundwater discharge through the coastal sediments occurs they may also reflect longshore coastal currents which transport groundwater from pantai baron along the coast 4 2 seasonal variability of groundwater flow a seasonal trend influenced by the enso in the year 2015 2016 was observed in rainfall and groundwater discharge data fig 3 typical for an el niño year the wet season started delayed in 2015 with no rainfall in october 2015 low precipitation rates in november 2015 followed by an onset of higher precipitation rates in december 2015 which lasted until april 2016 the driest months were july 2016 and august 2016 as expected for a la niña year the wet season started early at the end of september 2016 high precipitation rates during mid of april 2016 were followed by an increase in discharge rates at bribin sindon a period with low precipitation and discharge rates was observed from end of april 2016 until the end of july 2016 fig 3 which was followed by a sudden but then constant increase in discharge until october 2016 at the end of november 2016 discharge rates increased from 3 0 m3 s to 8 0 m3 s and then further increased by the beginning of december up to 16 1 m3 s during this time constant and high precipitation was observed at all climate stations nglipar ponjong semanu and tepus fig 3 electronic supplementary material on a shorter time scale of days events with heavy rain and high discharge were observed which were in general also indicated by a lower groundwater temperature and ec at pantai baron and partly in other subsurface rivers in the hinterland table 1 for example on the 21st of june 2016 a short and heavy rain event was followed by an increase in discharge which was also indicated by lower ec and temperature values similarly on the 19th of april 2016 the 30th of november 2016 and the 13th of december 2016 events with higher precipitation and discharge rates were also indicated by a lower ec and temperature at pantai baron table 1 4 3 seasonal variability of nutrient concentrations and fluxes a temporal variability of nutrient concentrations was observed in groundwater sampled in the hinterland and at coastal springs table 1 dissolved inorganic nitrogen dominantly occurred in the form of nitrate which ranged from 0 to 300 µmol l at pantai baron nitrate concentrations were high in the wet season 2015 2016 and in december 2016 nitrate concentrations decreased at the beginning of the dry season from april until june 2016 at pantai baron pantai ngrumput goa pindul and gunung kendil highest nitrate concentrations were observed in august 2016 at pantai baron goa pindul and kali suci after the increase from a period of very low discharge to a period with a constantly higher discharge nitrate concentrations at the coastal spring pantai ngrumput followed the same pattern and were positively correlated with nitrate concentrations at pantai baron spearman correlation 0 9 phosphate concentrations were in general very low 0 1 µmol l with the only exception measured in december 2016 when concentrations increased to 0 9 µmol l and 1 µmol l at pantai baron and pantai ngrumput respectively dsi concentrations were in general lower when discharge was higher fig 4 orange dots indicating a dilution effect during periods with higher discharge fig 4 an increase in dsi concentrations at pantai baron pantai ngrumput goa pindul and kali suci was observed at the transition from the wet season to the dry season from april 2016 until june 2016 nitrate concentrations did not show any trend between concentration and discharge while phosphate concentrations were only elevated during the highest discharge event the temporal variability of groundwater nutrient concentrations and discharge lead to the temporal variability of groundwater nutrient fluxes fig 5 high nitrate concentrations coupled to high groundwater discharge rates lead to high fluxes in the wet season 2015 2016 with 63 74 106 mol day and 94 129 106 mol day in november 2015 and april 2016 respectively at the beginning of the dry season a lower discharge and lower nitrate concentrations lead to lower nitrate fluxes e g 7 11 106 mol day on the 24th of may 2016 during the dry season a peak discharge event on the 21st of june 2016 did not lead to elevated nitrate fluxes due to low nitrate concentrations fig 5 in august 2016 the increase in groundwater discharge and nitrate concentrations lead to a high nitrate flux of 111 123 106 mol day while the highest nitrate flux of 133 245 106 mol day was observed in december 2016 after the period of heavy rain during this time a high phosphate flux of 852 1571 103 mol day was observed as well dsi fluxes were higher during the wet season when compared to the dry season but a temporal variability was not as pronounced as for nitrate fluxes 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal variability of land ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes correlating discharge rates at karstic springs with nutrient concentrations can help identifying and characterizing the flow behavior and the source of a nutrient a negative correlation between discharge and nutrient concentration for example indicates a constant source of nutrients which is diluted during times of high discharge a positive correlation between discharge rates and nutrient concentrations point towards a surface source of nutrients which is enriched during dry season and washed into the aquifer as a pulse in the rainy season in gunung kidul higher groundwater ec and temperature indicate diffuse matrix flow conditions in the subsurface aquifer system eiche et al 2016 which was also reflected in higher dsi concentrations table 1 this was for example observed during the onset of the dry season from april 2016 until june 2016 when groundwater dsi concentrations increased both in some subsurface rivers in the hinterland as well as coastal springs lower dsi concentrations during times of higher discharge indicated a dilution effect in the aquifer during wet season due to piston flow conditions fig 4 such as on the 21st of june 2016 however total dsi fluxes were still higher during times of high groundwater discharge thus a further source of dsi has to be present this further dsi source might be volcanic material from the mountain ranges in the north fig 1 and from agricultural fields nearby which may be washed into the aquifer during heavy rain events the transport of colloidal material in the karstic area during the wet season was also indicated by brownish water color during flash floods and can often be observed in the area after heavy rain events in surface and subsurface rivers eiche et al 2016 during wet season nutrient fluxes were mostly controlled by discharge during some sampling events nutrient concentrations e g phosphate nitrate sampled at subsurface rivers in the hinterland and at the coastal springs varied in a similar way with time the variation indicated nutrient inputs into groundwater to occur in the hinterland which are transported through the aquifer directly towards the coast especially nitrate fluxes were high during the wet season which might be due to nitrogen leaching from a surface source like fertilizers animal waste and general urban waste which can also be observed in other karstic areas guo and jiang 2009 during wet season high groundwater nitrogen fluxes towards the coastal ocean were for example also observed in florida keys lapointe et al 1990 and in bermudas possibly due to the use of fertilizers in the hinterland lewis 1987 in gunung kidul major crops such as rice corn and soy are mainly fertilized during wet season from october until march when water availability is high katam 2017 in general three different types of fertilizer are used in the area of gunung kidul including urea sp 36 as well as potassium chloride urea contains large amounts of nitrogen in the form of ammonium which might be oxidized to nitrate in oxic groundwater within the aquifer table 1 and the soil heckmann 2011 furthermore large amounts of nutrients and contaminants may reach the subsurface aquifer system via direct infiltration and via sinkholes from sewage due to a lack of wastewater treatment in the area heckmann 2011 nayono et al 2016 in gunung kidul about 21 of the population total population of 722 500 inhabitants badan pusat statistik kabupaten gunungkidul 2017a does not have access to wastewater treatment facilities badan pusat statistik kabupaten gunungkidul 2017b septic tanks often leak and sewage is often spilled uncontrolled into the environment heckmann 2011 nayono et al 2016 during dry season nutrient fluxes were besides groundwater discharge also controlled by nutrient concentrations in the aquifer low nitrate fluxes such as during the flood recession period from april to july 2016 may be attributed to a temporal depleted nitrate pool in the hinterland after the wet season e g due to leaching of nitrate from the soil and sinkholes during the wet season the peak discharge event on the 21st of june 2016 fig 5 did not lead to elevated nitrate fluxes due to low groundwater nitrate concentrations high nitrate fluxes in august followed an increase in discharge after an extended dry period in july during which time a nutrient pool in the hinterland may have been build up while fertilizers are not being used in the area during dry season nutrients and pollutants may have accumulated in the top soil and in sinkholes from sewage heckmann 2011 nayono et al 2016 in general coastal managers and ecosystem studies should consider that during the wet season nutrient fluxes will in general be high due to a high groundwater discharge coupled to a nutrient source in the hinterland while during dry season occasional events may occur during which nutrient fluxes can be temporarily high 5 2 effects on coastal ecosystems groundwater nutrient inputs into coastal waters may lead to severe effects on coastal ecosystems such as eutrophication adyasari et al 2018 or the occurrence of harmful alga blooms lapointe et al 2005 in tropical karstic regions an increase in groundwater discharge e g after heavy rain events may suddenly transport large amounts of nutrients into sensitive coastal ecosystems along the coastline of gunung kidul various barrier reefs and seagrass beds are situated in the vicinity of groundwater discharge sites at pantai ngrumput groundwater directly discharges into a barrier reef which was only affected by high groundwater nitrate concentrations during the wet season in november 2015 and december 2016 table 1 visually seagrass beds and macroalgae were observed within the reef which are likely affected by nutrient concentrations from groundwater furthermore large mats of macroalgae were observed along some of the beaches in the area while the coastal ecosystems along the karstic coast of gunung kidul still need to be researched in more detail our study indicates that significant terrestrial nutrient sources exist in the area especially sudden inputs of phosphate such as in december 2016 fig 5 table 1 may trigger algae blooms as coastal waters around carbonates are often phosphate limiting because calcium carbonate scavenges phosphate brand 2002 brackish groundwater discharge and associated phosphate fluxes from a karst aquifer in florida bay was for example hypothesized explain the occurrence of alga blooms in the nearshore area blakey et al 2015 in many other tropical karstic regions groundwater discharge was identified as a major nutrient source for coastal ecosystems with elevated groundwater nutrient concentrations often due to anthropogenic activities in the hinterland lapointe and o connell 1989 arandacirerol et al 2006 tapia gonzález et al 2008 amato et al 2016 in the tropical karstic region of yucatan groundwater is a dominant source of dsi and nitrate to lagoons herrera silveira 1994 with high fresh groundwater inputs and high nutrient fluxes during wet season tapia gonzález et al 2008 groundwater nitrate concentrations in yucatan range from 2 to 300 µmol l arandacirerol et al 2006 and thus vary in a similar way as in southern java in barbados groundwater discharge into a coral reef was twice as high during wet season than during dry season lewis 1987 nutrients were only measured during wet season and nitrate was clearly elevated in fresh groundwater lewis 1987 in bermuda groundwater discharge associated anthropogenic nitrogen fluxes may support coastal alga blooms lapointe and o connell 1989 simmons and lyons 1994 but seasonal trends were not investigated in guam groundwater discharge was associated with anthropogenic nitrogen inputs into coastal waters which lead to alga blooms marsh 1977 and a decline in coral reef health redding et al 2013 salinity and nox concentrations from 75 to 144 µmol l in brackish beach seep water in guam fluctuated after heavy rain events with a lower salinity during the wet season matson 1993 the high nutrient fluxes with a high temporal variability found in the gunung kidul karst area highlight the importance of monitoring groundwater discharge and its associated nutrient fluxes from karst areas particularly in the vicinity of sensitive ecosystems globally coastal segments with a length of 0 27 106 km contain karstic areas defined as carbonate rocks mapped in hartmann and moosdorf 2012 following the approach of chen et al 2017 up to 500 m away from the coast these areas are here named as potentially karstic coasts this amounts to 14 of the total global coast length coastal shapes according to isciences l l c 2009 karstic coasts are particularly abundant in the mediterranean carribean and in southeast asia fig 6 of the global potentially karstic coasts 41 are situated in tropical areas they are often in the immediate vicinity of coral reefs fig 6 which in some locations have been shown to be impacted by groundwater discharge derived nutrient inputs d elia et al 1981 senal et al 2011 dadhich et al 2017 the abundance of karstic coasts in tropical climatic regimes highlights that the here shown pathway deserves attention in order to understand its regional impacts on the sensitive ecology of tropical coasts climatic conditions but also anthropogenic factors in areas as the one portrayed here in detail are different from better studied temperate regions in order to understand the implications of groundwater discharge in these areas more studies are needed that particularly recognize the strong temporal variability of nutriend fluxes demonstrated at the example of the gunung kidul area 6 conclusions we studied the seasonal variability of groundwater nutrient fluxes into the coastal ocean in the tropical karstic region of gunung kidul indonesia while in many porous coastal aquifers the transport of terrestrial groundwater towards the ocean is slow in the karstic region of gunung kidul transport of groundwater can be fast with tens of kilometers from the hinterland within a few days and also highly variable throughout the year during the wet season the variability of groundwater nitrate fluxes was mostly controlled by discharge while during dry season nutrient concentrations in the aquifer also played a key role for groundwater nitrate fluxes extreme rain events lead to extraordinarily high nitrate fluxes as well as to high phosphate fluxes which are otherwise low throughout the year however peak discharge events in the dry season did not lead to elevated nutrient fluxes due to dilution effect in the aquifer and a temporal exhaust of the surface nutrient pool fertilizers untreated sewage and waste in the hinterland in developing countries such as indonesia groundwater is often polluted with nutrients due to the lack of wastewater treatment facilities and the high population density while large parts of the coastline consists of karst rocks and coral reefs coastal ecosystems along these coastlines may thus be affected by short and sudden pulses of high groundwater nutrient fluxes during times of high discharge which has to be considered by coastal managers and ecosystem studies

7032,during flood control reservoir operation uncertainties occur in flood forecasting hydrograph shape streamflow simulation reservoir storage water level and discharge outflow it is therefore important to analyze flood control risk due to these uncertainties this study proposes a stochastic simulation method comprising a copula based simulation method accounting for flood forecasting uncertainty a copula based single site daily streamflow simulation method for uncertainty in flood hydrograph and the latin hypercube sampling lhs method for uncertainty in storage water level and outflow discharge using the three gorges reservoir tgr as a case study the flood control risk defined by traditional statistical and entropy methods was calculated and compared the proposed method satisfactorily preserved the statistical characteristics of the original streamflow series results from the tgr case study showed that the entropy method was effective for assessing flood risk due to different uncertainties thus this study provides gives a comprehensive evaluation of flood risk during flood control reservoir operation keywords flood risk analysis flood control reservoir operation multiple uncertainties entropy theory copula function 1 introduction flood is a major natural disaster that strikes many countries each year and its consequences can be enormous in terms of loss of life and property pham 2011 from 1983 to 2003 floods caused on average 98 deaths and 4 5 billion in property damage per year in the united states alone morss et al 2005 the european commission 2011 reported that in europe there were more than 100 major damaging floods within a period of three years between 1998 and 2002 which represented on average more than 30 floods per year chen et al 2016a b one of the objectives of building dams and reservoirs on rivers is flood control chen et al 2016a b in practice the operation of a flood control reservoir is influenced by a multiple uncertainties bogner and pappenberger 2011 and judicious operation of reservoirs is therefore one of the most significant issues during a flood season the uncertainties that influence flood control reservoir operation introduces randomness in flood control targets e g highest water level terminal water level and outflow peak discharge zhu et al 2017a b yin et al 2018 analyzed the impact of design flood on reservoir routing the most important uncertainty is the flood forecast uncertainty shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2014a b chen et al 2016a b flood forecasts provide information about future streamflow and are vital in guiding the operation of a flood control reservoir zhu et al 2017a b other uncertainties arise from the hydrological model structure model input and parameter estimation and are usually measured by flood forecast errors considerable work has been done to investigate the effect of flood forecast uncertainty on reservoir operation li et al 2010a b evaluated the flood limited water level for reservoir operation considering the inflow uncertainty yan et al 2014 quantified the inflow forecasting errors and their impact on reservoir flood control operation ding et al 2015 derived analytical optimal hedging rules under different levels of forecast uncertainty with the assumption of unbiased gaussian distribution in these studies the flood error series was assumed to be normally distributed chen et al 2015a b c fitted several frequency distributions to the flood error series for different lead times calculated by different hydrological models and found that the assumption of normal distribution was not always justified and the use of this distribution for estimating flood risk might lead to incorrect results using the three gorges reservoir as a case study zhao et al 2013 showed that the forecast error was heavy tailed and non gaussian therefore flood risk analysis with flood forecast error following the normal distribution was not justified further the above studies did not consider the dependence among flood forecast errors usually flood forecast errors for diffident lead times are not independent of each other therefore it is logical to first consider the skewness and dependence in flood forecast errors and identify appropriate distributions in addition to flood forecast errors uncertainties in flood hydrographs also have a significant influence on the highest water level and maximum discharge if an n day flood volume is the same but the time when the flood peak occurs is different then reservoir operation is totally different li et al 2010a b analyzed the effect of error in flood hydrograph shape on reservoir operation the uncertainties in the discharge capacity curve water level storage curve and outflow were also considered in this study these uncertainties greatly influence reservoir operation chen et al 2014a b for judicious operation of reservoirs during a flood season analysis of flood control risk considering the above mentioned uncertainties should be carried out several methods for flood control risk analysis have been developed in recent years chen et al 2015a b c 2017 li et al 2010a b tung et al 2006 yan et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 which can be divided into two types one is based on the stochastic simulation method and the other is called analytical method chen et al 2015a b c the commonly used analytical methods are first order second moment fosm advanced first order second moment afosm and joint committee jc methods rackwitz and flessler 1978 unami et al 2010 wu et al 2011 these methods calculate risk using a reliability index derived from the characteristic values of uncertainties such as the mean value or variance however they assume that all uncertainties follow the normal distribution and are independent variables in order to overcome these limitations stochastic simulation methods have been used for flood control risk analysis chen et al 2015a b c since a multi reservoir system operation involves a variety of uncertainties it is difficult to analytically describe the relation between uncertainties and risk to overcome this difficulty monte carlo stochastic simulation can be employed which can easily consider multiple uncertainties for risk analysis the traditional method for risk analysis is based on the probability value it has the limitation that it cannot evaluate the whole flood risk during the flood control system as an alternative method the risk caused by the uncertainties can be evaluated using the entropy method the entropy theory has been used as an effective tool for risk managements chen et al 2013 chen and singh 2018 chen et al 2018 yang and qiu 2007 bowden 2011 pele et al 2017 for example yang and qiu 2007 used entropy based risk measures in a decision making model pele et al 2017 studied the link between the entropy of the distribution function of intraday returns and intraday and daily measures of market risk the impact of each uncertainty mentioned above on the reservoir operation can be quantified according to the value of entropy therefore the entropy based method was proposed for flood control risk analysis the objective of this study is therefore to propose an entropy based risk analysis method of flood control reservoir operation considering multiple uncertainties this paper considers the uncertainties in flood hydrograph shape flood forecasting discharge capacity water level storage curves and wind wave a copula based single site daily streamflow simulation method was used to simulate flood hydrographs and a copula based simulation method was used to simulate flood forecast errors with different lead times for other uncertainties the latin hypercube sampling lhs method was employed three gorges reservoir was selected as a case study the risk caused by single uncertainty and multiple uncertainties were calculated and analyzed based on the traditional and the entropy based flood control risk analysis methods the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the method for uncertainty simulation section 3 presents a flood control operation model considering simulated uncertainties based on the simulation of these uncertainties two flood control risk analysis methods are applied in section 4 section 5 discusses the results of flood control risk analysis and section 6 summarizes the conclusions 2 stochastic simulation of uncertainties a stochastic simulation method was used for simulating different uncertainties since there are some correlations among forecast errors with different lead times in addition the flood error series always follow a skewed distribution in order to describe the dependences and skewness characteristic among them a copula based simulation method was used to simulate flood forecast errors for the uncertainty in flood hydrograph since there is a great correlation between the streamflow at time t and t 1 it is necessary to simulate the streamflow at time t under the condition of streamflow at time t 1 therefore a copula based single site daily streamflow simulation method was employed to simulate flood hydrograph for the uncertainties in discharge capacity water level storage curves and wind wave they can be considered as independent variables in order to ensure the uniformity of the sampling the latin hypercube sampling lhs method was applied 2 1 simulation of uncertainties in flood forecasts the flood forecast uncertainty was measured by flood forecast errors the relative flood forecast error was expressed as 1 e s q t s q t s q t s s 1 2 h where qt s is the predicted streamflow at time t for time t s h is the lead time of flood forecast qt s is the observed streamflow at time t s and et s is the relative error between predicted and observed streamflow at time t for time t s a schematic of flood forecasting for different lead times is shown in fig 1 since the lead time of a flood forecast model is generally more than one day and there are dependences among uncertainties with different lead times simulation of flood forecast uncertainties is a multivariate problem the copula method was selected for simulating flood forecast uncertainties with different lead times the copula based joint distribution of these uncertainties with different lead times can be expressed as 2 f e 1 e 2 e s e h c u 1 u 2 u s u h where istherelativeforecasterrorseriesforleadtime is the relative forecast error series for lead time s and isthecumulative is the cumulative distribution function of the metaelliptical copula and vine copula are often employed to determine a higher dimensional joint distribution chen et al 2016a b for high dimensional variables the regular vine copula embraces a large number of possible pair copula decompositions aas et al 2009 which means that some additional structures may be used to select a more suitable vine composition the metaelliptical copula can model arbitrary pairwise dependences between variables though a correlation matrix therefore considering the advantage of metaelliptical copulas and the limitations of vine copula the metaelliptical copula was selected in this study the student t copula function was selected to construct the joint distribution for flood forecast errors and the maximum likelihood method mle method was used to estimate the parameters of the joint distribution since the flood forecast uncertainty series do not always follow the normal distribution distributions commonly used in hydrology including exponential exp generalized extreme value gev generalized logistic glo generalized pareto gpa generalized normal gno gumbel normal pearson type iii p iii wakeby and weibull distributions given in the appendix were selected as candidate marginal distributions for fitting the uncertainties the l moment method was used to estimate the parameters of the marginal distributions then the best fitted distribution was selected based on the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 zhang and singh 2007 chen et al 2015b 2017 1 based on the joint distribution flood forecast uncertainties were computed as follows 2 copula function was used to derive the joint distribution of flood forecast uncertainties a n d t h e p a r a m e t e r s w e r e e s t i m a t e d b y t h e m l e m e t h o d and the parameters were estimated by the mle method 3 first generate a uniform random vector ε 1 ε 2 ε h second let u 1 ε 1 since u 1 and ε 2 are known u 2 can be simulated by the conditional distribution c u 2 u 1 ε 2 and so forth since u 1 u i 1 and ε i are known u i can get a definite value by conditional distribution c u i u 1 u i 1 ε i finally the vector u 1 u 2 u h can be obtained and unique the error vector can be obtained from the inverse function of the marginal distribution e i f 1 u i the forecast uncertainties were simulated by repeating steps 2 and 3 2 2 simulation of uncertainties in flood hydrograph in order to simulate the uncertainties in flood hydrograph shape more hydrograph data at the daily scale were generated using the copula based single site stochastic simulation as proposed by lee and salas 2011 for this simulation the bivariate archimedean copula was used to construct the joint distribution using the copula based method for streamflow simulation lee and salas 2011 concluded that the gumbel copula showed a better fit than the frank or clayton copula for flood data the gumbel copula captured the upper tail dependences well and was hence used to simulate the flood hydrograph as follows suppose yt is the simulated streamflow of site a at time t the streamflow at time t is related to the previous streamflow at time t 1 in order to describe the correlation between these streamflow values the copula method was used to derive their joint distributions since streamflow at time t is conditioned on the previous streamflow at t 1 the conditional distribution was employed to generate the streamflow data the generating procedure with the conditional copula is summarized as follows 1 the pearson type iii p iii distribution was used as the marginal distributions of yt and yt 1 u t f y t and u t 1 f y t 1 2 the joint distribution wasestablishedbasedonthecopulamethod was established based on the copula method f y t 1 y t c u t 1 u t and the parameters of joint distribution were estimated based on the kendall tau method 3 since streamflow at the previous time t 1 is known u t 1 f y t 1 was calculated based on the p iii distribution generate a uniform random number ε c u t u t 1 ε since ut 1 and ε are known the value of u t was obtained from the inverse function c 1 u t u t 1 and ut was single value 4 the daily streamflow yt of site can be obtained from the inverse function f 1 u t note that the first value y 1 was generated from the marginal distribution f y 1 further information can be found in lee and salas 2008 2011 2 3 simulation of uncertainties in discharge capacity water level storage curves and wind wave besides the uncertainties in flood forecasts uncertainties in discharge capacity curve water level storage curve and wind wave also have an impact on flood control reservoir operation these uncertainties were also fitted by certain probability distributions 1 the uncertainty of discharge capacity refers to the error between the actual discharge q and the set discharge qs which is mainly measured by the reservoir discharge coefficient the relation between observed discharge and set discharge can be given as 3 q λ q s where λ is the discharge coefficient assumed to follow a normal distribution n 1 σ λ 2 wherein the value of σ λ was determined by the reservoir spillway conditions diao et al 2010 2 the uncertainty of reservoir storage is mainly due to sediment erosion and deposition measurement errors and other factors as a result the actual storage v is usually not equal to the measured storage vm determined by the original water level storage curve the water storage corresponding to a specific water level can be quantified by a normal distribution n v m σ m 2 where σ m was determined by the specific reservoir characteristics diao et al 2010 the water storage can also be expressed as 4 v v m v v n 0 σ m 2 where v is defined as the storage error between the actual storage and the measured storage 3 the wind related factors causing the rise of water level include the backwater height e and the wave run up height hp sun and huang 2005 since wind may come from different directions with different velocities the height of waves and backwater are random generally the backwater height and wave run up height caused by the wind can be assumed to follow the gumbel distribution and rayleigh distribution respectively sun et al 2012 zhang and tan 2014 in order to sample these uncertainties at the same time an efficient sampling method the lhs method pioneered by mckay et al 1979 and iman and conover 1980 was used for flood risk assessment its variants such as orthogonal array based lhs tang 1993 discrete lhs panida jirutitijaroen and singh 2008 and conditioned lhs silva et al 2015 have been applied for risk analysis estimation of parameters of neural networks and optimization algorithms yu et al 2009 giovanis and papadopoulos 2015 the advantages of lhs are a it has the effect of filtering the variance associated with the additive components of a transformation stein 1987 and b it gives a more uniform coverage of the solution space and more stable output with much less number of simulations compared to traditional monte carlo sampling the principle of the lhs method is illustrated in fig 2 the lhs was implemented by dividing the cumulative probability distribution of each variable into ns disjointed strata ns is equal to sample size with an equal length of 1 ns the samples of each distribution were extracted once from the respective ranges and randomly grouped into ns sample sets the procedure of sampling is as follows 1 determine the cumulative probability distribution function f of each variable 2 generate the ordering matrix p of n s n v where each column is a random permutation of integers from 1 to ns where nv is the number of variables 3 obtain the m kinds of uncertainties in each sample using the inverse function 5 x i j f j 1 1 n p i j θ i j i 1 2 n s j 1 2 n v where f j 1 is the inverse cumulative probability distribution function of the jth variable and θ i j is the random number between 0 and 1 which follows the uniform distribution 3 flood control reservoir operation considering simulated uncertainties reservoir routing was used for flood control reservoir operation the routing was based on the continuity equation and a storage elevation curve 6 q q dv dt h g 1 v where q q and v are the reservoir inflow outflow and storage respectively g is the function of water level storage and t is the time to do reservoir routing a discrete form of eq 6 was used as 7 v t 1 q t q t δ t v t h t 1 g 1 v t 1 where qt qt and vt are the reservoir average inflow outflow and storage at time t respectively vt 1 and ht 1 are the reservoir storage and water level at time t 1 respectively and isthetimeinterval is the time interval considering the above mentioned uncertainties in flood routing eq 7 was changed to 8 v t 1 q i t λ j q s t δ t v t h t 1 g 1 v t 1 v j e j h p j t 1 2 t i 1 2 n j 1 2 n s where qi t is the inflow of ith simulated flood hydrograph at time t which is produced by the summation of generated forecast error series and synthetic simulation inflow qs t is the reservoir discharge calculated by the operation model at time t λj vj ej and hpj are respectively the coefficient the storage error the backwater height and the wave run up height in the jth sample which were derived using the lhs method t is the duration of flood hydrograph n is the number of simulated flood hydrographs and ns t n is the sampling size based on the lhs method when the initial water level is given the water level of the reservoir and the discharge downstream during the entire reservoir operation can be derived by the iteration of eq 8 this procedure was repeated n times and a number of n flood control reservoir operations were then obtained which were used for subsequent risk analysis these forecast information was used in flood control operation for flood routing the pre release module was applied which has also been used by li et al 2010a b this method making use of the real time inflow forecast information aims to alleviate the flood severity by releasing the water stored in the reservoir before the arrival of a large flood chen et al 2016a b 4 flood control risk analysis the flood control risk was analyzed using the traditional method and the entropy method a framework of risk analysis is illustrated in fig 3 4 1 flood control risk analysis using the traditional method risk which is typically defined as the probability of failure when the load l on the system exceeds the resistance r can be expressed as zhu et al 2017a b 9 p f p l r in the reservoir flood control system the load can be the highest water level zm or peak discharge qm at the downstream control point and the resistance can be determined by the safe water level zs or the safe water release discharge qs thus flood control risk was defined as the probability of zm or qm exceeding zs or qs 10 p f 1 p z m z s o r p f 2 p q m q s based on the flood control operation discussed in section 3 the times that the highest water level exceeded the determined safe water level or the peak discharge exceeded the safe water release discharge were calculated and their corresponding flood control risk was computed as 11 p f 1 p z m z s m 1 n o r p f 2 p q m q s m 2 n where m1 represents the times of z m z s m2 represents the times of q m q s and n is the number of simulated flood hydrographs the risk assessment in flood control operation based on the traditional method is illustrated in fig 3 4 2 flood control risk analysis based on entropy method shannon 1948 formulated the entropy theory which can be used to quantify the amount of information in a data set for a discrete random variable x the shannon entropy canbeexpressedas can be expressed as 12 h x i 1 l p x i log p x i where istheprobabilitymassfunctionof is the probability mass function of x 0 p x i 1 and i 1 l p x i 1 if the variable is deterministic then it contains no uncertainty therefore in this case the information entropy is 0 chen 2015 entropy was used to assess the risk of flood control operation wherein the system risk wasexpressedas was expressed as 13 h r k 1 m j 1 n h kj x k 1 m j 1 n i 1 l p kj x i log p kj x i where x is the highest water level or the maximum discharge during the flood control operation m and n are the number of risk types and uncertainties respectively istheentropyofthe is the entropy of the riskcausedbythe risk caused by the uncertainty uncertainty l is the number of subintervals isthe is the ith subinterval and istheprobabilitythatthehighestwaterlevelfallsi is the probability that the highest water level falls in this proposed method can be used to evaluate the risk during the flood control operation caused by different uncertainties and the effect of different uncertainties on the reservoir operation can be qualified by the magnitude of h x the greater h x is the greater the impact of the uncertainty on flood control operation is in order to analyze multiple uncertainties and risk types in flood control operation the system risk of flood control operation was assessed by eq 13 the smaller the hr is the less uncertainty there is in flood control operation therefore the risk of flood control operation was judged by the value of hr if hr 0 the flood control operation is deterministic and has no risk and the risk of the entire system is 0 as uncertainty increases hr becomes larger and there is more risk in flood control operation 5 case study 5 1 data the three gorges reservoir located on the yangtze river in china was selected as a case study the main function of the tgr as shown in fig 4 is flood control the tgr basin encompasses an area of 1 106 km2 and the reservoir has a surface area of about 1080 km2 and the average width of about 1100 m zhou and guo 2014 during flood season the flood limited water level flwl of the tgr is generally 145 0 m for the 100 year and 1000 year floods the flood water level is 171 0 m and 175 0 m respectively and detailed water level information of the tgr is shown in fig 5 in this study daily flow data from the period 1878 to 2015 was used for flood routing in tgr a ruled based decision making method was used in this study which is also the current real time operation rules for tgr now as shown in table 1 5 2 uncertainties in stochastic simulation 5 2 1 flood forecast uncertainty simulation in real time flood control operation of tgr flood forecasts with a lead time of three days were considered a three dimensional copula function was selected to construct the joint distribution of flood forecast errors all candidate distributions given in appendix were used to fit the flood uncertainty data the rmse and aic were used for selecting the best fitting distribution for flood forecast errors the calculated rmse and aic for each marginal distribution are given in table 2 it is seen from table 2 that the values of rmse and aic corresponding to wakeby distribution are the smallest therefore the wakeby distribution was the best fitted distribution for flood forecast errors with different lead times the estimated parameters of the marginal and joint distributions are shown in table 3 and fig 6 respectively the fitting distributions are shown in fig 7 which shows that the distributions fitted the observed data well using simulation the forecast error series were generated based on the student t copula since the forecast lead time was three days the vector u 1 u 2 u 3 was calculated by u 1 ε 1 c u 2 u 1 ε 2 and c u 3 u 1 u 2 ε 3 the uncertainty vector e 1 e 2 e 3 was obtained from the inverse function of the wakeby distribution e 1 f 1 1 u 1 e 2 f 2 1 u 2 and e 3 f 3 1 u 3 respectively therefore the three dimensional forecast series was simulated by repeating the simulation steps the statistics of observed and simulated data of forecast errors including the mean value coefficient of variation cv and skewness cs were compared for the 3 day lead time chen et al 2016a b these statistics were illustrated by boxplots in fig 8 which gives the information of minimum lower quartile 25 of data less than this value median upper quartile 25 of data greater than this value and maximum values it is indicated from fig 8 that the generated statistics fitted the observed statistics well the median value of the mean forecast errors for 1 day 2 day and 3 day lead time are 0 83 1 38 and 2 41 respectively and the length of the boxplot elongates with the increase of lead time therefore results show that as the lead time increasing the forecast error will increase 5 2 2 simulation of uncertainties in flood hydrograph the copula method was applied for simulating the single site daily streamflow at tgr in order to demonstrate the performance of the single site daily streamflow simulation basic statistics including the mean daily streamflow cv and cs were calculated a set of mean value cv and cs can be obtained by a stochastic simulation 1000 sets of mean value cv and cs can be obtained after 1000 simulations these values were averaged to compare with the mean value cv and cs of observed data and they were shown in fig 9 in which the lines represent the average value of the mean daily streamflow cv and cs values for m samples the mean relative errors of these statistics were also calculated as given in table 4 it can be seen from fig 9 and table 4 that the mean value cv and cs of the simulated data fitted those of the observed data well 5 2 3 simulation of other uncertainties errors in discharge coefficient λ storage volume and wind wave height were fitted using three different distributions the errors in discharge coefficient λ and storage error v were fitted using the normal distribution respectively the backwater height error e was fitted using the gumbel distribution the wave run up height hp was fitted using the rayleigh distribution the parameters of the normal distributions were estimated by the moment method in which the first order and second order moments were employed to calculate the parameters of these distributions as shown in table 5 based on the lhs method n samples of discharge coefficient λ storage error v and wind wave height were simulated from the distributions given above to validate the distributions histograms of each variable based on the simulated samples were constructed as shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 c that the backwater wind impact height is in the order of 10 4 therefore it can be ignored in this case study 5 3 risk analysis of flood control four uncertainties flood forecast uncertainty discharge capacity water level storage curve and wind wave effect and one risk type the exceedance probability of the highest water level were considered in this study therefore an and f i r s t t h e f l o o d c o n t r o l r i s k w a s a n a l y z e d b y t h e t r a d i t i o n a l s t a t i s t i c a l m e t h o

e s first the flood control risk was analyzed by the traditional statistical method second the entropy theory was used to analyze the flood control operation risk by considering different uncertainties 5 3 1 results of traditional statistical analysis simulated forecast flood hydrographs were the input to the flood routing model other uncertainties simulated in section 5 2 were also considered in the reservoir operation after reservoir operation the highest water level for each hydrograph was known from the risk defined in section 4 1 different safe water levels zs were considered and their corresponding flood control risks were calculated using eq 11 the exceedance probabilities of some characteristic water level are listed in table 6 and the relation between the safe water level zs and the flood control risk are shown in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that it is not a smooth curve with two change points defined as change points 1 and 2 the reason for the first change point is that when the water level reaches 155 m of tgr the reservoir operation mode is changed and the discharge increases rapidly as shown in table 1 so is the reason for the second change point 2 5 3 2 entropy based method for flood control risk analysis the entropy theory was used to assess the flood control risk by considering uncertainties in flood forecast discharge capacity curve water level storage curve and wind wave were respectively considered in flood control operation the exceedance probabilities of characteristic water levels calculated by the traditional statistical method are shown in table 7 and the relation between the safe water level zs and the flood control risk is shown in fig 12 then the range of the highest water level was divided into two subintervals the entropy of the entire flood control operation system was calculated by equations 12 and 13 and results are shown in table 8 when h r 0 the flood control system risk is 0 when hr greater than 0 there is risk in flood control operation system for flood control risk of different water levels the whole system entropy values were calculated by eq 13 the operation risk was 0 when the highest water level was 180 4 m which means that for the return period of the design flood 10 000 years the flood control operation system was certain and the highest water level cannot exceed 180 4 m during flood control it also shows that if the flood event whose return period was greater than 10 000 years did not occur the risk of flood control operation system was 0 and tgd was safe during flood control according to the reservoir design criterion the highest water level corresponding to the 100 year and 1000 year design flood hydrographs are 171 m and 175 m respectively therefore the probabilities of the highest water level exceeding 171 m and 175 m during flood control are 0 01 and 0 001 respectively from eq 13 the system entropy h r 100 for the 100 year design criterion and the system entropy h r 1000 for the 1000 year design criterion were h r 100 0 2240 and h r 1000 0 03163 respectively it is seen from table 8 that the system entropies were 0 1921 and 0 03087 when the safe water levels were 171 m and 175 m respectively since these values were greater than 0 there was a risk during flood control operation system in addition these entropy values were less than the system entropy of design criteria 0 1921 h r 100 0 2240 and 0 03087 h r 1000 0 03163 respectively which means that the flood control operation system conformed to the design criteria it is seen from table 8 and fig 12 that the entropy values were nearly the same by considering four different uncertainties respectively moreover the difference in these entropy values and those entropy values that simultaneously considered four uncertainties were small the reasons for this result is as follows a the flood control operation risk is mainly caused by the flood hydrograph shape and other uncertainties have relatively less impact on flood control operation system b the effects of the four uncertainties can be offset during flood control for example the water level could increase when the flood forecast is relatively small at the same time the water level could decline when the error of discharge capacity curve is relatively large furthermore as the determined safe water level increases the operation system entropy becomes smaller and the flood control operation system risk becomes smaller therefore the proposed method a new approach for flood control risk analysis was reasonable to assess flood control risk 6 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 in this study the uncertainties in flood hydrographs shape flood forecasts discharge capacity of reservoirs water level storage curves and the impact of wind wave were considered during the flood control reservoir operation a copula based single site daily streamflow simulation method was used to simulate flood hydrographs and a copula based simulation method was used to simulate flood forecast errors with different lead times for other uncertainties the lhs method was applied the simulated uncertainties series which captures the statistical characteristics of the original sequence can be used for flood control risk analysis this study considering multiple uncertainties gives a comprehensive evaluation of flood risk during the flood control reservoir operation 2 this study presents a risk analysis method for flood control operation based on entropy theory entropy can be used as a measure to assess risk the risk caused by the uncertainties can be evaluated using the entropy method and the impact of each uncertainty factor on the reservoir operation was quantified according to the value of shannon entropy the proposed entropy method for risk analysis is superior to the traditional method because the proposed method can qualify the impact of each uncertainties on the reservoir operation furthermore the proposed method can evaluate the total risk including the risk that the highest water level exceeds the safe water level and the discharge exceeds the safe water release downstream because of the additivity of the value of entropy 3 results of case study show that the influence of each uncertainty on flood control reservoir operation is nearly the same when multiple uncertainties were considered at the same time the effects of these uncertainties may cancel each other out during the flood control reservoir operation it shows that it is necessary to consider uncertainties on flood control operation and the entropy method is reasonable and applicable at the same time it also provides a new way for flood risk analysis acknowledgments this study is

7032,during flood control reservoir operation uncertainties occur in flood forecasting hydrograph shape streamflow simulation reservoir storage water level and discharge outflow it is therefore important to analyze flood control risk due to these uncertainties this study proposes a stochastic simulation method comprising a copula based simulation method accounting for flood forecasting uncertainty a copula based single site daily streamflow simulation method for uncertainty in flood hydrograph and the latin hypercube sampling lhs method for uncertainty in storage water level and outflow discharge using the three gorges reservoir tgr as a case study the flood control risk defined by traditional statistical and entropy methods was calculated and compared the proposed method satisfactorily preserved the statistical characteristics of the original streamflow series results from the tgr case study showed that the entropy method was effective for assessing flood risk due to different uncertainties thus this study provides gives a comprehensive evaluation of flood risk during flood control reservoir operation keywords flood risk analysis flood control reservoir operation multiple uncertainties entropy theory copula function 1 introduction flood is a major natural disaster that strikes many countries each year and its consequences can be enormous in terms of loss of life and property pham 2011 from 1983 to 2003 floods caused on average 98 deaths and 4 5 billion in property damage per year in the united states alone morss et al 2005 the european commission 2011 reported that in europe there were more than 100 major damaging floods within a period of three years between 1998 and 2002 which represented on average more than 30 floods per year chen et al 2016a b one of the objectives of building dams and reservoirs on rivers is flood control chen et al 2016a b in practice the operation of a flood control reservoir is influenced by a multiple uncertainties bogner and pappenberger 2011 and judicious operation of reservoirs is therefore one of the most significant issues during a flood season the uncertainties that influence flood control reservoir operation introduces randomness in flood control targets e g highest water level terminal water level and outflow peak discharge zhu et al 2017a b yin et al 2018 analyzed the impact of design flood on reservoir routing the most important uncertainty is the flood forecast uncertainty shi et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 chen et al 2014a b chen et al 2016a b flood forecasts provide information about future streamflow and are vital in guiding the operation of a flood control reservoir zhu et al 2017a b other uncertainties arise from the hydrological model structure model input and parameter estimation and are usually measured by flood forecast errors considerable work has been done to investigate the effect of flood forecast uncertainty on reservoir operation li et al 2010a b evaluated the flood limited water level for reservoir operation considering the inflow uncertainty yan et al 2014 quantified the inflow forecasting errors and their impact on reservoir flood control operation ding et al 2015 derived analytical optimal hedging rules under different levels of forecast uncertainty with the assumption of unbiased gaussian distribution in these studies the flood error series was assumed to be normally distributed chen et al 2015a b c fitted several frequency distributions to the flood error series for different lead times calculated by different hydrological models and found that the assumption of normal distribution was not always justified and the use of this distribution for estimating flood risk might lead to incorrect results using the three gorges reservoir as a case study zhao et al 2013 showed that the forecast error was heavy tailed and non gaussian therefore flood risk analysis with flood forecast error following the normal distribution was not justified further the above studies did not consider the dependence among flood forecast errors usually flood forecast errors for diffident lead times are not independent of each other therefore it is logical to first consider the skewness and dependence in flood forecast errors and identify appropriate distributions in addition to flood forecast errors uncertainties in flood hydrographs also have a significant influence on the highest water level and maximum discharge if an n day flood volume is the same but the time when the flood peak occurs is different then reservoir operation is totally different li et al 2010a b analyzed the effect of error in flood hydrograph shape on reservoir operation the uncertainties in the discharge capacity curve water level storage curve and outflow were also considered in this study these uncertainties greatly influence reservoir operation chen et al 2014a b for judicious operation of reservoirs during a flood season analysis of flood control risk considering the above mentioned uncertainties should be carried out several methods for flood control risk analysis have been developed in recent years chen et al 2015a b c 2017 li et al 2010a b tung et al 2006 yan et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 which can be divided into two types one is based on the stochastic simulation method and the other is called analytical method chen et al 2015a b c the commonly used analytical methods are first order second moment fosm advanced first order second moment afosm and joint committee jc methods rackwitz and flessler 1978 unami et al 2010 wu et al 2011 these methods calculate risk using a reliability index derived from the characteristic values of uncertainties such as the mean value or variance however they assume that all uncertainties follow the normal distribution and are independent variables in order to overcome these limitations stochastic simulation methods have been used for flood control risk analysis chen et al 2015a b c since a multi reservoir system operation involves a variety of uncertainties it is difficult to analytically describe the relation between uncertainties and risk to overcome this difficulty monte carlo stochastic simulation can be employed which can easily consider multiple uncertainties for risk analysis the traditional method for risk analysis is based on the probability value it has the limitation that it cannot evaluate the whole flood risk during the flood control system as an alternative method the risk caused by the uncertainties can be evaluated using the entropy method the entropy theory has been used as an effective tool for risk managements chen et al 2013 chen and singh 2018 chen et al 2018 yang and qiu 2007 bowden 2011 pele et al 2017 for example yang and qiu 2007 used entropy based risk measures in a decision making model pele et al 2017 studied the link between the entropy of the distribution function of intraday returns and intraday and daily measures of market risk the impact of each uncertainty mentioned above on the reservoir operation can be quantified according to the value of entropy therefore the entropy based method was proposed for flood control risk analysis the objective of this study is therefore to propose an entropy based risk analysis method of flood control reservoir operation considering multiple uncertainties this paper considers the uncertainties in flood hydrograph shape flood forecasting discharge capacity water level storage curves and wind wave a copula based single site daily streamflow simulation method was used to simulate flood hydrographs and a copula based simulation method was used to simulate flood forecast errors with different lead times for other uncertainties the latin hypercube sampling lhs method was employed three gorges reservoir was selected as a case study the risk caused by single uncertainty and multiple uncertainties were calculated and analyzed based on the traditional and the entropy based flood control risk analysis methods the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the method for uncertainty simulation section 3 presents a flood control operation model considering simulated uncertainties based on the simulation of these uncertainties two flood control risk analysis methods are applied in section 4 section 5 discusses the results of flood control risk analysis and section 6 summarizes the conclusions 2 stochastic simulation of uncertainties a stochastic simulation method was used for simulating different uncertainties since there are some correlations among forecast errors with different lead times in addition the flood error series always follow a skewed distribution in order to describe the dependences and skewness characteristic among them a copula based simulation method was used to simulate flood forecast errors for the uncertainty in flood hydrograph since there is a great correlation between the streamflow at time t and t 1 it is necessary to simulate the streamflow at time t under the condition of streamflow at time t 1 therefore a copula based single site daily streamflow simulation method was employed to simulate flood hydrograph for the uncertainties in discharge capacity water level storage curves and wind wave they can be considered as independent variables in order to ensure the uniformity of the sampling the latin hypercube sampling lhs method was applied 2 1 simulation of uncertainties in flood forecasts the flood forecast uncertainty was measured by flood forecast errors the relative flood forecast error was expressed as 1 e s q t s q t s q t s s 1 2 h where qt s is the predicted streamflow at time t for time t s h is the lead time of flood forecast qt s is the observed streamflow at time t s and et s is the relative error between predicted and observed streamflow at time t for time t s a schematic of flood forecasting for different lead times is shown in fig 1 since the lead time of a flood forecast model is generally more than one day and there are dependences among uncertainties with different lead times simulation of flood forecast uncertainties is a multivariate problem the copula method was selected for simulating flood forecast uncertainties with different lead times the copula based joint distribution of these uncertainties with different lead times can be expressed as 2 f e 1 e 2 e s e h c u 1 u 2 u s u h where istherelativeforecasterrorseriesforleadtime is the relative forecast error series for lead time s and isthecumulative is the cumulative distribution function of the metaelliptical copula and vine copula are often employed to determine a higher dimensional joint distribution chen et al 2016a b for high dimensional variables the regular vine copula embraces a large number of possible pair copula decompositions aas et al 2009 which means that some additional structures may be used to select a more suitable vine composition the metaelliptical copula can model arbitrary pairwise dependences between variables though a correlation matrix therefore considering the advantage of metaelliptical copulas and the limitations of vine copula the metaelliptical copula was selected in this study the student t copula function was selected to construct the joint distribution for flood forecast errors and the maximum likelihood method mle method was used to estimate the parameters of the joint distribution since the flood forecast uncertainty series do not always follow the normal distribution distributions commonly used in hydrology including exponential exp generalized extreme value gev generalized logistic glo generalized pareto gpa generalized normal gno gumbel normal pearson type iii p iii wakeby and weibull distributions given in the appendix were selected as candidate marginal distributions for fitting the uncertainties the l moment method was used to estimate the parameters of the marginal distributions then the best fitted distribution was selected based on the root mean square error rmse and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 zhang and singh 2007 chen et al 2015b 2017 1 based on the joint distribution flood forecast uncertainties were computed as follows 2 copula function was used to derive the joint distribution of flood forecast uncertainties a n d t h e p a r a m e t e r s w e r e e s t i m a t e d b y t h e m l e m e t h o d and the parameters were estimated by the mle method 3 first generate a uniform random vector ε 1 ε 2 ε h second let u 1 ε 1 since u 1 and ε 2 are known u 2 can be simulated by the conditional distribution c u 2 u 1 ε 2 and so forth since u 1 u i 1 and ε i are known u i can get a definite value by conditional distribution c u i u 1 u i 1 ε i finally the vector u 1 u 2 u h can be obtained and unique the error vector can be obtained from the inverse function of the marginal distribution e i f 1 u i the forecast uncertainties were simulated by repeating steps 2 and 3 2 2 simulation of uncertainties in flood hydrograph in order to simulate the uncertainties in flood hydrograph shape more hydrograph data at the daily scale were generated using the copula based single site stochastic simulation as proposed by lee and salas 2011 for this simulation the bivariate archimedean copula was used to construct the joint distribution using the copula based method for streamflow simulation lee and salas 2011 concluded that the gumbel copula showed a better fit than the frank or clayton copula for flood data the gumbel copula captured the upper tail dependences well and was hence used to simulate the flood hydrograph as follows suppose yt is the simulated streamflow of site a at time t the streamflow at time t is related to the previous streamflow at time t 1 in order to describe the correlation between these streamflow values the copula method was used to derive their joint distributions since streamflow at time t is conditioned on the previous streamflow at t 1 the conditional distribution was employed to generate the streamflow data the generating procedure with the conditional copula is summarized as follows 1 the pearson type iii p iii distribution was used as the marginal distributions of yt and yt 1 u t f y t and u t 1 f y t 1 2 the joint distribution wasestablishedbasedonthecopulamethod was established based on the copula method f y t 1 y t c u t 1 u t and the parameters of joint distribution were estimated based on the kendall tau method 3 since streamflow at the previous time t 1 is known u t 1 f y t 1 was calculated based on the p iii distribution generate a uniform random number ε c u t u t 1 ε since ut 1 and ε are known the value of u t was obtained from the inverse function c 1 u t u t 1 and ut was single value 4 the daily streamflow yt of site can be obtained from the inverse function f 1 u t note that the first value y 1 was generated from the marginal distribution f y 1 further information can be found in lee and salas 2008 2011 2 3 simulation of uncertainties in discharge capacity water level storage curves and wind wave besides the uncertainties in flood forecasts uncertainties in discharge capacity curve water level storage curve and wind wave also have an impact on flood control reservoir operation these uncertainties were also fitted by certain probability distributions 1 the uncertainty of discharge capacity refers to the error between the actual discharge q and the set discharge qs which is mainly measured by the reservoir discharge coefficient the relation between observed discharge and set discharge can be given as 3 q λ q s where λ is the discharge coefficient assumed to follow a normal distribution n 1 σ λ 2 wherein the value of σ λ was determined by the reservoir spillway conditions diao et al 2010 2 the uncertainty of reservoir storage is mainly due to sediment erosion and deposition measurement errors and other factors as a result the actual storage v is usually not equal to the measured storage vm determined by the original water level storage curve the water storage corresponding to a specific water level can be quantified by a normal distribution n v m σ m 2 where σ m was determined by the specific reservoir characteristics diao et al 2010 the water storage can also be expressed as 4 v v m v v n 0 σ m 2 where v is defined as the storage error between the actual storage and the measured storage 3 the wind related factors causing the rise of water level include the backwater height e and the wave run up height hp sun and huang 2005 since wind may come from different directions with different velocities the height of waves and backwater are random generally the backwater height and wave run up height caused by the wind can be assumed to follow the gumbel distribution and rayleigh distribution respectively sun et al 2012 zhang and tan 2014 in order to sample these uncertainties at the same time an efficient sampling method the lhs method pioneered by mckay et al 1979 and iman and conover 1980 was used for flood risk assessment its variants such as orthogonal array based lhs tang 1993 discrete lhs panida jirutitijaroen and singh 2008 and conditioned lhs silva et al 2015 have been applied for risk analysis estimation of parameters of neural networks and optimization algorithms yu et al 2009 giovanis and papadopoulos 2015 the advantages of lhs are a it has the effect of filtering the variance associated with the additive components of a transformation stein 1987 and b it gives a more uniform coverage of the solution space and more stable output with much less number of simulations compared to traditional monte carlo sampling the principle of the lhs method is illustrated in fig 2 the lhs was implemented by dividing the cumulative probability distribution of each variable into ns disjointed strata ns is equal to sample size with an equal length of 1 ns the samples of each distribution were extracted once from the respective ranges and randomly grouped into ns sample sets the procedure of sampling is as follows 1 determine the cumulative probability distribution function f of each variable 2 generate the ordering matrix p of n s n v where each column is a random permutation of integers from 1 to ns where nv is the number of variables 3 obtain the m kinds of uncertainties in each sample using the inverse function 5 x i j f j 1 1 n p i j θ i j i 1 2 n s j 1 2 n v where f j 1 is the inverse cumulative probability distribution function of the jth variable and θ i j is the random number between 0 and 1 which follows the uniform distribution 3 flood control reservoir operation considering simulated uncertainties reservoir routing was used for flood control reservoir operation the routing was based on the continuity equation and a storage elevation curve 6 q q dv dt h g 1 v where q q and v are the reservoir inflow outflow and storage respectively g is the function of water level storage and t is the time to do reservoir routing a discrete form of eq 6 was used as 7 v t 1 q t q t δ t v t h t 1 g 1 v t 1 where qt qt and vt are the reservoir average inflow outflow and storage at time t respectively vt 1 and ht 1 are the reservoir storage and water level at time t 1 respectively and isthetimeinterval is the time interval considering the above mentioned uncertainties in flood routing eq 7 was changed to 8 v t 1 q i t λ j q s t δ t v t h t 1 g 1 v t 1 v j e j h p j t 1 2 t i 1 2 n j 1 2 n s where qi t is the inflow of ith simulated flood hydrograph at time t which is produced by the summation of generated forecast error series and synthetic simulation inflow qs t is the reservoir discharge calculated by the operation model at time t λj vj ej and hpj are respectively the coefficient the storage error the backwater height and the wave run up height in the jth sample which were derived using the lhs method t is the duration of flood hydrograph n is the number of simulated flood hydrographs and ns t n is the sampling size based on the lhs method when the initial water level is given the water level of the reservoir and the discharge downstream during the entire reservoir operation can be derived by the iteration of eq 8 this procedure was repeated n times and a number of n flood control reservoir operations were then obtained which were used for subsequent risk analysis these forecast information was used in flood control operation for flood routing the pre release module was applied which has also been used by li et al 2010a b this method making use of the real time inflow forecast information aims to alleviate the flood severity by releasing the water stored in the reservoir before the arrival of a large flood chen et al 2016a b 4 flood control risk analysis the flood control risk was analyzed using the traditional method and the entropy method a framework of risk analysis is illustrated in fig 3 4 1 flood control risk analysis using the traditional method risk which is typically defined as the probability of failure when the load l on the system exceeds the resistance r can be expressed as zhu et al 2017a b 9 p f p l r in the reservoir flood control system the load can be the highest water level zm or peak discharge qm at the downstream control point and the resistance can be determined by the safe water level zs or the safe water release discharge qs thus flood control risk was defined as the probability of zm or qm exceeding zs or qs 10 p f 1 p z m z s o r p f 2 p q m q s based on the flood control operation discussed in section 3 the times that the highest water level exceeded the determined safe water level or the peak discharge exceeded the safe water release discharge were calculated and their corresponding flood control risk was computed as 11 p f 1 p z m z s m 1 n o r p f 2 p q m q s m 2 n where m1 represents the times of z m z s m2 represents the times of q m q s and n is the number of simulated flood hydrographs the risk assessment in flood control operation based on the traditional method is illustrated in fig 3 4 2 flood control risk analysis based on entropy method shannon 1948 formulated the entropy theory which can be used to quantify the amount of information in a data set for a discrete random variable x the shannon entropy canbeexpressedas can be expressed as 12 h x i 1 l p x i log p x i where istheprobabilitymassfunctionof is the probability mass function of x 0 p x i 1 and i 1 l p x i 1 if the variable is deterministic then it contains no uncertainty therefore in this case the information entropy is 0 chen 2015 entropy was used to assess the risk of flood control operation wherein the system risk wasexpressedas was expressed as 13 h r k 1 m j 1 n h kj x k 1 m j 1 n i 1 l p kj x i log p kj x i where x is the highest water level or the maximum discharge during the flood control operation m and n are the number of risk types and uncertainties respectively istheentropyofthe is the entropy of the riskcausedbythe risk caused by the uncertainty uncertainty l is the number of subintervals isthe is the ith subinterval and istheprobabilitythatthehighestwaterlevelfallsi is the probability that the highest water level falls in this proposed method can be used to evaluate the risk during the flood control operation caused by different uncertainties and the effect of different uncertainties on the reservoir operation can be qualified by the magnitude of h x the greater h x is the greater the impact of the uncertainty on flood control operation is in order to analyze multiple uncertainties and risk types in flood control operation the system risk of flood control operation was assessed by eq 13 the smaller the hr is the less uncertainty there is in flood control operation therefore the risk of flood control operation was judged by the value of hr if hr 0 the flood control operation is deterministic and has no risk and the risk of the entire system is 0 as uncertainty increases hr becomes larger and there is more risk in flood control operation 5 case study 5 1 data the three gorges reservoir located on the yangtze river in china was selected as a case study the main function of the tgr as shown in fig 4 is flood control the tgr basin encompasses an area of 1 106 km2 and the reservoir has a surface area of about 1080 km2 and the average width of about 1100 m zhou and guo 2014 during flood season the flood limited water level flwl of the tgr is generally 145 0 m for the 100 year and 1000 year floods the flood water level is 171 0 m and 175 0 m respectively and detailed water level information of the tgr is shown in fig 5 in this study daily flow data from the period 1878 to 2015 was used for flood routing in tgr a ruled based decision making method was used in this study which is also the current real time operation rules for tgr now as shown in table 1 5 2 uncertainties in stochastic simulation 5 2 1 flood forecast uncertainty simulation in real time flood control operation of tgr flood forecasts with a lead time of three days were considered a three dimensional copula function was selected to construct the joint distribution of flood forecast errors all candidate distributions given in appendix were used to fit the flood uncertainty data the rmse and aic were used for selecting the best fitting distribution for flood forecast errors the calculated rmse and aic for each marginal distribution are given in table 2 it is seen from table 2 that the values of rmse and aic corresponding to wakeby distribution are the smallest therefore the wakeby distribution was the best fitted distribution for flood forecast errors with different lead times the estimated parameters of the marginal and joint distributions are shown in table 3 and fig 6 respectively the fitting distributions are shown in fig 7 which shows that the distributions fitted the observed data well using simulation the forecast error series were generated based on the student t copula since the forecast lead time was three days the vector u 1 u 2 u 3 was calculated by u 1 ε 1 c u 2 u 1 ε 2 and c u 3 u 1 u 2 ε 3 the uncertainty vector e 1 e 2 e 3 was obtained from the inverse function of the wakeby distribution e 1 f 1 1 u 1 e 2 f 2 1 u 2 and e 3 f 3 1 u 3 respectively therefore the three dimensional forecast series was simulated by repeating the simulation steps the statistics of observed and simulated data of forecast errors including the mean value coefficient of variation cv and skewness cs were compared for the 3 day lead time chen et al 2016a b these statistics were illustrated by boxplots in fig 8 which gives the information of minimum lower quartile 25 of data less than this value median upper quartile 25 of data greater than this value and maximum values it is indicated from fig 8 that the generated statistics fitted the observed statistics well the median value of the mean forecast errors for 1 day 2 day and 3 day lead time are 0 83 1 38 and 2 41 respectively and the length of the boxplot elongates with the increase of lead time therefore results show that as the lead time increasing the forecast error will increase 5 2 2 simulation of uncertainties in flood hydrograph the copula method was applied for simulating the single site daily streamflow at tgr in order to demonstrate the performance of the single site daily streamflow simulation basic statistics including the mean daily streamflow cv and cs were calculated a set of mean value cv and cs can be obtained by a stochastic simulation 1000 sets of mean value cv and cs can be obtained after 1000 simulations these values were averaged to compare with the mean value cv and cs of observed data and they were shown in fig 9 in which the lines represent the average value of the mean daily streamflow cv and cs values for m samples the mean relative errors of these statistics were also calculated as given in table 4 it can be seen from fig 9 and table 4 that the mean value cv and cs of the simulated data fitted those of the observed data well 5 2 3 simulation of other uncertainties errors in discharge coefficient λ storage volume and wind wave height were fitted using three different distributions the errors in discharge coefficient λ and storage error v were fitted using the normal distribution respectively the backwater height error e was fitted using the gumbel distribution the wave run up height hp was fitted using the rayleigh distribution the parameters of the normal distributions were estimated by the moment method in which the first order and second order moments were employed to calculate the parameters of these distributions as shown in table 5 based on the lhs method n samples of discharge coefficient λ storage error v and wind wave height were simulated from the distributions given above to validate the distributions histograms of each variable based on the simulated samples were constructed as shown in fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 c that the backwater wind impact height is in the order of 10 4 therefore it can be ignored in this case study 5 3 risk analysis of flood control four uncertainties flood forecast uncertainty discharge capacity water level storage curve and wind wave effect and one risk type the exceedance probability of the highest water level were considered in this study therefore an and f i r s t t h e f l o o d c o n t r o l r i s k w a s a n a l y z e d b y t h e t r a d i t i o n a l s t a t i s t i c a l m e t h o

e s first the flood control risk was analyzed by the traditional statistical method second the entropy theory was used to analyze the flood control operation risk by considering different uncertainties 5 3 1 results of traditional statistical analysis simulated forecast flood hydrographs were the input to the flood routing model other uncertainties simulated in section 5 2 were also considered in the reservoir operation after reservoir operation the highest water level for each hydrograph was known from the risk defined in section 4 1 different safe water levels zs were considered and their corresponding flood control risks were calculated using eq 11 the exceedance probabilities of some characteristic water level are listed in table 6 and the relation between the safe water level zs and the flood control risk are shown in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that it is not a smooth curve with two change points defined as change points 1 and 2 the reason for the first change point is that when the water level reaches 155 m of tgr the reservoir operation mode is changed and the discharge increases rapidly as shown in table 1 so is the reason for the second change point 2 5 3 2 entropy based method for flood control risk analysis the entropy theory was used to assess the flood control risk by considering uncertainties in flood forecast discharge capacity curve water level storage curve and wind wave were respectively considered in flood control operation the exceedance probabilities of characteristic water levels calculated by the traditional statistical method are shown in table 7 and the relation between the safe water level zs and the flood control risk is shown in fig 12 then the range of the highest water level was divided into two subintervals the entropy of the entire flood control operation system was calculated by equations 12 and 13 and results are shown in table 8 when h r 0 the flood control system risk is 0 when hr greater than 0 there is risk in flood control operation system for flood control risk of different water levels the whole system entropy values were calculated by eq 13 the operation risk was 0 when the highest water level was 180 4 m which means that for the return period of the design flood 10 000 years the flood control operation system was certain and the highest water level cannot exceed 180 4 m during flood control it also shows that if the flood event whose return period was greater than 10 000 years did not occur the risk of flood control operation system was 0 and tgd was safe during flood control according to the reservoir design criterion the highest water level corresponding to the 100 year and 1000 year design flood hydrographs are 171 m and 175 m respectively therefore the probabilities of the highest water level exceeding 171 m and 175 m during flood control are 0 01 and 0 001 respectively from eq 13 the system entropy h r 100 for the 100 year design criterion and the system entropy h r 1000 for the 1000 year design criterion were h r 100 0 2240 and h r 1000 0 03163 respectively it is seen from table 8 that the system entropies were 0 1921 and 0 03087 when the safe water levels were 171 m and 175 m respectively since these values were greater than 0 there was a risk during flood control operation system in addition these entropy values were less than the system entropy of design criteria 0 1921 h r 100 0 2240 and 0 03087 h r 1000 0 03163 respectively which means that the flood control operation system conformed to the design criteria it is seen from table 8 and fig 12 that the entropy values were nearly the same by considering four different uncertainties respectively moreover the difference in these entropy values and those entropy values that simultaneously considered four uncertainties were small the reasons for this result is as follows a the flood control operation risk is mainly caused by the flood hydrograph shape and other uncertainties have relatively less impact on flood control operation system b the effects of the four uncertainties can be offset during flood control for example the water level could increase when the flood forecast is relatively small at the same time the water level could decline when the error of discharge capacity curve is relatively large furthermore as the determined safe water level increases the operation system entropy becomes smaller and the flood control operation system risk becomes smaller therefore the proposed method a new approach for flood control risk analysis was reasonable to assess flood control risk 6 conclusions the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 in this study the uncertainties in flood hydrographs shape flood forecasts discharge capacity of reservoirs water level storage curves and the impact of wind wave were considered during the flood control reservoir operation a copula based single site daily streamflow simulation method was used to simulate flood hydrographs and a copula based simulation method was used to simulate flood forecast errors with different lead times for other uncertainties the lhs method was applied the simulated uncertainties series which captures the statistical characteristics of the original sequence can be used for flood control risk analysis this study considering multiple uncertainties gives a comprehensive evaluation of flood risk during the flood control reservoir operation 2 this study presents a risk analysis method for flood control operation based on entropy theory entropy can be used as a measure to assess risk the risk caused by the uncertainties can be evaluated using the entropy method and the impact of each uncertainty factor on the reservoir operation was quantified according to the value of shannon entropy the proposed entropy method for risk analysis is superior to the traditional method because the proposed method can qualify the impact of each uncertainties on the reservoir operation furthermore the proposed method can evaluate the total risk including the risk that the highest water level exceeds the safe water level and the discharge exceeds the safe water release downstream because of the additivity of the value of entropy 3 results of case study show that the influence of each uncertainty on flood control reservoir operation is nearly the same when multiple uncertainties were considered at the same time the effects of these uncertainties may cancel each other out during the flood control reservoir operation it shows that it is necessary to consider uncertainties on flood control operation and the entropy method is reasonable and applicable at the same time it also provides a new way for flood risk analysis acknowledgments this study is

7033,precipitation plays an important role in any hydrological analysis the aim of this study is to empirically investigate the behaviour of spatial dependence of precipitation fields this would determine whether the gaussian assumption is fulfilled in regard to symmetric spatial dependence structure between low and high precipitation values an asymmetry function that can incorporate zero precipitation amounts is introduced on the basis of empirical bivariate copulas the asymmetry function is calculated by integrating the empirical bivariate copula density in the upper right and the lower left parts for any given quantile thresholds zero precipitation amounts are handled as latent variables and the thresholds therefore are set to be bigger than probability of zero the gaussian simulations based testing is applied for determining the degree of uncertainty the empirical bivariate copulas are constructed using the concept of regionalized variables in spatial random process with a given separating distance for any selected time interval the precipitation over the region of interest is assumed to be a single realization of a spatially stationary random process the investigations are conducted in singapore and bavaria to take temporal characteristics and seasons into account precipitation occurrences with different time scales for different seasons are analysed the empirical evidence proves that the precipitation events tend to follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence structure particularly at a short separating distance this implies that precipitation amounts with higher intensities tends to be more spatially correlated than that with lower intensities because precipitation occurrences tend to occur in a clustered manner consequently spatial precipitation models that are based on the symmetric gaussian dependence could result in an underestimation of the spatial extent of actual precipitation extremes moreover this pattern is higher for smaller time scales hourly to daily keywords precipitation asymmetric dependence empirical copula 1 introduction reliable spatial information on precipitation is required for water resources planning and management since solid evidence has shown that precipitation exhibits high spatial variability unfortunately the spatial coverage of available precipitation data is frequently inadequate for accurately representing the spatial distribution of precipitation the low densities of precipitation gauge network cause the poor quality of spatial precipitation data hence a reliable spatial interpolation method is necessary to estimate ungauged areas a variety of spatial interpolation models have been developed for precipitation applications over the last half of the century the models have been implemented in a variety of different regions such as in the mediterranean area casas et al 2004 alpine countries serinaldi and kilsby 2014 bárdossy and pegram 2013 and in various area sizes ranging from small aghakouchak et al 2010 aghakouchak et al 2010 aghakouchak et al 2010 to large areas serinaldi and kilsby 2014 bárdossy and pegram 2013 the spatial precipitation models are commonly developed based on either a multi site approach serinaldi 2009 wilks 1998 srikanthan and pegram 2009 wilks 1999 wilks 1999 bárdossy and pegram 2009 villarini et al 2014 vrac et al 2007 bárdossy and pegram 2014 or grid cells bárdossy and pegram 2012 aghakouchak et al 2010 bárdossy and pegram 2013 gyasi agyei 2016 many of these methods are developed based on the gaussian assumption because they are derived from the concept of linear regression in particular one of the spatial models that has popularly been implemented in precipitation studies is the kriging model kriging type models can be classified into stochastic models which are able to deliver uncertainty of the interpolation quality directly with its variances because precipitation behavior exhibits a higher uncertainty of spatial distribution of precipitation however kriging models offer the quality of interpolation that is simply a function of the observation density and the variogram models bárdossy 2006 this function can only describe the spatial dependence as an integral over the whole distribution of the parameter values therefore anomalies in the observations and locations with high or low variabilities cannot be considered for estimating the kriging variances bárdossy and li 2008 these models cannot properly detect the different percentile values for example extremes which have a different spatial dependence structure from the mid values bárdossy 2006 this issue is relevant to precipitation fields that are characterized by a skewed distribution consequently variogram functions that are dominated by only a few anomalously differing pairs might occur with regard to the above issue copula based modeling is a promising tool to overcome the drawbacks the copula is also flexible to separately analyse the marginal distributions from the joint distributions and allows them to be same or different from the distribution family furthermore the copula is capable of expressing a good deal of dependence structures on a quantile scale which can detect both non linear and tail or asymmetric dependences nelsen 2006 spatial interpolation copula models have recently been implemented in precipitation studies bárdossy and pegram 2013 bárdossy and pegram 2014 wasko et al 2013 a precipitation event shows a skewed behavior in univariate cases and is more clearly detected at a higher time resolution such as hourly or daily indeed some common non gaussian based models such as exponential gamma gumbel weibull and pareto distributions can successfully be implemented to address the skewed distribution of precipitation in the univariate cases in contrast modelling of the skewed precipitation events at the multivariate cases is still challenging due to its complexity although few models have been built to overcome the skewed behavior of precipitation many of them are limited to be applied in the bivariate cases the spatial models underlying gaussian assumption are convenient for computation but could deviate from reality either under or overestimating if the assumption is difficult to fulfil one of the characteristics of the gaussian assumption is a structure of symmetric dependence between low and high values consequently empirical investigations into asymmetric spatial dependence on the characteristics of precipitation fields are of importance to improve spatial precipitation modelling however the investigations have not yet adequately been researched in respect to this deeper investigations of asymmetric spatial dependence of precipitation fields are therefore necessary and used as the central topic of this paper the purpose of this study is designed to investigate the asymmetric spatial dependence of precipitation fields between high and low values with a given quantile threshold q 0 on the basis of empirical bivariate copulas in addition a deeper investigation into the effect of different distances and temporal scales on the asymmetric dependence within different climate regions is considered to be interesting and is discussed further in this study to support the findings with physical processes regional climate models rcms datasets are also investigated to see to what extent non symmetrical dependence behavior is related to the underlying physical processes the paper is divided into five sections after the introduction section the investigation locations and data available are explained in section 2 then section 3 presents the basic methodology of the investigations the empirical findings of the investigation in singapore and southern germany are discussed in section 4 finally a summary of the findings is given in section 5 2 data and study locations this study uses high quality precipitation datasets in terms of record length spatial coverage and temporal resolutions in place of which located in different climate regions namely singapore in southeast asia and bavaria in the southern part of germany the investigation locations are shown in fig 1 2 1 singapore gauge station network the precipitation datasets analysed in this study consist of 30 precipitation gauge stations covering a small scale of inter gauge distances from 1 9 to 38 7 km as presented in fig 1 the temporal precipitation resolution available in the region is hourly which is simultaneously recorded from 30 gauge stations during the period of 1980 2010 the precipitation datasets are provided by the national environment agency of singapore nea to investigate the impact of different temporal scales of precipitation fields on the statistical characteristics of interest the hourly precipitation amounts are aggregated at higher scales including 3 hourly 6 hourly 12 hourly daily 5 daily 10 daily and 15 daily the precipitation gauge stations are also classified into different bins ranging from 5 to 40 km with an increment of 5 km to investigate the influence of different groups of distances on the statistics of interest all of the possible combination pairs of the precipitation gauge stations at various locations spaced at a constant distance of 5 km are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the number of possible pairs for the given group distances is more than 30 for the inter gauge distances less than 25 km whereas the numbers of possible pairs with the inter gauge distances 30 km 35 km and 40 km are less than 30 namely 13 10 and 4 respectively thus precipitation analyses in singapore using the geostatistical approach are then carried out for inter gauge distances less than 25 km precipitation statistics singapore is an island with a flat and relatively homogeneous topography with an area of 718 km2 as depicted in fig 1 the country is situated in the northern side of the equator extending from 1 168 to 1 488 n and from 103 68 to 104 098 e singapore is located in southeast asia and is on an island offshore at the southern end of the malayan peninsula separated between indonesia and malaysia due to its location near to the equator and its typically tropical climate precipitation rate in singapore is very high with an annual average of precipitation accumulation around 2430 mm and an annual average of about 51 of wet days mandapaka and qin 2013 in singapore most of the precipitation events are characterized as tropical convective precipitation which lasts in a short duration of less than 1 h with high intensity chatterjea 1998 occurring in the afternoon and low intensity in the late evening beck et al 2015 the average of hourly precipitation from all stations in the djf season reveals the highest value of around 0 306 mm and followed by son 0 299 mm mam 0 297 mm and jja 0 245 mm global climate regime the precipitation mechanism in singapore is triggered not only by the tropical climate regime due to its location close to the equator resulting in local convective precipitation but also strongly influenced by the global climate regime namely the asian monsoon system the asian monsoon system is basically driven by the sun movement that brings the predominant atmospheric flow direction which follows an annual cycle the asian monsoon system in singapore is classified into two different monsoon seasons namely the northeast monsoon season from december to early march and the southwest monsoon season from june to september which are separated by two inter monsoonal periods from the late march until may and from october to november beck et al 2015 fong and ng 2012 2 2 bavaria germany gauge station network the precipitation observation datasets in the bavaria region that are considered within the investigation consist of 573 precipitation gauge stations the gauge stations cover a wide range of inter gauge distances from 1 19 to 391 23 km the temporal precipitation resolution conducted in this study is at the daily scale recorded in the time period of 1951 2001 the number of missing precipitation events on the given time step which are not used in the investigation is less than 3 of the time series length 1 january 1951 31 december 2001 because the events do not provide adequate simultaneous spatial observations at the same time nevertheless this is not essential because this study focuses more on the spatial analysis for each time step independently for further analysis the daily precipitation datasets in the region are aggregated into higher time scales at 5 daily 10 daily and 15 daily similarly the mutual distances taken between stations are from 5 to 100 km with an increment of 5 km all of the possible combination pairs of precipitation gauge stations at different locations spaced at a constant distance of 5 km are presented in fig 1 the number of possible pairs of gauge stations at the region of bavaria is generally more than 30 gauge pairs for all different distance groups the number of possible pairs in bavaria comprises 51 524 834 and 1054 pairs for the inter gauge distances of 5 10 15 and 20 km respectively and dramatically increases into 3645 pairs for the inter gauge distance of 100 km this indicates that the precipitation gauge network in this region has a sufficient number of gauge pairs at a variety of inter gauge distances precipitation statistics the german state of bavaria lies in the northern part of the equator extending from 9 12 to 13 78 e and from 47 33 to 50 45 n located in the southeastern side of germany with an area of 70 547 km2 bavaria has a very structured topography ranging from flat terrain in the northern region to the high mountains in the southern region namely the alps and the swabian jura the southern region of bavaria has a southwesterly northeasterly orientation and elevations up to 1 000 m above the mean sea water level mswl which is characterized by steep orography at the boundaries and a high plateau warrach sagi et al 2013 bárdossy and pegram 2013 the precipitation gauge stations at the region of bavaria are elevated from 110 to 1832 m from the mswl with a mean elevation of 481 26 m like other regions in germany bavaria has a typical mid latitude moderate climate characterized by a westerly flow with the rainfall associated with the frontal systems in winter and more convective precipitation in summer wulfmeyer et al 2011 warrach sagi et al 2013 frei and schär 1998 this is the reason why the average daily precipitation from all stations in the jja season reveals the highest value of around 3 44 mm and followed by mam 2 29 mm son 2 219 mm and djf 2 216 mm 3 measure of spatial dependence 3 1 bivariate copulas the copula was originally introduced by sklar 1959 as a useful method to derive joint distributions given the marginals especially when dealing with non normal distributions the method is also likely to be beneficial when the marginals can be definitely stipulated but the joint distribution is very tricky to construct cameron et al 2004 the name copula basically comes from the word couple to emphasize a manner between a joint distribution function and the marginals which a copula combines nelsen 2006 the copula is a function that links a multidimensional distribution to its marginals the bivariate copula is defined as a joint bivariate distribution with the univariate marginals in the uniform distribution u 0 1 and it is expressed mathematically as follows 1 c 0 1 2 0 1 a bivariate distribution function with given marginal distributions in the original domain h x 1 x 2 can be modeled by a bivariate copula function c given marginal distributions in the uniform domain u 0 1 with the help of sklar s theorem sklar 1959 nelsen 2006 the marginal distributions in the uniform distribution u 0 1 can be carried out by a transformation using its cumulative distribution function f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 or the rank transformation of the original data values hence analysis of marginal distributions can be done separately from the joint distribution without requiring simultaneous analysis this means that the parameters estimation of marginal distributions and joint distribution in the one stage maximum likelihood estimation is unnecessary the relationship between the joint bivariate distribution function h and the copula function c can be formulated as follows 2 h x 1 x 2 c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 one can see that a copula function c describes the dependence structure of bivariate distribution function h independently from the marginal distributions in the unit hypercube this flexibility of selecting the family of marginal distributions is another benefit of implementing copula in multivariate problems while the traditional multivariate models require all univariate marginal distributions to come from the same family of marginal distributions if the marginal distribution functions f 1 and f 2 are all continuous it means that the bivariate distribution function h is also continuous then the copula c is said to be unique nelsen 2006 the bivariate copula function c can conversely be constructed from a joint bivariate distribution function h nelsen 2006 as follows 3 c u 1 u 2 h f 1 1 u 1 f 1 1 u 2 where f 1 1 f n 1 are the inverses of marginal distributions the copula density c can be expressed in the density of bivariate distribution and the product of densities of the univariate marginals in this manner 4 c u 1 u 2 h f 1 1 u 1 f 2 1 u 2 i 1 2 f i f i 1 u i where h is a density function of multivariate distribution function h and f i are the density functions of univariate marginals for empirical bivariate copula its densities can be constructed from 2 dimensional histogram of a scatter plot of the marginals u 1 and u 2 the densities can also be estimated via a 2 dimensional kernel density estimation if the data amount is small guthke 2013 3 2 asymmetry function pearson s correlation has broadly been used in a variety of applications to quantify the strength and direction decreasing or increasing of a linear relationship between two variables in fact the pearson s correlation was the first formal correlation measure of linear dependency between a pair of random variables lee rodgers and nicewander 1988 and is still the most widely used measure of dependence in various applications however the pearson s correlation coefficient is much more influenced by outliers than by observations near the mean habib and krajewski 2001 consequently the existence of extreme events will lead to an inflated estimate of the correlation which may obscure the true relationship over most of the range of observations habib and krajewski 2001 in addition this measure of linear dependence assumes that the data follow a normal distribution serinaldi 2008 if the assumption is difficult to be fulfilled then the measure of dependence will lead to a high level of bias in estimation therefore even though pearson s correlation is a very useful statistical quantity it is limited by the assumptions underlying the estimation and should only be applied when those assumptions are held a non parametric rank measure of dependence such as spearman s and kendall s tau is free from distributional assumptions and is suggested as a possible alternative to pearson s linear correlation coefficient spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904 is a non parametric measure of rank correlation that is used to evaluate the degree of monotonic association between two independent variables when the two variables have a positive monotonic dependence spearman s rank correlation between the two variables will be high and vice versa both the pearson s and spearman s rank correlations are capable of quantifying a linear monotonic association measure between two random variables with their assumptions and limitations indeed spearman s rank correlation is suggested as a good alternative to substitute for the pearson s rank correlation but in fact it also formally depends upon only one correlation coefficient describing the entire dependence structure of the two random variables in some cases a quantification of the degree of association that depends not on the whole distribution of multiple variables but on the extreme values is more interesting the dependence structure between the extreme high values of two random variables may be different from that of the extreme low values in other words the dependence between the extreme high values might be stronger than that between the mid or even low values or vice versa in any practical application of hydrology precipitation extremes that simultaneously occur at multiple locations can lead to a serious impact on risk assessment and mitigation strategies in respect to this estimation of the dependence structure in the occurrence of extreme events in both upper and lower tails extremes is therefore required a precipitation model that is not capable of capturing the joint extreme events will either underestimate or overestimate the design values the upper tail dependence utd coefficient λ u and lower tail dependence ltd λ l joe 1997 have been widely used to measure the mutual occurrence of extreme events in a variety of applications however the main interest in the spatial statistics is usually not at the very extremes but in the location of values that exceed certain thresholds bárdossy 2006 moreover empirical investigations present that the utd shows bad performances with a strong bias estimation serinaldi et al 2014 instead of focusing on the tail dependencies bárdossy 2006 expressed the non symmetrical dependence by the ratio of the joint probability of not exceeding the quantile u and exceeding the quantile 1 u this ratio in turn expresses whether higher values have a stronger dependence than the low values a 1 u 1 a 1 u 1 a 1 u 1 a 1 u 1 or the opposite a 1 u 1 or if the dependence is the same as formulated below 5 a 1 u 2 u 1 c 1 u 1 u c u u based on the combination of two third order moments bárdossy and li 2008 li 2010 described a different non symmetrical measure that characterizes the difference in the dependence between high or low percentiles as given in the following formula 6 a 2 u 1 u 2 e u 1 0 5 u 2 0 5 2 u 1 0 5 2 u 2 0 5 0 1 0 1 u 1 0 5 u 2 0 5 2 u 1 0 5 2 u 2 0 5 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 a 2 is positive for a stronger dependence of high values and will be negative for a stronger dependence of low values a 2 will be zero if above and below 0 5 exhibit symmetric dependence li 2010 and guthke 2013 guthke and bárdossy 2017 both eq 5 and 6 above are not applicable if the datasets consist of zero inflated data which frequently happens in precipitation fields especially for shorter time scales daily and sub daily in order to handle this problem a new simple method by considering zero precipitation amounts in modified eq 7 is adopted this method is a comparison of the mass of empirical copula density between the upper right and lower left parts as shown in fig 2 to distinguish those parts a threshold q 0 with different quantiles 0 q 0 0 5 can then be adopted the threshold q 0 must be bigger than the probability of dry events because the density of zero values can be identified but the exact values are unknown due to the latent variables the formula is illustrated below 7 a 3 u 1 u 2 1 q 0 1 1 q 0 1 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 0 q 0 0 q 0 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 1 q 0 1 1 q 0 1 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 0 q 0 0 q 0 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 where q 0 is the threshold to distinguish mass of empirical copula density between the upper right and lower left parts of bivariate copulas if the asymmetry function a3 is positive then the empirical bivariate copula presents the positive asymmetric dependence if a3 is negative then it shows the negative asymmetric dependence if a3 is zero then it exhibits the symmetric dependence 3 3 application to synthetic data in order to demonstrate the asymmetry function a 3 to measure the non symmetrical dependence structure 500 monte carlo based stochastic simulations using three different families of copulas are conducted namely gumbel gaussian and clayton copulas the gaussian copula exhibits a symmetrical dependence structure the gumbel copula has more densities concentrated in the upper tails and the clayton copula is recognized as a copula model with a heavy concentration of probability near 0 0 nelsen 2006 the bivariate gumbel copula density can be written as follows 8 c u 1 u 2 exp ln u 1 θ ln u 2 θ 1 θ and the bivariate clayton copula density can formulated as follows 9 c u 1 u 2 u 1 θ u 2 θ 1 1 θ where 0 θ is the parameter controlling the dependence perfect dependence is obtained if θ while θ 0 implies independence each simulation is carried out using a different numbers of samples n namely n 30 50 100 500 1000 and 5000 pairs fig 3 shows an example of scatter plots of 500 random variables simulated from three families of copulas in the uniform unit 0 1 that is the gumbel copula with the parameter θ 3 on the left panel the gaussian copula with the parameter ρ 0 8 on the middle panel and the clayton copula with the parameter θ 2 on the right panel in every simulation the asymmetric function a 3 is calculated using the formula 7 for different quantiles q 0 as the threshold namely q 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 the basic idea is to calculate the difference of frequencies densities between the upper and lower tails as marked with the red lines in fig 3 fig 4 depicts the asymmetric function a 3 for a variety of simulated sample of sizes n using the three families of copulas above and different quantile thresholds namely q 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 the horizontal axes define the quantile thresholds and the primary vertical axes represent the asymmetric function a 3 in addition the secondary vertical axes are the family of copulas in every quantile threshold q 0 there are box plots of the asymmetric function a 3 from 500 stochastic simulations created using the monte carlo approach which is available in r r core team 2013 by the copula package hofert et al 2017 one can see that the gumbel copulas clearly exhibit a positive asymmetric dependence on the whole particularly for the quantile thresholds q 0 of 0 1 and 0 2 meanwhile the gaussian copulas present a consistently symmetrical dependence for all the quantile thresholds also the clayton copulas generally present a negative asymmetric dependence especially for the quantile thresholds q 0 of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 overall each family of copula exhibits its pattern more consistently in accordance with the increasing size of the samples 4 application to precipitation data 4 1 procedure of investigation spatially distributed data values at different locations are frequently not completely random but usually exhibit a form of a spatial correlation structure where closely separated points in space tend to be highly correlated a phenomenon that spreads in space and exhibits a certain spatial correlation structure is called regionalized matheron 1971 in the context of geostatistics the regionalized variables are assumed to be a single realization of a random variable which is characterized by its distribution function the distribution function that completely describes a spatially distributed variable can thus be defined by assigning an n dimensional probability distribution f n to the set of points in the domain of interest since the spatial data is assumed to be only one realization counting the frequencies to infer the distribution function to find a multivariate probability distribution f that fits to the data is not possible without an additional assumption on the spatial process that is the spatial strong stationarity guthke 2013 under the spatial stationarity assumption the hypothesis is that the random function dependent on the location is relaxed towards a dependence of the spatial configuration of the regionalized variables the random function remains the same if a certain configuration of points is only shifted by a length of the separating distance h in addition under the geometric isotropy assumption the distance h does not depend on any direction despite the fact that whether the two gauges at separating distance h are located in the north south the west east or any other directions the distribution function can now be inferred by counting the frequencies of values in the same configuration resulting in the empirical bivariate distribution function guthke 2013 the empirical bivariate copulas for the spatial precipitation observations z at any given location s of n gauge stations z s 1 z s n can be constructed using the procedure suggested by bárdossy 2006 the procedure is conducted for each selected time interval of precipitation events due to the assumption of a single realization of a spatial random variable the precipitation occurrences analysed in this study are all selected precipitation events on a given time step with more than 0 7 value of all gauge stations located in the regions of interest which are wet with the precipitation depth higher than 0 1 mm in singapore for example the precipitation occurrence on a given time event during a time period of 1980 2010 is to be considered in this analysis if at least 21 out of 30 precipitation gauge stations are receiving precipitation with more than 0 1 mm in bavaria the precipitation occurrence on a given time event during a time period of 1951 2001 is considered in this analysis if at least 401 out of 573 precipitation gauge stations are classified to be wet with the precipitation depth value to be higher than 0 1 mm the detail of investigation procedure and statistical testing are described as follows 1 for any selected time scale and season empirical bivariate copulas using the geostatistical approach along with the given separating distances are created the estimation of the empirical bivariate copulas from observations z s 1 z s n can be done with the following procedure bárdossy 2006 a the precipitation data from all the spatial observation points at any given time step are transformed into a uniform distribution u 0 1 using the empirical marginal distribution function f z z s i or the normalized ranks from the observation points below 10 u n r z s i 1 2 n where z s i is univariate random variable z at location s i n is the number of data r z i is the rank of z s i in the set z s 1 z s n z s 1 is the maximum value and z s n is the minimum value b for any given separating distance h all gauge stations are grouped with the similar lags h and the set of pairs s h of gauge stations can then be created the set of pairs s h consists of the empirical distribution function values of the precipitation variables of any pair at locations separated by the distance h the set of pairs s h are then formulated as follows 11 s h c f z z s f z z s h again s h is a set of points in the unit square it is to be noted that s h is by definition symmetrical regarding the major axis u 1 u 2 of the unit square namely if u 1 u 2 s h then u 2 u 1 s h c from the set of pairs s h the spatial copula function c s is implemented as a function of the distance h extended from eq 2 for any two selected quantiles u 1 and u 2 eq 2 becomes as follows 12 c s u 1 u 2 h prob f z z s u 1 f z z s h u 2 c u 1 f z z s u 2 f z z s h here f z is the marginal distribution of the variable z and is supposed to be the same for each location s any two locations separated by the distance h are related to each other by the bivariate distribution function whose dependence is described by the bivariate copula d the unit square is divided into k x k grids the empirical copula density can then be constructed by calculating the empirical frequencies on each grid two dimensional histograms of the marginals u 1 and u 2 are the result 2 for any selected time scale season and quantile threshold q 0 the empirical asymmetric dependence is calculated using eq 7 on the basis of the empirical bivariate copulas 3 for any selected time scale season and quantile threshold q 0 precipitation amounts are transformed to the gaussian domain using the normal score transformation 4 based on the statistical parameters obtained from step 3 the multivariate normal distributions with t times n are generated where n is the number of gauge stations in the region of interest and t is the length of precipitation time series 5 for each realization of the t gaussian realizations the asymmetric spatial dependence using eq 7 is calculated and determined whether it is positive negative or zero asymmetric dependence 6 for all of the t gaussian realizations obtained from step 4 the number of precipitation events that presents the positive negative and zero non symmetrical dependence from step 5 is counted 7 steps 1 6 are repeated for 100 simulations and thus the quantile 5 and 95 for lower and upper limit of the confidence interval can be calculated for all of the parameters of interest for all of the realizations of precipitation events time series of spatial precipitations the number of positive negative and zero asymmetrical spatial dependencies is recapitulated the gaussian simulations here are applied to measure the degree of the uncertainty with a certain significant level namely 90 of the confidence interval the range of non symmetrical dependence from gaussian simulation here is called a confidence interval 8 steps 1 7 are repeatedly conducted using different quantile thresholds for example q 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 and the different seasons the months of djf mam jja son and also the different time scales sub daily 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and super daily 1d 5d and 15d 4 2 implementation in singapore empirical asymmetry function investigations of non symmetrical spatial dependence based on the bivariate copulas expose new findings in the singapore region the region of singapore has been characterized as a homogeneous area in terms of topography due to the flat land surface even though it is also described as high variables in terms of spatial and temporal precipitation events due to the tropical climate region fig 5 shows the frequencies of precipitation occurrences that exhibit the positive asymmetric dependence and negative asymmetric dependence for the quantile threshold 0 2 at different temporal scales ranging from hourly to 15 daily and different distance scales as well as different seasons effect of spatial scales overall the number of precipitation events that follow the positive asymmetric dependence decreases with the increase in distances but the number of precipitation occurrences that follow the negative asymmetric dependence increases with the increase in distances in this case the precipitation events dominantly exhibit the positive asymmetric dependence at close distances of below 10 km while the precipitation events that present the negative asymmetric dependence become more dominant at far distances above 20 km then the precipitation occurrences that show symmetric spatial dependence lead significantly at distances between 10 and 20 km this means that there is a transition phase from the positive asymmetric spatial dependence to the negative asymmetric spatial dependence through the gaussian symmetric spatial dependence at specific distances in other words the spatial scales play a crucial role to characterize the behavior of asymmetric spatial dependence the positive asymmetric dependence is extensively exhibited at the neighborhood distances because the precipitation events usually occur in a clustered manner as a result high values of precipitation at adjacent locations are more spatially correlated than low values effect of time scales the effect of spatial scales on the characteristics of asymmetric spatial dependence either positive or negative asymmetric dependence is restricted to a certain time scale this means that the temporal aggregation of precipitation amounts might generate an important influence on the characteristics of asymmetric dependence in general the number of precipitation events that exhibit either positive or negative asymmetric dependence is significantly dominant at the higher time resolutions the number of precipitation occurrences that follow either positive or negative asymmetric dependence then decreases with the increase of the temporal scales the positive asymmetric spatial dependence which frequently occurs at nearby distances below 10 km and the negative asymmetric dependence which often arises at far distances above 20 km are more pronounced at the sub daily scales from hourly to daily the asymmetric dependence disappears at the higher temporal scales for example from pentad to 15 daily which would be closer to the climatology analysis rather than the event analysis in other words the symmetric gaussian spatial dependence tends to significantly exist at the higher time scales especially from 5 daily scale and above either located at close or far distances effect of seasons the characteristics of the asymmetric spatial dependence above generally exhibit similar patterns for all different seasons however there is still a small difference in the behavior of the asymmetry function especially in the djf season in the djf season the positive asymmetric spatial dependence substantially occurs at distances below 10 km from hourly to only 12 hourly then it turns into the symmetric gaussian spatial dependence from daily or 5 daily to monthly although the positive asymmetric spatial dependence still presents a slightly higher symmetrical dependence at the daily scale it is only a very few numbers and almost negligible in contrast to the djf season for other seasons for example mam jja and son the positive asymmetric spatial dependence is significantly dominant at distances below 10 km from hourly to daily and becomes the symmetric gaussian dependence from 5 daily to monthly scale nevertheless there is strong empirical evidence that precipitation occurrences generally exhibit the positive asymmetric spatial dependence at close distances and high temporal resolutions for all different seasons no matter in which season of the year implication of asymmetric dependence on areal precipitation intensities to study the implication of the positive asymmetric spatial dependence on the areal of precipitation intensities a new analysis is conducted the precipitation datasets are divided into three datasets corresponding to the characteristics of asymmetric spatial dependences namely all the datasets positive and negative asymmetry the first dataset is from all of the precipitation events the precipitation amounts for each station are then averaged over all of the time series resulting in a mean value of precipitation at each gauge this is also conducted to all of the gauges resulting in the mean precipitation amounts of all of the stations the interpolated precipitation amounts over the whole region of interest are created from the points resulting in a single realization of spatial precipitation amounts over a regular grid the second dataset is from all of the precipitation occurrences that follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence at close distances below 10 km the precipitation intensities at the observation points are also averaged over the selected precipitation occurrences above resulting in a single spatial realization of mean precipitation points the spatial interpolations using kriging are carried out to estimate the precipitation intensities at unsampled locations over the whole region of interest from the points resulting in a single realization of spatial precipitation fields over a regular grid next the third dataset comes from the extractions of all the precipitation events that exhibit the negative asymmetric spatial dependence at distances below 10 km then the mean value of precipitation for each station is calculated based on the available precipitation occurrences that follow the negative asymmetric spatial dependence this is carried out to all of the gauges resulting in the mean precipitation amounts over all stations the precipitation intensities at unsampled locations over the whole spatial domain of interest are estimated based on those points resulting in a single spatial realization of precipitation fields over a regular grid fig 6 shows the spatial precipitation intensities using the different three datasets above namely all of the datasets positive asymmetry and negative asymmetry at different temporal scales from hourly to daily in different seasons djf jja mam and son it can be seen that heavy precipitation triggers more positive spatial asymmetric dependence at close distances on the contrary the negative spatial asymmetric spatial dependence is commonly caused by the lighter precipitation intensities moreover within the context of urban water management some empirical investigation evidence reveals that instead of using the spatial gaussian model or symmetrical spatial dependence based model the spatial precipitation models based on the positive asymmetric spatial dependence is recommended to be adopted for a better flood risk management 4 3 implementation in bavaria germany analysis of asymmetric spatial dependencies is also carried out in the large scale regions of southern germany namely the state of bavaria the region of bavaria has almost a hundred fold greater area than singapore fig 7 presents the asymmetric spatial dependence of the above region with a variety of different time scales from daily to 15 daily scale 1d 5d and 15d and various spatial distances from 5 to 60 km with the increment of 5 km for the seasons of djf mam jja and son the empirical investigation results of the precipitation events in bavaria reveal that the positive asymmetric spatial dependence also frequently occurs at the nearby gauge stations while the negative asymmetric dependence significantly appears at far distances the number of precipitation occurrences that follow positive asymmetric dependence decreases with the increase of distances while the number of precipitation occurrences with negative asymmetric dependence increase with the increases of distances unlike in the region of singapore this pattern applies to all time scales ranging from daily to monthly in all of the different seasons this is an indication that increasing temporal scales from daily to monthly does not change the behavior of asymmetric spatial dependence instead the precipitation occurrences that follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence at close distances are still pronounced no matter which time scale is used it is found that precipitation events that exhibit the positive asymmetric spatial dependence at nearby gauges are influenced by seasons for example the domination of the positive asymmetric spatial dependence is discovered until the distance of 30 km during the djf season while it is only until the distance of 15 km during the jja season meanwhile during the mam and son seasons the precipitation occurrences that follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence occur at the same distances which are below 25 km implication of asymmetric dependence on areal precipitation intensities fig 8 shows the spatial precipitation intensities in different seasons djf jja mam and son and different datasets namely all datasets positive and negative asymmetry similar to singapore the first dataset consists of all of the precipitation events and then averaged over all time series for each gauge station separately in order to get the single realization of spatial precipitation fields meanwhile the second dataset deals with all of the precipitation events that follow the positive asymmetric dependence at close distances 30 km and also averaged over all of the time series at each gauge station separately in order to obtain the single realization of spatial precipitation fields next the third dataset is intended for the extraction of precipitation events with the negative asymmetric spatial dependence in neighboring distances 30 km and a mean value is calculated over time series at each gauge station to obtain the single realization of precipitation fields in summary it is clearly seen that the local heavy precipitations in the south of bavaria tend to trigger positive asymmetry precipitation events at close distances 4 4 implementation of crms precipitation data a spatial precipitation model designed for deriving climate change scenarios at a finer spatial resolution has played a crucial role in many hydrological applications global circulation models gcms provide scenarios for the possible future developments of climate but in a very coarse spatial resolution therefore they cannot directly be used for the assessment of regional consequences of climate change next regional climate models rcms are considered to be promising tools to provide projected precipitation data with high spatial and temporal resolutions rcms are generally obtained by dynamically downscaling the output of the gcms which provide climate variables including precipitations at a finer spatial resolution unfortunately rcm models inherit some biases of the gcms the large number of uncertainties in the current global and regional climate models is related to the representation of clouds moist convection and complex topography one way to solve this is by applying the convection resolving modeling crm by reducing the grid spacing of the climate models down to some few kilometers and switching off the convection parameterization in addition crm has some advantages such as very finer spatial resolutions to some kilometers and better representations of topography surface fields and boundary layer processes thus crm has become a promising climate model to generate more realistic precipitation patterns especially in the cases of moist convection and or over mountainous regions ban et al 2014 however evaluation of performances on this model is necessary to be conducted using different perspectives most studies investigating rcms biases are conducted on the basis of marginal distribution of precipitation at individual sites for example mean variance extreme events and cross correlation between stations moreover it is also interesting to investigate the biases of rcms on the basis of asymmetric spatial dependence structures using empirical bivariate copulas in particular the rcms data type implemented in this study is convection resolving modeling crms precipitation data the data used in this study are classified into three groups namely historical observations 1951 2001 rcm simulations 1998 2007 and rcm projections 2081 2090 the data rcms used is a type of crm data with 2 2 km spatial resolution from a convection resolving simulation integrated with the cosmo clm model consortium for small scale modeling in climate mode similarly the empirical evidence proves that the positive asymmetric spatial dependence is significantly detected at close distances for the three types of datasets observations rcm simulations and rcm projections under different time scales and in all seasons as shown in fig 9 it can clearly be seen that in djf season for example the observed precipitation events frequently exhibit positive asymmetrical spatial dependence within the inter gauge distances below 35 km in different time scales identically the rcm precipitation simulations evaluations and projections also present the characteristics of asymmetric spatial dependence within similar spatial range below 35 km across different temporal scales additionally in jja seasons for example the precipitation observations and rcm precipitation simulations of both of the evaluations and projections often present the positive asymmetric dependence at nearby distances in all various temporal scales within the spatial ranges below 20 km 5 conclusions the results of empirical investigation reveal that precipitation events that exhibit the positive asymmetric spatial dependence frequently occur at nearby stations and those that exhibit negative asymmetric dependence significant appear at far distances the precipitation occurrences with positive asymmetric dependence decrease with the increase in distances while the precipitation events that exhibit the negative asymmetric dependence increase with the increase in distances in singapore the number of precipitation events that exhibit asymmetric dependence is significantly dominant at higher time resolutions and decreases with the increase in temporal scales in bavaria this pattern also applies in all of the time scales ranging from daily to monthly the positive asymmetric spatial dependences of the three datasets observations rcm simulations and rcm projections in bavaria are also significantly detected at close distances under different time scales both observations and rcm simulations show an interesting systematic pattern in relation to the domination of the positive asymmetric dependence in short distances and small time steps the precipitations with high intensity are likely to exhibit a high spatial clustering behaviour however the rcm simulations have slightly a lower degree of domination and smaller coverage areas of positive asymmetrical dependence than the observations competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements financial support for completing this study is

7033,precipitation plays an important role in any hydrological analysis the aim of this study is to empirically investigate the behaviour of spatial dependence of precipitation fields this would determine whether the gaussian assumption is fulfilled in regard to symmetric spatial dependence structure between low and high precipitation values an asymmetry function that can incorporate zero precipitation amounts is introduced on the basis of empirical bivariate copulas the asymmetry function is calculated by integrating the empirical bivariate copula density in the upper right and the lower left parts for any given quantile thresholds zero precipitation amounts are handled as latent variables and the thresholds therefore are set to be bigger than probability of zero the gaussian simulations based testing is applied for determining the degree of uncertainty the empirical bivariate copulas are constructed using the concept of regionalized variables in spatial random process with a given separating distance for any selected time interval the precipitation over the region of interest is assumed to be a single realization of a spatially stationary random process the investigations are conducted in singapore and bavaria to take temporal characteristics and seasons into account precipitation occurrences with different time scales for different seasons are analysed the empirical evidence proves that the precipitation events tend to follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence structure particularly at a short separating distance this implies that precipitation amounts with higher intensities tends to be more spatially correlated than that with lower intensities because precipitation occurrences tend to occur in a clustered manner consequently spatial precipitation models that are based on the symmetric gaussian dependence could result in an underestimation of the spatial extent of actual precipitation extremes moreover this pattern is higher for smaller time scales hourly to daily keywords precipitation asymmetric dependence empirical copula 1 introduction reliable spatial information on precipitation is required for water resources planning and management since solid evidence has shown that precipitation exhibits high spatial variability unfortunately the spatial coverage of available precipitation data is frequently inadequate for accurately representing the spatial distribution of precipitation the low densities of precipitation gauge network cause the poor quality of spatial precipitation data hence a reliable spatial interpolation method is necessary to estimate ungauged areas a variety of spatial interpolation models have been developed for precipitation applications over the last half of the century the models have been implemented in a variety of different regions such as in the mediterranean area casas et al 2004 alpine countries serinaldi and kilsby 2014 bárdossy and pegram 2013 and in various area sizes ranging from small aghakouchak et al 2010 aghakouchak et al 2010 aghakouchak et al 2010 to large areas serinaldi and kilsby 2014 bárdossy and pegram 2013 the spatial precipitation models are commonly developed based on either a multi site approach serinaldi 2009 wilks 1998 srikanthan and pegram 2009 wilks 1999 wilks 1999 bárdossy and pegram 2009 villarini et al 2014 vrac et al 2007 bárdossy and pegram 2014 or grid cells bárdossy and pegram 2012 aghakouchak et al 2010 bárdossy and pegram 2013 gyasi agyei 2016 many of these methods are developed based on the gaussian assumption because they are derived from the concept of linear regression in particular one of the spatial models that has popularly been implemented in precipitation studies is the kriging model kriging type models can be classified into stochastic models which are able to deliver uncertainty of the interpolation quality directly with its variances because precipitation behavior exhibits a higher uncertainty of spatial distribution of precipitation however kriging models offer the quality of interpolation that is simply a function of the observation density and the variogram models bárdossy 2006 this function can only describe the spatial dependence as an integral over the whole distribution of the parameter values therefore anomalies in the observations and locations with high or low variabilities cannot be considered for estimating the kriging variances bárdossy and li 2008 these models cannot properly detect the different percentile values for example extremes which have a different spatial dependence structure from the mid values bárdossy 2006 this issue is relevant to precipitation fields that are characterized by a skewed distribution consequently variogram functions that are dominated by only a few anomalously differing pairs might occur with regard to the above issue copula based modeling is a promising tool to overcome the drawbacks the copula is also flexible to separately analyse the marginal distributions from the joint distributions and allows them to be same or different from the distribution family furthermore the copula is capable of expressing a good deal of dependence structures on a quantile scale which can detect both non linear and tail or asymmetric dependences nelsen 2006 spatial interpolation copula models have recently been implemented in precipitation studies bárdossy and pegram 2013 bárdossy and pegram 2014 wasko et al 2013 a precipitation event shows a skewed behavior in univariate cases and is more clearly detected at a higher time resolution such as hourly or daily indeed some common non gaussian based models such as exponential gamma gumbel weibull and pareto distributions can successfully be implemented to address the skewed distribution of precipitation in the univariate cases in contrast modelling of the skewed precipitation events at the multivariate cases is still challenging due to its complexity although few models have been built to overcome the skewed behavior of precipitation many of them are limited to be applied in the bivariate cases the spatial models underlying gaussian assumption are convenient for computation but could deviate from reality either under or overestimating if the assumption is difficult to fulfil one of the characteristics of the gaussian assumption is a structure of symmetric dependence between low and high values consequently empirical investigations into asymmetric spatial dependence on the characteristics of precipitation fields are of importance to improve spatial precipitation modelling however the investigations have not yet adequately been researched in respect to this deeper investigations of asymmetric spatial dependence of precipitation fields are therefore necessary and used as the central topic of this paper the purpose of this study is designed to investigate the asymmetric spatial dependence of precipitation fields between high and low values with a given quantile threshold q 0 on the basis of empirical bivariate copulas in addition a deeper investigation into the effect of different distances and temporal scales on the asymmetric dependence within different climate regions is considered to be interesting and is discussed further in this study to support the findings with physical processes regional climate models rcms datasets are also investigated to see to what extent non symmetrical dependence behavior is related to the underlying physical processes the paper is divided into five sections after the introduction section the investigation locations and data available are explained in section 2 then section 3 presents the basic methodology of the investigations the empirical findings of the investigation in singapore and southern germany are discussed in section 4 finally a summary of the findings is given in section 5 2 data and study locations this study uses high quality precipitation datasets in terms of record length spatial coverage and temporal resolutions in place of which located in different climate regions namely singapore in southeast asia and bavaria in the southern part of germany the investigation locations are shown in fig 1 2 1 singapore gauge station network the precipitation datasets analysed in this study consist of 30 precipitation gauge stations covering a small scale of inter gauge distances from 1 9 to 38 7 km as presented in fig 1 the temporal precipitation resolution available in the region is hourly which is simultaneously recorded from 30 gauge stations during the period of 1980 2010 the precipitation datasets are provided by the national environment agency of singapore nea to investigate the impact of different temporal scales of precipitation fields on the statistical characteristics of interest the hourly precipitation amounts are aggregated at higher scales including 3 hourly 6 hourly 12 hourly daily 5 daily 10 daily and 15 daily the precipitation gauge stations are also classified into different bins ranging from 5 to 40 km with an increment of 5 km to investigate the influence of different groups of distances on the statistics of interest all of the possible combination pairs of the precipitation gauge stations at various locations spaced at a constant distance of 5 km are shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the number of possible pairs for the given group distances is more than 30 for the inter gauge distances less than 25 km whereas the numbers of possible pairs with the inter gauge distances 30 km 35 km and 40 km are less than 30 namely 13 10 and 4 respectively thus precipitation analyses in singapore using the geostatistical approach are then carried out for inter gauge distances less than 25 km precipitation statistics singapore is an island with a flat and relatively homogeneous topography with an area of 718 km2 as depicted in fig 1 the country is situated in the northern side of the equator extending from 1 168 to 1 488 n and from 103 68 to 104 098 e singapore is located in southeast asia and is on an island offshore at the southern end of the malayan peninsula separated between indonesia and malaysia due to its location near to the equator and its typically tropical climate precipitation rate in singapore is very high with an annual average of precipitation accumulation around 2430 mm and an annual average of about 51 of wet days mandapaka and qin 2013 in singapore most of the precipitation events are characterized as tropical convective precipitation which lasts in a short duration of less than 1 h with high intensity chatterjea 1998 occurring in the afternoon and low intensity in the late evening beck et al 2015 the average of hourly precipitation from all stations in the djf season reveals the highest value of around 0 306 mm and followed by son 0 299 mm mam 0 297 mm and jja 0 245 mm global climate regime the precipitation mechanism in singapore is triggered not only by the tropical climate regime due to its location close to the equator resulting in local convective precipitation but also strongly influenced by the global climate regime namely the asian monsoon system the asian monsoon system is basically driven by the sun movement that brings the predominant atmospheric flow direction which follows an annual cycle the asian monsoon system in singapore is classified into two different monsoon seasons namely the northeast monsoon season from december to early march and the southwest monsoon season from june to september which are separated by two inter monsoonal periods from the late march until may and from october to november beck et al 2015 fong and ng 2012 2 2 bavaria germany gauge station network the precipitation observation datasets in the bavaria region that are considered within the investigation consist of 573 precipitation gauge stations the gauge stations cover a wide range of inter gauge distances from 1 19 to 391 23 km the temporal precipitation resolution conducted in this study is at the daily scale recorded in the time period of 1951 2001 the number of missing precipitation events on the given time step which are not used in the investigation is less than 3 of the time series length 1 january 1951 31 december 2001 because the events do not provide adequate simultaneous spatial observations at the same time nevertheless this is not essential because this study focuses more on the spatial analysis for each time step independently for further analysis the daily precipitation datasets in the region are aggregated into higher time scales at 5 daily 10 daily and 15 daily similarly the mutual distances taken between stations are from 5 to 100 km with an increment of 5 km all of the possible combination pairs of precipitation gauge stations at different locations spaced at a constant distance of 5 km are presented in fig 1 the number of possible pairs of gauge stations at the region of bavaria is generally more than 30 gauge pairs for all different distance groups the number of possible pairs in bavaria comprises 51 524 834 and 1054 pairs for the inter gauge distances of 5 10 15 and 20 km respectively and dramatically increases into 3645 pairs for the inter gauge distance of 100 km this indicates that the precipitation gauge network in this region has a sufficient number of gauge pairs at a variety of inter gauge distances precipitation statistics the german state of bavaria lies in the northern part of the equator extending from 9 12 to 13 78 e and from 47 33 to 50 45 n located in the southeastern side of germany with an area of 70 547 km2 bavaria has a very structured topography ranging from flat terrain in the northern region to the high mountains in the southern region namely the alps and the swabian jura the southern region of bavaria has a southwesterly northeasterly orientation and elevations up to 1 000 m above the mean sea water level mswl which is characterized by steep orography at the boundaries and a high plateau warrach sagi et al 2013 bárdossy and pegram 2013 the precipitation gauge stations at the region of bavaria are elevated from 110 to 1832 m from the mswl with a mean elevation of 481 26 m like other regions in germany bavaria has a typical mid latitude moderate climate characterized by a westerly flow with the rainfall associated with the frontal systems in winter and more convective precipitation in summer wulfmeyer et al 2011 warrach sagi et al 2013 frei and schär 1998 this is the reason why the average daily precipitation from all stations in the jja season reveals the highest value of around 3 44 mm and followed by mam 2 29 mm son 2 219 mm and djf 2 216 mm 3 measure of spatial dependence 3 1 bivariate copulas the copula was originally introduced by sklar 1959 as a useful method to derive joint distributions given the marginals especially when dealing with non normal distributions the method is also likely to be beneficial when the marginals can be definitely stipulated but the joint distribution is very tricky to construct cameron et al 2004 the name copula basically comes from the word couple to emphasize a manner between a joint distribution function and the marginals which a copula combines nelsen 2006 the copula is a function that links a multidimensional distribution to its marginals the bivariate copula is defined as a joint bivariate distribution with the univariate marginals in the uniform distribution u 0 1 and it is expressed mathematically as follows 1 c 0 1 2 0 1 a bivariate distribution function with given marginal distributions in the original domain h x 1 x 2 can be modeled by a bivariate copula function c given marginal distributions in the uniform domain u 0 1 with the help of sklar s theorem sklar 1959 nelsen 2006 the marginal distributions in the uniform distribution u 0 1 can be carried out by a transformation using its cumulative distribution function f 1 x 1 and f 2 x 2 or the rank transformation of the original data values hence analysis of marginal distributions can be done separately from the joint distribution without requiring simultaneous analysis this means that the parameters estimation of marginal distributions and joint distribution in the one stage maximum likelihood estimation is unnecessary the relationship between the joint bivariate distribution function h and the copula function c can be formulated as follows 2 h x 1 x 2 c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 one can see that a copula function c describes the dependence structure of bivariate distribution function h independently from the marginal distributions in the unit hypercube this flexibility of selecting the family of marginal distributions is another benefit of implementing copula in multivariate problems while the traditional multivariate models require all univariate marginal distributions to come from the same family of marginal distributions if the marginal distribution functions f 1 and f 2 are all continuous it means that the bivariate distribution function h is also continuous then the copula c is said to be unique nelsen 2006 the bivariate copula function c can conversely be constructed from a joint bivariate distribution function h nelsen 2006 as follows 3 c u 1 u 2 h f 1 1 u 1 f 1 1 u 2 where f 1 1 f n 1 are the inverses of marginal distributions the copula density c can be expressed in the density of bivariate distribution and the product of densities of the univariate marginals in this manner 4 c u 1 u 2 h f 1 1 u 1 f 2 1 u 2 i 1 2 f i f i 1 u i where h is a density function of multivariate distribution function h and f i are the density functions of univariate marginals for empirical bivariate copula its densities can be constructed from 2 dimensional histogram of a scatter plot of the marginals u 1 and u 2 the densities can also be estimated via a 2 dimensional kernel density estimation if the data amount is small guthke 2013 3 2 asymmetry function pearson s correlation has broadly been used in a variety of applications to quantify the strength and direction decreasing or increasing of a linear relationship between two variables in fact the pearson s correlation was the first formal correlation measure of linear dependency between a pair of random variables lee rodgers and nicewander 1988 and is still the most widely used measure of dependence in various applications however the pearson s correlation coefficient is much more influenced by outliers than by observations near the mean habib and krajewski 2001 consequently the existence of extreme events will lead to an inflated estimate of the correlation which may obscure the true relationship over most of the range of observations habib and krajewski 2001 in addition this measure of linear dependence assumes that the data follow a normal distribution serinaldi 2008 if the assumption is difficult to be fulfilled then the measure of dependence will lead to a high level of bias in estimation therefore even though pearson s correlation is a very useful statistical quantity it is limited by the assumptions underlying the estimation and should only be applied when those assumptions are held a non parametric rank measure of dependence such as spearman s and kendall s tau is free from distributional assumptions and is suggested as a possible alternative to pearson s linear correlation coefficient spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904 is a non parametric measure of rank correlation that is used to evaluate the degree of monotonic association between two independent variables when the two variables have a positive monotonic dependence spearman s rank correlation between the two variables will be high and vice versa both the pearson s and spearman s rank correlations are capable of quantifying a linear monotonic association measure between two random variables with their assumptions and limitations indeed spearman s rank correlation is suggested as a good alternative to substitute for the pearson s rank correlation but in fact it also formally depends upon only one correlation coefficient describing the entire dependence structure of the two random variables in some cases a quantification of the degree of association that depends not on the whole distribution of multiple variables but on the extreme values is more interesting the dependence structure between the extreme high values of two random variables may be different from that of the extreme low values in other words the dependence between the extreme high values might be stronger than that between the mid or even low values or vice versa in any practical application of hydrology precipitation extremes that simultaneously occur at multiple locations can lead to a serious impact on risk assessment and mitigation strategies in respect to this estimation of the dependence structure in the occurrence of extreme events in both upper and lower tails extremes is therefore required a precipitation model that is not capable of capturing the joint extreme events will either underestimate or overestimate the design values the upper tail dependence utd coefficient λ u and lower tail dependence ltd λ l joe 1997 have been widely used to measure the mutual occurrence of extreme events in a variety of applications however the main interest in the spatial statistics is usually not at the very extremes but in the location of values that exceed certain thresholds bárdossy 2006 moreover empirical investigations present that the utd shows bad performances with a strong bias estimation serinaldi et al 2014 instead of focusing on the tail dependencies bárdossy 2006 expressed the non symmetrical dependence by the ratio of the joint probability of not exceeding the quantile u and exceeding the quantile 1 u this ratio in turn expresses whether higher values have a stronger dependence than the low values a 1 u 1 a 1 u 1 a 1 u 1 a 1 u 1 or the opposite a 1 u 1 or if the dependence is the same as formulated below 5 a 1 u 2 u 1 c 1 u 1 u c u u based on the combination of two third order moments bárdossy and li 2008 li 2010 described a different non symmetrical measure that characterizes the difference in the dependence between high or low percentiles as given in the following formula 6 a 2 u 1 u 2 e u 1 0 5 u 2 0 5 2 u 1 0 5 2 u 2 0 5 0 1 0 1 u 1 0 5 u 2 0 5 2 u 1 0 5 2 u 2 0 5 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 a 2 is positive for a stronger dependence of high values and will be negative for a stronger dependence of low values a 2 will be zero if above and below 0 5 exhibit symmetric dependence li 2010 and guthke 2013 guthke and bárdossy 2017 both eq 5 and 6 above are not applicable if the datasets consist of zero inflated data which frequently happens in precipitation fields especially for shorter time scales daily and sub daily in order to handle this problem a new simple method by considering zero precipitation amounts in modified eq 7 is adopted this method is a comparison of the mass of empirical copula density between the upper right and lower left parts as shown in fig 2 to distinguish those parts a threshold q 0 with different quantiles 0 q 0 0 5 can then be adopted the threshold q 0 must be bigger than the probability of dry events because the density of zero values can be identified but the exact values are unknown due to the latent variables the formula is illustrated below 7 a 3 u 1 u 2 1 q 0 1 1 q 0 1 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 0 q 0 0 q 0 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 1 q 0 1 1 q 0 1 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 0 q 0 0 q 0 c u 1 u 2 du 1 du 2 where q 0 is the threshold to distinguish mass of empirical copula density between the upper right and lower left parts of bivariate copulas if the asymmetry function a3 is positive then the empirical bivariate copula presents the positive asymmetric dependence if a3 is negative then it shows the negative asymmetric dependence if a3 is zero then it exhibits the symmetric dependence 3 3 application to synthetic data in order to demonstrate the asymmetry function a 3 to measure the non symmetrical dependence structure 500 monte carlo based stochastic simulations using three different families of copulas are conducted namely gumbel gaussian and clayton copulas the gaussian copula exhibits a symmetrical dependence structure the gumbel copula has more densities concentrated in the upper tails and the clayton copula is recognized as a copula model with a heavy concentration of probability near 0 0 nelsen 2006 the bivariate gumbel copula density can be written as follows 8 c u 1 u 2 exp ln u 1 θ ln u 2 θ 1 θ and the bivariate clayton copula density can formulated as follows 9 c u 1 u 2 u 1 θ u 2 θ 1 1 θ where 0 θ is the parameter controlling the dependence perfect dependence is obtained if θ while θ 0 implies independence each simulation is carried out using a different numbers of samples n namely n 30 50 100 500 1000 and 5000 pairs fig 3 shows an example of scatter plots of 500 random variables simulated from three families of copulas in the uniform unit 0 1 that is the gumbel copula with the parameter θ 3 on the left panel the gaussian copula with the parameter ρ 0 8 on the middle panel and the clayton copula with the parameter θ 2 on the right panel in every simulation the asymmetric function a 3 is calculated using the formula 7 for different quantiles q 0 as the threshold namely q 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 the basic idea is to calculate the difference of frequencies densities between the upper and lower tails as marked with the red lines in fig 3 fig 4 depicts the asymmetric function a 3 for a variety of simulated sample of sizes n using the three families of copulas above and different quantile thresholds namely q 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 the horizontal axes define the quantile thresholds and the primary vertical axes represent the asymmetric function a 3 in addition the secondary vertical axes are the family of copulas in every quantile threshold q 0 there are box plots of the asymmetric function a 3 from 500 stochastic simulations created using the monte carlo approach which is available in r r core team 2013 by the copula package hofert et al 2017 one can see that the gumbel copulas clearly exhibit a positive asymmetric dependence on the whole particularly for the quantile thresholds q 0 of 0 1 and 0 2 meanwhile the gaussian copulas present a consistently symmetrical dependence for all the quantile thresholds also the clayton copulas generally present a negative asymmetric dependence especially for the quantile thresholds q 0 of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 overall each family of copula exhibits its pattern more consistently in accordance with the increasing size of the samples 4 application to precipitation data 4 1 procedure of investigation spatially distributed data values at different locations are frequently not completely random but usually exhibit a form of a spatial correlation structure where closely separated points in space tend to be highly correlated a phenomenon that spreads in space and exhibits a certain spatial correlation structure is called regionalized matheron 1971 in the context of geostatistics the regionalized variables are assumed to be a single realization of a random variable which is characterized by its distribution function the distribution function that completely describes a spatially distributed variable can thus be defined by assigning an n dimensional probability distribution f n to the set of points in the domain of interest since the spatial data is assumed to be only one realization counting the frequencies to infer the distribution function to find a multivariate probability distribution f that fits to the data is not possible without an additional assumption on the spatial process that is the spatial strong stationarity guthke 2013 under the spatial stationarity assumption the hypothesis is that the random function dependent on the location is relaxed towards a dependence of the spatial configuration of the regionalized variables the random function remains the same if a certain configuration of points is only shifted by a length of the separating distance h in addition under the geometric isotropy assumption the distance h does not depend on any direction despite the fact that whether the two gauges at separating distance h are located in the north south the west east or any other directions the distribution function can now be inferred by counting the frequencies of values in the same configuration resulting in the empirical bivariate distribution function guthke 2013 the empirical bivariate copulas for the spatial precipitation observations z at any given location s of n gauge stations z s 1 z s n can be constructed using the procedure suggested by bárdossy 2006 the procedure is conducted for each selected time interval of precipitation events due to the assumption of a single realization of a spatial random variable the precipitation occurrences analysed in this study are all selected precipitation events on a given time step with more than 0 7 value of all gauge stations located in the regions of interest which are wet with the precipitation depth higher than 0 1 mm in singapore for example the precipitation occurrence on a given time event during a time period of 1980 2010 is to be considered in this analysis if at least 21 out of 30 precipitation gauge stations are receiving precipitation with more than 0 1 mm in bavaria the precipitation occurrence on a given time event during a time period of 1951 2001 is considered in this analysis if at least 401 out of 573 precipitation gauge stations are classified to be wet with the precipitation depth value to be higher than 0 1 mm the detail of investigation procedure and statistical testing are described as follows 1 for any selected time scale and season empirical bivariate copulas using the geostatistical approach along with the given separating distances are created the estimation of the empirical bivariate copulas from observations z s 1 z s n can be done with the following procedure bárdossy 2006 a the precipitation data from all the spatial observation points at any given time step are transformed into a uniform distribution u 0 1 using the empirical marginal distribution function f z z s i or the normalized ranks from the observation points below 10 u n r z s i 1 2 n where z s i is univariate random variable z at location s i n is the number of data r z i is the rank of z s i in the set z s 1 z s n z s 1 is the maximum value and z s n is the minimum value b for any given separating distance h all gauge stations are grouped with the similar lags h and the set of pairs s h of gauge stations can then be created the set of pairs s h consists of the empirical distribution function values of the precipitation variables of any pair at locations separated by the distance h the set of pairs s h are then formulated as follows 11 s h c f z z s f z z s h again s h is a set of points in the unit square it is to be noted that s h is by definition symmetrical regarding the major axis u 1 u 2 of the unit square namely if u 1 u 2 s h then u 2 u 1 s h c from the set of pairs s h the spatial copula function c s is implemented as a function of the distance h extended from eq 2 for any two selected quantiles u 1 and u 2 eq 2 becomes as follows 12 c s u 1 u 2 h prob f z z s u 1 f z z s h u 2 c u 1 f z z s u 2 f z z s h here f z is the marginal distribution of the variable z and is supposed to be the same for each location s any two locations separated by the distance h are related to each other by the bivariate distribution function whose dependence is described by the bivariate copula d the unit square is divided into k x k grids the empirical copula density can then be constructed by calculating the empirical frequencies on each grid two dimensional histograms of the marginals u 1 and u 2 are the result 2 for any selected time scale season and quantile threshold q 0 the empirical asymmetric dependence is calculated using eq 7 on the basis of the empirical bivariate copulas 3 for any selected time scale season and quantile threshold q 0 precipitation amounts are transformed to the gaussian domain using the normal score transformation 4 based on the statistical parameters obtained from step 3 the multivariate normal distributions with t times n are generated where n is the number of gauge stations in the region of interest and t is the length of precipitation time series 5 for each realization of the t gaussian realizations the asymmetric spatial dependence using eq 7 is calculated and determined whether it is positive negative or zero asymmetric dependence 6 for all of the t gaussian realizations obtained from step 4 the number of precipitation events that presents the positive negative and zero non symmetrical dependence from step 5 is counted 7 steps 1 6 are repeated for 100 simulations and thus the quantile 5 and 95 for lower and upper limit of the confidence interval can be calculated for all of the parameters of interest for all of the realizations of precipitation events time series of spatial precipitations the number of positive negative and zero asymmetrical spatial dependencies is recapitulated the gaussian simulations here are applied to measure the degree of the uncertainty with a certain significant level namely 90 of the confidence interval the range of non symmetrical dependence from gaussian simulation here is called a confidence interval 8 steps 1 7 are repeatedly conducted using different quantile thresholds for example q 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 and the different seasons the months of djf mam jja son and also the different time scales sub daily 1 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and super daily 1d 5d and 15d 4 2 implementation in singapore empirical asymmetry function investigations of non symmetrical spatial dependence based on the bivariate copulas expose new findings in the singapore region the region of singapore has been characterized as a homogeneous area in terms of topography due to the flat land surface even though it is also described as high variables in terms of spatial and temporal precipitation events due to the tropical climate region fig 5 shows the frequencies of precipitation occurrences that exhibit the positive asymmetric dependence and negative asymmetric dependence for the quantile threshold 0 2 at different temporal scales ranging from hourly to 15 daily and different distance scales as well as different seasons effect of spatial scales overall the number of precipitation events that follow the positive asymmetric dependence decreases with the increase in distances but the number of precipitation occurrences that follow the negative asymmetric dependence increases with the increase in distances in this case the precipitation events dominantly exhibit the positive asymmetric dependence at close distances of below 10 km while the precipitation events that present the negative asymmetric dependence become more dominant at far distances above 20 km then the precipitation occurrences that show symmetric spatial dependence lead significantly at distances between 10 and 20 km this means that there is a transition phase from the positive asymmetric spatial dependence to the negative asymmetric spatial dependence through the gaussian symmetric spatial dependence at specific distances in other words the spatial scales play a crucial role to characterize the behavior of asymmetric spatial dependence the positive asymmetric dependence is extensively exhibited at the neighborhood distances because the precipitation events usually occur in a clustered manner as a result high values of precipitation at adjacent locations are more spatially correlated than low values effect of time scales the effect of spatial scales on the characteristics of asymmetric spatial dependence either positive or negative asymmetric dependence is restricted to a certain time scale this means that the temporal aggregation of precipitation amounts might generate an important influence on the characteristics of asymmetric dependence in general the number of precipitation events that exhibit either positive or negative asymmetric dependence is significantly dominant at the higher time resolutions the number of precipitation occurrences that follow either positive or negative asymmetric dependence then decreases with the increase of the temporal scales the positive asymmetric spatial dependence which frequently occurs at nearby distances below 10 km and the negative asymmetric dependence which often arises at far distances above 20 km are more pronounced at the sub daily scales from hourly to daily the asymmetric dependence disappears at the higher temporal scales for example from pentad to 15 daily which would be closer to the climatology analysis rather than the event analysis in other words the symmetric gaussian spatial dependence tends to significantly exist at the higher time scales especially from 5 daily scale and above either located at close or far distances effect of seasons the characteristics of the asymmetric spatial dependence above generally exhibit similar patterns for all different seasons however there is still a small difference in the behavior of the asymmetry function especially in the djf season in the djf season the positive asymmetric spatial dependence substantially occurs at distances below 10 km from hourly to only 12 hourly then it turns into the symmetric gaussian spatial dependence from daily or 5 daily to monthly although the positive asymmetric spatial dependence still presents a slightly higher symmetrical dependence at the daily scale it is only a very few numbers and almost negligible in contrast to the djf season for other seasons for example mam jja and son the positive asymmetric spatial dependence is significantly dominant at distances below 10 km from hourly to daily and becomes the symmetric gaussian dependence from 5 daily to monthly scale nevertheless there is strong empirical evidence that precipitation occurrences generally exhibit the positive asymmetric spatial dependence at close distances and high temporal resolutions for all different seasons no matter in which season of the year implication of asymmetric dependence on areal precipitation intensities to study the implication of the positive asymmetric spatial dependence on the areal of precipitation intensities a new analysis is conducted the precipitation datasets are divided into three datasets corresponding to the characteristics of asymmetric spatial dependences namely all the datasets positive and negative asymmetry the first dataset is from all of the precipitation events the precipitation amounts for each station are then averaged over all of the time series resulting in a mean value of precipitation at each gauge this is also conducted to all of the gauges resulting in the mean precipitation amounts of all of the stations the interpolated precipitation amounts over the whole region of interest are created from the points resulting in a single realization of spatial precipitation amounts over a regular grid the second dataset is from all of the precipitation occurrences that follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence at close distances below 10 km the precipitation intensities at the observation points are also averaged over the selected precipitation occurrences above resulting in a single spatial realization of mean precipitation points the spatial interpolations using kriging are carried out to estimate the precipitation intensities at unsampled locations over the whole region of interest from the points resulting in a single realization of spatial precipitation fields over a regular grid next the third dataset comes from the extractions of all the precipitation events that exhibit the negative asymmetric spatial dependence at distances below 10 km then the mean value of precipitation for each station is calculated based on the available precipitation occurrences that follow the negative asymmetric spatial dependence this is carried out to all of the gauges resulting in the mean precipitation amounts over all stations the precipitation intensities at unsampled locations over the whole spatial domain of interest are estimated based on those points resulting in a single spatial realization of precipitation fields over a regular grid fig 6 shows the spatial precipitation intensities using the different three datasets above namely all of the datasets positive asymmetry and negative asymmetry at different temporal scales from hourly to daily in different seasons djf jja mam and son it can be seen that heavy precipitation triggers more positive spatial asymmetric dependence at close distances on the contrary the negative spatial asymmetric spatial dependence is commonly caused by the lighter precipitation intensities moreover within the context of urban water management some empirical investigation evidence reveals that instead of using the spatial gaussian model or symmetrical spatial dependence based model the spatial precipitation models based on the positive asymmetric spatial dependence is recommended to be adopted for a better flood risk management 4 3 implementation in bavaria germany analysis of asymmetric spatial dependencies is also carried out in the large scale regions of southern germany namely the state of bavaria the region of bavaria has almost a hundred fold greater area than singapore fig 7 presents the asymmetric spatial dependence of the above region with a variety of different time scales from daily to 15 daily scale 1d 5d and 15d and various spatial distances from 5 to 60 km with the increment of 5 km for the seasons of djf mam jja and son the empirical investigation results of the precipitation events in bavaria reveal that the positive asymmetric spatial dependence also frequently occurs at the nearby gauge stations while the negative asymmetric dependence significantly appears at far distances the number of precipitation occurrences that follow positive asymmetric dependence decreases with the increase of distances while the number of precipitation occurrences with negative asymmetric dependence increase with the increases of distances unlike in the region of singapore this pattern applies to all time scales ranging from daily to monthly in all of the different seasons this is an indication that increasing temporal scales from daily to monthly does not change the behavior of asymmetric spatial dependence instead the precipitation occurrences that follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence at close distances are still pronounced no matter which time scale is used it is found that precipitation events that exhibit the positive asymmetric spatial dependence at nearby gauges are influenced by seasons for example the domination of the positive asymmetric spatial dependence is discovered until the distance of 30 km during the djf season while it is only until the distance of 15 km during the jja season meanwhile during the mam and son seasons the precipitation occurrences that follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence occur at the same distances which are below 25 km implication of asymmetric dependence on areal precipitation intensities fig 8 shows the spatial precipitation intensities in different seasons djf jja mam and son and different datasets namely all datasets positive and negative asymmetry similar to singapore the first dataset consists of all of the precipitation events and then averaged over all time series for each gauge station separately in order to get the single realization of spatial precipitation fields meanwhile the second dataset deals with all of the precipitation events that follow the positive asymmetric dependence at close distances 30 km and also averaged over all of the time series at each gauge station separately in order to obtain the single realization of spatial precipitation fields next the third dataset is intended for the extraction of precipitation events with the negative asymmetric spatial dependence in neighboring distances 30 km and a mean value is calculated over time series at each gauge station to obtain the single realization of precipitation fields in summary it is clearly seen that the local heavy precipitations in the south of bavaria tend to trigger positive asymmetry precipitation events at close distances 4 4 implementation of crms precipitation data a spatial precipitation model designed for deriving climate change scenarios at a finer spatial resolution has played a crucial role in many hydrological applications global circulation models gcms provide scenarios for the possible future developments of climate but in a very coarse spatial resolution therefore they cannot directly be used for the assessment of regional consequences of climate change next regional climate models rcms are considered to be promising tools to provide projected precipitation data with high spatial and temporal resolutions rcms are generally obtained by dynamically downscaling the output of the gcms which provide climate variables including precipitations at a finer spatial resolution unfortunately rcm models inherit some biases of the gcms the large number of uncertainties in the current global and regional climate models is related to the representation of clouds moist convection and complex topography one way to solve this is by applying the convection resolving modeling crm by reducing the grid spacing of the climate models down to some few kilometers and switching off the convection parameterization in addition crm has some advantages such as very finer spatial resolutions to some kilometers and better representations of topography surface fields and boundary layer processes thus crm has become a promising climate model to generate more realistic precipitation patterns especially in the cases of moist convection and or over mountainous regions ban et al 2014 however evaluation of performances on this model is necessary to be conducted using different perspectives most studies investigating rcms biases are conducted on the basis of marginal distribution of precipitation at individual sites for example mean variance extreme events and cross correlation between stations moreover it is also interesting to investigate the biases of rcms on the basis of asymmetric spatial dependence structures using empirical bivariate copulas in particular the rcms data type implemented in this study is convection resolving modeling crms precipitation data the data used in this study are classified into three groups namely historical observations 1951 2001 rcm simulations 1998 2007 and rcm projections 2081 2090 the data rcms used is a type of crm data with 2 2 km spatial resolution from a convection resolving simulation integrated with the cosmo clm model consortium for small scale modeling in climate mode similarly the empirical evidence proves that the positive asymmetric spatial dependence is significantly detected at close distances for the three types of datasets observations rcm simulations and rcm projections under different time scales and in all seasons as shown in fig 9 it can clearly be seen that in djf season for example the observed precipitation events frequently exhibit positive asymmetrical spatial dependence within the inter gauge distances below 35 km in different time scales identically the rcm precipitation simulations evaluations and projections also present the characteristics of asymmetric spatial dependence within similar spatial range below 35 km across different temporal scales additionally in jja seasons for example the precipitation observations and rcm precipitation simulations of both of the evaluations and projections often present the positive asymmetric dependence at nearby distances in all various temporal scales within the spatial ranges below 20 km 5 conclusions the results of empirical investigation reveal that precipitation events that exhibit the positive asymmetric spatial dependence frequently occur at nearby stations and those that exhibit negative asymmetric dependence significant appear at far distances the precipitation occurrences with positive asymmetric dependence decrease with the increase in distances while the precipitation events that exhibit the negative asymmetric dependence increase with the increase in distances in singapore the number of precipitation events that exhibit asymmetric dependence is significantly dominant at higher time resolutions and decreases with the increase in temporal scales in bavaria this pattern also applies in all of the time scales ranging from daily to monthly the positive asymmetric spatial dependences of the three datasets observations rcm simulations and rcm projections in bavaria are also significantly detected at close distances under different time scales both observations and rcm simulations show an interesting systematic pattern in relation to the domination of the positive asymmetric dependence in short distances and small time steps the precipitations with high intensity are likely to exhibit a high spatial clustering behaviour however the rcm simulations have slightly a lower degree of domination and smaller coverage areas of positive asymmetrical dependence than the observations competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgements financial support for completing this study is

7034,surrogate assisted simulation optimization technique is an effective approach for identifying aquifer remediation strategies using surrogate models to replace high fidelity groundwater simulation models is key to reduce computing time inevitably uncertainties persist in surrogate model structure and parameters and may lead to poor accuracy in prediction however past studies often adopt one surrogate to capture the original model response and rarely investigate uncertainties and approximation accuracy of surrogate models in this study we present an ensemble surrogate modeling approach to address uncertainty in surrogate model predictions for saltwater intrusion mitigation designs using a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well firstly polynomial response surface surrogate models are constructed to capture the relationship between chloride concentrations and saltwater extraction rates of a horizontal well secondly a stochastic optimization model that includes multiple ensemble surrogates is developed to determine the optimal saltwater extraction schedule chance constrained cc programming is used to account for model selection uncertainty in probabilistic nonlinear concentration constraints akaike information criterion correction aicc based bayesian model averaging bma method is adopted to determine required statistics of concentrations in the chance constraints finally a set of saltwater intrusion mitigation strategies are obtained through an interior point optimization algorithm the proposed methodology is applied to the saltwater intrusion problem in baton rouge louisiana a high fidelity flow and solute transport model is developed but requires 16 h for one model run the study shows that the developed surrogate models perform well and have strong predictive capabilities with respect to the solute transport model response while considerably reducing computation time including model selection uncertainty through multimodel inference and model averaging provides more reliable remediation strategies compared with the single surrogate assisted approach keywords saltwater scavenging ensemble surrogate response surface uncertainty bayesian model averaging optimization 1 introduction saltwater intrusion is a widespread problem that threatens many coastal and inland aquifers around the world developing appropriate management strategies is imperative to mitigate this issue aquifer remediation designs heavily rely on high fidelity groundwater conceptual models to simulate flows in aquifer systems chitsazan and tsai 2014 güngör demirci and aksoy 2011 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015b malott et al 2017 sidiropoulos et al 2015 singh and chakrabarty 2011 there has been a tendency toward including increasing numerical resolution more physical processes and expanding model domain in fully distributed groundwater models doherty and simmons 2013 leube et al 2012 greater model complexity tends to be computationally intensive as it rigorously accommodates detailed properties of the real world gosses et al 2018 keating et al 2010 sreekanth and moore 2018 despite the steady and continuing growth of computing power computational costs of complex high fidelity engineering analyses and simulations maintain pace long runtimes often prohibit the use of original codes in applications rajabi et al 2015 rajabi and ketabchi 2017 such as prediction uncertainty analysis optimization sensitivity analysis inverse modeling and design space exploration for example optimization procedures usually repeat evaluations of objective functions and constraints to identify optimal solutions besides dealing with associated probabilistic objective functions or constraints generally requires numerical methods such as monte carlo simulation which involves massive numbers of model runs in order to reach a desired level of accuracy due to these key issues performing optimization faces an enormous challenge hence in order to make the simulation optimization a practical tool for real world groundwater management problems it is necessary to find techniques that can substantially reduce the computational burden approximation methods such as design of experiments combined with response surface surrogate modeling are one of the potential strategies for minimizing the computational expense in such analyses asher et al 2015 response surface surrogates as one broad family of surrogate models razavi et al 2012 have the potential to speed up complex models without sacrificing accuracy response surface surrogates are statistical or empirical data driven models emulating high fidelity model responses but are computationally cheaper to approximate the original model the surface represents the model response with respect to the explanatory variables of interest while the main motivation of applying surrogates is to achieve computational efficiency other reasons do exist surrogate models can reveal insensitive outputs and irrelevant parameters young and ratto 2011 reduce numerical instability which facilitates calibration doherty and christensen 2011 and allow gradient based nonlinear programming methods for optimization problems hemker et al 2008 in spite of the benefits surrogates are simplified simulation models preserving the main body of processes modeled in original simulation models and less detailed compared to the original ones the literature has reported many available surrogate modeling approaches for example genetic programming is utilized to find a functional form that approximates the relationship between observed precipitation and groundwater levels fallah mehdipour et al 2013 studies broad et al 2009 kasiviswanathan and sudheer 2013 shrestha et al 2009 yoon et al 2011 focus on automatic model calibration and uncertainty analysis through artificial neural networks and support vector machines liu et al 2016 researchers focused on developing other surrogates such as kriging models radial basis functions and polynomial regression and applied them into water resources optimization problems andrade et al 2016 hussain et al 2015 laloy et al 2013 nayak et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 surrogate models are appropriate to different cases and no surrogate method is universally superior however previous studies generally adopted a single surrogate model with a fixed surrogate model structure to approximate the original model response but rarely did they investigate the approximation accuracy which tends to miss critical features on the other hand considering multiple surrogate models is likely to produce more reliable results sreekanth and datta 2011 developing surrogate models from numerical simulation models results in a certain amount of uncertainty in the predictions this is due to the uncertainty in the model structures and model parameters for example non uniqueness in selecting ann structural parameters includes number of hidden layers number of neurons in each layer and type of transfer functions chitsazan et al 2015a different choices of basis functions in rbfs and selection of polynomial forms razavi et al 2012 besides model parameters must be estimated in data analysis context and there is often substantial uncertainty in this estimation process further there exist uncertainty in the model selection process where there are data and a set of models classically it is assumed that there is a single best model that suffices as the sole model for making inferences from the data burnham and anderson 2004 however if one model is not overwhelmingly the best inevitably choosing one final model gives rise to many problems it is promising to investigate multiple surrogate modeling approach and fill the gap within the water resources research community hence quantifying the uncertainty induced by the surrogate model is a nascent field this study conducts multimodel inference and model averaging in order to quantify the uncertainties in the response surface surrogate selection process where the surrogate model aims to provide a bridge between remediation strategies well pumping schedule and remediation performance chloride concentrations in an aquifer threatened by saltwater intrusion bayesian model averaging hoeting et al 1999 is able to overcome issues of using a single model and provides a robust bayesian framework to integrate outcomes of multiple models bma has been used to account for prediction uncertainty from geological structures and hydraulic conductivity estimation chitsazan et al 2015b elshall and tsai 2014 li and tsai 2009 in groundwater models but has not been used to address the uncertainty in the surrogate model selection process by allowing multimodel inference besides posterior model probabilities in bma can be evaluated by means of monte carlo simulation based methods or by information theoretic criteria singh et al 2010 neuman 2003 proposed a bma approach with maximum likelihood estimated parameters information theoretic criteria such as the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1998 and the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 are sought efficient alternatives to approximate the posterior model probabilities however this condition is not necessary for real problems because data are not sufficient akaike information criterion correction aicc is originally derived from aic and recommended for relatively small sample size this study establishes aicc based bma approach to combine multiple surrogate model outcomes and calculate posterior model weight chance constrained cc method is introduced in conjunction with bma to quantify ensemble mean and variance of model predictions cc programming aims to determine the optimal decision variables that ensure the probability of meeting the management constraints is above a certain level chitsazan and tsai 2014 guo et al 2013 wagner 1999 the objective of this research aims to develop an aicc based bma cc framework that integrates simulation multimodel inference and stochastic optimization programming to identify optimal saltwater scavenging strategies to the best knowledge of the authors akaike weights have not been previously used to quantify the uncertainty in the response surface surrogate selection process in the context of groundwater remediation design such a methodology allows us to go beyond inference based on only one model in this study the optimal saltwater scavenging strategies are developed to protect public supply wells in a chloride elevated aquifer the work entails the following tasks 1 generating input output samples from the original solute transport simulation model 2 establishing and validating a set of regression surrogate functions that bridge temporal extraction rates of a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well and chloride concentrations at multiple monitoring locations 3 conducting multimodel inference through an aicc based bma approach 4 advancing nonlinear stochastic optimization by incorporating bma mean and variance into chance constraints 5 applying the proposed methodology to the baton rouge aquifer system in the southeastern louisiana where chloride concentration is being elevated because of heavy pumping by industrial users modeling of a horizontal scavenger well for a deep aquifer is the first time to investigate if it is an effective approach to mitigate saltwater intrusion threat confronting baton rouge metropolitan area 2 salinization in the baton rouge aquifer system southeast louisiana baton rouge has a long history of saltwater intrusion since the 1960s morgan and winner 1964 the source of saline water comes from the expulsion of over pressured brine fluids extending vertically upward above the top of the gabriel salt dome bray and hanor 1990 groundwater naturally flows southward and the baton rouge fault acted as a low permeability leaky flow barrier elshall et al 2013 however heavy withdrawals from the area north of the baton rogue fault have reversed the groundwater flow gradient the presence of saline water in the aquifers north of the baton rouge fault has been reported and monitored lovelace 2007 morgan and winner 1964 smith jr 1976 whiteman 1977 to better understand the impact of groundwater withdrawals a high fidelity three dimensional baton rouge groundwater flow model pham and tsai 2017 was developed the model visualized in gms software includes the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa the 400 foot sand down to the 2800 foot sand fig 1 all aquifers are interconnected and dip south towards the gulf of mexico the model is discretized into 93 rows 137 columns and 162 layers with 808 095 active cells the cell size is 200 m by 200 m with an averaged layer thickness of 5 2 m the simulation period is from january 1 1975 to december 31 2014 with monthly stress period and monthly time step owing to available monthly pumpage records the study found that the 2000 foot sand was the most heavily pumped by the industrial users which caused the most significant drawdown in the industrial district most of the recorded chloride concentration is less than 5000 mg l south of the baton rouge fault therefore the study assumes that the density effect is not significant the study employed mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to simulate chloride transport besides the modflow 2005 inputs pham and tsai 2017 additional inputs for mt3dms include solute transport initial conditions boundary conditions and transport properties which are developed through mt3dms basic transport package btn advection package adv dispersion package dsp in addition the mt3dms transport model is used in conjunction with modflow through a link package lmt because mt3dms needs the flow solutions obtained from the flow model the historical groundwater head and chloride concentration data in the simulation period collected from us geological survey observation wells are used for model calibration and model parameter estimation each flow and transport model run takes around 16 h this study particularly investigates the saltwater intrusion problem in the 2000 foot sand fig 2 a shows the simulated saltwater plume in the 2000 foot sand on dec 31 2009 developing optimal aquifer remediation strategies using the physically based simulation model with a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well fig 2b is literally impossible due to a large number of model runs in optimization instead in what follows this study aims to develop affordable and feasible response surface surrogate models razavi et al 2012 to improve the computational efficiency in the groundwater remediation design 3 methodology 3 1 experimental design and sampling in order to train and test response surface surrogate models a number of simulation scenarios are needed through a numerical experimental design each scenario includes a configuration of explanatory variables extraction rates of the scavenger well and response variables chloride concentrations at monitoring wells in this study the training samples and testing samples are generated independently but in the same sampling way the key steps in this implementation are as follows 1 selecting an input dataset a well distributed input dataset helps capture the complexity of the underlying original system over limited ranges of the variables a variety of space filling techniques garud et al 2017 are available to sample the input design space for example random sampling is a very common method of producing training data but may suffer from an unbalanced sample within the domain of interest a conventional full factorial design may be deemed extremely large and beyond the computational budget typically when the original function is computationally expensive in this study the optimal latin hypercube olh sampling method is employed the approach adopts the maximum minimum distance maximin distance criterion i e maximizing the minimum distance between points among the configurations it partitions each input distribution into a number of intervals of equal probability and randomly selects one sample from these subintervals tang 1993 2 performing model simulation the input dataset is then used to perform an ensemble of solute transport model simulations which result in a number of outputs these outputs together with their respective inputs provide the input output samples which are used to train and test surrogate models apart from that the sampling size can be a limiting factor that affects the suitability of the response surface surrogate for example in an overdetermined system at least n 1 n 2 2 input output samples are required to determine coefficients in a second order polynomial regression model where n is the number of explanatory variables 3 2 response surface surrogate models consider that c k is the predicted chloride concentration a response variable at a monitoring well k and q 1 q 2 q n are n extraction rates explanatory variables in a time series for the horizontal scavenger well a regression surrogate model in terms of a second order polynomial function can be formulated as 1 ln c k β 0 k i 1 n β i k q i i 1 n j 1 j i n β ij k q i q j i 1 n β ii k q i 2 ε k where ln c k is the natural logarithm of chloride concentration at monitoring well k at the end of remediation period β 0 k is the intercept term of the surrogate i 1 n β i k q i are the linear terms of the surrogate i 1 n j 1 j i n β ij k q i q j are the interaction terms of the surrogate i 1 n β ii k q i 2 are the quadratic terms of the surrogate β i k and β ij k are the regression coefficients ε k is the error term of the surrogate and n is the number of explanatory variables for a full form the total number of the regression coefficients is n 1 n 2 2 the responses at multiple monitoring wells using surrogates are as follows 2 ln c bq e where 3 ln c ln c 1 ln c 2 ln c k t 4 b β 0 1 β i 1 β i j 1 β i i 1 β 0 2 β i 2 β i j 2 β i i 2 β 0 k β i k β i j k β i i k 5 q 1 q i q i q j q i 2 t 6 e ε 1 ε 2 ε k t where ln c is the response vector q is the explanatory vector b is the coefficient matrix e is the error vector k is the number of responses the number of monitoring wells and superscript t is the transpose operator 3 3 training of surrogate models to select significant terms in eq 1 this study applies backward stepwise regression draper and smith 2014 analysis which is an effective technique to do so since it supports automatic selection in cases where there are a lot of potential explanatory variables with no anterior knowledge to be used to conduct surrogate selection the equations for each training sample point 1 2 m are stacked together and are written in the following multiple linear regression form 7 ln c k 1 ln c k 2 ln c k m 1 q i 1 q i 1 q j 1 q i 1 2 1 q i 2 q i 2 q j 2 q i 2 2 1 q i m q i m q j m q i m 2 β 0 k β i k β i j k β i i k ε k 1 ε k 2 ε k m where m is the number of training samples in each step of backward selection given the training samples the linear regression coefficient vector β can be obtained through the maximum likelihood estimation mle approach with assumed normal error in this process there exists uncertainty from the estimated regression coefficients the probability distribution of the regression coefficient estimators β can be approximated by a multivariate normal distribution anderson and mathématicien 1958 with the derived mean vector and covariance matrix since this process is inferring regression models from the data uncertainty inevitably exists after selecting components for regression models 3 4 performance evaluation of surrogate models in this study prediction performance of the developed surrogate models are evaluated by five statistical metrics r square r2 root mean square error rmse f value p value and mean absolute relative error η based on the samples as follows 8 r 2 1 i 1 n ln c i ln c i 2 i 1 n ln c i ln c 2 9 f i 1 n ln c i ln c 2 p 1 i 1 n ln c i ln c i 2 n p 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n ln c i ln c i 2 11 η 1 n i 1 n ln c i ln c i ln c i where n is the number of samples p denotes the number of regression parameters in the model c i is the chloride concentration value at sample i from the solute transport model c i is the chloride concentration value at sample i from the surrogate model ln c is the average log concentration of all samples from the solute transport model the p value is the probability of the f value being greater than the f statistic a higher r2 will result in a better fitting the smaller the rmse and η the more accurate the surrogate model will be the p value is the probability of the f value being greater than the f statistics a surrogate with a high f value or a small p value is desired 3 5 chance constrained mitigation design fig 2b shows the focal area of saltwater intrusion and a potential horizontal scavenger well in the middle of the domain considering the salt plume transport six 6 control points as potential monitoring wells surround the horizontal scavenger well to gauge the chloride concentration passing through two public supply wells are behind the control points to simplify the mitigation design the location of the potential horizontal scavenger well and the potential monitoring wells are pre specified the objective function is to minimize the total extraction rate from the horizontal scavenger well subjected that chloride concentrations at monitoring wells are below a predefined maximum contamination level mcl concentration prediction uncertainties from surrogate model structure and model parameters are considered in terms of probability the mitigation design is the following 12 minimize i 1 n q i subject to 13 p k ln c k q 1 q 2 q n ln c mcl α 14 q min q i q max where q i is the extraction rate of the horizontal scavenger well for the extraction period i c mcl is the maximum concentration level mcl of chloride concentration n is the number of extraction periods p k is the probability that the predicted chloride concentration at monitoring well k satisfies the mcl constraint α 0 1 is the confidence level and q min q max are the lower and upper limits of extraction rates of the horizontal scavenger well ln ck is predicted by a response surface surrogate model in eq 1 or a number of surrogate models totally there are k nonlinear probabilistic constraints equation 13 accounts for the uncertainty of prediction concentration in meeting the design constraint lnck ln cmcl which is equivalent to its deterministic form 15 ln c k α f 1 α γ 1 γ 2 ln c mcl where f 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function cdf of ln ck and γ 1 γ 2 are the statistical moments of the probability density function pdf of ln ck this study considers that the natural logarithm of chloride concentration follows a normal distribution eq 13 can be expressed as 16 ln c k α e ln c k φ 1 α var ln c k ln c mcl where e ln c k is the expectation of ln ck var ln c k is the variance of ln ck φ 1 α is the inverse cdf of the standard normal distribution function or the z score at the confidence level α ln c k α is the α confidence bound for ln ck in this study an interior point method potra and wright 2000 is employed to solve the chance constrained nonlinear minimization problem to find the optimal extraction rates 3 6 bayesian model averaging this study adopts the bayesian model averaging to account for predicting uncertainty of concentration which arises from the non uniqueness in surrogate models and uncertainty in surrogate model parameters consider that a set of surrogate models gi is developed to predict chloride concentration in monitoring wells according to the law of total expectation the mean predicted lnck by the surrogate models is 17 e ln c k d i e ln c k i g i d pr g i d where e ln c k d is the mean predicted lnc at monitoring well k given training samples d that are derived from the solute transport model e ln c k i g i d is the mean predicted lnc monitoring well k from surrogate model i given training samples d and pr g i d is the posterior model probability for surrogate model i e ln c k d represents e ln c k in eq 16 based on the law of total variance the variance of the predicted lnck is 18 var ln c k d i var ln c k i g i d pr g i d i e ln c k i g i d e ln c k d 2 pr g i d where var ln c k d represents var ln c k in eq 16 the first term at the right side of eq 18 denotes the within model variance of the predicted lnck which comes from the uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients the second term at the right side of eq 18 is the between model variance of the predicted mean ln ck which in this case comes from the uncertainty of regression function structure after a surrogate model is trained the mean and covariance matrix of estimated regression coefficients can be derived by the linear statistical analysis under the normal distribution assumption bard 1974 in this study a monte carlo simulation was conducted on the regression coefficients to derive e ln c k i g i d and var ln c k i g i d for each surrogate model 3 7 bayesian model averaging with akaike weights this study conducts model selection on the basis of aicc criterion in order to estimate the amount of information lost when a probability distribution model is used to approximate the true probability distribution which is called kullback leibler k l information kullback and leibler 1951 the akaike information criterion is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the expected relative k l information quantity using aicc the models are easily ranked from best to worst based on the data however when the aicc differences are very small making inference from only one best model may lead to poor accuracy of model predictions hence this study considers bayesian model averaging with akaike weights to conduct multimodel inference from data the posterior model probability for surrogate model g i can be calculated using bayes rule as follows 19 pr g i d pr d g i pr g i i pr d g i pr g i where pr g i is the prior model probability of surrogate model g i pr d g i is the marginal likelihood of surrogate model g i it is a common practice to consider equal prior model probability for surrogate models the akaike weights to approximate the marginal likelihood are as follows 20 pr d g i exp 1 2 aicc i where aicc is the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1978 akaike 1979 with a correction burnham and anderson 2004 when training sample size m is small compared to the number of model parameters p say m p 40 21 aicc aic 2p p 1 m p 1 the akaike information criterion is 22 aic i 2 ln l g i β i d 2 l where l g i β i d is the maximum likelihood β i is the maximum likelihood estimated regression coefficient vector for the surrogate model g i given the training data d as more model parameters are included in the surrogate model the first term in the aic representing the goodness of fit becomes smaller however the second term representing model complexity becomes larger aicc follows the parsimony principle to combine estimation and model selection the best model has the minimum aicc value substituting eq 20 into eq 19 akaike weights using aicc can be derived as follows 23 pr g i d exp 1 2 δ aicc i i exp 1 2 δ aicc i where δ aicc i aicc i aicc min aicc min is the minimum aicc value of all surrogate models for each monitoring well the total aicc weights is unity i e i pr g i d 1 in the context of bma the aic facilitates the posterior model probability calculation δ i δ aicc i represents the information loss of surrogate model i relative to the best model as a rule of thumb models with δ i 2 receive substantial support models with 4 δ i 7 have considerably less support and models with δ i 10 receive no support burnham and anderson 2004 when δ aicc i are very small the acceptance of only the best surrogate model gives rise to a false sense of confidence instead multi model inference is desirable for this study surrogate models with δ i 6 occam s window are discarded therefore the number of surrogates may vary given different target monitoring wells the overall methodology can be presented in a simplified flowchart as shown in fig 3 which involves two parts multimodel inference and groundwater remediation design under uncertainty 4 numerical application 4 1 study area the historical chloride concentration data suggest that the public supply wells eb 630 and eb 1150 have been threatened by saltwater intrusion at the 2000 foot sand due to heavy pumping in the industrial district to mitigate this problem a horizontal scavenger well is designed close to the baton rouge fault in order to extract the saline water and protect the public supply wells fig 2b shows the focal area where a potential horizontal scavenger well is located at the center the six monitoring wells m1 m6 surround the scavenger well the horizontal scavenger well has a screen length of 400 m with a diameter of 0 5 m the well depth is 673 8 m below land surface the revised multi node well mnw2 package konikow et al 2009 is used in this study to simulate the horizontal scavenger well this study chooses ten years as a remediation duration 4 2 samples collection and processing this study explores the effect of groundwater quality recovery with a duration of 10 years from 2000 to 2009 assuming constant pumping rate within a year we have 10 total decision variables which are q1 q2 q3 q4 q5 q6 q7 q8 q9 and q10 respectively combinations of different pumping rates explanatory variables for each year comprises the input design space 200 sets of pumping rates are generated based on the olh sampling method in the desired range 0 10000 m3 d then all the designed pumping rates are used as input to the calibrated solute transport simulation model and construct initial chloride concentrations as outputs at each monitoring location thus a dataset including 200 samples is used for training the response surface surrogates for data processing pumping rates are normalized between 0 and 1 after the training samples are prepared the next step is to estimate the coefficient vector β through the maximum likelihood estimation approach besides an independent testing set of 100 samples is generated for model validation since the developed solute transport model is computationally expensive this data collection process is implemented on a multi core supercomputer to facilitate data generation 5 results and discussions 5 1 model performance evaluation a stepwise regression approach is adopted for model inference from the 200 training samples then based on the calculated aicc values surrogate models with δaicc 6 are selected for model averaging table 1 lists the preferred surrogate models g i at different monitoring wells m i the function forms of g i are different for different monitoring wells for example g1 for m1 is different from g1 for m2 etc given the selection criterion δaicc 6 different bma models have different number of surrogates g i the function forms of the surrogates are not provided here due to limited space to rigorously assess the predicting performance of the surrogates r square p value rmse and η are calculated in this study table 2 presents the results for the training samples table 3 presents the validation results for the testing samples besides all the calculated p values are much less than 0 0001 which means that the proposed regression models are statistically significant in summary tables 2 and 3 show that individual surrogates perform well with respect to the solute transport simulation model moreover from table 3 the bma models outperform the best models g 1 at m 2 m 4 and m 6 based on the r square criterion when considering root mean square error rmse criterion bma models generally outperform the best models except at m 5 similarly bma models perform better than the best models except at m 1 and m 5 relatively the errors are high at the well m 4 considering some noisy chloride concentrations in the specific samples but overall it is accurate enough for prediction although the best model performance is slightly better than that of bma model at some locations under a certain criterion the bma model is recommended instead of a stand alone surrogate model especially for cases with pumping data beyond the training and test datasets the bma model could provide a more reliable and conservative solution for bma model performance fig 4 describes a comparison between natural logarithms of the simulated chloride concentrations and those from the bma surrogates on the 200 training samples overall bma models fit the data well and have strong predictive capabilities fig 5 presents the comparison between natural logarithms of the simulated chloride concentrations and those from the bma surrogates on the 100 independent testing samples at each monitoring location the lnc values obtained from bma surrogates match well with those from the solute transport simulation model it is concluded that the developed bma surrogate models perform well in the input design space and can be used for simulating chloride concentrations also compared to the time consuming solute transport model with running time of over 16 hours the bma surrogate only takes seconds for single run which makes the simulation optimization framework possible in this study the surrogate assisted optimization approach generally takes less than one hour to converge to the optimal solution depending on the number of iterations in different cases in contrast the optimal solution could be obtained with thousands of hours using the non surrogate optimization method therefore the statistical learning method has the ability to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities and hence constitutes a valuable means for saving efforts in groundwater remediation design 5 2 bma cc for identifying horizontal scavenger well extraction strategy given each surrogate model 100 realizations of the regression coefficients are sampled from the multivariate normal distribution provided by the mle then the generated values are used in regression functions to derive the ensemble mean from eq 17 and total variance based on eq 18 of the predicted concentrations given extraction rates the mcl of chloride concentration is set to be 250 mg l i e c mcl 250 mg l present study utilizes the interior point method to solve the chance constrained nonlinear minimization problem and find the optimal extraction rates the function and constraint tolerances are set to 10 3 during the optimization process the ensemble mean and variance of the predicted concentrations are recalculated by the updated extraction rates besides this study also conducts another two cases for comparison one is the best model case that involves only minimum aicc model at each monitoring location for deriving optimal extraction rates the other is the worst model case with maximum aicc models fig 6 presents the tradeoff between confidence level and minimum average extraction rate using the horizontal scavenger well for the 10 year remediation period for the three cases the best model case the bma model case and the worst model case overall a higher extraction rate is needed to guarantee a higher chance of satisfying the mcl taking the bma model case for example if the optimization problem described in eqs 12 14 is solved with a confidence level of 75 the optimal average pumping rate is 7788 m3 d while a pumping rate of 7828 m3 d could achieve a probability of 85 that the chloride concentrations at all monitoring locations are less than 250 mg l without the horizontal scavenger well groundwater flow direction could not be altered and public supply wells would not be protected besides when the confidence level is less than 20 the solutions among the three cases are close to each other however as the confidence level goes higher the gap becomes higher in this study given the same confidence level the extraction rate from the worst model case is overestimated and biased when compared with bma based optimization in addition the solutions from the bma model case are close to those from best model case and both of them give a relatively lower pumping rate for example an average pumping rate of 7856 m3 d can satisfy the chance constraints with 90 confidence level if the bma model is used while 7839 m3 d is needed for the best model case and 7901 m3 d for the worst model case this is because the best model with minimum aicc has a higher weight in the model averaging while the worst model with maximum aicc accounts for a relatively lower weight also both cases represent the results that only consider the prediction variance from model parameter uncertainty however the bma model case incorporates multiple models and considers both within model variance and between model variance therefore the aicc based bma cc model is robust and remediation strategies based on the bma cc model are more reliable moreover it indicates that the bma model case would be a good choice especially for forecasting the within model variances and between model variances are calculated based on the first and the second terms of eq 18 as shown in fig 7 the result shows that the within model variances dominate the between model variances that is because there are many model parameters in the regression surrogate models relatively the between model variances account for a low proportion since this study considers statistical models with δ aicc 6 based on occam s window and the selected models have similar structures however between model variance can affect model performance especially in the case where the model structures are significantly different nevertheless between model variances should be considered to construct a robust ensemble model 5 3 impact of mcls on pumping schedule design to examine the effect of different mcls on pumping strategies we investigate the optimal extraction rates with the mcl to be 250 mg l and 300 mg l fig 8 displays the optimal pumping schedules from the bma cc method for the two cases given the confidence level of 90 the optimal extraction rates are 4808 8555 5661 6542 7932 9333 8438 9822 8154 and 9311 m3 d respectively with an average of 7856 m3 d if we target 90 chance that the predicted chloride concentrations at all the six monitoring wells to be less than 250 mg l similarly at the same confidence level given the condition mcl 300 mg l the ten yearly extraction rates are 2 241 2 942 3 715 4 405 6 302 8 807 7 631 9 879 5 905 and 8 593 m3 d respectively with an average of 6 042 m3 d as the mcl is relaxed the optimal extraction rates at most years are generally reduced except for the year 2007 where the two extraction rates are almost the same while under a stricter mcl higher extraction rates would be needed besides under each mcl all of the temporal periods play significant roles in the saltwater intrusion mitigation process the scavenger well would extract more in years 2005 2007 and 2009 which contribute the most to the total extraction rate these high extraction rates are needed because the remediation period is short only 10 years if the remediation period is much longer it is expected that the load of operation would be reduced 5 4 saltwater intrusion mitigation effect the saltwater intrusion mitigation effect is verified by using the optimized pumping schedule as inputs to the solute transport model fig 9 a shows chloride concentration distribution through the solute transport model at the end of 10 years without the horizontal scavenger well and fig 9b shows the chloride concentration distribution through the solute transport model at the end of the remediation period in this case the optimal pumping schedule of the horizontal scavenger well is identified through the bma cc approach given the mcl 250 mg l at the confidence level of 90 the ten extraction rates from q 1 to q 10 are 4808 8555 5661 6542 7932 9333 8438 9822 8154 and 9311 m3 d respectively it is observed that the public supply wells eb 630 and eb 1150 have already experienced saltwater intrusion before any remediation strategy when using the horizontal scavenger well the saltwater plume can be retreated and the saltwater encroachment problem can be mitigated to some extent fig 10 presents the chloride concentration variations of the two public supply wells during the remediation period chloride concentrations of the wells are reduced a lot because a large volume of saltwater are extracted from the aquifer hence this remediation design is effective for reducing chloride concentrations and protect the public supply wells from the saltwater intrusion threat generally it can be predicted that with higher mcl criterion less extraction rates are needed to ensure the same probability of meeting the management constraints and hence reduce the saltwater encroachment 6 conclusions the response surface surrogates are proven to be effective to represent the outputs of a time consuming physically based saltwater intrusion model using the regression surrogate models is crucial for considerably reducing computation time in the aquifer remediation design due to massive runs of the groundwater simulation model for this study the computation time using second order polynomial response surface surrogates is at least three orders of magnitude faster than that using the solute transport model without sacrificing accuracy using higher order polynomial response surface surrogates may dramatically increase model complexity while linear response surface surrogates may be too simple and cause significant model errors as a consequence the second order polynomial response surface surrogates are very appealing to our study as the surrogates dramatically reduce the computation burden in optimization without sacrificing modeling accuracy the effectiveness of saltwater scavenging approach depends on reliable chloride concentration prediction this study develops a rigorous simulation optimization framework that utilizes multiple surrogate models for chloride concentration prediction and quantifies uncertainty of using surrogates in saltwater scavenging optimization the aicc based bma predictions may not always outperform all the individual surrogates in the ensemble but this robust approach incorporates multiple models and hence produces relatively reliable chloride concentration predictions the chance constrained cc programming proves to be effective to cope with uncertainty in probabilistic nonlinear chloride constraints the aicc based bma approach in conjunction with ensemble surrogate assisted cc programming provides more reliable optimal saltwater scavenging strategies than those from single surrogate modeling to authors best knowledge this approach has not been previously applied to quantify surrogate model structure and parameter uncertainties in the context of saltwater intrusion mitigation design in this study the gradient based interior point method is highly effective to solve the surrogate assisted optimization problem while none of nonlinear optimization algorithms can guarantee global solutions the optimal solutions derived from the interior point method are sufficient for this study using a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well to extract salty water for a deep aquifer is the first test for urban cities where land properties are generally limited and difficult to obtain for installing multiple wells the complex groundwater model is able to determine a suitable position for the horizontal scavenger well in the aquifer the optimal extraction schedule for the scavenger well is successfully achieved through the proposed framework where the simulation multi surrogate model inference and chance constrained optimization programming are unified the optimal extraction schedule is also verified through the solute transport model that the

7034,surrogate assisted simulation optimization technique is an effective approach for identifying aquifer remediation strategies using surrogate models to replace high fidelity groundwater simulation models is key to reduce computing time inevitably uncertainties persist in surrogate model structure and parameters and may lead to poor accuracy in prediction however past studies often adopt one surrogate to capture the original model response and rarely investigate uncertainties and approximation accuracy of surrogate models in this study we present an ensemble surrogate modeling approach to address uncertainty in surrogate model predictions for saltwater intrusion mitigation designs using a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well firstly polynomial response surface surrogate models are constructed to capture the relationship between chloride concentrations and saltwater extraction rates of a horizontal well secondly a stochastic optimization model that includes multiple ensemble surrogates is developed to determine the optimal saltwater extraction schedule chance constrained cc programming is used to account for model selection uncertainty in probabilistic nonlinear concentration constraints akaike information criterion correction aicc based bayesian model averaging bma method is adopted to determine required statistics of concentrations in the chance constraints finally a set of saltwater intrusion mitigation strategies are obtained through an interior point optimization algorithm the proposed methodology is applied to the saltwater intrusion problem in baton rouge louisiana a high fidelity flow and solute transport model is developed but requires 16 h for one model run the study shows that the developed surrogate models perform well and have strong predictive capabilities with respect to the solute transport model response while considerably reducing computation time including model selection uncertainty through multimodel inference and model averaging provides more reliable remediation strategies compared with the single surrogate assisted approach keywords saltwater scavenging ensemble surrogate response surface uncertainty bayesian

evaluations of objective functions and constraints to identify optimal solutions besides dealing with associated probabilistic objective functions or constraints generally requires numerical methods such as monte carlo simulation which involves massive numbers of model runs in order to reach a desired level of accuracy due to these key issues performing optimization faces an enormous challenge hence in order to make the simulation optimization a practical tool for real world groundwater management problems it is necessary to find techniques that can substantially reduce the computational burden approximation methods such as design of experiments combined with response surface surrogate modeling are one of the potential strategies for minimizing the computational expense in such analyses asher et al 2015 response surface surrogates as one broad family of surrogate models razavi et al 2012 have the potential to speed up complex models without sacrificing accuracy response surface surrogates are statistical or empirical data driven models emulating high fidelity model responses but are computationally cheaper to approximate the original model the surface represents the model response with respect to the explanatory variables of interest while the main motivation of applying surrogates is to achieve computational efficiency other reasons do exist surrogate models can reveal insensitive outputs and irrelevant parameters young and ratto 2011 reduce numerical instability which facilitates calibration doherty and christensen 2011 and allow gradient based nonlinear programming methods for optimization problems hemker et al 2008 in spite of the benefits surrogates are simplified simulation models preserving the main body of processes modeled in original simulation models and less detailed compared to the original ones the literature has reported many available surrogate modeling approaches for example genetic programming is utilized to find a functional form that approximates the relationship between observed precipitation and groundwater levels fallah mehdipour et al 2013 studies broad et al 2009 kasiviswanathan and sudheer 2013 shrestha et al 2009 yoon et al 2011 focus on automatic model calibration and uncertainty analysis through artificial neural networks and support vector machines liu et al 2016 researchers focused on developing other surrogates such as kriging models radial basis functions and polynomial regression and applied them into water resources optimization problems andrade et al 2016 hussain et al 2015 laloy et al 2013 nayak et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 surrogate models are appropriate to different cases and no surrogate method is universally superior however previous studies generally adopted a single surrogate model with a fixed surrogate model structure to approximate the original model response but rarely did they investigate the approximation accuracy which tends to miss critical features on the other hand considering multiple surrogate models is likely to produce more reliable results sreekanth and datta 2011 developing surrogate models from numerical simulation models results in a certain amount of uncertainty in the predictions this is due to the uncertainty in the model structures and model parameters for example non uniqueness in selecting ann structural parameters includes number of hidden layers number of neurons in each layer and type of transfer functions chitsazan et al 2015a different choices of basis functions in rbfs and selection of polynomial forms razavi et al 2012 besides model parameters must be estimated in data analysis context and there is often substantial uncertainty in this estimation process further there exist uncertainty in the model selection process where there are data and a set of models classically it is assumed that there is a single best model that suffices as the sole model for making inferences from the data burnham and anderson 2004 however if one model is not overwhelmingly the best inevitably choosing one final model gives rise to many problems it is promising to investigate multiple surrogate modeling approach and fill the gap within the water resources research community hence quantifying the uncertainty induced by the surrogate model is a nascent field this study conducts multimodel inference and model averaging in order to quantify the uncertainties in the response surface surrogate selection process where the surrogate model aims to provide a bridge between remediation strategies well pumping schedule and remediation performance chloride concentrations in an aquifer threatened by saltwater intrusion bayesian model averaging hoeting et al 1999 is able to overcome issues of using a single model and provides a robust bayesian framework to integrate outcomes of multiple models bma has been used to account for prediction uncertainty from geological structures and hydraulic conductivity estimation chitsazan et al 2015b elshall and tsai 2014 li and tsai 2009 in groundwater models but has not been used to address the uncertainty in the surrogate model selection process by allowing multimodel inference besides posterior model probabilities in bma can be evaluated by means of monte carlo simulation based methods or by information theoretic criteria singh et al 2010 neuman 2003 proposed a bma approach with maximum likelihood estimated parameters information theoretic criteria such as the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1998 and the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 are sought efficient alternatives to approximate the posterior model probabilities however this condition is not necessary for real problems because data are not sufficient akaike information criterion correction aicc is originally derived from aic and recommended for relatively small sample size this study establishes aicc based bma approach to combine multiple surrogate model outcomes and calculate posterior model weight chance constrained cc method is introduced in conjunction with bma to quantify ensemble mean and variance of model predictions cc programming aims to determine the optimal decision variables that ensure the probability of meeting the management constraints is above a certain level chitsazan and tsai 2014 guo et al 2013 wagner 1999 the objective of this research aims to develop an aicc based bma cc framework that integrates simulation multimodel inference and stochastic optimization programming to identify optimal saltwater scavenging strategies to the best knowledge of the authors akaike weights have not been previously used to quantify the uncertainty in the response surface surrogate selection process in the context of groundwater remediation design such a methodology allows us to go beyond inference based on only one model in this study the optimal saltwater scavenging strategies are developed to protect public supply wells in a chloride elevated aquifer the work entails the following tasks 1 generating input output samples from the original solute transport simulation model 2 establishing and validating a set of regression surrogate functions that bridge temporal extraction rates of a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well and chloride concentrations at multiple monitoring locations 3 conducting multimodel inference through an aicc based bma approach 4 advancing nonlinear stochastic optimization by incorporating bma mean and variance into chance constraints 5 applying the proposed methodology to the baton rouge aquifer system in the southeastern louisiana where chloride concentration is being elevated because of heavy pumping by industrial users modeling of a horizontal scavenger well for a deep aquifer is the first time to investigate if it is an effective approach to mitigate saltwater intrusion threat confronting baton rouge metropolitan area 2 salinization in the baton rouge aquifer system southeast louisiana baton rouge has a long history of saltwater intrusion since the 1960s morgan and winner 1964 the source of saline water comes from the expulsion of over pressured brine fluids extending vertically upward above the top of the gabriel salt dome bray and hanor 1990 groundwater naturally flows southward and the baton rouge fault acted as a low permeability leaky flow barrier elshall et al 2013 however heavy withdrawals from the area north of the baton rogue fault have reversed the groundwater flow gradient the presence of saline water in the aquifers north of the baton rouge fault has been reported and monitored lovelace 2007 morgan and winner 1964 smith jr 1976 whiteman 1977 to better understand the impact of groundwater withdrawals a high fidelity three dimensional baton rouge groundwater flow model pham and tsai 2017 was developed the model visualized in gms software includes the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa the 400 foot sand down to the 2800 foot sand fig 1 all aquifers are interconnected and dip south towards the gulf of mexico the model is discretized into 93 rows 137 columns and 162 layers with 808 095 active cells the cell size is 200 m by 200 m with an averaged layer thickness of 5 2 m the simulation period is from january 1 1975 to december 31 2014 with monthly stress period and monthly time step owing to available monthly pumpage records the study found that the 2000 foot sand was the most heavily pumped by the industrial users which caused the most significant drawdown in the industrial district most of the recorded chloride concentration is less than 5000 mg l south of the baton rouge fault therefore the study assumes that the density effect is not significant the study employed mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 to simulate chloride transport besides the modflow 2005 inputs pham and tsai 2017 additional inputs for mt3dms include solute transport initial conditions boundary conditions and transport properties which are developed through mt3dms basic transport package btn advection package adv dispersion package dsp in addition the mt3dms transport model is used in conjunction with modflow through a link package lmt because mt3dms needs the flow solutions obtained from the flow model the historical groundwater head and chloride concentration data in the simulation period collected from us geological survey observation wells are used for model calibration and model parameter estimation each flow and transport model run takes around 16 h this study particularly investigates the saltwater intrusion problem in the 2000 foot sand fig 2 a shows the simulated saltwater plume in the 2000 foot sand on dec 31 2009 developing optimal aquifer remediation strategies using the physically based simulation model with a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well fig 2b is literally impossible due to a large number of model runs in optimization instead in what follows this study aims to develop affordable and feasible response surface surrogate models razavi et al 2012 to improve the computational efficiency in the groundwater remediation design 3 methodology 3 1 experimental design and sampling in order to train and test response surface surrogate models a number of simulation scenarios are needed through a numerical experimental design each scenario includes a configuration of explanatory variables extraction rates of the scavenger well and response variables chloride concentrations at monitoring wells in this study the training samples and testing samples are generated independently but in the same sampling way the key steps in this implementation are as follows 1 selecting an input dataset a well distributed input dataset helps capture the complexity of the underlying original system over limited ranges of the variables a variety of space filling techniques garud et al 2017 are available to sample the input design space for example random sampling is a very common method of producing training data but may suffer from an unbalanced sample within the domain of interest a conventional full factorial design may be deemed extremely large and beyond the computational budget typically when the original function is computationally expensive in this study the optimal latin hypercube olh sampling method is employed the approach adopts the maximum minimum distance maximin distance criterion i e maximizing the minimum distance between points among the configurations it partitions each input distribution into a number of intervals of equal probability and randomly selects one sample from these subintervals tang 1993 2 performing model simulation the input dataset is then used to perform an ensemble of solute transport model simulations which result in a number of outputs these outputs together with their respective inputs provide the input output samples which are used to train and test surrogate models apart from that the sampling size can be a limiting factor that affects the suitability of the response surface surrogate for example in an overdetermined system at least n 1 n 2 2 input output samples are required to determine coefficients in a second order polynomial regression model where n is the number of explanatory variables 3 2 response surface surrogate models consider that c k is the predicted chloride concentration a response variable at a monitoring well k and q 1 q 2 q n are n extraction rates explanatory variables in a time series for the horizontal scavenger well a regression surrogate model in terms of a second order polynomial function can be formulated as 1 ln c k β 0 k i 1 n β i k q i i 1 n j 1 j i n β ij k q i q j i 1 n β ii k q i 2 ε k where ln c k is the natural logarithm of chloride concentration at monitoring well k at the end of remediation period β 0 k is the intercept term of the surrogate i 1 n β i k q i are the linear terms of the surrogate i 1 n j 1 j i n β ij k q i q j are the interaction terms of the surrogate i 1 n β ii k q i 2 are the quadratic terms of the surrogate β i k and β ij k are the regression coefficients ε k is the error term of the surrogate and n is the number of explanatory variables for a full form the total number of the regression coefficients is n 1 n 2 2 the responses at multiple monitoring wells using surrogates are as follows 2 ln c bq e where 3 ln c ln c 1 ln c 2 ln c k t 4 b β 0 1 β i 1 β i j 1 β i i 1 β 0 2 β i 2 β i j 2 β i i 2 β 0 k β i k β i j k β i i k 5 q 1 q i q i q j q i 2 t 6 e ε 1 ε 2 ε k t where ln c is the response vector q is the explanatory vector b is the coefficient matrix e is the error vector k is the number of responses the number of monitoring wells and superscript t is the transpose operator 3 3 training of surrogate models to select significant terms in eq 1 this study applies backward stepwise regression draper and smith 2014 analysis which is an effective technique to do so since it supports automatic selection in cases where there are a lot of potential explanatory variables with no anterior knowledge to be used to conduct surrogate selection the equations for each training sample point 1 2 m are stacked together and are written in the following multiple linear regression form 7 ln c k 1 ln c k 2 ln c k m 1 q i 1 q i 1 q j 1 q i 1 2 1 q i 2 q i 2 q j 2 q i 2 2 1 q i m q i m q j m q i m 2 β 0 k β i k β i j k β i i k ε k 1 ε k 2 ε k m where m is the number of training samples in each step of backward selection given the training samples the linear regression coefficient vector β can be obtained through the maximum likelihood estimation mle approach with assumed normal error in this process there exists uncertainty from the estimated regression coefficients the probability distribution of the regression coefficient estimators β can be approximated by a multivariate normal distribution anderson and mathématicien 1958 with the derived mean vector and covariance matrix since this process is inferring regression models from the data uncertainty inevitably exists after selecting components for regression models 3 4 performance evaluation of surrogate models in this study prediction performance of the developed surrogate models are evaluated by five statistical metrics r square r2 root mean square error rmse f value p value and mean absolute relative error η based on the samples as follows 8 r 2 1 i 1 n ln c i ln c i 2 i 1 n ln c i ln c 2 9 f i 1 n ln c i ln c 2 p 1 i 1 n ln c i ln c i 2 n p 10 rmse 1 n i 1 n ln c i ln c i 2 11 η 1 n i 1 n ln c i ln c i ln c i where n is the number of samples p denotes the number of regression parameters in the model c i is the chloride concentration value at sample i from the solute transport model c i is the chloride concentration value at sample i from the surrogate model ln c is the average log concentration of all samples from the solute transport model the p value is the probability of the f value being greater than the f statistic a higher r2 will result in a better fitting the smaller the rmse and η the more accurate the surrogate model will be the p value is the probability of the f value being greater than the f statistics a surrogate with a high f value or a small p value is desired 3 5 chance constrained mitigation design fig 2b shows the focal area of saltwater intrusion and a potential horizontal scavenger well in the middle of the domain considering the salt plume transport six 6 control points as potential monitoring wells surround the horizontal scavenger well to gauge the chloride concentration passing through two public supply wells are behind the control points to simplify the mitigation design the location of the potential horizontal scavenger well and the potential monitoring wells are pre specified the objective function is to minimize the total extraction rate from the horizontal scavenger well subjected that chloride concentrations at monitoring wells are below a predefined maximum contamination level mcl concentration prediction uncertainties from surrogate model structure and model parameters are considered in terms of probability the mitigation design is the following 12 minimize i 1 n q i subject to 13 p k ln c k q 1 q 2 q n ln c mcl α 14 q min q i q max where q i is the extraction rate of the horizontal scavenger well for the extraction period i c mcl is the maximum concentration level mcl of chloride concentration n is the number of extraction periods p k is the probability that the predicted chloride concentration at monitoring well k satisfies the mcl constraint α 0 1 is the confidence level and q min q max are the lower and upper limits of extraction rates of the horizontal scavenger well ln ck is predicted by a response surface surrogate model in eq 1 or a number of surrogate models totally there are k nonlinear probabilistic constraints equation 13 accounts for the uncertainty of prediction concentration in meeting the design constraint lnck ln cmcl which is equivalent to its deterministic form 15 ln c k α f 1 α γ 1 γ 2 ln c mcl where f 1 is the inverse cumulative distribution function cdf of ln ck and γ 1 γ 2 are the statistical moments of the probability density function pdf of ln ck this study considers that the natural logarithm of chloride concentration follows a normal distribution eq 13 can be expressed as 16 ln c k α e ln c k φ 1 α var ln c k ln c mcl where e ln c k is the expectation of ln ck var ln c k is the variance of ln ck φ 1 α is the inverse cdf of the standard normal distribution function or the z score at the confidence level α ln c k α is the α confidence bound for ln ck in this study an interior point method potra and wright 2000 is employed to solve the chance constrained nonlinear minimization problem to find the optimal extraction rates 3 6 bayesian model averaging this study adopts the bayesian model averaging to account for predicting uncertainty of concentration which arises from the non uniqueness in surrogate models and uncertainty in surrogate model parameters consider that a set of surrogate models gi is developed to predict chloride concentration in monitoring wells according to the law of total expectation the mean predicted lnck by the surrogate models is 17 e ln c k d i e ln c k i g i d pr g i d where e ln c k d is the mean predicted lnc at monitoring well k given training samples d that are derived from the solute transport model e ln c k i g i d is the mean predicted lnc monitoring well k from surrogate model i given training samples d and pr g i d is the posterior model probability for surrogate model i e ln c k d represents e ln c k in eq 16 based on the law of total variance the variance of the predicted lnck is 18 var ln c k d i var ln c k i g i d pr g i d i e ln c k i g i d e ln c k d 2 pr g i d where var ln c k d represents var ln c k in eq 16 the first term at the right side of eq 18 denotes the within model variance of the predicted lnck which comes from the uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients the second term at the right side of eq 18 is the between model variance of the predicted mean ln ck which in this case comes from the uncertainty of regression function structure after a surrogate model is trained the mean and covariance matrix of estimated regression coefficients can be derived by the linear statistical analysis under the normal distribution assumption bard 1974 in this study a monte carlo simulation was conducted on the regression coefficients to derive e ln c k i g i d and var ln c k i g i d for each surrogate model 3 7 bayesian model averaging with akaike weights this study conducts model selection on the basis of aicc criterion in order to estimate the amount of information lost when a probability distribution model is used to approximate the true probability distribution which is called kullback leibler k l information kullback and leibler 1951 the akaike information criterion is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the expected relative k l information quantity using aicc the models are easily ranked from best to worst based on the data however when the aicc differences are very small making inference from only one best model may lead to poor accuracy of model predictions hence this study considers bayesian model averaging with akaike weights to conduct multimodel inference from data the posterior model probability for surrogate model g i can be calculated using bayes rule as follows 19 pr g i d pr d g i pr g i i pr d g i pr g i where pr g i is the prior model probability of surrogate model g i pr d g i is the marginal likelihood of surrogate model g i it is a common practice to consider equal prior model probability for surrogate models the akaike weights to approximate the marginal likelihood are as follows 20 pr d g i exp 1 2 aicc i where aicc is the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1978 akaike 1979 with a correction burnham and anderson 2004 when training sample size m is small compared to the number of model parameters p say m p 40 21 aicc aic 2p p 1 m p 1 the akaike information criterion is 22 aic i 2 ln l g i β i d 2 l where l g i β i d is the maximum likelihood β i is the maximum likelihood estimated regression coefficient vector for the surrogate model g i given the training data d as more model parameters are included in the surrogate model the first term in the aic representing the goodness of fit becomes smaller however the second term representing model complexity becomes larger aicc follows the parsimony principle to combine estimation and model selection the best model has the minimum aicc value substituting eq 20 into eq 19 akaike weights using aicc can be derived as follows 23 pr g i d exp 1 2 δ aicc i i exp 1 2 δ aicc i where δ aicc i aicc i aicc min aicc min is the minimum aicc value of all surrogate models for each monitoring well the total aicc weights is unity i e i pr g i d 1 in the context of bma the aic facilitates the posterior model probability calculation δ i δ aicc i represents the information loss of surrogate model i relative to the best model as a rule of thumb models with δ i 2 receive substantial support models with 4 δ i 7 have considerably less support and models with δ i 10 receive no support burnham and anderson 2004 when δ aicc i are very small the acceptance of only the best surrogate model gives rise to a false sense of confidence instead multi model inference is desirable for this study surrogate models with δ i 6 occam s window are discarded therefore the number of surrogates may vary given different target monitoring wells the overall methodology can be presented in a simplified flowchart as shown in fig 3 which involves two parts multimodel inference and groundwater remediation design under uncertainty 4 numerical application 4 1 study area the historical chloride concentration data suggest that the public supply wells eb 630 and eb 1150 have been threatened by saltwater intrusion at the 2000 foot sand due to heavy pumping in the industrial district to mitigate this problem a horizontal scavenger well is designed close to the baton rouge fault in order to extract the saline water and protect the public supply wells fig 2b shows the focal area where a potential horizontal scavenger well is located at the center the six monitoring wells m1 m6 surround the scavenger well the horizontal scavenger well has a screen length of 400 m with a diameter of 0 5 m the well depth is 673 8 m below land surface the revised multi node well mnw2 package konikow et al 2009 is used in this study to simulate the horizontal scavenger well this study chooses ten years as a remediation duration 4 2 samples collection and processing this study explores the effect of groundwater quality recovery with a duration of 10 years from 2000 to 2009 assuming constant pumping rate within a year we have 10 total decision variables which are q1 q2 q3 q4 q5 q6 q7 q8 q9 and q10 respectively combinations of different pumping rates explanatory variables for each year comprises the input design space 200 sets of pumping rates are generated based on the olh sampling method in the desired range 0 10000 m3 d then all the designed pumping rates are used as input to the calibrated solute transport simulation model and construct initial chloride concentrations as outputs at each monitoring location thus a dataset including 200 samples is used for training the response surface surrogates for data processing pumping rates are normalized between 0 and 1 after the training samples are prepared the next step is to estimate the coefficient vector β through the maximum likelihood estimation approach besides an independent testing set of 100 samples is generated for model validation since the developed solute transport model is computationally expensive this data collection process is implemented on a multi core supercomputer to facilitate data generation 5 results and discussions 5 1 model performance evaluation a stepwise regression approach is adopted for model inference from the 200 training samples then based on the calculated aicc values surrogate models with δaicc 6 are selected for model averaging table 1 lists the preferred surrogate models g i at different monitoring wells m i the function forms of g i are different for different monitoring wells for example g1 for m1 is different from g1 for m2 etc given the selection criterion δaicc 6 different bma models have different number of surrogates g i the function forms of the surrogates are not provided here due to limited space to rigorously assess the predicting performance of the surrogates r square p value rmse and η are calculated in this study table 2 presents the results for the training samples table 3 presents the validation results for the testing samples besides all the calculated p values are much less than 0 0001 which means that the proposed regression models are statistically significant in summary tables 2 and 3 show that individual surrogates perform well with respect to the solute transport simulation model moreover from table 3 the bma models outperform the best models g 1 at m 2 m 4 and m 6 based on the r square criterion when considering root mean square error rmse criterion bma models generally outperform the best models except at m 5 similarly bma models perform better than the best models except at m 1 and m 5 relatively the errors are high at the well m 4 considering some noisy chloride concentrations in the specific samples but overall it is accurate enough for prediction although the best model performance is slightly better than that of bma model at some locations under a certain criterion the bma model is recommended instead of a stand alone surrogate model especially for cases with pumping data beyond the training and test datasets the bma model could provide a more reliable and conservative solution for bma model performance fig 4 describes a comparison between natural logarithms of the simulated chloride concentrations and those from the bma surrogates on the 200 training samples overall bma models fit the data well and have strong predictive capabilities fig 5 presents the comparison between natural logarithms of the simulated chloride concentrations and those from the bma surrogates on the 100 independent testing samples at each monitoring location the lnc values obtained from bma surrogates match well with those from the solute transport simulation model it is concluded that the developed bma surrogate models perform well in the input design space and can be used for simulating chloride concentrations also compared to the time consuming solute transport model with running time of over 16 hours the bma surrogate only takes seconds for single run which makes the simulation optimization framework possible in this study the surrogate assisted optimization approach generally takes less than one hour to converge to the optimal solution depending on the number of iterations in different cases in contrast the optimal solution could be obtained with thousands of hours using the non surrogate optimization method therefore the statistical learning method has the ability to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities and hence constitutes a valuable means for saving efforts in groundwater remediation design 5 2 bma cc for identifying horizontal scavenger well extraction strategy given each surrogate model 100 realizations of the regression coefficients are sampled from the multivariate normal distribution provided by the mle then the generated values are used in regression functions to derive the ensemble mean from eq 17 and total variance based on eq 18 of the predicted concentrations given extraction rates the mcl of chloride concentration is set to be 250 mg l i e c mcl 250 mg l present study utilizes the interior point method to solve the chance constrained nonlinear minimization problem and find the optimal extraction rates the function and constraint tolerances are set to 10 3 during the optimization process the ensemble mean and variance of the predicted concentrations are recalculated by the updated extraction rates besides this study also conducts another two cases for comparison one is the best model case that involves only minimum aicc model at each monitoring location for deriving optimal extraction rates the other is the worst model case with maximum aicc models fig 6 presents the tradeoff between confidence level and minimum average extraction rate using the horizontal scavenger well for the 10 year remediation period for the three cases the best model case the bma model case and the worst model case overall a higher extraction rate is needed to guarantee a higher chance of satisfying the mcl taking the bma model case for example if the optimization problem described in eqs 12 14 is solved with a confidence level of 75 the optimal average pumping rate is 7788 m3 d while a pumping rate of 7828 m3 d could achieve a probability of 85 that the chloride concentrations at all monitoring locations are less than 250 mg l without the horizontal scavenger well groundwater flow direction could not be altered and public supply wells would not be protected besides when the confidence level is less than 20 the solutions among the three cases are close to each other however as the confidence level goes higher the gap becomes higher in this study given the same confidence level the extraction rate from the worst model case is overestimated and biased when compared with bma based optimization in addition the solutions from the bma model case are close to those from best model case and both of them give a relatively lower pumping rate for example an average pumping rate of 7856 m3 d can satisfy the chance constraints with 90 confidence level if the bma model is used while 7839 m3 d is needed for the best model case and 7901 m3 d for the worst model case this is because the best model with minimum aicc has a higher weight in the model averaging while the worst model with maximum aicc accounts for a relatively lower weight also both cases represent the results that only consider the prediction variance from model parameter uncertainty however the bma model case incorporates multiple models and considers both within model variance and between model variance therefore the aicc based bma cc model is robust and remediation strategies based on the bma cc model are more reliable moreover it indicates that the bma model case would be a good choice especially for forecasting the within model variances and between model variances are calculated based on the first and the second terms of eq 18 as shown in fig 7 the result shows that the within model variances dominate the between model variances that is because there are many model parameters in the regression surrogate models relatively the between model variances account for a low proportion since this study considers statistical models with δ aicc 6 based on occam s window and the selected models have similar structures however between model variance can affect model performance especially in the case where the model structures are significantly different nevertheless between model variances should be considered to construct a robust ensemble model 5 3 impact of mcls on pumping schedule design to examine the effect of different mcls on pumping strategies we investigate the optimal extraction rates with the mcl to be 250 mg l and 300 mg l fig 8 displays the optimal pumping schedules from the bma cc method for the two cases given the confidence level of 90 the optimal extraction rates are 4808 8555 5661 6542 7932 9333 8438 9822 8154 and 9311 m3 d respectively with an average of 7856 m3 d if we target 90 chance that the predicted chloride concentrations at all the six monitoring wells to be less than 250 mg l similarly at the same confidence level given the condition mcl 300 mg l the ten yearly extraction rates are 2 241 2 942 3 715 4 405 6 302 8 807 7 631 9 879 5 905 and 8 593 m3 d respectively with an average of 6 042 m3 d as the mcl is relaxed the optimal extraction rates at most years are generally reduced except for the year 2007 where the two extraction rates are almost the same while under a stricter mcl higher extraction rates would be needed besides under each mcl all of the temporal periods play significant roles in the saltwater intrusion mitigation process the scavenger well would extract more in years 2005 2007 and 2009 which contribute the most to the total extraction rate these high extraction rates are needed because the remediation period is short only 10 years if the remediation period is much longer it is expected that the load of operation would be reduced 5 4 saltwater intrusion mitigation effect the saltwater intrusion mitigation effect is verified by using the optimized pumping schedule as inputs to the solute transport model fig 9 a shows chloride concentration distribution through the solute transport model at the end of 10 years without the horizontal scavenger well and fig 9b shows the chloride concentration distribution through the solute transport model at the end of the remediation period in this case the optimal pumping schedule of the horizontal scavenger well is identified through the bma cc approach given the mcl 250 mg l at the confidence level of 90 the ten extraction rates from q 1 to q 10 are 4808 8555 5661 6542 7932 9333 8438 9822 8154 and 9311 m3 d respectively it is observed that the public supply wells eb 630 and eb 1150 have already experienced saltwater intrusion before any remediation strategy when using the horizontal scavenger well the saltwater plume can be retreated and the saltwater encroachment problem can be mitigated to some extent fig 10 presents the chloride concentration variations of the two public supply wells during the remediation period chloride concentrations of the wells are reduced a lot because a large volume of saltwater are extracted from the aquifer hence this remediation design is effective for reducing chloride concentrations and protect the public supply wells from the saltwater intrusion threat generally it can be predicted that with higher mcl criterion less extraction rates are needed to ensure the same probability of meeting the management constraints and hence reduce the saltwater encroachment 6 conclusions the response surface surrogates are proven to be effective to represent the outputs of a time consuming physically based saltwater intrusion model using the regression surrogate models is crucial for considerably reducing computation time in the aquifer remediation design due to massive runs of the groundwater simulation model for this study the computation time using second order polynomial response surface surrogates is at least three orders of magnitude faster than that using the solute transport model without sacrificing accuracy using higher order polynomial response surface surrogates may dramatically increase model complexity while linear response surface surrogates may be too simple and cause significant model errors as a consequence the second order polynomial response surface surrogates are very appealing to our study as the surrogates dramatically reduce the computation burden in optimization without sacrificing modeling accuracy the effectiveness of saltwater scavenging approach depends on reliable chloride concentration prediction this study develops a rigorous simulation optimization framework that utilizes multiple surrogate models for chloride concentration prediction and quantifies uncertainty of using surrogates in saltwater scavenging optimization the aicc based bma predictions may not always outperform all the individual surrogates in the ensemble but this robust approach incorporates multiple models and hence produces relatively reliable chloride concentration predictions the chance constrained cc programming proves to be effective to cope with uncertainty in probabilistic nonlinear chloride constraints the aicc based bma approach in conjunction with ensemble surrogate assisted cc programming provides more reliable optimal saltwater scavenging strategies than those from single surrogate modeling to authors best knowledge this approach has not been previously applied to quantify surrogate model structure and parameter uncertainties in the context of saltwater intrusion mitigation design in this study the gradient based interior point method is highly effective to solve the surrogate assisted optimization problem while none of nonlinear optimization algorithms can guarantee global solutions the optimal solutions derived from the interior point method are sufficient for this study using a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well to extract salty water for a deep aquifer is the first test for urban cities where land properties are generally limited and difficult to obtain for installing multiple wells the complex groundwater model is able to determine a suitable position for the horizontal scavenger well in the aquifer the optimal extraction schedule for the scavenger well is successfully achieved through the proposed framework where the simulation multi surrogate model inference and chance constrained optimization programming are unified the optimal extraction schedule is also verified through the solute transport model that the nonlinear chloride constraints are met acknowledgments the study was supported in part by the louisiana board of regents itrs under award no leqsf 2015 18 rd b 03 the capital area ground water
