23130,in an offshore environment offshore wind energy resources are more available and stable but the investment cost is much higher than that of onshore wind the installation cost is a crucial factor of the investment with the increasing number of planned and approved offshore wind farms offshore wind turbine installation and relevant operations have received tremendous attention therefore expediting the turbine structure mating operations through a higher level of automation in offshore wind turbine installations may provide important economic benefits to achieve a higher automation level and reduce the weather waiting time during the installation of offshore wind turbines a flexible simulation verification framework with high fidelity is needed however state of the art wind turbine numerical analysis code is neither convenient nor open enough for applications concerning the design and verification of control algorithms matlab simulink is among the most widely utilized numerical platforms by control engineers and researchers this paper describes the development of a modularized blade installation simulation toolbox for the purpose of control design in matlab simulink the toolbox can be used to simulate several blade installation configurations both onshore and offshore the paper presents the key features and equations of the different modules exemplified by a single blade installation operation code to code verification results are presented and discussed with both quasi steady wind and three dimensional turbulent wind field keywords offshore installation blade installation simulation model matlab and simulink 1 introduction with the growing interest and need for clean energy wind energy has become increasingly popular in recent years wind turbines are categorized into onshore wind turbines and offshore wind turbines owts based on their installation locations because of their high initial installation and lifespan maintenance costs the price of offshore wind energy remains more than three times higher than onshore wind energy moné et al 2017 installation expenses significantly influence the cost of offshore wind energy hence techniques that can make the owt installation more efficient are of great value for wind turbine blade installation several approaches have been developed for example assembled rotor installation bunny ear configuration and single blade installation are often used kaiser and snyder 2010 zhao et al 2018 kuijken 2015 the selection among these approaches is a trade off among the equipment capacity number of offshore lifting operations weather etc all these factors influence the offshore operational time deck usage and the overall installation cost as the example of this paper single blade installation is a wind turbine blade installation method that is especially suitable for large scale owts as individual lifts of the blades are much easier than maneuvering of a full rotor tower nacelle assembly offshore this method also facilitates deck usage and requires low crane capacity of the installation vessel blades are lifted and mated separately when the weather conditions allow the operation one blade is held by a yoke and lifted by a crane from the deck with the blade root approaching the hub after moving the blade to the mating position at the hub the mating operation proceeds if the blade root motion is limited within a specified range the single blade installation approach provides a more efficient deck utilization and reduces the transportation time for instance by allowing more turbine components to be carried in one trip the disadvantage is that this installation approach typically requires more operation time using state of the art lift equipment the single blade installation approach is only allowed to be conducted up to a mean wind speed of approximately 8 12 m s at the hub height gaunaa et al 2014 hence increasing the weather window for the installation work and making the lifting operation more time efficient will greatly reduce the installation costs research on intelligent marine operations are seeing increasing attention johansen et al 2003 fang et al 2014 skaare and egeland 2006 ren et al 2018 wang et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the typical objectives are to enhance the overall efficiency ensure safety broaden the operating window and ultimately gain economic benefits because single blade installation approach demands large amount of offshore working time the installation cost can be reduced if the mating operations are accelerated by enhancing the automation level for the blade installation system to the best of the authors knowledge no studies have looked into such issues therefore there is an urgent need for highly efficient and user friendly simulation tools for use during the controller design process for marine installations to start a control design for such a complex process as an owt installation a numerical model is surely needed open source matlab simulink toolboxes such as the mss gnc and mss hydro toolboxes perez et al 2006 mss marine systems simulator 2010 and mss marpowsim bø et al 2015 are widely applied for marine control systems e g the dynamic positioning of surface vessels and power management systems however these toolboxes lack modules to model wind turbine installations commercial software for marine operations such as sima marintek 2016 jiang et al 2015 are widely used during analysis and design however their closed source policy and tedious customization of external dynamic link libraries dlls for the design of control systems weaken their applicability to control design and analysis state of the art aeroelastic codes for designing of wind turbines under normal operations including hawc2 larsen and hansen 2007 fast jonkman and buhl 2005 and bladed bossanyi 2009 are based on blade element momentum bem theory complex aerodynamic performances such as blade tip flow wake dynamic inflow and dynamic stall are modeled code to code comprehensive simulations jonkman et al 2008 prove that these codes agree well with each other single blade installation has been studied using hawc2 gaunaa et al 2014 jiang et al 2018 taking hawc2 as an example although they can interface with matlab simulink through tcp ip or use some dlls to implement simple control laws there are disadvantages first setting up the interface and debugging the model are often time consuming furthermore limitations of the supported modules restrict its flexibility and complexity except for the blade during modeling other limitations include fixed time steps and cumbersome user interfaces in addition numerous codes and toolboxes for example wind turbine gearbox haastrup et al 2011 a wind turbine sub model in an in house computational fluid dynamics cfd code hallanger and sand 2013 and a computational aeroelastic tool with the boundary element method calabretta et al 2016 have been developed that are relevant to wind turbine simulations none of these however is able to simulate blade installation this paper presents the development of an open source object oriented simulation verification blade installation modeling toolbox targeting the design and analysis of automation and control functions the code is developed primarily for wind turbine blade installation but it can also be used in related fields with simple modifications the resulting functions and modules are integrated in the marin marine installation toolbox which is under development within the sfi move center at ntnu the modularized code in matlab simulink can be used in place of commercial software with verified numerical correctness the main contributions of this paper are the development of an object oriented matlab simulink based simulation verification toolbox for the blade installation of owts and a verification of the model against the mainstream commercial software hawc2 the

turbulence intensity w wind y yoke 2 blade installation framework 2 1 description of single blade installation in this section a commonly used single blade installation configuration is introduced to help the reader understand the necessary components in the toolbox and the basic ideas utilized during the modeling of such a process the configuration of a single blade lifting operation is depicted in fig 1 in this example a monopile foundation is considered which has been hammered into the seabed the supporting structures including the transition piece tower and hub were assembled subsequently a jackup installation vessel is assumed to be conducting the single blade installation operation the vessel mounted crane is responsible for lifting a blade by wire ropes a lift wire connects the crane tip and the hook and the hook connects to a yoke with slings a turbine blade is held by the yoke and suspended in the air tugger lines connecting the crane boom to the yoke are used to reduce the blade s pendulum motion the crane wire hook blade system is exposed to a windy environment with both a mean wind load and dynamic wind loads when the weather window allows the installation to be conducted the hub is first rotated to the desired orientation such that the flange holes on the hub are ready to mate with the guide pins on the blade root normally horizontally then the blade is lifted from the deck to the hub elevation by controlling the boom winch and corresponding lift wire length afterward the crane is rotated to move the blade horizontally to a position near the final mating point while the blade s motion is monitored if the motion stays within the allowable range the final mating operation is executed by manually inserting the guide pins into the flange holes after bolting the blade and the hub the installation is finished during the mating process if the relative motions between the blade root and hub are too large guide pins can be damaged which causes unnecessary delays visual guidance is needed and banksmen are often used to give orders to the crane operator and to assist the final mating process the need for banksmen poses potential risks in such activities if sensorial or automated guidance can be used to automate the process such risks can be lowered substantially 2 2 model assumptions from the above description the main components of the blade installation process are physical components vessel crane winch lift wires slings tugger lines hook yoke blade environmental components wind turbulence simulator and wind induced loads the proposed toolbox can be applied to simulation of blade installation using either a jackup or a floating vessel to install blades with a jackup is a simplified scenario and the crane boom is fixed in space the simplified configuration is illustrated in fig 2 for a floating installation vessel the real time crane tip position can be calculated by a coordinate transformation of the vessel s position and orientations and the crane configuration because the wind induced loads acting on a blade are substantially smaller than the vessel s inertial and gravity loads the influence of the crane on the vessel is neglected given the light weight of the blade system less than 100 tonnes it is acceptable to assume that the load and load effects on the crane caused by its payload can be disregarded the crane flexibility can be modeled which affects the stiffness of the rigging system and hence the wire tension normally an equivalent stiffness of the wire rope can be used to model the crane flexibility in which the crane flexibility can be considered together with the actual flexibility of the rope remark 1 note that for high fidelity numerical models for engineering design and risk assessment such effects should not be neglected and instead should be considered however for the purpose of control design one can typically reduce the fidelity of the model by disregarding fast stable dynamics to produce a simplified model capturing the most important dynamics the control system with its actuators will typically dominate the loads on the plant and make it behave according to the specified control objective that is also why it is very important to include a realistic model of the control functions when performing detailed analysis of loads and load effects the length of the lift wire is a sum of the wire between the crane winch drum and the crane tip and the wire between the crane tip and the hook two slings connect the hook to the yoke we assume that the crane hook and blade are all rigid bodies and that the yoke mass is located at the blade cog the primary objectives for active turbine installation operations are to stabilize the payloads and to move the payloads with desired trajectories global loads and motion analysis are of importance while the local structural analysis with attention on structural flexibility is disregarded therefore the rigid body dynamics are the focus instead of the bem technique adopted by operational wind turbines the hook dynamics is modeled in 3 degrees of freedom dofs and the blade motion is simulated in 6 dofs the nrel 5 mw reference turbine blade is taken as an example hereafter in this paper jonkman et al 2009 the mass of the yoke is concentrated at the cog of the blade two tugger lines are placed symmetrically about the blade cog on the yoke the other ends of the tugger lines are fixed to the vessel which moves with the vessel lift wires slings and tugger lines are modeled as tensile springs with specific damping coefficients therein merely providing tension with a positive elongation 2 3 toolbox overview with the simplified assumptions the main modules in this toolbox correspond to the vessel crane wire rope hook blade wind generator and wind induced loads the proposed toolbox consists of a framework to simulate the blade installation with a relatively high fidelity for control design purposes the modeling procedure is object oriented therein interconnecting blocks with newton euler mechanics all components should be easy to assemble to achieve different configurations the inputs outputs i o are tabulated in tables a 5 a 10 see appendix c for more details the configuration of an example system is presented in fig 3 the vessel is an optional component for offshore wind turbine blade installation for an installation operation conducted with a floating vessel the position of the crane tip and the ends of the tugger lines are movable for simulating an installation using a jackup vessel rigidly fixed to the seabed the vessel model is skipped and the boundary conditions of the crane tip and the tugger lines are imposed the crane tip and the hook are the ends of a lift wire the restoring force can be calculated based on the elongation and stiffness the same calculations are applied to the slings and the tugger lines the total force acting on the hook is the restoring force from the lift wire and slings by disregarding the wind induced loads the external loads acting on the blade are the wind induced loads and restoring forces from the corresponding connected wires the proposed toolbox is able to model not only single blade installation but also other complex installation configurations with the combination of individual blade modules bunny ear configuration and assembled rotor configurations are realizable by fixing the root end to a hub or rotor which is modeled as a point mass the external wind induced loads acting on the entire payload can then be calculated the latest version of the proposed toolbox can be download as a zip file at https github com ntnu mcs marin 3 coordinate systems and coordinate transformation 3 1 coordinate systems we use the convention that all the coordinate systems follow the right hand rule to sum up the wind induced load the blade is divided into n segments with n 1 nodes along the span the blade root and tip are nodes numbered with 0 and n respectively the wind turbulence data are pre calculated information in a box shape structure where the wind box runs in its length direction four coordinate systems are briefly defined as follows global north east down ned geographic coordinate system n the origin o n is placed on the free sea surface with the x axis pointing to the north y axis pointing to the east and z direction being downward the orientations about the x y and z axes are roll ϕ pitch θ and yaw ψ respectively ned is assumed to be an inertia frame blade body fixed frame b the origin o b is placed at the blade cog the y b axis points from the root center to the tip center in the spanwise direction and the x b axis is directed from the leading edge to the trailing edge in the chordwise direction the angular velocities about the x b y b and z b axes are p q and r respectively note that the y axis is chosen as the longitudinal axis along the blade so that rotation about y results in a blade pitch angle being consistent with the blade pitch during turbine operation aerodynamic frame at node i 0 1 n in the body fixed frame the origin o b i is at the geometric center of the blade i t h cross section the y b i axis shares the same direction as the y b axis the x b axis and z b axis are considered as a combination of a planar translation and a rotation about the y b axis the aerodynamic twist i e the angle between x b i and x b is denoted by θ y i mean wind coordinate system w the origin o w is located at the lower right corner of the wind turbulence box o w is placed at a preset point in n the x w axis points in the wind inflow direction i e the box s length and z w is directed downward i e the box s height the wind velocities in the x w y w and z w axes are u w v w and w w respectively the box orientation about n is constant i e ϕ w θ w and ψ w are constants the ned reference frame is a widely used coordinate system in ocean engineering such as the control of dynamic positioning vessels moored vessels autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and remotely operated vehicles rovs the blade body fixed frame is also called the main body coordinate system the configuration is shown in figs 4 5 the wind shear is not considered for the single blade horizontally positioned the vertical variation in wind speed due to wind profile is not important since the blade vertical movement is limited remark 2 the reference frames b i are only used to compute the aerodynamic loads these frames otherwise do not enter the calculation loop remark 3 euler angles are used to show the rotation relation between the coordinate frames rotations about the fixed x y and z axes are named roll pitch and yaw for the sake of consistency and clarity the roll pitch and yaw are denoted by ϕ θ and ψ respectively regardless of the coordinate systems the variables in the above mentioned reference frames are tabulated in table 1 3 2 transformation between coordinate systems a vector position or translational velocity is transformed between the coordinate systems from b to a by multiplying by the rotation matrix r b a i e 1 v a r b a θ a b v b where v a and v b ℝ 3 are two vectors in a and b θ a b denotes a vector of the euler angles between a and b and the rotation matrix r b a rotates from the coordinate system b expressed by the subscript to the frame a denoted by the superscript the inverse transformation is given by the matrix r b a θ a b 1 r b a θ a b r a b θ a b in this paper the following order is adopted to transform a vector from one frame to another w n b b i the transformations are bidirectional therefore the wind velocity is transformed to the aerodynamic frame to represent the realistic wind induced loads by three transformations i e first from w to n then from n to b and finally from b to b i the relations between the vectors in the above mentioned coordinate systems are tabulated in table 2 the variables r b n and r w n are short for r b n θ b n and r w n θ w n respectively additionally position transformations between the coordinate systems are expressed by 2 b n p r b n p b d b n 3 w n p r w n p w d w n where the distance vectors between the coordinate origins are 4 d b n d n b p o n p o b 5 d w n d n w p o n p o w 6 with p o n x o n y o n z o n p o b x o b y o b z o b a n d p o w x o w y o w z o w 4 ropes winches and hook 4 1 wire rope sling and tugger line the lift wires slings and tugger lines are modeled as tensile springs which only provide tension when the axial elongation is positive the self weight of the rope is disregarded without loss of generality a tensile spring between points a and b with an initial length l a b between points a and b is presented as an example define l a b p a p b where p a and p b ℝ 3 are the positions of the ends of the wire if the mass of the wire rope is negligible the restoring force ren et al 2017 in the global frame f a ℝ 3 is modeled as 7 f a κ δ a b k r δ a b d r d δ a b d t l a b l a b where l a b l a b decomposes the total force into three components in the ned frame the restoring acting coefficient κ is 8 κ δ a b 1 δ a b 0 0 otherwise the axial elongation is 9 δ a b l a b l a b the elastic stiffness of the wire rope k r is a function of its length as well as the characteristics of the wire rope e g material diameter and strand construction given by ren et al 2017 10 k r γ r e a r l 1 where e denotes the young s modulus a r refers to the cross sectional area of the rope and l 1 is the overall initial length of the rope for a lift wire or a tugger line the initial overall length is l 1 l l or l t l a b l 0 where l 0 is the length of the rope between the corresponding winch and pulley which is assumed to be a constant for a sling there is no connected winch i e l 1 l s l a b to sum up 11 l 1 l a b l 0 lift wire tugger line l a b sling a general form of the modified coefficient for a stranded wire γ r is deduced in feyrer 2007 given by 12 γ r i 0 n r z r i cos 3 α r i 1 v r i sin 2 α r i e r i a r i where n r is the number of wire layers counted from the inside with i 0 for the center wire and z r i e r i a r i α r i and v r i are the number of wires in layer i the young s modulus the cross sectional area the lay angle and the poisson ratio of a wire in the i t h wire layer respectively a specific example of eqn 12 is γ r cos 3 α r 1 v r sin 2 α r when all the strands share the same lay angle and poisson ratio the tension on the rope is f r f a according to newton s third law the reaction force at the other end of the rope is 13 f b f a this rope model is implemented in the marin module called lifting equipment wire rope 4 2 winch a winch is connected at the end of a lift wire or a tugger line the winch rotational acceleration is based on the friction external load acting on the wire and the torque input acting on the winch egeland and gravdahl 2002 the external load is positive or zero the winch model is given by 14a l 1 r m ω m 14b ω m 1 j m d m ω m f r r m t m where ω m denotes the angular velocity of the winch motor r m is the radius of the winch motor j m represents the moment of inertia of the winch d m refers to the damping coefficient of the torsional damper and t m is the torque acting on the winch by the motor usually viewed as the control input to the winch this winch dynamics is implemented in the marin module called lifting equipment winch 4 3 hook the hook is modeled as a 3 dof rigid body point all the forces act on the cog the gravity is not negligible therefore the mass of the hook m h should be considered air resistance is negligible the kinetic model of the hook presented in fig 6 is given by newton s second law according to 15a p h v h 15b m h v h g h i 1 n l f l i b i 1 n s f s i a where p h and are the position and velocity vectors of the hook mass center in the global reference n m h diag m h m h m h is the hook mass matrix g h 0 0 m h g is the hook gravity vector n l and n s are the numbers of the connected lift wires and slings and f l i b and f s i a are the restoring forces acting on the hook from the lift wires and slings in n respectively the subscripts a and b are used to distinguish the pair of reacting forces at both ends of a rope to remain consistent the higher points are labeled a and the lower points are labeled b see fig 6 for an illustration this hook dynamics is implemented in the marin module called lifting equipment hook 5 blade dynamics it is assumed that the mass of the yoke concentrates on the cog of the blade and the moment of inertia of yoke is disregarded hence the blade and the yoke are considered as one body hereafter the blade dynamics is the dynamic of the entire blade yoke system 5 1 blade 6dof kinematics the kinematic dynamics for the blade fossen 2011 is given by 16 η b j θ b n ν b 17 j θ b n r b n θ b n 0 3 3 0 3 3 t θ b n where j ℝ 6 6 is a transformation matrix and 18 η b p n θ b n ν b v b ω b this rotation matrix is implemented in the marin module called basic functions euler angles to rotation matrix z y x 5 1 1 blade rotation matrix three euler angles are sufficient to represent an arbitrary rotation in 3d space there are 12 sequences to do this however the rotation matrix is singular when the second orientation equals 90 namely the gamble lock instead of the widely applied roll pitch yaw sequence diebel 2006 the rotation sequence is modified in case of a singularity of the rotation matrix for a blade installation process the yaw angle and pitch angle may practically become 90 in addition it is reasonable to assume that the blade span would not be assembled vertically i e the roll angle would not reach 90 therefore the rotation matrix for the blade is based on a pitch roll yaw sequence and the rotation matrix from the body fixed frame b to the global frame n becomes 19 r b n θ b n r z ψ r x ϕ r y θ c ψ s ψ 0 s ψ c ψ 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 c ϕ s ϕ 0 s ϕ c

b i is defined by 20 r b w i r 0 α 0 where α is the angle of attack aoa of the dashed airfoil outline without aerodynamic twist θ y i shown in fig 5 the details will be presented in the following remark 4 note that the rotation matrix r b w i here is not for a coordinate transformation it is responsible for transforming the wind induced forces i e the drag force and the lift force to the body fixed frame b the superscript w i here is another coordinate used to express the lift force and drag force because it only appears once the formal definition is omitted to keep the paper clear and short 5 1 2 angular updating rate the matrix t θ b n transforms the body fixed angular velocity to the euler angle update rate given by 21 t θ b n 1 θ b n 0 θ 0 r y θ ϕ 0 0 r y θ r x ϕ 0 0 ψ removing θ b n from both sides yields 22 t θ b n 1 c θ 0 c ϕ s θ 0 1 s ϕ s θ 0 c ϕ c θ hence 23 t θ b n c θ 0 s θ t ϕ s θ 1 c θ t ϕ s θ c ϕ 0 c θ c ϕ remark 5 note that this update law will cause drift because t θ b n is only a first order approximation diebel 2006 however the drift is small with restoring forces acting on the payload hence this simplification is suitable for control design 5 2 blade kinetics a turbine blade is free to move in 6 dofs assume that the yoke and the blade are rigidly fixed to each other the yoke cog coincides with the blade cog as a single body we disregard the moment of inertia of the yoke while the air resistance is included in the relative motion of the wind load the overall kinetics of the blade and yoke in b about its cog is given by 24 m b ν b c b ν b ν b g b b τ s b τ t b τ w b where g b b ℝ 6 is the gravity force and moment vector in b i e 25 g b b r b n 0 0 m b m y g τ s b τ t b and τ w b ℝ 6 are the external load vectors from slings and tugger lines and wind induced loads in b i e 26 τ s b i 1 n s r b n f s i b s p s i b p c o g b r b n f s i b 27 τ t b i 1 n t r b n f t i b s p t i b p c o g b r b n f t i b where p s i b and p t i b are the positions of the connecting points of the slings and tugger lines respectively the mass matrix is 28 m b m b m y i 3 0 3 0 3 i b where m b is the mass of the blade m y is the mass of the yoke and i b ℝ 3 3 is the inertia matrix the mass of the blade m b is given by 29 m b i 0 n m b i i 0 n ρ b i δ l b i where ρ b i is the mass per unit length at the i t h node 30 δ l b i 1 2 r b 1 r b 0 i 0 1 2 r b i 1 r b i 1 i 1 n 1 1 2 r b n r b n 1 i n in which r b i with i 0 n denotes the axial distance from the position of the i t h node to the blade root center for a vector λ λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 ℝ 3 the matrix s λ fossen 2011 in eqns 26 and 27 is given by 31 s λ 0 λ 3 λ 2 λ 3 0 λ 1 λ 2 λ 1 0 the coriolis matrix fossen 2011 then becomes 32 c b c b m b m y s ω b 0 3 0 3 s i b ω b the blade dynamics is implemented in the marin module called payload suspended blade 5 3 wind field unlike an operational turbine the wind induced motion to the different sections of the blade is small when calculating the aerodynamic loads the blade is assumed to be divided into a group of n small segments with n 1 nodes enumerated from 0 to n the total wind induced load to the blade is basically the integration of local two dimensional elemental loads acting along the span according to the cross flow principle during a single blade installation the wind induced loads are the main external disturbance because the lengths of the blade are often greater than 60 m for a 5 mw turbine a time varying wind velocity should be considered the wind load limits the weather window therefore uniform wind is not sufficient to calculate the wind induced load in this case the wind velocity at a point in space x y z at time t denoted by v w x y z t is the sum of the mean wind speed and the turbulence i e 33 v w x y z t v w r w n t v t i x y z t where v w t r w n u w t 0 0 is the mean wind velocity vector in n u w is the mean wind speed and v t i x y z t is the spatio temporal turbulence velocity at x y z 5 3 1 wind turbulence the taylor s hypothesis of frozen turbulence is adopted and assumes that the advection of a field of turbulence past a fixed point can be taken to be entirely due to the mean flow as the contribution from the turbulent circulation is small this only holds if the relative turbulence intensity t i is small that is u e u w 1 where u e refers to the eddy velocity a turbulence box is assumed in a space with evenly distributed points inside that moves with the mean wind speed u w in the length direction i e x w axis the size of the turbulence box is n w x n w y n w z with intervals d w x d w y and d w z along the corresponding axes where n w x n w y and n w z are the numbers of points in the x w y w and z w axes respectively mann 1998 the wind turbulence boxes are generated by importing and reshaping the binary files from turbsim kelley and jonkman 2006 jonkman and kilcher 2012 with preset discrete points along the length width and height turbsim is a free stochastic turbulence simulator turbsim 2017 additionally the binary turbulence file generated by hawc2 is also supported according to a rule of thumb in aeroelastic simulations the grid sizes are chosen to be smaller than the blade root diameter in order to capture the effects of wind speed variation of the turbulent wind field on the blade loads a blade is a smooth interpolation of a number of cross sections the position of a point in n is transformed to the position in w to remain consistent the wind force is considered to act on the center of pressure c 1 4 based on the wind velocity at c 1 4 the position of c 1 4 at the i t h cross section in n is defined by p c 1 4 i x c 1 4 i y c 1 4 i z c 1 4 i the wind velocity vector at the i t h node in n v w i p c 1 4 i t u w i v w i w w i is interpolated by a 3d lookup table with the following relation 34 v w i r w n u w 0 0 ω x m a n n w p c 1 4 i w t ω y m a n n w p c 1 4 i w t ω z m a n n w p c 1 4 i w t with 35 p c 1 4 i w x c 1 4 i t 0 t u w τ d τ x o w y c 1 4 i t y o w z c 1 4 i t z o w where ω x m a n n w ω y m a n n w and ω z m a n n w are the generated turbulence boxes for the x w y w and z w directions respectively this turbulence is implemented in the marin module called environment 3d wind generator with turbulence 5 3 2 wind induced loads acting on a blade a centerline is defined in the main body coordinate system because the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine blade does not have a prebend the centerline is almost a straight line the aerodynamic center c 1 2 of a cross section lays on the centerline with a rotation θ y i about the y b axis in the main body x b z b coordinate plane the centerline connects all c 1 2 from the blade root to the blade tip the root is defined using a circular shape the shape of the main blade body is a series of airfoils with various chord lengths geometric centers and thickness chord ratios t c define t c i t i c i where c i and are the chord length and the maximum thickness of the i t h airfoil section in a quasi steady analysis the aerodynamic coefficients are a function of the aoa and t c the structural parameters and aerodynamic coefficients can be obtained by interpolation though data from the reference turbine the aerodynamic load calculation is based on the following assumptions rigid structure blade vibration is negligible vertex shedding or dynamic stall can be ignored the lift force drag force and pitching moment acting on the i t h node denoted by l i d i and m i are calculated with airfoil theory anderson 2010 and an integration along the span this gives 36 l i 1 2 ρ a c l α i t c i a i v i 2 37 d i 1 2 ρ a c d α i t c i a i v i 2 38 m i 1 2 ρ a c m α i t c i a i v i 2 where the subscript i refers to the i t h node ρ a is the air density and c l c d and c m denote the lifting coefficient the drag coefficient and the pitching moment coefficient respectively the inflow speed is v i l r n b i v w i v c 1 4 i where l 1 0 0 0 0 1 and v c 1 4 i are the velocity vector of the i t h center of pressure in n respectively note that the relative velocity here contributes to the air resistance the wing area is 39 a i r b 1 r b 0 c 1 2 if i 0 r b i r b n 1 c n 2 if i n r b i r b i 1 c i 2 r b i 1 r b i c i 1 2 otherwise the aoa at the i t h segment α i is given by 40 α i α θ y i with 41 α f a π atan 2 w w i b w c 1 4 b u w i b u c 1

velocity at the i t h blade segment center in b for small α i in the range 45 45 deg a series of aerodynamic coefficients w r t the aoa has been calculated and stored in a lookup table for high α i in the ranges 180 45 and 45 180 deg the aerodynamic coefficients are calculated as flat plates which are given by 42a c l α i t c i 2 cos α i sin α i 42b c d α i t c i c d t c i sin 2 α i 42c c m α i t c

w i b m w i b these wind induced loads are implemented in the marin module called payload wind induced load acting on the blade 6 code to code verification of the blade model with quasi static analysis in this section a series of code to code verification tests are conducted to verify that the proposed code models the blade with realistic parameters and coefficients the tests are conducted using the hawc2 and matlab simulink with the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine the aerodynamic coefficients are read from the hawc2 dat file to obtain the same wind loads and perform a fair comparison study a brief summary of the blade is tabulated in table 3 in the simulations of this section the wind velocity is constant without turbulence in the next section we will introduce turbulence and conduct testing with more realistic wind loads 6 1 test 1 mass and moment of inertia the mass the moment of inertia and the cog position are calculated by a user defined function init blade hawc2 the function reads the structural coefficients from hawc2 files this test attempts to verify that the function init blade hawc2 reads the correct parameters from the hawc2 data files and calculates the correct mass matrix and cog position the results are tabulated in table 4 from the results the init blade hawc2 function outputs are close to those from hawc2 6 2 test 2 aerodynamic coefficient lookup tables due to the rotation of the centerline and axial varying thickness the aerodynamic coefficients along the blade span are also varied the init blade hawc2 function reads the aerodynamic coefficients to construct lookup tables for the aerodynamic force modules for the nrel 5 mw reference turbine blade the resulting aerodynamic coefficients w r t blade aoa and t c are shown in figs 7 9 the curves agree with the results in ref jonkman et al 2009 therefore the init blade hawc2 function is accepted to correctly read the aerodynamic coefficients from the hawc2 data files 6 3 test 3 aerodynamic coefficients and force along the blade axis we conducted tests to verify the wind induced load acting on the blade with respect to different wind speeds roll angles and yaw angles i e the algorithm proposed in section 5 3 2 the blade is fixed at 90 m above the sea surface with ψ 0 deg and ψ 30 deg respectively the horizontal wind speed at the height of 90 m is 10 m s in the global negative x direction the pitch angle is set to 10 30 50 60 and 90 the wind speeds up during the first 20 s and the results are the corresponding values at 100 s for the hawc2 model the wind induced load quadratically increases with a slight delay at the later stage after the wind speed reaches a steady value the wind induced load is constant the proposed model calculates the wind load quadratically according to the wind speed the aerodynamic coefficients and forces are illustrated at various spanwise cross planes as shown in figs 10 13 in the figures curves from the hawc2 and the proposed simulink model agree well therefore the results confirm that the simulink module calculates the aerodynamic coefficients and force correctly 6 4 test 4 total wind induced load acting on the blade the total load acting on the blade is tested with respect to various wind speeds and blade pitch angles the wind speed is from 0 to 20 m s with a 1 m s interval the pitch angle is from 10 to 90 with a 10 deg interval the blade yaw is 0 i e the wind loads are at their maxima in this situation the resulting forces at the steady states are presented in fig 14 from the results it is noticed that the wind generated forces f x and f z are well fitted and are proportional to the square of the mean wind speed this observation corresponds well with gaunaa et al 2014 deviations between the hawc2 and the proposed model occur in the subplot f y this is because of the different mechanics used in simulation that is timoshenko beam elements in hawc2 and the rigid body with assumed zero sway force in the proposed model comparing with the magnitudes of f x and f z the deviation in f y is very small and considered negligible for the intended use of our model the same issue appears in simulations with ψ 30 whose results are presented in fig 15 7 case study single blade installation model after confirming the performance of each module individually the overall single blade installation model is built a single blade installation is performed with a yoke that grabs and holds the blade around the center of gravity the yoke is lifted by lift wires from a crane and stabilized by tugger lines symmetrically arranged around the cog on the blade axis the model is to a certain degree of low fidelity due to the lack of complex aerodynamic effects this increases the run time performance of the model while maintaining the most important dynamic effects for the purposes of control design and analysis 7 1 modeling procedure all modules and basic functions are packaged as an individual package of marin toolbox which will be integrated into marin in the future see fig 16 the single blade installation model presented in figs b 22 b 23 is given as an example of the use of this toolbox newton euler mechanics is used to connect the modules in the inflow direction 7 2 test 5 equilibrium point in steady wind first tests concerning the equilibrium points in an environment with constant wind speed are conducted for the nonrotating blade studied under a constant wind speed the displacements of the root center the cog and the tip center around their equilibrium positions approximately follow a quadratic relation with the wind speed this observation is aligned with gaunaa et al 2014 jiang et al 2018 the position of the crane and the lengths of all the wire ropes are fixed the blade leading edge is downward i e the pitch angle is equal to 90 and θ b n 0 0 π 2 0 the mean wind direction is in the x axis i e θ w n 0 0 0 a constant wind speed starts acting on the blade with a 5 s ramp increasing the results are presented in figs 17 and 18 the displacements of the root center cog and tip center all satisfy quadratic relations 7 3 test 6 time domain simulation with wind turbulence in practical situations the wind speed is not constant therefore a complex turbulent wind field is used in the simulation the external loads are caused by the wind field with spatio temporal turbulence see jiang et al 2018 for more details the mean wind speed is set to 12 m s and t i 0 146 the seed number is set to 94 the simulations are conducted with a personal computer with an intel core i7 3 6 ghz cpu using matlab version r2017b the solver in simulink is more powerful and flexible than aerodynamic software a variable step size and the maximum step size can be set to ensure both accuracy and efficiency for a 1000 s simulation the average computation time is 710 s therefore the proposed simulation model is fast enough for the simulation the histories of the blade root position cog position and tip position are presented in figs 19 21 as shown the motions in the x direction are dominant and the pendulum mode 0 1 hz of the blade system is visible in the time series of the blade root under the turbulent wind condition the blade root and the blade tip experience significantly larger motions compared to the blade cog for the blade root the displacement has a 553 6 increase in x 152 0 increase in y and 2482 2 increase in z the motion at the blade tip is even larger whose displacement experiences a 823 3 increase in x 303 1 increase in y 4701 1 increase in z 8

23130,in an offshore environment offshore wind energy resources are more available and stable but the investment cost is much higher than that of onshore wind the installation cost is a crucial factor of the investment with the increasing number of planned and approved offshore wind farms offshore wind turbine installation and relevant operations have received tremendous attention therefore expediting the turbine structure mating operations through a higher level of automation in offshore wind turbine installations may provide important economic benefits to achieve a higher automation level and reduce the weather waiting time during the installation of offshore wind turbines a flexible simulation verification framework with high fidelity is needed however state of the art wind turbine numerical analysis code is neither convenient nor open enough for applications concerning the design and verification of control algorithms matlab simulink is among the most widely utilized numerical platforms by control engineers and researchers this paper describes the development of a modularized blade installation simulation toolbox for the purpose of control design in matlab simulink the toolbox can be used to simulate several blade installation configurations both onshore and offshore the paper presents the key features and equations of the different modules exemplified by a single blade installation operation code to code verification results are presented and discussed with both quasi steady wind and three dimensional turbulent wind field keywords offshore installation blade installation simulation model matlab and simulink 1 introduction with the growing interest and need for clean energy wind energy has become increasingly popular in recent years wind turbines are categorized into onshore wind turbines and offshore wind turbines owts based on their installation locations because of their high initial installation and lifespan maintenance costs the price of offshore wind energy remains more than three times higher than onshore wind energy moné et al 2017 installation expenses significantly influence the cost of offshore wind energy hence techniques that can make the owt installation more efficient are of great value for wind turbine blade installation several approaches have been developed for example assembled rotor installation bunny ear configuration and single blade installation are often used kaiser and snyder 2010 zhao et al 2018 kuijken 2015 the selection among these approaches is a trade off among the equipment capacity number of offshore lifting operations weather etc all these factors influence the offshore operational time deck usage and the overall installation cost as the example of this paper single blade installation is a wind turbine blade installation method that is especially suitable for large scale owts as individual lifts of the blades are much easier than maneuvering of a full rotor tower nacelle assembly offshore this method also facilitates deck usage and requires low crane capacity of the installation vessel blades are lifted and mated separately when the weather conditions allow the operation one blade is held by a yoke and lifted by a crane from the deck with the blade root approaching the hub after moving the blade to the mating position at the hub the mating operation proceeds if the blade root motion is limited within a specified range the single blade installation approach provides a more efficient deck utilization and reduces the transportation time for instance by allowing more turbine components to be carried in one trip the disadvantage is that this installation approach typically requires more operation time using state of the art lift equipment the single blade installation approach is only allowed to be conducted up to a mean wind speed of approximately 8 12 m s at the hub height gaunaa et al 2014 hence increasing the weather window for the installation work and making the lifting operation more time efficient will greatly reduce the installation costs research on intelligent marine operations are seeing increasing attention johansen et al 2003 fang et al 2014 skaare and egeland 2006 ren et al 2018 wang et al 2018 tian et al 2018 the typical objectives are to enhance the overall efficiency ensure safety broaden the operating window and ultimately gain economic benefits because single blade installation approach demands large amount of offshore working time the installation cost can be reduced if the mating operations are accelerated by enhancing the automation level for the blade installation system to the best of the authors knowledge no studies have looked into such issues therefore there is an urgent need for highly efficient and user friendly simulation tools for use during the controller design process for marine installations to start a control design for such a complex process as an owt installation a numerical model is surely needed open source matlab simulink toolboxes such as the mss gnc and mss hydro toolboxes perez et al 2006 mss marine systems simulator 2010 and mss marpowsim bø et al 2015 are widely applied for marine control systems e g the dynamic positioning of surface vessels and power management systems however these toolboxes lack modules to model wind turbine installations commercial software for marine operations such as sima marintek 2016 jiang et al 2015 are widely used during analysis and design however their closed source policy and tedious customization of external dynamic link libraries dlls for the design of control systems weaken their applicability to control design and analysis state of the art aeroelastic codes for designing of wind turbines under normal operations including hawc2 larsen and hansen 2007 fast jonkman and buhl 2005 and bladed bossanyi 2009 are based on blade element momentum bem theory complex aerodynamic performances such as blade tip flow wake dynamic inflow and dynamic stall are modeled code to code comprehensive simulations jonkman et al 2008 prove that these codes agree well with each other single blade installation has been studied using hawc2 gaunaa et al 2014 jiang et al 2018 taking hawc2 as an example although they can interface with matlab simulink through tcp ip or use some dlls to implement simple control laws there are disadvantages first setting up the interface and debugging the model are often time consuming furthermore limitations of the supported modules restrict its flexibility and complexity except for the blade during modeling other limitations include fixed time steps and cumbersome user interfaces in addition numerous codes and toolboxes for example wind turbine gearbox haastrup et al 2011 a wind turbine sub model in an in house computational fluid dynamics cfd code hallanger and sand 2013 and a computational aeroelastic tool with the boundary element method calabretta et al 2016 have been developed that are relevant to wind turbine simulations none of these however is able to simulate blade installation this paper presents the development of an open source object oriented simulation verification blade installation modeling toolbox targeting the design and analysis of automation and control functions the code is developed primarily for wind turbine blade installation but it can also be used in related fields with simple modifications the resulting functions and modules are integrated in the marin marine installation toolbox which is under development within the sfi move center at ntnu the modularized code in matlab simulink can be used in place of commercial software with verified numerical correctness the main contributions of this paper are the development of an object oriented matlab simulink based simulation verification toolbox for the blade installation of owts and a verification of the model against the mainstream commercial software hawc2 the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the problem formulation and development guidelines are proposed in section 3 relevant coordinate systems and coordinate transformations are introduced the models of the wire ropes winches and hook are presented in section 4 the blade dynamics wind velocity with turbulence model and wind induced loads are presented in section 5 code to code verification

turbulence intensity w wind y yoke 2 blade installation framework 2 1 description of single blade installation in this section a commonly used single blade installation configuration is introduced to help the reader understand the necessary components in the toolbox and the basic ideas utilized during the modeling of such a process the configuration of a single blade lifting operation is depicted in fig 1 in this example a monopile foundation is considered which has been hammered into the seabed the supporting structures including the transition piece tower and hub were assembled subsequently a jackup installation vessel is assumed to be conducting the single blade installation operation the vessel mounted crane is responsible for lifting a blade by wire ropes a lift wire connects the crane tip and the hook and the hook connects to a yoke with slings a turbine blade is held by the yoke and suspended in the air tugger lines connecting the crane boom to the yoke are used to reduce the blade s pendulum motion the crane wire hook blade system is exposed to a windy environment with both a mean wind load and dynamic wind loads when the weather window allows the installation to be conducted the hub is first rotated to the desired orientation such that the flange holes on the hub are ready to mate with the guide pins on the blade root normally horizontally then the blade is lifted from the deck to the hub elevation by controlling the boom winch and corresponding lift wire length afterward the crane is rotated to move the blade horizontally to a position near the final mating point while the blade s motion is monitored if the motion stays within the allowable range the final mating operation is executed by manually inserting the guide pins into the flange holes after bolting the blade and the hub the installation is finished during the mating process if the relative motions between the blade root and hub are too large guide pins can be damaged which causes unnecessary delays visual guidance is needed and banksmen are often used to give orders to the crane operator and to assist the final mating process the need for banksmen poses potential risks in such activities if sensorial or automated guidance can be used to automate the process such risks can be lowered substantially 2 2 model assumptions from the above description the main components of the blade installation process are physical components vessel crane winch lift wires slings tugger lines hook yoke blade environmental components wind turbulence simulator and wind induced loads the proposed toolbox can be applied to simulation of blade installation using either a jackup or a floating vessel to install blades with a jackup is a simplified scenario and the crane boom is fixed in space the simplified configuration is illustrated in fig 2 for a floating installation vessel the real time crane tip position can be calculated by a coordinate transformation of the vessel s position and orientations and the crane configuration because the wind induced loads acting on a blade are substantially smaller than the vessel s inertial and gravity loads the influence of the crane on the vessel is neglected given the light weight of the blade system less than 100 tonnes it is acceptable to assume that the load and load effects on the crane caused by its payload can be disregarded the crane flexibility can be modeled which affects the stiffness of the rigging system and hence the wire tension normally an equivalent stiffness of the wire rope can be used to model the crane flexibility in which the crane flexibility can be considered together with the actual flexibility of the rope remark 1 note that for high fidelity numerical models for engineering design and risk assessment such effects should not be neglected and instead should be considered however for the purpose of control design one can typically reduce the fidelity of the model by disregarding fast stable dynamics to produce a simplified model capturing the most important dynamics the control system with its actuators will typically dominate the loads on the plant and make it behave according to the specified control objective that is also why it is very important to include a realistic model of the control functions when performing detailed analysis of loads and load effects the length of the lift wire is a sum of the wire between the crane winch drum and the crane tip and the wire between the crane tip and the hook two slings connect the hook to the yoke we assume that the crane hook and blade are all rigid bodies and that the yoke mass is located at the blade cog the primary objectives for active turbine installation operations are to stabilize the payloads and to move the payloads with desired trajectories global loads and motion analysis are of importance while the local structural analysis with attention on structural flexibility is disregarded therefore the rigid body dynamics are the focus instead of the bem technique adopted by operational wind turbines the hook dynamics is modeled in 3 degrees of freedom dofs and the blade motion is simulated in 6 dofs the nrel 5 mw reference turbine blade is taken as an example hereafter in this paper jonkman et al 2009 the mass of the yoke is concentrated at the cog of the blade two tugger lines are placed symmetrically about the blade cog on the yoke the other ends of the tugger lines are fixed to the vessel which moves with the vessel lift wires slings and tugger lines are modeled as tensile springs with specific damping coefficients therein merely providing tension with a positive elongation 2 3 toolbox overview with the simplified assumptions the main modules in this toolbox correspond to the vessel crane wire rope hook blade wind generator and wind induced loads the proposed toolbox consists of a framework to simulate the blade installation with a relatively high fidelity for control design purposes the modeling procedure is object oriented therein interconnecting blocks with newton euler mechanics all components should be easy to assemble to achieve different configurations the inputs outputs i o are tabulated in tables a 5 a 10 see appendix c for more details the configuration of an example system is presented in fig 3 the vessel is an optional component for offshore wind turbine blade installation for an installation operation conducted with a floating vessel the position of the crane tip and the ends of the tugger lines are movable for simulating an installation using a jackup vessel rigidly fixed to the seabed the vessel model is skipped and the boundary conditions of the crane tip and the tugger lines are imposed the crane tip and the hook are the ends of a lift wire the restoring force can be calculated based on the elongation and stiffness the same calculations are applied to the slings and the tugger lines the total force acting on the hook is the restoring force from the lift wire and slings by disregarding the wind induced loads the external loads acting on the blade are the wind induced loads and restoring forces from the corresponding connected wires the proposed toolbox is able to model not only single blade installation but also other complex installation configurations with the combination of individual blade modules bunny ear configuration and assembled rotor configurations are realizable by fixing the root end to a hub or rotor which is modeled as a point mass the external wind induced loads acting on the entire payload can then be calculated the latest version of the proposed toolbox can be download as a zip file at https github com ntnu mcs marin 3 coordinate systems and coordinate transformation 3 1 coordinate systems we use the convention that all the coordinate systems follow the right hand rule to sum up the wind induced load the blade is divided into n segments with n 1 nodes along the span the blade root and tip are nodes numbered with 0 and n respectively the wind turbulence data are pre calculated information in a box shape structure where the wind box runs in its length direction four coordinate systems are briefly defined as follows global north east down ned geographic coordinate system n the origin o n is placed on the free sea surface with the x axis pointing to the north y axis pointing to the east and z direction being downward the orientations about the x y and z axes are roll ϕ pitch θ and yaw ψ respectively ned is assumed to be an inertia frame blade body fixed frame b the origin o b is placed at the blade cog the y b axis points from the root center to the tip center in the spanwise direction and the x b axis is directed from the leading edge to the trailing edge in the chordwise direction the angular velocities about the x b y b and z b axes are p q and r respectively note that the y axis is chosen as the longitudinal axis along the blade so that rotation about y results in a blade pitch angle being consistent with the blade pitch during turbine operation aerodynamic frame at node i 0 1 n in the body fixed frame the origin o b i is at the geometric center of the blade i t h cross section the y b i axis shares the same direction as the y b axis the x b axis and z b axis are considered as a combination of a planar translation and a rotation about the y b axis the aerodynamic twist i e the angle between x b i and x b is denoted by θ y i mean wind coordinate system w the origin o w is located at the lower right corner of the wind turbulence box o w is placed at a preset point in n the x w axis points in the wind inflow direction i e the box s length and z w is directed downward i e the box s height the wind velocities in the x w y w and z w axes are u w v w and w w respectively the box orientation about n is constant i e ϕ w θ w and ψ w are constants the ned reference frame is a widely used coordinate system in ocean engineering such as the control of dynamic positioning vessels moored vessels autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and remotely operated vehicles rovs the blade body fixed frame is also called the main body coordinate system the configuration is shown in figs 4 5 the wind shear is not considered for the single blade horizontally positioned the vertical variation in wind speed due to wind profile is not important since the blade vertical movement is limited remark 2 the reference frames b i are only used to compute the aerodynamic loads these frames otherwise do not enter the calculation loop remark 3 euler angles are used to show the rotation relation between the coordinate frames rotations about the fixed x y and z axes are named roll pitch and yaw for the sake of consistency and clarity the roll pitch and yaw are denoted by ϕ θ and ψ respectively regardless of the coordinate systems the variables in the above mentioned reference frames are tabulated in table 1 3 2 transformation between coordinate systems a vector position or translational velocity is transformed between the coordinate systems from b to a by multiplying by the rotation matrix r b a i e 1 v a r b a θ a b v b where v a and v b ℝ 3 are two vectors in a and b θ a b denotes a vector of the euler angles between a and b and the rotation matrix r b a rotates from the coordinate system b expressed by the subscript to the frame a denoted by the superscript the inverse transformation is given by the matrix r b a θ a b 1 r b a θ a b r a b θ a b in this paper the following order is adopted to transform a vector from one frame to another w n b b i the transformations are bidirectional therefore the wind velocity is transformed to the aerodynamic frame to represent the realistic wind induced loads by three transformations i e first from w to n then from n to b and finally from b to b i the relations between the vectors in the above mentioned coordinate systems are tabulated in table 2 the variables r b n and r w n are short for r b n θ b n and r w n θ w n respectively additionally position transformations between the coordinate systems are expressed by 2 b n p r b n p b d b n 3 w n p r w n p w d w n where the distance vectors between the coordinate origins are 4 d b n d n b p o n p o b 5 d w n d n w p o n p o w 6 with p o n x o n y o n z o n p o b x o b y o b z o b a n d p o w x o w y o w z o w 4 ropes winches and hook 4 1 wire rope sling and tugger line the lift wires slings and tugger lines are modeled as tensile springs which only provide tension when the axial elongation is positive the self weight of the rope is disregarded without loss of generality a tensile spring between points a and b with an initial length l a b between points a and b is presented as an example define l a b p a p b where p a and p b ℝ 3 are the positions of the ends of the wire if the mass of the wire rope is negligible the restoring force ren et al 2017 in the global frame f a ℝ 3 is modeled as 7 f a κ δ a b k r δ a b d r d δ a b d t l a b l a b where l a b l a b decomposes the total force into three components in the ned frame the restoring acting coefficient κ is 8 κ δ a b 1 δ a b 0 0 otherwise the axial elongation is 9 δ a b l a b l a b the elastic stiffness of the wire rope k r is a function of its length as well as the characteristics of the wire rope e g material diameter and strand construction given by ren et al 2017 10 k r γ r e a r l 1 where e denotes the young s modulus a r refers to the cross sectional area of the rope and l 1 is the overall initial length of the rope for a lift wire or a tugger line the initial overall length is l 1 l l or l t l a b l 0 where l 0 is the length of the rope between the corresponding winch and pulley which is assumed to be a constant for a sling there is no connected winch i e l 1 l s l a b to sum up 11 l 1 l a b l 0 lift wire tugger line l a b sling a general form of the modified coefficient for a stranded wire γ r is deduced in feyrer 2007 given by 12 γ r i 0 n r z r i cos 3 α r i 1 v r i sin 2 α r i e r i a r i where n r is the number of wire layers counted from the inside with i 0 for the center wire and z r i e r i a r i α r i and v r i are the number of wires in layer i the young s modulus the cross sectional area the lay angle and the poisson ratio of a wire in the i t h wire layer respectively a specific example of eqn 12 is γ r cos 3 α r 1 v r sin 2 α r when all the strands share the same lay angle and poisson ratio the tension on the rope is f r f a according to newton s third law the reaction force at the other end of the rope is 13 f b f a this rope model is implemented in the marin module called lifting equipment wire rope 4 2 winch a winch is connected at the end of a lift wire or a tugger line the winch rotational acceleration is based on the friction external load acting on the wire and the torque input acting on the winch egeland and gravdahl 2002 the external load is positive or zero the winch model is given by 14a l 1 r m ω m 14b ω m 1 j m d m ω m f r r m t m where ω m denotes the angular velocity of the winch motor r m is the radius of the winch motor j m represents the moment of inertia of the winch d m refers to the damping coefficient of the torsional damper and t m is the torque acting on the winch by the motor usually viewed as the control input to the winch this winch dynamics is implemented in the marin module called lifting equipment winch 4 3 hook the hook is modeled as a 3 dof rigid body point all the forces act on the cog the gravity is not negligible therefore the mass of the hook m h should be considered air resistance is negligible the kinetic model of the hook presented in fig 6 is given by newton s second law according to 15a p h v h 15b m h v h g h i 1 n l f l i b i 1 n s f s i a where p h and are the position and velocity vectors of the hook mass center in the global reference n m h diag m h m h m h is the hook mass matrix g h 0 0 m h g is the hook gravity vector n l and n s are the numbers of the connected lift wires and slings and f l i b and f s i a are the restoring forces acting on the hook from the lift wires and slings in n respectively the subscripts a and b are used to distinguish the pair of reacting forces at both ends of a rope to remain consistent the higher points are labeled a and the lower points are labeled b see fig 6 for an illustration this hook dynamics is implemented in the marin module called lifting equipment hook 5 blade dynamics it is assumed that the mass of the yoke concentrates on the cog of the blade and the moment of inertia of yoke is disregarded hence the blade and the yoke are considered as one body hereafter the blade dynamics is the dynamic of the entire blade yoke system 5 1 blade 6dof kinematics the kinematic dynamics for the blade fossen 2011 is given by 16 η b j θ b n ν b 17 j θ b n r b n θ b n 0 3 3 0 3 3 t θ b n where j ℝ 6 6 is a transformation matrix and 18 η b p n θ b n ν b v b ω b this rotation matrix is implemented in the marin module called basic functions euler angles to rotation matrix z y x 5 1 1 blade rotation matrix three euler angles are sufficient to represent an arbitrary rotation in 3d space there are 12 sequences to do this however the rotation matrix is singular when the second orientation equals 90 namely the gamble lock instead of the widely applied roll pitch yaw sequence diebel 2006 the rotation sequence is modified in case of a singularity of the rotation matrix for a blade installation process the yaw angle and pitch angle may practically become 90 in addition it is reasonable to assume that the blade span would not be assembled vertically i e the roll angle would not reach 90 therefore the rotation matrix for the blade is based on a pitch roll yaw sequence and the rotation matrix from the body fixed frame b to the global frame n becomes 19 r b n θ b n r z ψ r x ϕ r y θ c ψ s ψ 0 s ψ c ψ 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 c ϕ s ϕ 0 s ϕ c

b i is defined by 20 r b w i r 0 α 0 where α is the angle of attack aoa of the dashed airfoil outline without aerodynamic twist θ y i shown in fig 5 the details will be presented in the following remark 4 note that the rotation matrix r b w i here is not for a coordinate transformation it is responsible for transforming the wind induced forces i e the drag force and the lift force to the body fixed frame b the superscript w i here is another coordinate used to express the lift force and drag force because it only appears once the formal definition is omitted to keep the paper clear and short 5 1 2 angular updating rate the matrix t θ b n transforms the body fixed angular velocity to the euler angle update rate given by 21 t θ b n 1 θ b n 0 θ 0 r y θ ϕ 0 0 r y θ r x ϕ 0 0 ψ removing θ b n from both sides yields 22 t θ b n 1 c θ 0 c ϕ s θ 0 1 s ϕ s θ 0 c ϕ c θ hence 23 t θ b n c θ 0 s θ t ϕ s θ 1 c θ t ϕ s θ c ϕ 0 c θ c ϕ remark 5 note that this update law will cause drift because t θ b n is only a first order approximation diebel 2006 however the drift is small with restoring forces acting on the payload hence this simplification is suitable for control design 5 2 blade kinetics a turbine blade is free to move in 6 dofs assume that the yoke and the blade are rigidly fixed to each other the yoke cog coincides with the blade cog as a single body we disregard the moment of inertia of the yoke while the air resistance is included in the relative motion of the wind load the overall kinetics of the blade and yoke in b about its cog is given by 24 m b ν b c b ν b ν b g b b τ s b τ t b τ w b where g b b ℝ 6 is the gravity force and moment vector in b i e 25 g b b r b n 0 0 m b m y g τ s b τ t b and τ w b ℝ 6 are the external load vectors from slings and tugger lines and wind induced loads in b i e 26 τ s b i 1 n s r b n f s i b s p s i b p c o g b r b n f s i b 27 τ t b i 1 n t r b n f t i b s p t i b p c o g b r b n f t i b where p s i b and p t i b are the positions of the connecting points of the slings and tugger lines respectively the mass matrix is 28 m b m b m y i 3 0 3 0 3 i b where m b is the mass of the blade m y is the mass of the yoke and i b ℝ 3 3 is the inertia matrix the mass of the blade m b is given by 29 m b i 0 n m b i i 0 n ρ b i δ l b i where ρ b i is the mass per unit length at the i t h node 30 δ l b i 1 2 r b 1 r b 0 i 0 1 2 r b i 1 r b i 1 i 1 n 1 1 2 r b n r b n 1 i n in which r b i with i 0 n denotes the axial distance from the position of the i t h node to the blade root center for a vector λ λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 ℝ 3 the matrix s λ fossen 2011 in eqns 26 and 27 is given by 31 s λ 0 λ 3 λ 2 λ 3 0 λ 1 λ 2 λ 1 0 the coriolis matrix fossen 2011 then becomes 32 c b c b m b m y s ω b 0 3 0 3 s i b ω b the blade dynamics is implemented in the marin module called payload suspended blade 5 3 wind field unlike an operational turbine the wind induced motion to the different sections of the blade is small when calculating the aerodynamic loads the blade is assumed to be divided into a group of n small segments with n 1 nodes enumerated from 0 to n the total wind induced load to the blade is basically the integration of local two dimensional elemental loads acting along the span according to the cross flow principle during a single blade installation the wind induced loads are the main external disturbance because the lengths of the blade are often greater than 60 m for a 5 mw turbine a time varying wind velocity should be considered the wind load limits the weather window therefore uniform wind is not sufficient to calculate the wind induced load in this case the wind velocity at a point in space x y z at time t denoted by v w x y z t is the sum of the mean wind speed and the turbulence i e 33 v w x y z t v w r w n t v t i x y z t where v w t r w n u w t 0 0 is the mean wind velocity vector in n u w is the mean wind speed and v t i x y z t is the spatio temporal turbulence velocity at x y z 5 3 1 wind turbulence the taylor s hypothesis of frozen turbulence is adopted and assumes that the advection of a field of turbulence past a fixed point can be taken to be entirely due to the mean flow as the contribution from the turbulent circulation is small this only holds if the relative turbulence intensity t i is small that is u e u w 1 where u e refers to the eddy velocity a turbulence box is assumed in a space with evenly distributed points inside that moves with the mean wind speed u w in the length direction i e x w axis the size of the turbulence box is n w x n w y n w z with intervals d w x d w y and d w z along the corresponding axes where n w x n w y and n w z are the numbers of points in the x w y w and z w axes respectively mann 1998 the wind turbulence boxes are generated by importing and reshaping the binary files from turbsim kelley and jonkman 2006 jonkman and kilcher 2012 with preset discrete points along the length width and height turbsim is a free stochastic turbulence simulator turbsim 2017 additionally the binary turbulence file generated by hawc2 is also supported according to a rule of thumb in aeroelastic simulations the grid sizes are chosen to be smaller than the blade root diameter in order to capture the effects of wind speed variation of the turbulent wind field on the blade loads a blade is a smooth interpolation of a number of cross sections the position of a point in n is transformed to the position in w to remain consistent the wind force is considered to act on the center of pressure c 1 4 based on the wind velocity at c 1 4 the position of c 1 4 at the i t h cross section in n is defined by p c 1 4 i x c 1 4 i y c 1 4 i z c 1 4 i the wind velocity vector at the i t h node in n v w i p c 1 4 i t u w i v w i w w i is interpolated by a 3d lookup table with the following relation 34 v w i r w n u w 0 0 ω x m a n n w p c 1 4 i w t ω y m a n n w p c 1 4 i w t ω z m a n n w p c 1 4 i w t with 35 p c 1 4 i w x c 1 4 i t 0 t u w τ d τ x o w y c 1 4 i t y o w z c 1 4 i t z o w where ω x m a n n w ω y m a n n w and ω z m a n n w are the generated turbulence boxes for the x w y w and z w directions respectively this turbulence is implemented in the marin module called environment 3d wind generator with turbulence 5 3 2 wind induced loads acting on a blade a centerline is defined in the main body coordinate system because the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine blade does not have a prebend the centerline is almost a straight line the aerodynamic center c 1 2 of a cross section lays on the centerline with a rotation θ y i about the y b axis in the main body x b z b coordinate plane the centerline connects all c 1 2 from the blade root to the blade tip the root is defined using a circular shape the shape of the main blade body is a series of airfoils with various chord lengths geometric centers and thickness chord ratios t c define t c i t i c i where c i and are the chord length and the maximum thickness of the i t h airfoil section in a quasi steady analysis the aerodynamic coefficients are a function of the aoa and t c the structural parameters and aerodynamic coefficients can be obtained by interpolation though data from the reference turbine the aerodynamic load calculation is based on the following assumptions rigid structure blade vibration is negligible vertex shedding or dynamic stall can be ignored the lift force drag force and pitching moment acting on the i t h node denoted by l i d i and m i are calculated with airfoil theory anderson 2010 and an integration along the span this gives 36 l i 1 2 ρ a c l α i t c i a i v i 2 37 d i 1 2 ρ a c d α i t c i a i v i 2 38 m i 1 2 ρ a c m α i t c i a i v i 2 where the subscript i refers to the i t h node ρ a is the air density and c l c d and c m denote the lifting coefficient the drag coefficient and the pitching moment coefficient respectively the inflow speed is v i l r n b i v w i v c 1 4 i where l 1 0 0 0 0 1 and v c 1 4 i are the velocity vector of the i t h center of pressure in n respectively note that the relative velocity here contributes to the air resistance the wing area is 39 a i r b 1 r b 0 c 1 2 if i 0 r b i r b n 1 c n 2 if i n r b i r b i 1 c i 2 r b i 1 r b i c i 1 2 otherwise the aoa at the i t h segment α i is given by 40 α i α θ y i with 41 α f a π atan 2 w w i b w c 1 4 b u w i b u c 1 4 b where f a is a function that converts an angle to the range π π atan 2 y x is the multi valued inverse tangent function and w w i b w c 1 4 b and u w i b u c 1 4 b denote the relative wind velocity at the i t h blade segment center in b for small α i in the range 45 45 deg a series of aerodynamic coefficients w r t the aoa has been calculated and stored in a lookup table for high α i in the ranges 180 45 and 45 180 deg the aerodynamic coefficients are calculated as flat plates which are given by 42a c l α i t c i 2 cos α i sin α i 42b c d α i t c i c d t c i sin 2 α i 42c c m α i t c i sin α i 4 where c d t c is the maximum value for c d with respect to t c bak et al 2013 the coefficients for an arbitrary aoa are then found by interpolation when the yaw angle is small the force component in the y b axis is negligible according to the cross flow principle consequently the resulting force and moment vector acting at the i t h node in the blade main body frame b are given by 43 f w i b r b w i d i 0 l i 44 m w i b m w i w i 0 m i 0 therefore the total wind induced force and moment acting on the main body cog are given by 45 τ w b i 0 n f w i b i 0 n s p c 1 4 i b p c o g b f w i b m w i b these wind induced loads are implemented in the marin module called payload wind induced load acting on the blade 6 code to code verification of the blade model with quasi static analysis in this section a series of code to code verification tests are conducted to verify that the proposed code models the blade with realistic parameters and coefficients the tests are conducted using the hawc2 and matlab simulink with the nrel 5 mw reference wind turbine the aerodynamic coefficients are read from the hawc2 dat file to obtain the same wind loads and perform a fair comparison study a brief summary of the blade is tabulated in table 3 in the simulations of this section the wind velocity is constant without turbulence in the next section we will introduce turbulence and conduct testing with more realistic wind loads 6 1 test 1 mass and moment of inertia the mass the moment of inertia and the cog position are calculated by a user defined function init blade hawc2 the function reads the structural coefficients from hawc2 files this test attempts to verify that the function init blade hawc2 reads the correct parameters from the hawc2 data files and calculates the correct mass matrix and cog position the results are tabulated in table 4 from the results the init blade hawc2 function outputs are close to those from hawc2 6 2 test 2 aerodynamic coefficient lookup tables due to the rotation of the centerline and axial varying thickness the aerodynamic coefficients along the blade span are also varied the init blade hawc2 function reads the aerodynamic coefficients to construct lookup tables for the aerodynamic force modules for the nrel 5 mw reference turbine blade the resulting aerodynamic coefficients w r t blade aoa and t c are shown in figs 7 9 the curves agree with the results in ref jonkman et al 2009 therefore the init blade hawc2 function is accepted to correctly read the aerodynamic coefficients from the hawc2 data files 6 3 test 3 aerodynamic coefficients and force along the blade axis we conducted tests to verify the wind induced load acting on the blade with respect to different wind speeds roll angles and yaw angles i e the algorithm proposed in section 5 3 2 the blade is fixed at 90 m above the sea surface with ψ 0 deg and ψ 30 deg respectively the horizontal wind speed at the height of 90 m is 10 m s in the global negative x direction the pitch angle is set to 10 30 50 60 and 90 the wind speeds up during the first 20 s and the results are the corresponding values at 100 s for the hawc2 model the wind induced load quadratically increases with a slight delay at the later stage after the wind speed reaches a steady value the wind induced load is constant the proposed model calculates the wind load quadratically according to the wind speed the aerodynamic coefficients and forces are illustrated at various spanwise cross planes as shown in figs 10 13 in the figures curves from the hawc2 and the proposed simulink model agree well therefore the results confirm that the simulink module calculates the aerodynamic coefficients and force correctly 6 4 test 4 total wind induced load acting on the blade the total load acting on the blade is tested with respect to various wind speeds and blade pitch angles the wind speed is from 0 to 20 m s with a 1 m s interval the pitch angle is from 10 to 90 with a 10 deg interval the blade yaw is 0 i e the wind loads are at their maxima in this situation the resulting forces at the steady states are presented in fig 14 from the results it is noticed that the wind generated forces f x and f z are well fitted and are proportional to the square of the mean wind speed this observation corresponds well with gaunaa et al 2014 deviations between the hawc2 and the proposed model occur in the subplot f y this is because of the different mechanics used in simulation that is timoshenko beam elements in hawc2 and the rigid body with assumed zero sway force in the proposed model comparing with the magnitudes of f x and f z the deviation in f y is very small and considered negligible for the intended use of our model the same issue appears in simulations with ψ 30 whose results are presented in fig 15 7 case study single blade installation model after confirming the performance of each module individually the overall single blade installation model is built a single blade installation is performed with a yoke that grabs and holds the blade around the center of gravity the yoke is lifted by lift wires from a crane and stabilized by tugger lines symmetrically arranged around the cog on the blade axis the model is to a certain degree of low fidelity due to the lack of complex aerodynamic effects this increases the run time performance of the model while maintaining the most important dynamic effects for the purposes of control design and analysis 7 1 modeling procedure all modules and basic functions are packaged as an individual package of marin toolbox which will be integrated into marin in the future see fig 16 the single blade installation model presented in figs b 22 b 23 is given as an example of the use of this toolbox newton euler mechanics is used to connect the modules in the inflow direction 7 2 test 5 equilibrium point in steady wind first tests concerning the equilibrium points in an environment with constant wind speed are conducted for the nonrotating blade studied under a constant wind speed the displacements of the root center the cog and the tip center around their equilibrium positions approximately follow a quadratic relation with the wind speed this observation is aligned with gaunaa et al 2014 jiang et al 2018 the position of the crane and the lengths of all the wire ropes are fixed the blade leading edge is downward i e the pitch angle is equal to 90 and θ b n 0 0 π 2 0 the mean wind direction is in the x axis i e θ w n 0 0 0 a constant wind speed starts acting on the blade with a 5 s ramp increasing the results are presented in figs 17 and 18 the displacements of the root center cog and tip center all satisfy quadratic relations 7 3 test 6 time domain simulation with wind turbulence in practical situations the wind speed is not constant therefore a complex turbulent wind field is used in the simulation the external loads are caused by the wind field with spatio temporal turbulence see jiang et al 2018 for more details the mean wind speed is set to 12 m s and t i 0 146 the seed number is set to 94 the simulations are conducted with a personal computer with an intel core i7 3 6 ghz cpu using matlab version r2017b the solver in simulink is more powerful and flexible than aerodynamic software a variable step size and the maximum step size can be set to ensure both accuracy and efficiency for a 1000 s simulation the average computation time is 710 s therefore the proposed simulation model is fast enough for the simulation the histories of the blade root position cog position and tip position are presented in figs 19 21 as shown the motions in the x direction are dominant and the pendulum mode 0 1 hz of the blade system is visible in the time series of the blade root under the turbulent wind condition the blade root and the blade tip experience significantly larger motions compared to the blade cog for the blade root the displacement has a 553 6 increase in x 152 0 increase in y and 2482 2 increase in z the motion at the blade tip is even larger whose displacement experiences a 823 3 increase in x 303 1 increase in y 4701 1 increase in z 8 conclusion and future research in this paper a numerical modeling framework for blade installation for wind turbine is presented a single blade installation model is given along with an example the model is based on the newton euler method the hook blade lift wire sling tugger line winch and wind are modeled code to code verification studies are conducted to prove the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed model this model presents a starting point for future research on owt installation and related control and monitoring functions the model will be integrated with other modules to verify controllers for various scenarios of single blade installation as well as other marine operations with emphasis on crane operation in the future a structured and more comprehensive

23131,ship listing and motion is one significant factor that affects safety evacuation in passenger ship by reducing individual walking speed a ship corridor simulator was developed to investigate the combined effect of heeling and trim on individual walking speed when freely and fast walking circumstances were considered the value of the heeling angle α considered in the experiment is 0 5 10 15 and the value of the trim angle β is 0 5 10 15 20 it is found that average individual walking speed could be greatly attenuated when the heeling and or trim angles are considered compared to trim angles heeling angles show less impact on average individual walking speed when trim angle β 0 the gradient of average individual walking speed along with the increasing heeling or trim angle is larger compared to that when trim angle β 0 the maximum value for average individual speed could be achieved at the heeling angle α of 0 with trim angle β ranging from 15 to 5 since the average individual walking speed increases obviously under gravity effect during trim down conditions α 0 as the trim down slope increases from 0 to 10 the results will provide fundamental guidance to the practical ship evacuation keywords passenger ship ship corridor simulator trim heel individual walking speed 1 introduction passenger ship especially the cruise ship as one of the most reliable means for marine transportation has gained increasing attention in recent years fowler and sørgård 2000 although the possibility for the occurrence of serious accidents is rather low the consequences could be destructive e g the capsize of chinese passenger ship oriental star in 2015 has caused 442 life casualties meng et al 2016 in the event of such a catastrophe an efficient evacuation could be the promising means to minimize its consequence hystad et al 2016 in 1995 passenger ship st malo wrecked on the rocks and took in water despite that the weather conditions for evacuation on that occasion were favorable the ship was subject to listing and motion this however had extended the evacuation time for the 308 passengers aboard to 77 min after the initial alert notification for emergency hystad et al 2016 lee et al 2003 2004 lockey et al 1997 nevertheless the evacuation time in the exercise under static conditions was only 8 min this indicates that evacuation simulation exhibits certain limitation in that the practical scenarios of rolling pitching and listing have not been taken into account in model design individual walking speed is an important parameter for evaluating the personnel evacuation performance generally individual walking speed will be affected by several factors including the complexity of the evacuation environment and the particular of individuals gender height weight age etc the cerebellum also plays an important role in the control and adaptation of gait vinueza veloz et al 2015 when the environment is inclined experimental subjects tend to feel dizzy and their gait would alter as well all of which results in the loss of individual walking speed furthermore the changes of fraction between planta and the floor would also have a quite considerable impact chen et al 2016 park et al 2004 there are numerous publications highlighting human behaviors in evacuation with ship listing and in motion national maritime research institute of japan nmri reported that the average walking speed of the experimental subjects 70 120 students with an average age of 20 in ship corridor was 1 4 m s katsuhara et al 1999 katuhara et al 1997 1999 australian maritime engineering cooperative research centre ame crc and korea maritime university conducted several observations in ship corridors and on stairs and correlated the basic experimental data such as gender distribution and age distribution to walking speed brumley and koss 2000 hwang 2013 nmri and research institute of marine engineering of japan rime constructed a walkway model with a fixed length of 6 0 m and changing width as 1 2 0 9 and 0 6 m for static inclination tests murayama et al 2000 yoshida et al 2001 the normal walking speed of the experimental subjects 19 male and 2 female adults was 1 23 1 25 m s under heeling conditions no significant changes in walking speed of the experimental subjects could be observed as the heeling angle increased to 20 by contrast the walking speed decreased from 1 38 m s to 0 82 m s with the increasing trim angle from 20 to 20 fleet technology limited ftl and fire safety engineering group fseg in university of greenwich devoted joint efforts to establish the ship evacuation behavior assessment facility sheba the sheba featured a 7 m l 4 m w sized cabin a 10 m l 2 m w sized corridor and a flight of stairs in which a series of experiments were conducted galea et al 2012 glen 2004 glen et al 2001 nicholls et al 2012 valanto 2006 moreover similar investigations has also been reported by ame crc 67 adult males and females between 18 and 25 years of age the dutch research institute tno human factors 150 people between the ages of 18 and 83 and korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso 18 male students and 3 female students bles et al 2002 boer and skjong 2001 kim et al 2004 koss et al 1997 lee et al 2004 valanto 2006 vanem and skjong 2006 based on the experimental results above germanischer lloyd proposed a model for describing the change of speed reduction defined as the ratio of individual walking speed in inclined conditions to that in normal conditions with different trim or heeling angle the proposed model had been applied in aeneas a ship evacuation software widely used in ship design valanto 2006 despite that individual walking speed tested under single heeling and trim conditions have been reported the available statistic for quantitative analysis is limited besides the effects of heeling and trim experimental conditions on individual walking speed deserve further understandings hitherto the combined effect of both heeling and trim on individual walking speed has been rarely reported which is more likely to happen than single heeling or trim conditions when ship accidents occur therefore this work mainly focuses on the quantitative analysis of the combined effects of heeling and trim conditions on individual walking speed and the experimental results will provide fundamental guidance to the practical evacuation in ship accidents 2 experimental section 2 1 experimental setup to investigate the factors affecting human walking speed a dead end ship corridor simulator with a size of 10 0 m l 1 8 m w 2 2 m h was developed as presented in fig 1 two sets of hydraulic systems were equipped within the perpendicular tracks respectively along which the ship corridor simulator could slide one set of the equipped hydraulic systems is responsible for raising one side of the ship corridor simulator and the other one is responsible for raising one end of the ship corridor simulator the maximum tilt angle of the ship corridor simulator is 30 in both directions which could be measured by two inclinometers equipped on the ship corridor simulator respectively fig 2 shows the internal structure of the developed ship corridor simulator and the instrument arrangement therein a total of 9 lamps is located in the centerline of the ceiling with an interval of 1 m a 4 channel electrical monitoring device with 4 cameras is arranged to record the behaviors of experimental subjects within the desired distance during the experiment moreover experimental subjects in the ship corridor simulator would lose sight of the external environment which could promote the reality of walking in the inclined corridor 2 2 experimental design it has been proposed that ship would capsize as the heeling angle exceeds 30 valanto 2006 however our preliminary experiment results indicated that experimental subjects would slip and fall when the heeling angle exceeded 15 or the trim angle was greater than 20 considering the safety of the experimental subjects the designed experimental conditions in the inclined corridor simulator are shown in fig 3 the value of the heeling angle α is 0 5 10 15 and the value of the trim angle β is 0 5 10 15 20 a total of 17 students 24 6 1 45 years old 167 7 6 4 cm and 60 5 9 1 kg was involved as the selected experimental subjects and their particulars are listed in table 1 in each inclined conditions experimental subjects were required to walk in the ship corridor simulator one by one in freely and fast walking modes in order to investigate the relationship between fast walking speed and freely walking speed freely walking mode refers to the normal walking state while fast walking mode is to walk as fast as possible rather than run up 2 3 experimental procedure operating instructions including walking freely walking fast start walking and stop walking were issued by the experimental commander using wireless walkie talkie devices for communication once the experimental subjects received the instruction they completed the desired actions to obtain the individual walking speed v as shown in eq 1 the duration t of the experimental subjects while walking within the desired distance s as shown in fig 2 was recorded by changing trim and or heeling angle the individual walking speed of the experimental subjects under different inclined conditions could be obtained furthermore average individual walking speed the arithmetic mean value of specified individual walking speed data υ could be calculated by eq 2 and the combined effects of heeling and trim conditions on average individual walking speed could therefore be discussed 1 υ s t 2 υ 1 n i 1 n υ i 3 results and discussion the impacts of single heeling or trim angle on individual walking speed and the combined effect of both single heeling and trim angles on individual walking speed would be discussed respectively as follows 3 1 single heeling or trim angle to investigate the effect of heeling or trim on individual walking speed experimental subject no 1 is required to accomplish freely and fast walking under different conditions with trim angle β varying from 20 to 20 α 0 or heeling angle α varying from 15 to 15 β 0 fig 4 shows that the individual walking speed exhibits obvious fluctuation with the changing trim or heeling angle under the given trim or heeling conditions the individual walking speed in fast walking mode would be greater than that in freely walking mode moreover there is a larger range of the individual walking speed under trim conditions than that under heeling conditions it is speculated that trim angle β exercises a greater influence on individual walking speed than heeling angle α accurate description of the angle influence on individual walking speed should be dependent upon greater sample data therefore a large quantity of experimental data is further analyzed and the distribution of individual walking speed is presented in fig 5 due to the difference in individual characteristic factors obvious discrepancy in individual walking speed could be observed as indicated in fig 5 the change of individual walking speed in fast walking and freely walking modes versus heeling or trim angle shows similar trends individual walking speed has a range of 1 46 2 00 m s in fast walking mode and 1 01 1 60 m s in freely walking mode under flat condition where trim and heeling angles equal 0 moreover individual walking speed has a small range when heeling or trim angle equals to 0 compared to that when heeling or trim angle is not 0 this might be affected by the gender factor by contrast individual walking speed under trim or heeling conditions could be smaller this indicates that the presence of trim or heeling angle is detrimental to individual walking speed and the attenuating percent in individual walking speed increases with the increasing angle to investigate the effect of gender factor on individual walking speed experimental subjects are divided into two groups as 7 females 23 6 1 3 years old 163 1 4 0 cm and 57 6 9 2 kg and 10 males 24 9 1 1 years old 170 9 4 1 cm and 62 6 9 4 kg and they are requested to walk one by one in freely and fast walking modes under different trim or heeling conditions fig 6 illustrates the average individual walking speed the arithmetic mean value of specified individual walking speed data of the female and male groups versus heeling or trim angle the average individual walking speed is 1 71 m s for female group and 1 80 m s for male group in fast walking mode under flat condition where trim and heeling angles equal 0 in comparison those for the female and male groups in freely walking mode are 1 32 m s and 1 41 m s respectively in both freely and fast walking modes with the same heeling or trim angle the average individual walking speed of female group could be slower than that of male group this could be attributable to the discrepancy in physical quality considering the gender factor however fig 6 illustrates similar trends of the average individual walking speed of female and male group which results in similar trend of average individual walking speed of all the experimental subjects fig 7 shows that the average individual walking speed in both freely and fast walking modes present similar change with the increasing heeling angle α or trim angle β under heeling conditions no obvious differences in average individual walking speed could be observed with the increasing heeling angle α under trim up conditions the average individual walking speed decreases rapidly with the increase of trim angle β moreover the attenuation amplitude of the average individual walking speed also increases as the trim angle β increases from 0 to 20 for trim down conditions the average individual walking speed in both freely and fast walking modes increases slightly under gravity effect as the downward slope becomes steeper the experimental subjects tend to reduce their walking speeds in order to keep balance and avoid falling down to facilitate analysis the results in this work and those reported by some other institutes are summarized in fig 8 the previous results are obtained from the similar experiment condition in this study although the previous experiments varies in the characteristics of people age and gender and the range of heeling or trim angles in order to clearly present the change of walking speed speed reduction defined as the ratio of individual walking speed under inclined conditions to that under normal conditions is calculated under heeling conditions the experimental results are consistent with those reported by ftl fseg kriso tno ame crc and aeneas under trim up conditions the individual walking speed would decrease as the trim angle β increases from 0 to 20 whereas the experimental results under trim down conditions are inconsistent with those obtained by the other institutes this might be deduced as the difference in experimental conditions and subjects yoshida et al at rime and murayama et al at nmri reported that walking speed would increase as the trim down slope increased murayama et al 2000 yoshida et al 2001 flt fseg aeneas and kriso found that the increase in trim down slope would result in a reduction in walking speed in tno s observation walking speed would also decrease with the increasing trim down slope except for the condition when trim down slope was 10 where the maximum value for speed reduction appeared ame crc reported that the walking speed would decrease first and then increase with the increasing trim down slope from 0 to 20 by contrast the results in this work are different from those reported by the above mentioned institutes which might be because that the previous experiments varies in the characteristics of people age and gender and the range of heeling or trim angles as indicated when the trim down slope is small the average individual walking speed obviously increases under gravity when the trim down slope is greater than 10 experimental subjects would keep their balance at the expense of reducing walking speed 3 2 combination of heeling and trim angles despite that the change of individual walking speed under heeling or trim conditions has been expounded the combined effect of both heeling and trim angles on individual walking speed have not been reported yet therefore 17 experimental subjects are required to accomplish freely and fast walking under different inclined experimental conditions with trim angle β varying from 20 to 20 combined with heeling angle α varying from 15 to 15 the combined effect of both heeling and trim angles on individual walking speed is shown in fig 9 the maximum value of 1 807 1 920 m s for the average individual walking speed could be observed at the heeling angle α of 0 with trim angle β ranging from 15 to 5 meanwhile the minimum value of 0 965 1 084 m s is noticed at the heeling angle α of 15 combined with the trim angle β of 20 under a given trim angle β except for 0 the average individual walking speed decreases with the increasing heeling angle α when the trim angle β increases to a higher value heeling angle α would correspondingly exert greater influence on average individual walking speed meanwhile the gradient of average individual walking speed along with the increasing heeling angle α is larger with a trim up slope compared to that with a trim down slope under a given heeling angle α the average individual walking speed under trim up conditions could be rather slower compared to that under trim down conditions meanwhile the gradient of average individual walking speed along with increasing trim angle β is also larger under trim up conditions compared to that under trim down conditions with the same given heeling angle α fig 10 illustrates the average individual walking speed versus heeling angle α under different trim conditions as mentioned above no obvious differences in average individual walking speed could be observed with the increasing heeling angle α when the trim angle β is 0 whereas when the trim angle β is greater than 0 average individual walking speed would decrease with the increase of heeling angle α in both freely and fast walking modes under trim up conditions β 0 average individual walking speed decreases with the increasing trim angle β in general fig 11 illustrates the average individual walking speed versus trim angle β under different heeling conditions under a given inclined experimental condition the change of average individual walking speed versus the increasing trim angle β in both freely and fast walking modes shows similar tendency by contrast it is found that the speed value in freely walking mode is about 78 0 70 0 83 of the speed value in fast walking mode under each inclined conditions which is not consistent with the coefficient 0 9 used in exodus whereas the change tendency of the average individual walking speed versus the increasing trim angle β under different heeling conditions could be different when the heeling angle α is 0 as the trim down slope is less than 10 the average individual walking speed increases obviously under gravity effect however the experimental subjects tend to slow down to keep balance when the trim down slope is greater than 10 and therefore will give rise to a decreased average individual walking speed nevertheless when the heeling angle α is greater than 0 the stimulative gravity effect on the average individual walking speed could not be observed instead the average individual walking speed would decrease as the experimental subjects walk downwards this might be ascribed to the fact that it is rather more difficult for experimental subjects to keep their balance under the combined effect of heeling and trim standard deviation reflects the dispersion degree of a set of data standard deviation of individual walking speed under the combined trim and heeling conditions is illustrated in fig 12 standard deviation of individual walking speed is rather smaller when the experimental subjects walk upwards with the trim up slope ranging from 0 to 20 under trim up conditions the individual walking speed decreases dramatically which contributes to the smaller standard deviation values under trim down conditions the experiment subjects behave differently as some might speed up acutely under gravity effect while some others might slow down to keep balance therefore the standard deviation values under trim down conditions could be higher however as the heeling angle α or trim down angle increases to higher values the standard deviation of individual walking speed tends to narrow down since the majority of the experimental subjects recognize to slow down to keep balance for the inclined condition with a larger standard deviation average individual walking speed is not sufficient as the representative of all the experimental subjects more experiments are needed in order to obtain the distribution of individual walking speed under specified inclined condition 4 conclusions heeling and or trim are typical factors of concern amongst various that affect safety evacuation in passenger ships individual walking speed is one significant parameter for evaluating the evacuation performances in this work a ship corridor simulator is developed and the combined effect of heeling and trim on average individual walking speed is experimentally demonstrated therein in both freely and fast walking modes the change of average individual walking speed versus the increasing heeling or trim angle presents similar tendency it verifies the rationality of correlating fast walking speed and freely walking speed by using a coefficient in exodus although the value of the coefficient may need further study compared with the experimental results when the heeling and or trim angles are considered average individual walking speed could be greatly attenuated except that the average individual walking speed increases obviously under gravity effect during trim down conditions as the trim down slope increases from 0 to 10 when heeling angle α is 0 when trim angle β 0 the gradient of average individual walking speed along with the increasing heeling or trim angle is larger compared to that when trim angle β 0 compared to trim angles heeling angles show less impact on average individual walking speed the maximum values for the average individual walking speed in this work could be achieved at the heeling angle α of 0 with trim angle β ranging from 15 to 5 the minimum values for the average individual walking speed could be obtained at the heeling angle α of 15 with trim angle β of 20 moreover it is also found that the average individual walking speed of female group is slower than that of male group due to the difference in physical quality considering the gender factor the results and conclusions may only valid for this experiment or for the similar pedestrian to this study and there are some uncertainties in the experimental results with various sample size future work will be focused on the changing mechanism of individual walking speed along with heeling or and trim angle by analyzing gait characteristics of experimental subjects and the distribution of individual walking speed under specified inclined condition would also be further studied by supplementing more experiments the results in this work provide valuable information about individual passengers behaviors during evacuation considering the combined effect of ship trim and heeling which will finally be used in ship evacuation simulation software and be

23131,ship listing and motion is one significant factor that affects safety evacuation in passenger ship by reducing individual walking speed a ship corridor simulator was developed to investigate the combined effect of heeling and trim on individual walking speed when freely and fast walking circumstances were considered the value of the heeling angle α considered in the experiment is 0 5 10 15 and the value of the trim angle β is 0 5 10 15 20 it is found that average individual walking speed could be greatly attenuated when the heeling and or trim angles are considered compared to trim angles heeling angles show less impact on average individual walking speed when trim angle β 0 the gradient of average individual walking speed along with the increasing heeling or trim angle is larger compared to that when trim angle β 0 the maximum value for average individual speed could be achieved at the heeling angle α of 0 with trim angle β ranging from 15 to 5 since the average individual walking speed increases obviously under gravity effect during trim down conditions α 0 as the trim down slope increases from 0 to 10 the results will provide fundamental guidance to the practical ship evacuation keywords passenger ship ship corridor simulator trim heel individual walking speed 1 introduction passenger ship especially the cruise ship as one of the most reliable means for marine transportation has gained increasing attention in recent years fowler and sørgård 2000 although the possibility for the occurrence of serious accidents is rather low the consequences could be destructive e g the capsize of chinese passenger ship oriental star in 2015 has caused 442 life casualties meng et al 2016 in the event of such a catastrophe an efficient evacuation could be the promising means to minimize its consequence hystad et al 2016 in 1995 passenger ship st malo wrecked on the rocks and took in water despite that the weather conditions for evacuation on that occasion were favorable the ship was subject to listing and motion this however had extended the evacuation time for the 308 passengers aboard to 77 min after the initial alert notification for emergency hystad et al 2016 lee et al 2003 2004 lockey et al 1997 nevertheless the evacuation time in the exercise under static conditions was only 8 min this indicates that evacuation simulation exhibits certain limitation in that the practical scenarios of rolling pitching and listing have not been taken into account in model design individual walking speed is an important parameter for evaluating the personnel evacuation performance generally individual walking speed will be affected by several factors including the complexity of the evacuation environment and the particular of individuals gender height weight age etc the cerebellum also plays an important role in the control and adaptation of gait vinueza veloz et al 2015 when the environment is inclined experimental subjects tend to feel dizzy and their gait would alter as well all of which results in the loss of individual walking speed furthermore the changes of fraction between planta and the floor would also have a quite considerable impact chen et al 2016 park et al 2004 there are numerous publications highlighting human behaviors in evacuation with ship listing and in motion national maritime research institute of japan nmri reported that the average walking speed of the experimental subjects 70 120 students with an average age of 20 in ship corridor was 1 4 m s katsuhara et al 1999 katuhara et al 1997 1999 australian maritime engineering cooperative research centre ame crc and korea maritime university conducted several observations in ship corridors and on stairs and correlated the basic experimental data such as gender distribution and age distribution to walking speed brumley and koss 2000 hwang 2013 nmri and research institute of marine engineering of japan rime constructed a walkway model with a fixed length of 6 0 m and changing width as 1 2 0 9 and 0 6 m for static inclination tests murayama et al 2000 yoshida et al 2001 the normal walking speed of the experimental subjects 19 male and 2 female adults was 1 23 1 25 m s under heeling conditions no significant changes in walking speed of the experimental subjects could be observed as the heeling angle increased to 20 by contrast the walking speed decreased from 1 38 m s to 0 82 m s with the increasing trim angle from 20 to 20 fleet technology limited ftl and fire safety engineering group fseg in university of greenwich devoted joint efforts to establish the ship evacuation behavior assessment facility sheba the sheba featured a 7 m l 4 m w sized cabin a 10 m l 2 m w sized corridor and a flight of stairs in which a series of experiments were conducted galea et al 2012 glen 2004 glen et al 2001 nicholls et al 2012 valanto 2006 moreover similar investigations has also been reported by ame crc 67 adult males and females between 18 and 25 years of age the dutch research institute tno human factors 150 people between the ages of 18 and 83 and korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso 18 male students and 3 female students bles et al 2002 boer and skjong 2001 kim et al 2004 koss et al 1997 lee et al 2004 valanto 2006 vanem and skjong 2006 based on the experimental results above germanischer lloyd proposed a model for describing the change of speed reduction defined as the ratio of individual walking speed in inclined conditions to that in normal conditions with different trim or heeling angle the proposed model had been applied in aeneas a ship evacuation software widely used in ship design valanto 2006 despite that individual walking speed tested under single heeling and trim conditions have been reported the available statistic for quantitative analysis is limited besides the effects of heeling and trim experimental conditions on individual walking speed deserve further understandings hitherto the combined effect of both heeling and trim on individual walking speed has been rarely reported which is more likely to happen than single heeling or trim conditions when ship accidents occur therefore this work mainly focuses on the quantitative analysis of the combined effects of heeling and trim conditions on individual walking speed and the experimental results will provide fundamental guidance to the practical evacuation in ship accidents 2 experimental section 2 1 experimental setup to investigate the factors affecting human walking speed a dead end ship corridor simulator with a size of 10 0 m l 1 8 m w 2 2 m h was developed as presented in fig 1 two sets of hydraulic systems were equipped within the perpendicular tracks respectively along which the ship corridor simulator could slide one set of the equipped hydraulic systems is responsible for raising one side of the ship corridor simulator and the other one is responsible for raising one end of the ship corridor simulator the maximum tilt angle of the ship corridor simulator is 30 in both directions which could be measured by two inclinometers equipped on the ship corridor simulator respectively fig 2 shows the internal structure of the developed ship corridor simulator and the instrument arrangement therein a total of 9 lamps is located in the centerline of the ceiling with an interval of 1 m a 4 channel electrical monitoring device with 4 cameras is arranged to record the behaviors of experimental subjects within the desired distance during the experiment moreover experimental subjects in the ship corridor simulator would lose sight of the external environment which could promote the reality of walking in the inclined corridor 2 2 experimental design it has been proposed that ship would capsize as the heeling angle exceeds 30 valanto 2006 however our preliminary experiment results indicated that experimental subjects would slip and fall when the heeling

different conditions with trim angle β varying from 20 to 20 α 0 or heeling angle α varying from 15 to 15 β 0 fig 4 shows that the individual walking speed exhibits obvious fluctuation with the

viscous cfd model and comprises two components namely an approach for quantifying the amount of incident wave energy transferred to other physical processes and a methodology to convert the viscous energy loss components into dissipative coefficients that are subsequently added to a modified linear potential flow model the framework can be used to account for the effects of viscosity without reliance on model test data being available this is useful at the early stages of a flng development when the operability of various hull forms may be assessed usually using conventional inviscid potential flow models and before model tests are carried out it is well known that the near resonant gap free surface responses may be several times that of the incident wave height and accurate prediction of the elevations will require modelling of viscous effects in this paper details of the analysis framework are developed the framework is later used to calculate the gap free surface elevations and forcings on side by side barges which are discussed and presented in an accompanying paper part ii keywords side by side hydrodynamics viscous effects dissipation potentialflow gap resonance 1 introduction this work is motivated by the need to accurately and efficiently assess the hydrodynamic interaction effects between two vessels in a side by side configuration such as during the offloading of cargo from a flng platform onto a shuttle tanker this is because occurrence of large gap free surface elevations due to resonant or near resonant response of the gap water volume may pose a direct risk to the personnel and equipment involved in the offloading operations or result in large loads and motions that affect the operability of cargo transfer or other topsides process equipment at the present moment circa 2016 the industry uses a combination of model tests and potential flow models with added artificial damping terms to assess the gap free surface response several forms for the added damping terms which are calibrated against model test data have been proposed in huijsmans et al 2001 the authors observed excessively large gap responses in their linear potential flow model of a lng tanker moored alongside a flng platform due to the omission of viscous dissipative effects a rigid lid free surface boundary condition for the partially trapped water volume between the two vessels is used to suppress those responses chen 2005 modified the rigid lid approach by introducing into the free surface boundary condition a damping term commonly referred to as a damping lid whose strength is proportional to the gap water velocity pauw et al 2007 compared three dimensional numerical results of two side by side lng carriers with those obtained from experimental tests and found that there is no unique damping ratio for gap sizes of less than 25m calibrating the damping term to match first order experimental measurements would reduce the agreement of second order drift forces and vice versa newman 2003 proposed the use of chebychev polynomials to represent the generalized response modes of the gap free surface where damping factors can be used to represent the viscous dissipative effects both the number of response modes and values of damping factors would require calibration against model test data fournier et al 2006 compared the numerical predictions obtained from the damping lid and the generalized response modes methods against model test results and a third numerical method where an array of massless damping plates is placed on the gap free surface to dissipate energy similar to earlier methods the damping value to be applied on the plates requires calibration against model test data lu et al 2012 proposed using the fluid stress tensor calculated using results from viscous flow modelling to calculate the rate of viscous dissipation between two side by side vessels within a given control volume the dissipation rate is subsequently used to determine the damping lid value that will be applied to the gap free surface in a potential flow model using an expression derived by the authors two control volume definitions are tested and the one which gives better gap free surface response prediction compared to experimental data is recommended hong et al 2013 combined the damping lid approach with a damped body boundary condition referred to as wetted surface damping in their frequency domain potential flow models in order to calculate drift forces and gap resonance between two side by side vessels the same numerical value is used for both the free surface damping lid term and the wetted surface damping term for ship roll damping studies chakrabarti 2001 noted that skin friction losses do not scale in a linear manner with length unlike other damping components himeno 1981 estimated that the frictional component of roll damping at full scale is about 1 20 1 30 times of model scale given these considerations the lumping of dissipation due to different flow processes into a single damping lid term based on calibration against model tests or viscous simulations whose length scales differ from the actual side by side vessels will result in inaccurate modelling of the viscous energy dissipation following from the foregoing literature review an analysis framework for the modelling of hydrodynamic interaction between side by side floating bodies is developed in this paper part i of a two part work the two components of the framework are presented namely i an approach for quantifying the amount of incident wave energy that is being transferred to other physical processes due to the presence of the two vessels and splitting them into components representative of each of the processes and ii a method for incorporating the relevant viscous dissipative effects into linear potential flow via proposed modifications the framework is developed to address two issues that may arise in the design of vessels operating in side by side configurations firstly at the early stages of the design cycle before model tests are conducted effects of hull form changes on a flng platform s performance would need to be assessed secondly even when comparable model test data is available e g from vessels with similar hull forms the scaling effect of viscous dissipation is unknown in part ii chua et al 2017 the framework is applied to the case of two identical fixed floating side by side barges under the influence of regular waves different bilge corner geometries are investigated namely sharp bilge corners 90 between side shells and bottom and bilge corners with radii of 1m 2m 4m and 6m values of gap free surface elevation sway heave and roll forcings predicted using the modified potential flow model item ii above are compared against corresponding values obtained using a viscous flow solver openfoam a two step framework is proposed for the analysis of hydrodynamic interactions between side by side rigidly fixed floating vessels for the first step of the framework viscous simulations are carried out for a selected number of load cases such as at the low and high incident wave frequencies and at the estimated gap resonant frequencies the resulting viscous flow field data is used to quantify the total amount of incident wave energy being transferred to other physical processes and that amount is split into components representative of those individual processes the approach for quantifying and splitting the transferred incident wave energy into components is explained in section 2 3 in the second step the amount of energy that is dissipated through the viscous processes of vortex shedding and skin friction effects are used to calculate values of dissipative coefficients for terms that will be added to a modified linear potential flow model the modifications together with expressions for calculating the respective dissipative coefficients are presented in section 3 3 2 viscous modelling it is well known that viscous effects are critical when modelling hydrodynamic interactions between side by side vessels in this paper viscous modelling of the hydrodynamic interaction between side by side fixed floating vessels and regular incident waves is investigated to serve the following three purposes i to study influence of viscosity on gap free surface response and forcing ii to provide flow field data so that the amount of incident wave energy that is being transferred to other flow processes can be quantified and iii to use values of gap free surface elevation sway heave and roll forcings as comparison against corresponding predictions from a modified potential flow model 2 1 viscous solver viscous flow interaction between the side by side vessels and incident waves is modelled using the open source c solver library openfoam weller and new 2008 the library uses a finite volume method to discretise the computational domain into cells inside this domain the viscous flow is governed by the mass and momentum conservation equations as shown in the following expressions 1 u 0 and ρ u t ρ u u p g x ρ ρ μ u where u is the velocity vector x is the cartesian coordinate vector t represents time ρ is the density of fluid g is the gravitational acceleration p is the excess pressure above hydrostatic and μ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in the computational domain both air and water are modelled as a single fluid the volume of fluid vof approach is used to model the air water interface using a phase fraction scalar α transport of α is governed by the following equation 2 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where u r is the relative velocity between the air and water phases compared to the original phase fraction transport equation proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 eq 2 includes an additional convective term last term on left hand side which provides additional compression at the air water interface the amount of compression depends on the relative velocity between air and water phases u r and it acts to reduce the numerical diffusion of α across mesh cells berberovic 2010 the incompressible flow is solved using a segregated approach that combines two well known solution methods the piso issa 1986 and simple patankar and spalding 1972 algorithms into a combined approach called pimple the open source wave generation toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 is used for the generation and absorption of waves into and out of the computational domain the toolbox uses spatial relaxation zones in which desired velocity and phase fraction values are blended with computed values across spatial dimensions 2 2 validation the viscous solver s ability to model free surface flows in narrow gaps between three adjacent fixed boxes is validated by comparing the predicted values of free surface elevations with published experimental iwata et al 2007 and numerical results lu et al 2010 in these two dimensional simulations three side by side adjacent boxes representing fixed floating barges are subjected to linear regular waves generated at one end of the flow domain and absorbed at the opposite end the hydrodynamic response in the narrow gaps between the boxes in terms of free surface elevation are monitored for a range of wavelengths the set up of the validation simulations is shown in fig 1 note that the simulation domain shown in the figure has been truncated the wave inlet and outlet relaxation zones lie to left and right hand side of what is shown a mesh convergence study is first carried out at kd 1 307 where k represents the wavenumber and d is the water depth iwata et al 2007 observed the largest upstream gap response at this kd value mesh sizes ranging from about 32 000 cells to about 200 000 cells are used to investigate mesh dependency of free surface elevation in gaps and to determine the optimal mesh size for subsequent validation simulations fig 2 plots the steady state free surface response amplitude in the upstream and downstream gaps against the total number of cells in the mesh the response amplitudes in the upstream and downstream gaps exhibit a combination of oscillatory and monotonic convergent behaviours stern et al 2001 this is likely due to a combination of complex flow behaviour in the two narrow gaps and the complex mesh geometry where cell spacing reduces towards the three bodies and in the narrow gaps and expands away from them the plot shows a clear convergent trend towards asymptotic response values for both the upstream and downstream gaps for both gaps the differences between the largest and smallest values of free surface elevations are around 6 7 of the asymptotic values and the differences in the results from the 150 000 cell mesh and the asymptotic values are less than 1 the 150 000 cell mesh is therefore used for the subsequent validation simulations it should be highlighted at this point that in addition to the number of cells investigations have also been carried out to ensure that the meshes of a given density have sufficient resolution in terms of cell height and cell length for the simulated wave heights and wave lengths as well as to capture the wave particle velocity profile ten simulations were carried out for kd values ranging from 1 000 to 2 000 for a simulation duration of 40s each this simulation duration corresponds to around 24 39 wave cycles for the range of kd investigated and based on earlier test runs would allow the gap free surface responses to settle into steady state responses of around 12 17 cycles fig 3 shows the free surface elevation values at four locations the wave inlet labelled as inlet just before hitting the first upstream box labelled as incident and in the up and downstream gaps labelled as upstream gap and downstream gap respectively for kd 1 307 which correspond to when resonant responses occur in the two gaps it can be noted from the figure that steady state responses have been achieved also no wave breaking was observed in the gap despite the high resonant responses this observation together with the good comparison in terms of response amplitudes with both published experimental data iwata et al 2007 and numerical results obtained using a different viscous solver lu et al 2010 indicates that physically wave breaking would not occur for the load cases analysed the free surface responses obtained from the simulations are non dimensionalised against incident wave heights and plotted against kd in figs 4 a and b together with the experimental iwata et al 2007 and numerical lu et al 2010 results it should be noted that the latter includes output from both viscous based on finite element method and potential flow based on boundary element method solvers the boundary element method applies an artificial free surface damping value of 0 5 using the approach proposed by chen 2005 it can be observed from the figures that the results obtained using the viscous solver denoted as openfoam show good agreement with both the corresponding experimental and numerical values it is worth noting that the double peak nature of the upstream gap response curve has been captured by the viscous solver compared to the experimental data iwata et al 2007 the viscous solver over predicts the first resonant peak response in the upstream gap by about 5 the over prediction by the numerical openfoam model may be due to the fact that additional mechanisms of energy dissipation such as from side walls of the experimental wave flume were not modelled in the 2 dimensional numerical model it is worth nothing at this point that the wave generation and absorption capability of the viscous solver has been checked before the fore going validation simulations are carried out first order linear waves are generated at one end of the solution domain and allowed to propagate across it before being absorbed by the absorption outlet relaxation zone in the opposite end the free surface elevations at various locations within the computational domain are monitored and compared against analytical values this capability is subsequently extended to the generation and absorption of focussed wave events in a separate research the free surface elevations and velocity profiles of focussed waves are compared with analytical predictions and experimental data in bahuguni et al 2015 2 3 balance of energy components the approach for quantifying the amount of incident wave energy that is being transferred to other physical processes is based on the balance of energy components in a given control volume which encompasses the two vessels and can be thought of as an adaptation of the component roll damping method developed for the prediction of viscous roll damping effects in ships see e g himeno 1981 the energy balance equation for such a system is assumed to be of the following form 3 e t e wave e friction e vortices e appendages e bodies where e t represents the amount of incident wave excitation energy transferred to the right hand side terms due to interactions between the side by side vessels and the incident wave field e wave represents the amount of incident wave energy that is expended through scattered waves e friction represents the work done against skin friction at the hull surfaces e vortices represents the amount of incident wave energy dissipated due to vortex shedding effects e appendages represents the additional amount of wave energy being transferred away from the incident wave field due to the presence of appendages and e bodies represents the amount of energy required to move the vessels if they are free floating as is the case with the component roll damping method it may be argued that eq 3 may not be hydrodynamically correct given the fact that the various physical mechanisms of energy dissipation may act concurrently with cross interaction especially for the complex flow scenario of side by side bodies in this regard we would like to point out that eq 3 is based on heuristic and physical reasoning we would further argue that it is due the flow complexities that such an approach needs to be taken so that the intractably intertwined flow phenomena can be broken down into quantifiable components that can be applied to engineering problems at this stage it may be noted that the value of transferred incident wave energy is dependent on the size of the control volume as such the extent of the control volume i e size and boundaries should only be defined after considering the influence of the relevant right hand side components which in this case will be the wave scattering term this is discussed in the following sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 methods to calculate the remaining four components skin friction vortex shedding additional dissipation due to appendages and body motion are discussed in the respective sections 2 3 3 2 3 4 2 3 5 and 2 3 6 2 3 1 total energy dissipation the amount of incident wave energy being dissipated within a predefined control volume can be obtained by first calculating the energy flux across vertical boundaries of the volume and the free surface the net energy flux across all boundaries is subsequently integrated to obtain the total amount of energy lost within the boundaries over a given duration at each vertical boundary the energy flux due to the flow can be calculated as the product of dynamic pressure exerted on the boundary and the normal velocity of fluid passing through the boundary it should be noted that the vertical dimension of the boundaries change with time due to the constantly evolving free surface this means that the height of any surface piercing vertical boundaries should change with the wave field and similarly the shape of the free surface boundary should also change however depending on how the control volume is defined not all vertical boundaries will be surface piercing for example by terminating the boundaries upper edge at bottoms of the floating bodies it should be noted that by using a control volume approach the value of e t will depend on the extent of the control volume and as such the volume s boundaries can only be defined after considering the influence of certain energy dissipation components this is elaborated in the next subsection the total energy dissipated in the control volume is defined as 4 e t s τ τ t p t v n t dt ds where s represents the boundaries of the control volume τ represents the nominal start time of the time integral t represents the duration over which integration is carried out p t represents the instantaneous pressure acting on a particular point on the boundaries of the control volume and v n t represents the instantaneous normal velocity of fluid at a particular point on the control volume s boundaries corresponding to the value of the instantaneous pressure 2 3 2 energy lost through wave scattering wave scattering due to surface piercing bodies such as ships and offshore structures is known to be a predominantly inviscid flow phenomena that can be accurately predicted using potential flow models since one of the motivations of this research is to quantify viscous losses in order to improve the accuracy of potential flow models the energy dissipation effects from wave scattering should be omitted as far as possible even if these effects are small for hull geometries commonly found in ship and floating offshore platforms kawahara and maekawa 2008 this is to minimise double counting when the additional terms representative of viscous dissipation are added back to the modified linear potential flow model for side by side vessels it can be envisaged that wave scattering will take place within the narrow gap between the adjacent vessels and in the surrounding fluid body to the exterior of both vessels and the gap within the gap flow is likely to be vigorous and dominated by viscous processes it is therefore assumed that the influence of viscous processes will dominate while wave scattering damping is negligible for the surrounding exterior zone wave scattering effects can be omitted by defining the control volume s boundaries such that they correspond to the outward facing side shells of the two adjacent vessels and the longitudinal boundaries correspond to the longitudinal extent of the vessels in plan view the boundaries of the control volume are the areas that surround the two vessels and the partially entrapped body of water in the gap fig 5 below shows the definition of the control volume in elevation and plan view by using the control volume definition shown in fig 5 the influence of wave radiation damping on the overall energy dissipation is limited to the small gap region where its effects can be reasonably assumed to be negligible it should be mentioned that a similar control volume definition is used for the calculation of dissipation rate using the fluid stress tensor in lu et al 2012 however in that paper the authors tested two nominally defined control volumes and selected the one that gave a better agreement with experimental data in contrast the control volume definition described in the section is based the separation of energy components eq 3 and the need to exclude the incident wave energy losses due to wave radiation damping given that this effect is already accounted for in linear potential flow another significant difference between the approach proposed in this paper and that of lu et al 2012 is the method for calculating viscous dissipation in this paper this value is calculated as the net energy flux across all the boundaries of the control volume while in lu et al 2012 the volume integral of the fluid stress tensor is used since the boundaries vary with the square of a given control volume s dimensions while the volume varies with the cube of the dimensions it may be inferred that the approach proposed in this paper is more efficient 2 3 3 frictional energy dissipation in order to overcome fluid shear stress in the regions close to the adjacent hulls energy is expended and converted into internal energy of the fluid in this research the amount of energy loss due to skin friction is calculated by first estimating the frictional force coefficients of the hull surfaces using an empirical formula kato s formula has been used in this research as it accounts for the laminar to turbulent transition often found in flows around ships and floating offshore structures lloyd 1989 the formula originally used to determine the contribution of frictional forces to ship roll damping is given in the following expression 5 c f 1 328 r n 0 5 0 014 r n 0 114 where r n is the reynold s number this can be calculated using the following definition which is commonly used in studies of oscillatory boundary layer flows jensen et al 1989 6 r n au 0 ν where a is the characteristic length and is calculated as the amplitude of relative oscillatory motions between the body surface s and the surrounding water body u 0 is the reference free stream velocity amplitude and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water it should be noted that an alternative expression for r n defined in terms of relative roll angle and roll frequency is sometimes used in naval architecture in combination with eq 5 kato s formula eq 6 uses a global reference frame while the alternative expression uses one that is vessel centric to account for relative motions between a moving body and the moving free surface the values of u 0 in eq 6 are sampled across a plane running through the gap centreline this is to ensure that the flow velocities are obtained at locations inside the gap that are sufficiently offset from either of the side by side hull surfaces for cases where the vessels are free to move the reference velocity amplitudes are obtained by taking the amplitude of the difference between body motion velocities and the reference free stream velocities in cases where the adjacent floating vessels are constrained such that no motions are allowed as is the case in this research the reference velocity amplitudes would be equal to solely the velocity amplitudes of gap fluid response based on the above a method for calculating skin friction energy loss is proposed and described in the following steps 1 firstly it is assumed that the total skin friction losses at the gap facing side shells can be calculated as a summation of losses at transverse sections taken along the length of the gap and surrounding vessels secondly each transverse section is further divided in the vertical direction into panels which correspond to hull boundary cell faces of numerical models this second discretisation step is required due to the fact that both the free surface responses and flow velocities in the gap may not be uniform in the vertical direction since particle velocities of the background incident wave field decays exponentially with water depth 2 at each transverse section the relative motion is calculated as the difference between the steady state oscillatory gap motion response taken in the middle of the gap and roll motions similarly the relative velocity is the difference between the motion velocity of the vessel and the surrounding fluid s tangential relative velocity components these two datasets are subsequently used to the calculate r n using eq 6 3 calculations are made of the skin frictional coefficient using eq 5 kato s formula and subsequently the instantaneous rate of work done against friction on each hull panel using c f values of the transverse section on which the hull panel belongs to this is shown in the following expression 7 de friction i k 1 2 ρ a i k c f i u 0 reference 2 i k friction force u 0 reference i k where de friction i k represents the frictional losses at a hull panel with centroid at x i and z k c f i represents the frictional coefficient at the transverse section where x i a i k represents the wetted area of the hull panel u 0 reference i k represents the reference velocity amplitude between the gap water column and the body motions if vessels are free floating 4 the instantaneous rate of frictional energy loss for the two adjacent barges on their respective gap facing side shells is calculated by summing up the hull panel losses the calculation steps above do not include the frictional losses at the hull bottoms of the two adjacent barges noting that suitable values of u 0 need to be defined for these horizontal hull surfaces while accounting for the fact that in general the values of water particle velocity increase exponentially from the seabed to the free surface due to the background incident wave field however close to the hull bottoms the no slip condition on the hull bottom patches mean that the flow velocity magnitude will decrease closer to these patches even though the depths are shallower this means that there exists a horizontal plane where the velocity and its associated x y and z components will be maximum at a small distance away from the hull bottom patches but sufficiently far away from the seabed this plane referred to as the bottom reference velocity sampling plane is identified as an initial step in the post processing following the numerical simulations thereafter the calculation of skin friction energy losses at hull bottoms of the two adjacent vessels follow the same steps as the losses at the side shells albeit with the minor adjustment that the reference velocity will be defined as u 0 reference i j where i represents the longitudinal coordinate and j represents the transverse coordinate once the instantaneous frictional losses at the hull bottoms and gap facing side shells of the adjacent vessels have been determined the time averaged frictional work done is subsequently calculated by integrating over a certain number of oscillatory gap response cycles and dividing by the total time duration of those cycles the positions of gap and bottom reference velocity sampling planes are shown schematically in fig 6 note that the position of the bottom sampling plane is not to scale it is shown to be lower deeper in order to differentiate it from the actual hull bottoms 2 3 4 vortex shedding energy dissipation the wave driven flow of water in and out of the gap between the side by side vessels may separate around the regions where the vessels hull forms change rapidly due to the large pressure gradients being set up the flow separation and subsequent shedding of vortices dissipates fluid kinetic energy into internal energy of the fluid at present calculation of vortex shedding dissipation either through direct numerical simulations dns or the relatively more efficient large eddy simulations les requires significant time and computational resources full scale computation using these viscous flow models is impracticable for engineering use especially given that a non trivial number of wave cycles 15 is required before steady state gap response is attained an indirect approach is therefore proposed in this research where the vortex shedding losses are simply the residual amount after subtracting all the other right hand side terms that are present calculated using the approaches described in the preceding and subsequent subsections from the left hand side term of eq 3 e t 2 3 5 appendages energy dissipation the energy dissipation due to flow around appendages is a complex interaction of skin friction losses vortex shedding and other physical processes a further complexity arises from the fact that the appendages will also change the flow around the main hull surfaces quantification of each of those interaction effects is impracticable if not impossible the most practicable way to quantify the viscous dissipation due to appendages is to conduct two sets of numerical simulations model tests where the first set uses clean hulls without any appendages and a second set with all appendages present the difference in energy dissipation between the two sets of results will be attributed to the presence of appendages the dissipation value quantified in this manner also facilitates comparison between different appendage configurations in terms of effectiveness in reducing motions or responses at this point it should be noted that this energy dissipation component will not be investigated in this research as it requires specific functional specifications to be defined for the vessels such as the number and type of risers in order to estimate the size of riser balconies 2 3 6 body motion in cases where the side by side vessels are free to move some of the incident wave energy will be transferred to drive those motions this means that part of the energy provided by the incident wave field will be converted into the vessels kinetic and potential energies which can be calculated using vessels displacement and velocity values note that the side by side configurations investigated in this paper assume that the vessels are rigidly fixed and thus this component will not be quantified nonetheless the proposed approach is provided for completeness and may be expanded upon in future research 3 linear potential flow solver 3 1 governing equations in this research a conventional time domain linear potential flow solver based on a higher order boundary element method hobem is developed as a basis for subsequent modifications aimed at incorporating viscous dissipation the linear potential flow governing equations are given in the following expressions 8 laplace equation 2 ϕ s 0 in d potential 9 linear kinematic free surface condition ϕ s z ζ s t 0 on s 0 where z 0 10 linear dynamic free surface condition ϕ s t g ζ s 0 on s 0 where z 0 11 linear seabed boundary condition ϕ s z 0 at z d 12 linear body condition ϕ s n ϕ w n on s bodies where the computational domain occupied by the ideal fluid and defined using a cartesian coordinate system with origin on the mean sea level scattered wave field total values of flow field variables can be represents the free surface elevation d represents the water depth s bodies represents the body boundaries and s 0 represents the free surface boundary in addition to the linearisation process the velocity potential ϕ and free surface elevation ζ are also split into components representing contributions from the incident and the scattered wave fields these are denoted respectively by the superscripts w and s it should be noted that calculations are carried out only for the recovered by adding the known incident components to the calculated scattered values 3 2 numerical implementation to facilitate the subsequent explanation of the modifications made to incorporate the effects of viscosity the numerical implementation methodology of the linear potential flow analysis is briefly recapitulated here a boundary integral equation is adopted with green s theorem being applied to the laplace equation governing the velocity potential eq 8 to convert the three dimensional problem to one involving surface integrals at the boundaries enclosing the domain by noting that either the scattered velocity potential ϕ s or its normal derivative ϕ s n is known on each of the surfaces that define the potential flow region i e free surface s 0 far field control surfaces s c and solid boundaries such as seabed and body boundaries s bodies the linear boundary value problem defined by the above equations can be solved using green s second identity a rankine source and its image about the seabed is used as the green s function g x x 0 with the assumption of a flat and horizontal seabed these are shown in the following expressions 13 c x 0 ϕ x 0 s g x x 0 ϕ n x ds s g x x 0 n ϕ x ds and g x x 0 1 4 π 1 r 1 1 r 2 where s represents the entire potential flow region such that s s 0 s bodies s c x 0 represent the points in the field over which sources are distributed x represent the points of observation and c x 0 represents the solid angle at x 0 r 1 and r 2 represent the rankine source and its image about the seabed defined respectively as r 1 x x 0 1 and r 2 x x 0 2 x x y z represents the computational point x 0 1 x 0 y 0 z 0 represents the source point x 0 2 x 0 y 0 z 0 2 d represents the reflection of x 0 1 about the seabed the bounding surfaces of d potential can be categorised into neumann and dirichlet surfaces each defined using a separate set of integrals and arranged according to the unknowns to be solved by discretising these bounding surfaces using quadratic isoparametric 8 noded elements gauss legendre quadrature can be used to numerically compute the values of the integrals for singular or near singular integrands where field and source points are located within the same element a polar coordinate transformation originally developed for stress analysis li et al 1985 is used to evaluate the integral this method has previously been applied to wave structure interaction problems by for example eatock taylor and chau 1992 the fully discretised representations of eq 13 can be re arranged into the following matrix form so that the unknown variables on each of the neumann or dirichlet surfaces can be solved 14 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 φ 1 φ 2 b 1 b 2 where unknowns are φ 1 i ϕ x φ 2 i ϕ n x the influence coefficient matrices are dependent only on the mesh geometry and can be assembled immediately after mesh generation and stored in memory for calculations at all subsequent time steps this is because the linear potential flow problem is based on a taylor s series expansion of flow variables about the time invariant mean sea level which implies that the values of green s functions and the corresponding derivatives are dependent only on the mesh geometry the solid angle at the field point c x 0 is calculated by considering the case of a constant non zero velocity potential field within d potential wu and eatock taylor 1989 such that the normal derivative i e potential flux will be zero throughout the domain at the start of a simulation an undisturbed linear wave field is applied to the entire domain i e the scattered components of velocity potential and its derivative are taken to be zero at the start of the simulation a cosine ramp function is used to gradually build up the input incident wave field so that the scattering of flow variables from the body boundaries via eq 12 would correspondingly be increased gradually a fourth order runge kutta rk4 scheme is used to march the solution forward in time using the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions eqs 9 and 10 the remaining unknowns namely scattered velocity potential derivatives on the free surface ϕ s z s 0 and the scattered velocity potentials on the body boundaries ϕ s s bodies are calculated using the green s second identity these two terms correspond respectively to φ 2 i and φ 1 i of eq 14 i e φ 2 i and 1 i are the unknowns on the free surface and body boundaries as the scattered wave components travel to the outer regions of the flow domain they are absorbed using a passive wave absorption zone implemented as a free surface damping layer büchmann et al 1998 a spatially varying damping coefficient is used to provide incremental energy absorption as the scattered waves propagate outwards up to this point the behaviour of the velocity potential at far field vertical control surfaces beyond the wave damping zones have yet to be defined given that the scattered outgoing waves would have been absorbed by the wave absorption zone the velocity potential and its normal derivative at the far field control surfaces would be equal to zero therefore the boundary condition at these boundaries can be defined using the following expression 15 vertical far field control surface boundary condition ϕ s ϕ s n 0 on s c far field control surfaces 3 3 modifications to linear potential flow model modifications to the free surface and body boundary conditions of the time domain linear potential flow model are next described aimed at incorporating the dissipative effects of vortex shedding and skin friction body boundary condition modifications relating to skin friction losses are justified based on the fact that work done against frictional shear stresses is confined to the thin boundary layers immediately next to the body boundaries it thus follows that the amount of skin friction losses should be related to the extent of the wetted boundaries for vortex shedding losses it may be argued that modifications should also be applied at the vessels body boundaries based on the fact that vortices are likely to be shed at hull regions where a large change in shape occurs however initial viscous simulations showed that the amount of energy loss due to vortex shedding is related to gap width also there are two effects on side by side vessels due vortex shedding that should be accounted for one of which is the force exerted at the point of shedding and the other effect is that shed vortices continue to remove energy from the gap water volume between two side by side vessels further reducing the free surface elevation even after the initial shedding from the hull corners by using a dissipative term in the free surface boundary condition to account for vortex shedding it is implied that any lateral effects arising from shed vortices exert their influence in the form of damping in the vertical direction i e by reducing the free surface elevation physically vortices shed from hull bilge corners into the gap affect the local flow field as these vortices evolve at a small distance away from the sides of the vessels and may change the pressure distribution on the side shells of the adjacent vessels exerting a certain amount of lateral forcing the changes in pressure distribution will also interact with the oscillating boundary layers at the sides of the vessels indirectly influencing the amount of skin friction losses for the present research it is assumed that these lateral effects are small and can be neglected 3 3 1 free surface boundary condition with dissipation in this subsection the theoretical justification for using an additional damping term in the free surface boundary condition is developed based on the damped free surface boundary conditions derived by dutykh 2009 for predicting decay of gravity waves this appears to be the first time a theoretical justification is provided for the damping lid free surface boundary condition in the literature reviewed earlier the dissipative term has been described as a numerical tool to provide artificial damping in potential flow models dutykh 2009 derived the damped free surface boundary conditions by considering the balance of stresses at the free surface of a weakly dissipative fluid governed by the linearised navier stokes equations the authors applied helmholtz leray decomposition to split the primitive viscous flow variables into potential and solenoidal components the linearised boundary conditions from dutykh 2009 are reproduced here for reference as follows 16 ζ t ϕ z 2 ν 2 ζ where z ζ and 17 ϕ t g ζ 2 ν 2 ϕ z 2 where z ζ by first differentiating eq 17 with respect to time and substituting eq 16 into it these two boundary conditions can be combined into one as shown in eq 18 18 2 ϕ t 2 g ϕ z 2 ν 3 ϕ t z 2 a g 2 ζ b where z ζ the term a in eq 18 can be re expressed in terms of ϕ by assuming that ϕ is a product of a spatial component φ and a complex time harmonic component e i ω t use of the latter term implies sinusoidal motion of the free surface in time by differentiating ϕ where ϕ φ e i ω t with respect to time and back substituting into a eq 19 can be obtained 19 3 ϕ t z 2 i ω 2 ϕ z 2 for the term b the components of 2 ζ can also be re expressed in terms of ϕ by differentiating eq 17 twice with respect to x and y since ζ f x y t on z 0 as follows 20 2 ζ x 2 1 g i ω 2 ϕ x 2 2 ν g 4 ϕ x 2 z 2 and 2 ζ y 2 1 g i ω 2 ϕ y 2 2 ν g 4 ϕ y 2 z 2 substituting eqs 19 and 20 into 18 give 21 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z i 2 ν ω 2 ϕ z 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 4 ν 2 4 ϕ x 2 z 2 4 ϕ y 2 z 2 o ν 2 the second square bracketed term on the right hand side can be ignored for flows where the value of ν is small the range is given in dutykh 2009 as between 10 6 m 2 s to 10 3 m 2 s since the typical values of the ratio between turbulent and kinematic viscosities is of the order of 10 see e g chen et al 2001 and nguyen et al 2013 it is reasonable to assume that this term can also be dropped for cases where viscous dissipation occur due to vortex shedding i e where it is more realistic to use ν as a representation of eddy viscosity rather than kinematic viscosity thus the free surface boundary condition can be re written as follows 22 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z i 2 ν ω 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ z 2 in order to express eq 22 in a form similar to the damping lid free surface boundary condition proposed in chen 2005 it is necessary to have a term simply multiplying ϕ on its right hand side this is done by differentiating ϕ with respect to the spatial coordinates in the following manner 23 ϕ φ x y z e i ω t 24 n ϕ x n n φ x n e i ω t n φ x n ϕ φ n ϕ y n n φ y n e i ω t n φ y n ϕ φ n ϕ z n n φ z n e i ω t n φ z n ϕ φ these partial differentials can be substituted into eq 22 as follows 25 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z 2 ν φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 ε i ω ϕ by using ε to represent the group of right hand side terms containing the spatial velocity potential component φ the above equation can be re expressed in the following form 26 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z i ε ω ϕ implied in this intermediate step is the simplifying assumption that either i the terms φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 and 2 φ z 2 remain constant or ii the terms can be expressed as some form of time and space averaged constant since the second derivatives of the velocity potential component φ in x y and z directions represent the velocity gradients in these three directions assumption i is only appropriate for cases where the gap response corresponds to a piston mode in all three cartesian directions i e uniform throughout the gap for three dimensional side by side vessel configurations it is necessary to apply assumption ii due to the presence of openings at the bow aft openings of the gap this assumption will also be used in the derivation of an expression to calculate the value of ε which will be presented in the next subsection it should also be noted that ε is linearly related to the viscosity term and spatial derivatives of the velocity components 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 and inversely related to the spatial component of velocity potential φ by using the linear dispersion relation the above equation can be further re expressed in the same form as eq 13 of chen 2005 this is shown in the following 27 k ϕ ϕ z i ε k ϕ where ω 2 gk ε ε ω one may observe from eq 27 that the complex time harmonic term can be cancelled out from both sides of the equation for use in frequency domain potential flow models for the time domain potential flow code presented in the earlier sections time stepping of the solution is carried out using the dynamic and kinematic free surface boundary conditions instead of the combined free surface boundary conditions eq 27 it is thus necessary to allocate the damping term of eq 27 to one of these boundary conditions to facilitate numerical implementation by observation the modified dynamic free surface boundary condition can be re expressed with the damping term ε as follows 28 ϕ t g ζ ε ϕ 3 3 2 expression to calculate the free surface damping coefficient ε in lu et al 2012 an expression is derived to calculate the potential flow free surface boundary condition damping term from the results of two dimensional viscous simulations by assuming that the additional dissipation in the gap can be expressed as an additional hydrostatic pressure acting on the gap free surface the authors assumed that this additional hydrostatic pressure is proportional to the decrease in free surface response due to viscous dissipation for this research a similar expression to calculate ε is obtained by considering the rate at which energy is being dissipated in the gap using the modified dynamic free surface boundary condition eq 28 the rate of energy dissipation can be obtained by multiplying both sides of eq 28 with the vertical velocity at which the gap free surface is moving i e as a product of the dynamic pressure and velocity in the following manner 29 ρ ζ t ϕ t ζ t ρ g ζ ζ t ρ ε ϕ physically this implies that the gap water volume dissipates energy at a rate that is equal to the sum of work done against gravity in moving the free surface first term on right hand side and the work done against vortex shedding second term on the right hand side for a given transverse slice across the control volume the time averaged amount of work done against vortex shedding can be calculated by integrating the second term on the right hand side across the gap over a pre specified duration as follows 30 dwd gap 1 t τ τ t b g 2 b g 2 ζ t ρ ε ϕ dy dt where wd gap is the work done against vortex shedding τ is the nominal start time for time integration and b g is the gap width interestingly eq 30 above derived based on work done by dynamic pressure at the gap free surface has the same form as eq 22 in lu et al 2012 which relates the total amount of energy dissipated through viscosity with the work done against an additional hydrostatic pressure the integral of eq 30 has been derived in lu et al 2012 and is shown in the following expression 31 dwd gap 1 2 ρ gb g ε ω 2 ω 2 ε 2 ζ 0 2 where ζ 0 is the free surface response amplitude note that in eq 31 ζ 0 is a single value implying an assumption that the free surface response across the gap is piston mode for a given transverse slice since results from viscous simulations of fixed floating vessels showed only a small amount of variations in free surface elevation across the gap this assumption is a reasonable approximation for the work done at each transverse slice the response along the gap however cannot be assumed to be piston mode due to the openings at both ends of the gap where influence of the background incident waves and the scattering of waves around the exterior of the adjacent vessels cannot be neglected it may be recalled that in the previous section it was assumed that the velocity gradients in the cartesian directions 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 can be expressed as a time and space averaged constant this assumption is extended to the gap free surface elevation ζ so that the three dimensional rate of work done can be calculated using a value that has been spatially averaged in both transverse and longitudinal directions ζ this can be thought of as smearing the vortex shedding dissipation along and across the gap the average three dimensional rate of work done by the gap free surface wd gap due to the additional dynamic pressure arising from vortex shedding at the bilge corners can be thus calculated using the following expression 32 wd gap x l 2 x l 2 dw gap dx 1 2 ρ gb g l ε ω 2 ω 2 ε 2 ζ 2 the rate of work done against vortex shedding effects can be equated to the energy dissipation rate obtained by applying the energy decomposition method proposed in section 2 3 4 to the results of the viscous simulations by expressing the energy dissipation rate due to vortex shedding effects obtained from viscous simulations as wd gap visc an appropriate value of free surface damping term ε can be obtained using the following expression 33 wd gap visc wd gap ρ gb g l ε ω 2 ζ 2 2 ω 2 ε 2 leading to ε ω 2 ε 2 2 wd gap visc ρ gb g l ω 2 ζ 2 the calculated value of ε is subsequently used in the modified free surface boundary condition as part of the time domain potential flow solver to model energy loss through vortex shedding action 3 3 3 body boundary condition with dissipation an impedance boundary condition obtained by adding an impedance term to the body boundary condition is used to model skin friction dissipation by the wetted hull surfaces in this research however changes in amount of dissipation due to variations in wetted surface area are not modelled this is because the present method is based on a linear potential flow model that relies on a taylor s series expansion of flow variables about the time invariant mean water level which subsequently is represented numerically as a time constant mesh nonetheless for more sophisticated nonlinear potential flow models variations in skin friction losses due to changes in wetted hull surface area arising from body motions could be automatically accounted for using the impedance boundary condition proposed in this research this may be worth investigation in future work dalrymple 1992 used an impedance boundary condition to model the dissipative effects of jetties on waves propagating along a channel as follows 34 ϕ n i γ ϕ where γ is the impedance of the jetties the earlier assumption where the velocity potential ϕ is equal to the product of spatial and complex time harmonic components can be differentiated twice with respect to time and re arranged into the following equation 35 i ϕ 1 ω ϕ t substituting eq 35 into eq 34 the impedance boundary condition for the body surfaces can be expressed in the following form 36 ϕ n γ ω σ ϕ t σ ϕ t where σ is the impedance at the body boundaries due to skin friction by splitting the velocity potential ϕ into scattered and incident components on the left hand side and re arranging the following equation can be obtained 37 ϕ s n ϕ w n σ ϕ t it can be observed from eq 37 that skin friction effects in the form of a mechanical impedance reduce the magnitude of the scattered velocity potential normal derivatives from boundary layer theory the slowing of flow near body boundaries due to fluid shear stresses will result in a normal flux away from those boundaries due to continuity this can be thought of as an effect that displaces the inviscid flow outside of the boundary layer away from the solid surface to make space for the slower shearing fluid layers the extent of displacement is the boundary layer displacement thickness and this normal flux correction is balanced by the inviscid pressure and velocities at the edge of the boundary layer for oscillatory flows the magnitude of normal flux will vary inducing an inwards and outwards movement of the boundary layer edge kristiansen 2009 from the view point of the surrounding inviscid flow part of the incident wave energy will be expended in the form of work done by the dynamic pressure and associated flow velocities at the boundary layer edges this energy is subsequently cascaded into the boundary layers at the respective side shells and used to overcome the local viscous shear stresses via the imaginary interface between the boundary layer and the surrounding inviscid flow field thus a simplifying assumption is made in the present work to directly link the viscous frictional losses within the boundary layer in the form of an impedance term as a linear function of inviscid dynamic pressure acting at the boundary layer s edge via a skin friction coefficient term 3 3 4 expression to calculate body boundary damping coefficient σ in order to quantify the body boundary damping coefficient σ of eq 37 it is necessary to re express the body boundary condition in terms of work done since the rate at which work is done by a fluid can be expressed as a product of velocity and dynamic pressure the work done by the body boundary can be calculated by multiplying both sides of eq 36 with the dynamic pressure ϕ t physically this means that the inviscid gap water volume needs to do work against a time varying pressure exerted by the boundary layers on the relatively inviscid flow outside of the layers this can be expressed in the following manner 38 rate of work done ϕ t ϕ n σ ϕ t 2 the time averaged work done by a given body against skin friction can be calculated by first integrating the rate of work done over the wetted hull surfaces under consideration and across a few cycles of total duration t seconds and subsequently taking the mean work done value over that duration this is shown in the following expression 39 wd skin fric 1 t s bodies τ τ t ϕ t ϕ n dt ds bodies σ t s bodies τ τ t ϕ t 2 dt ds bodies where wd skin fric represents the time averaged skin friction losses obtained from viscous simulations using the component energy approach described in the earlier sections and s bodies represent the hull surfaces where the integration would be carried out eq 39 can be re arranged to obtain the following equation for calculating the value of σ 40 σ t wd skin fric s τ τ t ϕ t 2 dt ds furthermore since eq 37 includes the effects of viscosity in the form of a skin friction impedance term the modified dissipative potential flow dynamic pressure ϕ t can be assumed to be equal to the dynamic pressure field obtained from fully viscous simulations p d for side by side hydrodynamic interactions the dynamic pressure will be equivalent to the excess pressure above hydrostatic i e p of eq 1 it is therefore reasonable to use the latter as an approximation for the former in eq 37 σ can thus be expressed in a discretised form using parameters of the three dimensional fully viscous simulations for the hull surfaces inside the control volume defined in sub section 2 3 2 in the following manner 41 σ t wd skin fric s ns h t nt s c nc f p d c t s 2 area c s where ns h is the number of hull surfaces enclosed within the control volume for calculation of energy dissipation between side by side vessels i e gap facing side shells and hull bottoms s is the hull surface index nt s is the number of time steps in a duration of t seconds t is the time step index nc f is the number of cell faces on the respective hull surfaces c is the cell face index and area is the area of a cell face by using eq 41 values for the body boundary dissipation coefficient σ can be calculated from outputs of fully viscous simulations which can subsequently be used in the modified time domain potential flow solver to account for skin friction energy losses 3 4 modifications to time domain potential flow solver in the preceding sections expressions to calculate time and space averaged gap free surface damping and skin friction impedance damping coefficients have been developed while other forms of damping coefficients that may vary with spatial locations would be possible consideration should be given to whether the added complexity of varying coefficients provides meaningful physical representation of the cross interacting nature of viscous losses furthermore the added complexity should also be weighed against the following points ease of implementation of constant coefficients and reviewed literature e g dalrymple 1992 for dissipation of waves due to jetties lu and chen 2012 for gap response between side by side boxes hong et al 2013 for roll damping of semi submersibles showed good estimates of the behaviour of physical systems can be obtained from constant coefficients given the above considerations it was decided that this research would focus on the development of damping coefficients that are constant for a given incident wave frequency and gap width from a defined control volume using such an approach one would be able to investigate the influence of incident wave frequencies and or gap widths on damping coefficients efficiently for example by calculating the coefficient values at the gap resonant frequency as well as at high and low frequencies a relationship e g trend line can be established and subsequently used to obtain the damping coefficients at other frequencies that have not been modelled using viscous simulations moreover the use of a selected set of viscous simulations would also be more cost effective than experiments or running a full matrix of load cases using viscous simulations changes in hull forms can also be easily made in numerical simulations facilitating parametric studies at early stages of the design cycle in order to incorporate the gap free surface damping and skin friction impedance damping coefficients into the time domain potential flow solver it is necessary to modify the fourth order runge kutta time integration scheme described earlier in section 3 2 the need for this modification can be observed by comparing the conventional linear dynamic free surface and body boundary conditions eqs 10 and 12 against the modified damped linear dynamic free surface and body boundary conditions eqs 28 and 37 the respective vortex shedding and skin friction dissipation terms in the latter two equations are in terms of total velocity potential at the free surface ϕ s 0 and dynamic pressure at the body boundaries ϕ t s bodies while the conventional linear potential flow solver presented in section 3 2 calculates only the scattered field variables given that an undisturbed linear wave field is applied at the initial time step values of total velocity potential ϕ s 0 and dynamic pressure ϕ t s bodies can be directly calculated from the incident wave field the latter value is used in the modified body boundary condition eq 37 to provide the initial estimated values of the scattered normal derivative of velocity potential on the body boundaries ϕ s n s bodies thereafter the green s second identity eq 13 is used to compute the estimated values of scattered velocity potential normal derivatives at the free surface ϕ s z s 0 and the scattered velocity potentials on the body boundaries ϕ s s bodies it should be noted at this point that the value of ϕ t s bodies will be calculated using a simple euler backward scheme in the sub steps and time steps following initialisation since its value will be known for the sub step or time step just before the one being calculated the linear kinematic free surface boundary condition eq 9 is used in conjunction with ϕ s z s 0 to calculate the time derivative of the free surface elevation ζ s t which in turn can be used in the second euler implicit sub step of rk4 to calculate the estimated value of the scattered free surface elevation ζ s at this juncture in the calculation the values of the total velocity potential at the free surface ϕ s 0 are required so that the dissipative effects of vortex shedding can be accounted for in the damped linear dynamic free surface boundary condition eq 28 when calculating the total dynamic pressure at the free surface ϕ t s 0 at the first rk4 sub steps of the initial time step ϕ s 0 is assumed to be equal to the undisturbed incident wave field subsequently ϕ s 0 can be reconstructed by summing the last known estimated values of the scattered component ϕ s s 0 obtained at preceding rk4 sub steps or time steps and the known incident values ϕ w s 0 at the corresponding time steps the initial estimated values of ϕ t s 0 calculated from the previous paragraph is used to update ϕ s 0 by subtracting away the known incident component ϕ w s 0 the updated value of ϕ s s 0 can be obtained which can be used together with ϕ s n s bodies once again in the green s second identity to give corresponding updated values of ϕ s z s 0 and ϕ s s bodies this process is repeated for two more times so that four sets of estimated ϕ s z s 0 and ϕ s s bodies are obtained the final values of these variables are obtained using a weighted sum in the final rk4 sub step the flow solution is marched forward in time in the manner described above until the end of the simulation duration 4 concluding remarks an analysis framework for quantifying the amount of viscous dissipation and thereafter incorporating those dissipation effects into a modified linear potential flow model is developed the framework facilitates modelling of flow interaction between side by side vessels in the early part of a design cycle before model tests are conducted and uses viscous simulations to provide flow field data for quantifying the amount of energy loss through viscous flow processes of vortex shedding and skin friction effects the energy loss components are subsequently applied as dissipative terms in a modified potential flow model these modifications including the associated expressions for calculating the coefficient values of the dissipative terms are presented applications of this new approach are described in detail in part ii chua et al 2017 together with a discussion on the relative efficiency of using this approach compared with the use of viscous cfd simulations to analyse a full load case matrix of side by side configurations acknowledgements this work has been

23132,an analysis framework is developed in this paper to model the behaviour of a partially entrapped water volume between two vessels in a side by side arrangement the framework is based on a viscous cfd model and comprises two components namely an approach for quantifying the amount of incident wave energy transferred to other physical processes and a methodology to convert the viscous energy loss components into dissipative coefficients that are subsequently added to a modified linear potential flow model the framework can be used to account for the effects of viscosity without reliance on model test data being available this is useful at the early stages of a flng development when the operability of various hull forms may be assessed usually using conventional inviscid potential flow models and before model tests are carried out it is well known that the near resonant gap free surface responses may be several times that of the incident wave height and accurate prediction of the elevations will require modelling of viscous effects in this paper details of the analysis framework are developed the framework is later used to calculate the gap free surface elevations and forcings on side by side barges which are discussed and presented in an accompanying paper part ii keywords side by side hydrodynamics viscous effects dissipation potentialflow gap resonance 1 introduction this work is motivated by the need to accurately and efficiently assess the hydrodynamic interaction effects between two vessels in a side by side configuration such as during the offloading of cargo from a flng platform onto a shuttle tanker this is because occurrence of large gap free surface elevations due to resonant or near resonant response of the gap water volume may pose a direct risk to the personnel and equipment involved in the offloading operations or result in large loads and motions that affect the operability of cargo transfer or other topsides process equipment at the present moment circa 2016 the industry uses a combination of model tests and potential flow models with added artificial damping terms to assess the gap free surface response several forms for the added damping terms which are calibrated against model test data have been proposed in huijsmans et al 2001 the authors observed excessively large gap responses in their linear potential flow model of a lng tanker moored alongside a flng platform due to the omission of viscous dissipative effects a rigid lid free surface boundary condition for the partially trapped water volume between the two vessels is used to suppress those responses chen 2005 modified the rigid lid approach by introducing into the free surface boundary condition a damping term commonly referred to as a damping lid whose strength is proportional to the gap water velocity pauw et al 2007 compared three dimensional numerical results of two side by side lng carriers with those obtained from experimental tests and found that there is no unique damping ratio for gap sizes of less than 25m calibrating the damping term to match first order experimental measurements would reduce the agreement of second order drift forces and vice versa newman 2003 proposed the use of chebychev polynomials to represent the generalized response modes of the gap free surface where damping factors can be used to represent the viscous dissipative effects both the number of response modes and values of damping factors would require calibration against model test data fournier et al 2006 compared the numerical predictions obtained from the damping lid and the generalized response modes methods against model test results and a third numerical method where an array of massless damping plates is placed on the gap free surface to dissipate energy similar to earlier methods the damping value to be applied on the plates requires calibration against model test data lu et al 2012 proposed using the fluid stress tensor calculated using results from viscous flow modelling to calculate the rate of viscous dissipation between two side by side vessels within a given control volume the dissipation rate is subsequently used to determine the damping lid value that will be applied to the gap free surface in a potential flow model using an expression derived by the authors two control volume definitions are tested and the one which gives better gap free surface response prediction compared to experimental data is recommended hong et al 2013 combined the damping lid approach with a damped body boundary condition referred to as wetted surface damping in their frequency domain potential flow models in order to calculate drift forces and gap resonance between two side by side vessels the same numerical value is used for both the free surface damping lid term and the wetted surface damping term for ship roll damping studies chakrabarti 2001 noted that skin friction losses do not scale in a linear manner with length unlike other damping components himeno 1981 estimated that the frictional component of roll damping at full scale is about 1 20 1 30 times of model scale given these considerations the lumping of dissipation due to different flow processes into a single damping lid term based on calibration against model tests or viscous simulations whose length scales differ from the actual side by side vessels will result in inaccurate modelling of the viscous energy dissipation following from the foregoing literature review an analysis framework for the modelling of hydrodynamic interaction between side by side floating bodies is developed in this paper part i of a two part work the two components of the framework are presented namely i an approach for quantifying the amount of incident wave energy that is being transferred to other physical processes due to the presence of the two vessels and splitting them into components representative of each of the processes and ii a method for incorporating the relevant viscous dissipative effects into linear potential flow via proposed modifications the framework is developed to address two issues that may arise in the design of vessels operating in side by side configurations firstly at the early stages of the design cycle before model tests are conducted effects of hull form changes on a flng platform s performance would need to be assessed secondly even when comparable model test data is available e g from vessels with similar hull forms the scaling effect of viscous dissipation is unknown in part ii chua et al 2017 the framework is applied to the case of two identical fixed floating side by side barges under the influence of regular waves different bilge corner geometries are investigated namely sharp bilge corners 90 between side shells and bottom and bilge corners with radii of 1m 2m 4m and 6m values of gap free surface elevation sway heave and roll forcings predicted using the modified potential flow model item ii above are compared against corresponding values obtained using a viscous flow solver openfoam a two step framework is proposed for the analysis of hydrodynamic interactions between side by side rigidly fixed floating vessels for the first step of the framework viscous simulations are carried out for a selected number of load cases such as at the low and high incident wave frequencies and at the estimated gap resonant frequencies the resulting viscous flow field data is used to quantify the total amount of incident wave energy being transferred to other physical processes and that amount is split into components representative of those individual processes the approach for quantifying and splitting the transferred incident wave energy into components is explained in section 2 3 in the second step the amount of energy that is dissipated through the viscous processes of vortex shedding and skin friction effects are used to calculate values of dissipative coefficients for terms that will be added to a modified linear potential flow model the modifications together with expressions for calculating the respective dissipative coefficients are presented in section 3 3 2 viscous modelling it is well known that viscous effects are critical when modelling hydrodynamic interactions between side by side vessels in this paper viscous modelling of the hydrodynamic interaction between side by side fixed floating vessels and regular incident waves is investigated to serve the following three purposes i to study influence of viscosity on gap free surface response and forcing ii to provide flow field data so that the amount of incident wave energy that is being transferred to other flow processes can be quantified and iii to use values of gap free surface elevation sway heave and roll forcings as comparison against corresponding predictions from a modified potential flow model 2 1 viscous solver viscous flow interaction between the side by side vessels and incident waves is modelled using the open source c solver library openfoam weller and new 2008 the library uses a finite volume method to discretise the computational domain into cells inside this domain the viscous flow is governed by the mass and momentum conservation equations as shown in the following expressions 1 u 0 and ρ u t ρ u u p g x ρ ρ μ u where u is the velocity vector x is the cartesian coordinate vector t represents time ρ is the density of fluid g is the gravitational acceleration p is the excess pressure above hydrostatic and μ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid in the computational domain both air and water are modelled as a single fluid the volume of fluid vof approach is used to model the air water interface using a phase fraction scalar α transport of α is governed by the following equation 2 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where u r is the relative velocity between the air and water phases compared to the original phase fraction transport equation proposed by hirt and nichols 1981 eq 2 includes an additional convective term last term on left hand side which provides additional compression at the air water interface the amount of compression depends on the relative velocity between air and water phases u r and it acts to reduce the numerical diffusion of α across mesh cells berberovic 2010 the incompressible flow is solved using a segregated approach that combines two well known solution methods the piso issa 1986 and simple patankar and spalding 1972 algorithms into a combined approach called pimple the open source wave generation toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 is used for the generation and absorption of waves into and out of the computational domain the toolbox uses spatial relaxation zones in which desired velocity and phase fraction values are blended with computed values across spatial dimensions 2 2 validation the viscous solver s ability to model free surface flows in narrow gaps between three adjacent fixed boxes is validated by comparing the predicted values of free surface elevations with published experimental iwata et al 2007 and numerical results lu et al 2010 in these two dimensional simulations three side by side adjacent boxes representing fixed floating barges are subjected to linear regular waves generated at one end of the flow domain and absorbed at the opposite end the hydrodynamic response in the narrow gaps between the boxes in terms of free surface elevation are monitored for a range of wavelengths the set up of the validation simulations is shown in fig 1 note that the simulation domain shown in the figure has been truncated the wave inlet and outlet relaxation zones lie to left and right hand side of what is shown a mesh convergence study is first carried out at kd 1 307 where k represents the wavenumber and d is the water depth iwata et al 2007 observed the largest upstream gap response at this kd value mesh sizes ranging from about 32 000 cells to about 200 000 cells are used to investigate mesh dependency of free surface elevation in gaps and to determine the optimal mesh size for subsequent validation simulations fig 2 plots the steady state free surface response amplitude in the upstream and downstream gaps against the total number of cells in the mesh the response amplitudes in the upstream and downstream gaps exhibit a combination of oscillatory and monotonic convergent behaviours stern et al 2001 this is likely due to a combination of complex flow behaviour in the two narrow gaps and the complex mesh geometry where cell spacing reduces towards the three bodies and in the narrow gaps and expands away from them the plot shows a clear convergent trend towards asymptotic response values for both the upstream and downstream gaps for both gaps the differences between the largest and smallest values of free surface elevations are around 6 7 of the asymptotic values and the differences in the results from the 150 000 cell mesh and the asymptotic values are less than 1 the 150 000 cell mesh is therefore used for the subsequent validation simulations it should be highlighted at this point that in addition to the number of cells investigations have also been carried out to ensure that the meshes of a given density have sufficient resolution in terms of cell height and cell length for the simulated wave heights and wave lengths as well as to capture the wave particle velocity profile ten simulations were carried out for kd values ranging from 1 000 to 2 000 for a simulation duration of 40s each this simulation duration corresponds to around 24 39 wave cycles for the range of kd investigated and based on earlier test runs would allow the gap free surface responses to settle into steady state responses of around 12 17 cycles fig 3 shows the free surface elevation values at four locations the wave inlet labelled as inlet just before hitting the first upstream box labelled as incident and in the up and downstream gaps labelled as upstream gap and downstream gap respectively for kd 1 307 which correspond to when resonant responses occur in the two gaps it can be noted from the figure that steady state responses have been achieved also no wave breaking was observed in the gap despite the high resonant responses this observation together with the good comparison in terms of response amplitudes with both published experimental data iwata et al 2007 and numerical results obtained using a different viscous solver lu et al 2010 indicates that physically wave breaking would not occur for the load cases analysed the free surface responses obtained from the simulations are non dimensionalised against incident wave heights and plotted against kd in figs 4 a and b together with the experimental iwata et al 2007 and numerical lu et al 2010 results it should be noted that the latter includes output from both viscous based on finite element method and potential flow based on boundary element method solvers the boundary element method applies an artificial free surface damping value of 0 5 using the approach proposed by chen 2005 it can be observed from the figures that the results obtained using the viscous solver denoted as openfoam show good agreement with both the corresponding experimental and numerical values it is worth noting that the double peak nature of the upstream gap response curve has been captured by the viscous solver compared to the experimental data iwata et al 2007 the viscous solver over predicts the first resonant peak response in the upstream gap by about 5 the over prediction by the numerical openfoam model may be due to the fact that additional mechanisms of energy dissipation such as from side walls of the experimental wave flume were not modelled in the 2 dimensional numerical model it is worth nothing at this point that the wave generation and absorption capability of the viscous solver has been checked before the fore going validation simulations are carried out first order linear waves are generated at one end of the solution domain and allowed to propagate across it before being absorbed by the absorption outlet relaxation zone in the opposite end the free surface elevations at various locations within the computational domain are monitored and compared against analytical values this capability is subsequently extended to the generation and absorption of focussed wave events in a separate research the free surface elevations and velocity profiles of focussed waves are compared with analytical predictions and experimental data in bahuguni et al 2015 2 3 balance of energy components the approach for quantifying the amount of incident wave energy that is being transferred to other physical processes is based on the balance of energy components in a given control volume which encompasses the two vessels and can be thought of as an adaptation of the component roll damping method developed for the prediction of viscous roll damping effects in ships see e g himeno 1981 the energy balance equation for such a system is assumed to be of the following form 3 e t e wave e friction e vortices e appendages e bodies where e t represents the amount of incident wave excitation energy transferred to the right hand side terms due to interactions between the side by side vessels and the incident wave field e wave represents the amount of incident wave energy that is expended through scattered waves e friction represents the work done against skin friction at the hull surfaces e vortices represents the amount of incident wave energy dissipated due to vortex shedding effects e appendages represents the additional amount of wave energy being transferred away from the incident wave field due to the presence of appendages and e bodies represents the amount of energy required to move the vessels if they are free floating as is the case with the component roll damping method it may be argued that eq 3 may not be hydrodynamically correct given the fact that the various physical mechanisms of energy dissipation may act concurrently with cross interaction especially for the complex flow scenario of side by side bodies in this regard we would like to point out that eq 3 is based on heuristic and physical reasoning we would further argue that it is due the flow complexities that such an approach needs to be taken so that the intractably intertwined flow phenomena can be broken down into quantifiable components that can be applied to engineering problems at this stage it may be noted that the value of transferred incident wave energy is dependent on the size of the control volume as such the extent of the control volume i e size and boundaries should only be defined after considering the influence of the relevant right hand side components which in this case will be the wave scattering term this is discussed in the following sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 methods to calculate the remaining four components skin friction vortex shedding additional dissipation due to appendages and body motion are discussed in the respective sections 2 3 3 2 3 4 2 3 5 and 2 3 6 2 3 1 total energy dissipation the amount of incident wave energy being dissipated within a predefined control volume can be obtained by first calculating the energy flux across vertical boundaries of the volume and the free surface the net energy flux across all boundaries is subsequently integrated to obtain the total amount of energy lost within the boundaries over a given duration at each vertical boundary the energy flux due to the flow can be calculated as the product of dynamic pressure exerted on the boundary and the normal velocity of fluid passing through the boundary it should be noted that the vertical dimension of the boundaries change with time due to the constantly evolving free surface this means that the height of any surface piercing vertical boundaries should change with the wave field and similarly the shape of the free surface boundary should also change however depending on how the control volume is defined not all vertical boundaries will be surface piercing for example by terminating the boundaries upper edge at bottoms of the floating bodies it should be noted that by using a control volume approach the value of e t will depend on the extent of the control volume and as such the volume s boundaries can only be defined after considering the influence of certain energy dissipation components this is elaborated in the next subsection the total energy dissipated in the control volume is defined as 4 e t s τ τ t p t v n t dt ds where s represents the boundaries of the control volume τ represents the nominal start time of the time integral t represents the duration over which integration is carried out p t represents the instantaneous pressure acting on a particular point on the boundaries of the control volume and v n t represents the instantaneous normal velocity of fluid at a particular point on the control volume s boundaries corresponding to the value of the instantaneous pressure 2 3 2 energy lost through wave scattering wave scattering due to surface piercing bodies such as ships and offshore structures is known to be a predominantly inviscid flow phenomena that can be accurately predicted using potential flow models since one of the motivations of this research is to quantify viscous losses in order to improve the accuracy of potential flow models the energy dissipation effects from wave scattering should be omitted as far as possible even if these effects are small for hull geometries commonly found in ship and floating offshore platforms kawahara and maekawa 2008 this is to minimise double counting when the additional terms representative of viscous dissipation are added back to the modified linear potential flow model for side by side vessels it can be envisaged that wave scattering will take place within the narrow gap between the adjacent vessels and in the surrounding fluid body to the exterior of both vessels and the gap within the gap flow is likely to be vigorous and dominated by viscous processes it is therefore assumed that the influence of viscous processes will dominate while wave scattering damping is negligible for the surrounding exterior zone wave scattering effects can be omitted by defining the control volume s boundaries such that they correspond to the outward facing side shells of the two adjacent vessels and the longitudinal boundaries correspond to the longitudinal extent of the vessels in plan view the boundaries of the control volume are the areas that surround the two vessels and the partially entrapped body of water in the gap fig 5 below shows the definition of the control volume in elevation and plan view by using the control volume definition shown in fig 5 the influence of wave radiation damping on the overall energy dissipation is limited to the small gap region where its effects can be reasonably assumed to be negligible it should be mentioned that a similar control volume definition is used for the calculation of dissipation rate using the fluid stress tensor in lu et al 2012 however in that paper the authors tested two nominally defined control volumes and selected the one that gave a better agreement with experimental data in contrast the control volume definition described in the section is based the separation of energy components eq 3 and the need to exclude the incident wave energy losses due to wave radiation damping given that this effect is already accounted for in linear potential flow another significant difference between the approach proposed in this paper and that of lu et al 2012 is the method for calculating viscous dissipation in this paper this value is calculated as the net energy flux across all the boundaries of the control volume while in lu et al 2012 the volume integral of the fluid stress tensor is used since the boundaries vary with the square of a given control volume s dimensions while the volume varies with the cube of the dimensions it may be inferred that the approach proposed in this paper is more efficient 2 3 3 frictional energy dissipation in order to overcome fluid shear stress in the regions close to the adjacent hulls energy is expended and converted into internal energy of the fluid in this research the amount of energy loss due to skin friction is calculated by first estimating the frictional force coefficients of the hull surfaces using an empirical formula kato s formula has been used in this research as it accounts for the laminar to turbulent transition often found in flows around ships and floating offshore structures lloyd 1989 the formula originally used to determine the contribution of frictional forces to ship roll damping is given in the following expression 5 c f 1 328 r n 0 5 0 014 r n 0 114 where r n is the reynold s number this can be calculated using the following definition which is commonly used in studies of oscillatory boundary layer flows jensen et al 1989 6 r n au 0 ν where a is the characteristic length and is calculated as the amplitude of relative oscillatory motions between the body surface s and the surrounding water body u 0 is the reference free stream velocity amplitude and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water it should be noted that an alternative expression for r n defined in terms of relative roll angle and roll frequency is sometimes used in naval architecture in combination with eq 5 kato s formula eq 6 uses a global reference frame while the alternative expression uses one that is vessel centric to account for relative motions between a moving body and the moving free surface the values of u 0 in eq 6 are sampled across a plane running through the gap centreline this is to ensure that the flow velocities are obtained at locations inside the gap that are sufficiently offset from either of the side by side hull surfaces for cases where the vessels are free to move the reference velocity amplitudes are obtained by taking the amplitude of the difference between body motion velocities and the reference free stream velocities in cases where the adjacent floating vessels are constrained such that no motions are allowed as is the case in this research the reference velocity amplitudes would be equal to solely the velocity amplitudes of gap fluid response based on the above a method for calculating skin friction energy loss is proposed and described in the following steps 1 firstly it is assumed that the total skin friction losses at the gap facing side shells can be calculated as a summation of losses at transverse sections taken along the length of the gap and surrounding vessels secondly each transverse section is further divided in the vertical direction into panels which correspond to hull boundary cell faces of numerical models this second discretisation step is required due to the fact that both the free surface responses and flow velocities in the gap may not be uniform in the vertical direction since particle velocities of the background incident wave field decays exponentially with water depth 2 at each transverse section the relative motion is calculated as the difference between the steady state oscillatory gap motion response taken in the middle of the gap and roll motions similarly the relative velocity is the difference between the motion velocity of the vessel and the surrounding fluid s tangential relative velocity components these two datasets are subsequently used to the calculate r n using eq 6 3 calculations are made of the skin frictional coefficient using eq 5 kato s formula and subsequently the instantaneous rate of work done against friction on each hull panel using c f values of the transverse section on which the hull panel belongs to this is shown in the following expression 7 de friction i k 1 2 ρ a i k c f i u 0 reference 2 i k friction force u 0 reference i k where de friction i k represents the frictional losses at a hull panel with centroid at x i and z k c f i represents the frictional coefficient at the transverse section where x i a i k represents the wetted area of the hull panel u 0 reference i k represents the reference velocity amplitude between the gap water column and the body motions if vessels are free floating 4 the instantaneous rate of frictional energy loss for the two adjacent barges on their respective gap facing side shells is calculated by summing up the hull panel losses the calculation steps above do not include the frictional losses at the hull bottoms of the two adjacent barges noting that suitable values of u 0 need to be defined for these horizontal hull surfaces while accounting for the fact that in general the values of water particle velocity increase exponentially from the seabed to the free surface due to the background incident wave field however close to the hull bottoms the no slip condition on the hull bottom patches mean that the flow velocity magnitude will decrease closer to these patches even though the depths are shallower this means that there exists a horizontal plane where the velocity and its associated x y and z components will be maximum at a small distance away from the hull bottom patches but sufficiently far away from the seabed this plane referred to as the bottom reference velocity sampling plane is identified as an initial step in the post processing following the numerical simulations thereafter the calculation of skin friction energy losses at hull bottoms of the two adjacent vessels follow the same steps as the losses at the side shells albeit with the minor adjustment that the reference velocity will be defined as u 0 reference i j where i represents the longitudinal coordinate and j represents the transverse coordinate once the instantaneous frictional losses at the hull bottoms and gap facing side shells of the adjacent vessels have been determined the time averaged frictional work done is subsequently calculated by integrating over a certain number of oscillatory gap response cycles and dividing by the total time duration of those cycles the positions of gap and bottom reference velocity sampling planes are shown schematically in fig 6 note that the position of the bottom sampling plane is not to scale it is shown to be lower deeper in order to differentiate it from the actual hull bottoms 2 3 4 vortex shedding energy dissipation the wave driven flow of water in and out of the gap between the side by side vessels may separate around the regions where the vessels hull forms change rapidly due to the large pressure gradients being set up the flow separation and subsequent shedding of vortices dissipates fluid kinetic energy into internal energy of the fluid at present calculation of vortex shedding dissipation either through direct numerical simulations dns or the relatively more efficient large eddy simulations les requires significant time and computational resources full scale computation using these viscous flow models is impracticable for engineering use especially given that a non trivial number of wave cycles 15 is required before steady state gap response is attained an indirect approach is therefore proposed in this research where the vortex shedding losses are simply the residual amount after subtracting all the other right hand side terms that are present calculated using the approaches described in the preceding and subsequent subsections from the left hand side term of eq 3 e t 2 3 5 appendages energy dissipation the energy dissipation due to flow around appendages is a complex interaction of skin friction losses vortex shedding and other physical processes a further complexity arises from the fact that the appendages will also change the flow around the main hull surfaces quantification of each of those interaction effects is impracticable if not impossible the most practicable way to quantify the viscous dissipation due to appendages is to conduct two sets of numerical simulations model tests where the first set uses clean hulls without any appendages and a second set with all appendages present the difference in energy dissipation between the two sets of results will be attributed to the presence of appendages the dissipation value quantified in this manner also facilitates comparison between different appendage configurations in terms of effectiveness in reducing motions or responses at this point it should be noted that this energy dissipation component will not be investigated in this research as it requires specific functional specifications to be defined for the vessels such as the number and type of risers in order to estimate the size of riser balconies 2 3 6 body motion in cases where the side by side vessels are free to move some of the incident wave energy will be transferred to drive those motions this means that part of the energy provided by the incident wave field will be converted into the vessels kinetic and potential energies which can be calculated using vessels displacement and velocity values note that the side by side configurations investigated in this paper assume that the vessels are rigidly fixed and thus this component will not be quantified nonetheless the proposed approach is provided for completeness and may be expanded upon in future research 3 linear potential flow solver 3 1 governing equations in this research a conventional time domain linear potential flow solver based on a higher order boundary element method hobem is developed as a basis for subsequent modifications aimed at incorporating viscous dissipation the linear potential flow governing equations are given in the following expressions 8 laplace equation 2 ϕ s 0 in d potential 9 linear kinematic free surface condition ϕ s z ζ s t 0 on s 0 where z 0 10 linear dynamic free surface condition ϕ s t g ζ s 0 on s 0 where z 0 11 linear seabed boundary condition ϕ s z 0 at z d 12 linear body condition ϕ s n ϕ w n on s bodies where the computational domain occupied by the ideal fluid and defined using a cartesian coordinate system with origin on the mean sea level scattered wave field total values of flow field variables can be represents the free surface elevation d represents the water depth s bodies represents the body boundaries and s 0 represents the free surface boundary in addition to the linearisation process the velocity potential ϕ and free surface elevation ζ are also split into components representing contributions from the incident and the scattered wave fields these are denoted respectively by the superscripts w and s it should be noted that calculations are carried out only for the recovered by adding the known incident components to the calculated scattered values 3 2 numerical implementation to facilitate the subsequent explanation of the modifications made to incorporate the effects of viscosity the numerical implementation methodology of the linear potential flow analysis is briefly recapitulated here a boundary integral equation is adopted with green s theorem being applied to the laplace equation governing the velocity potential eq 8 to convert the three dimensional problem to one involving surface integrals at the boundaries enclosing the domain by noting that either the scattered velocity potential ϕ s or its normal derivative ϕ s n is known on each of the surfaces that define the potential flow region i e free surface s 0 far field control surfaces s c and solid boundaries such as seabed and body boundaries s bodies the linear boundary value problem defined by the above equations can be solved using green s second identity a rankine source and its image about the seabed is used as the green s function g x x 0 with the assumption of a flat and horizontal seabed these are shown in the following expressions 13 c x 0 ϕ x 0 s g x x 0 ϕ n x ds s g x x 0 n ϕ x ds and g x x 0 1 4 π 1 r 1 1 r 2 where s represents the entire potential flow region such that s s 0 s bodies s c x 0 represent the points in the field over which sources are distributed x represent the points of observation and c x 0 represents the solid angle at x 0 r 1 and r 2 represent the rankine source and its image about the seabed defined respectively as r 1 x x 0 1 and r 2 x x 0 2 x x y z represents the computational point x 0 1 x 0 y 0 z 0 represents the source point x 0 2 x 0 y 0 z 0 2 d represents the reflection of x 0 1 about the seabed the bounding surfaces of d potential can be categorised into neumann and dirichlet surfaces each defined using a separate set of integrals and arranged according to the unknowns to be solved by discretising these bounding surfaces using quadratic isoparametric 8 noded elements gauss legendre quadrature can be used to numerically compute the values of the integrals for singular or near singular integrands where field and source points are located within the same element a polar coordinate transformation originally developed for stress analysis li et al 1985 is used to evaluate the integral this method has previously been applied to wave structure interaction problems by for example eatock taylor and chau 1992 the fully discretised representations of eq 13 can be re arranged into the following matrix form so that the unknown variables on each of the neumann or dirichlet surfaces can be solved 14 a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 φ 1 φ 2 b 1 b 2 where unknowns are φ 1 i ϕ x φ 2 i ϕ n x the influence coefficient matrices are dependent only on the mesh geometry and can be assembled immediately after mesh generation and stored in memory for calculations at all subsequent time steps this is because the linear potential flow problem is based on a taylor s series expansion of flow variables about the time invariant mean sea level which implies that the values of green s functions and the corresponding derivatives are dependent only on the mesh geometry the solid angle at the field point c x 0 is calculated by considering the case of a constant non zero velocity potential field within d potential wu and eatock taylor 1989 such that the normal derivative i e potential flux will be zero throughout the domain at the start of a simulation an undisturbed linear wave field is applied to the entire domain i e the scattered components of velocity potential and its derivative are taken to be zero at the start of the simulation a cosine ramp function is used to gradually build up the input incident wave field so that the scattering of flow variables from the body boundaries via eq 12 would correspondingly be increased gradually a fourth order runge kutta rk4 scheme is used to march the solution forward in time using the kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions eqs 9 and 10 the remaining unknowns namely scattered velocity potential derivatives on the free surface ϕ s z s 0 and the scattered velocity potentials on the body boundaries ϕ s s bodies are calculated using the green s second identity these two terms correspond respectively to φ 2 i and φ 1 i of eq 14 i e φ 2 i and 1 i are the unknowns on the free surface and body boundaries as the scattered wave components travel to the outer regions of the flow domain they are absorbed using a passive wave absorption zone implemented as a free surface damping layer büchmann et al 1998 a spatially varying damping coefficient is used to provide incremental energy absorption as the scattered waves propagate outwards up to this point the behaviour of the velocity potential at far field vertical control surfaces beyond the wave damping zones have yet to be defined given that the scattered outgoing waves would have been absorbed by the wave absorption zone the velocity potential and its normal derivative at the far field control surfaces would be equal to zero therefore the boundary condition at these boundaries can be defined using the following expression 15 vertical far field control surface boundary condition ϕ s ϕ s n 0 on s c far field control surfaces 3 3 modifications to linear potential flow model modifications to the free surface and body boundary conditions of the time domain linear potential flow model are next described aimed at incorporating the dissipative effects of vortex shedding and skin friction body boundary condition modifications relating to skin friction losses are justified based on the fact that work done against frictional shear stresses is confined to the thin boundary layers immediately next to the body boundaries it thus follows that the amount of skin friction losses should be related to the extent of the wetted boundaries for vortex shedding losses it may be argued that modifications should also be applied at the vessels body boundaries based on the fact that vortices are likely to be shed at hull regions where a large change in shape occurs however initial viscous simulations showed that the amount of energy loss due to vortex shedding is related to gap width also there are two effects on side by side vessels due vortex shedding that should be accounted for one of which is the force exerted at the point of shedding and the other effect is that shed vortices continue to remove energy from the gap water volume between two side by side vessels further reducing the free surface elevation even after the initial shedding from the hull corners by using a dissipative term in the free surface boundary condition to account for vortex shedding it is implied that any lateral effects arising from shed vortices exert their influence in the form of damping in the vertical direction i e by reducing the free surface elevation physically vortices shed from hull bilge corners into the gap affect the local flow field as these vortices evolve at a small distance away from the sides of the vessels and may change the pressure distribution on the side shells of the adjacent vessels exerting a certain amount of lateral forcing the changes in pressure distribution will also interact with the oscillating boundary layers at the sides of the vessels indirectly influencing the amount of skin friction losses for the present research it is assumed that these lateral effects are small and can be neglected 3 3 1 free surface boundary condition with dissipation in this subsection the theoretical justification for using an additional damping term in the free surface boundary condition is developed based on the damped free surface boundary conditions derived by dutykh 2009 for predicting decay of gravity waves this appears to be the first time a theoretical justification is provided for the damping lid free surface boundary condition in the literature reviewed earlier the dissipative term has been described as a numerical tool to provide artificial damping in potential flow models dutykh 2009 derived the damped free surface boundary conditions by considering the balance of stresses at the free surface of a weakly dissipative fluid governed by the linearised navier stokes equations the authors applied helmholtz leray decomposition to split the primitive viscous flow variables into potential and solenoidal components the linearised boundary conditions from dutykh 2009 are reproduced here for reference as follows 16 ζ t ϕ z 2 ν 2 ζ where z ζ and 17 ϕ t g ζ 2 ν 2 ϕ z 2 where z ζ by first differentiating eq 17 with respect to time and substituting eq 16 into it these two boundary conditions can be combined into one as shown in eq 18 18 2 ϕ t 2 g ϕ z 2 ν 3 ϕ t z 2 a g 2 ζ b where z ζ the term a in eq 18 can be re expressed in terms of ϕ by assuming that ϕ is a product of a spatial component φ and a complex time harmonic component e i ω t use of the latter term implies sinusoidal motion of the free surface in time by differentiating ϕ where ϕ φ e i ω t with respect to time and back substituting into a eq 19 can be obtained 19 3 ϕ t z 2 i ω 2 ϕ z 2 for the term b the components of 2 ζ can also be re expressed in terms of ϕ by differentiating eq 17 twice with respect to x and y since ζ f x y t on z 0 as follows 20 2 ζ x 2 1 g i ω 2 ϕ x 2 2 ν g 4 ϕ x 2 z 2 and 2 ζ y 2 1 g i ω 2 ϕ y 2 2 ν g 4 ϕ y 2 z 2 substituting eqs 19 and 20 into 18 give 21 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z i 2 ν ω 2 ϕ z 2 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 4 ν 2 4 ϕ x 2 z 2 4 ϕ y 2 z 2 o ν 2 the second square bracketed term on the right hand side can be ignored for flows where the value of ν is small the range is given in dutykh 2009 as between 10 6 m 2 s to 10 3 m 2 s since the typical values of the ratio between turbulent and kinematic viscosities is of the order of 10 see e g chen et al 2001 and nguyen et al 2013 it is reasonable to assume that this term can also be dropped for cases where viscous dissipation occur due to vortex shedding i e where it is more realistic to use ν as a representation of eddy viscosity rather than kinematic viscosity thus the free surface boundary condition can be re written as follows 22 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z i 2 ν ω 2 ϕ x 2 2 ϕ y 2 2 ϕ z 2 in order to express eq 22 in a form similar to the damping lid free surface boundary condition proposed in chen 2005 it is necessary to have a term simply multiplying ϕ on its right hand side this is done by differentiating ϕ with respect to the spatial coordinates in the following manner 23 ϕ φ x y z e i ω t 24 n ϕ x n n φ x n e i ω t n φ x n ϕ φ n ϕ y n n φ y n e i ω t n φ y n ϕ φ n ϕ z n n φ z n e i ω t n φ z n ϕ φ these partial differentials can be substituted into eq 22 as follows 25 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z 2 ν φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 ε i ω ϕ by using ε to represent the group of right hand side terms containing the spatial velocity potential component φ the above equation can be re expressed in the following form 26 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z i ε ω ϕ implied in this intermediate step is the simplifying assumption that either i the terms φ 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 and 2 φ z 2 remain constant or ii the terms can be expressed as some form of time and space averaged constant since the second derivatives of the velocity potential component φ in x y and z directions represent the velocity gradients in these three directions assumption i is only appropriate for cases where the gap response corresponds to a piston mode in all three cartesian directions i e uniform throughout the gap for three dimensional side by side vessel configurations it is necessary to apply assumption ii due to the presence of openings at the bow aft openings of the gap this assumption will also be used in the derivation of an expression to calculate the value of ε which will be presented in the next subsection it should also be noted that ε is linearly related to the viscosity term and spatial derivatives of the velocity components 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 and inversely related to the spatial component of velocity potential φ by using the linear dispersion relation the above equation can be further re expressed in the same form as eq 13 of chen 2005 this is shown in the following 27 k ϕ ϕ z i ε k ϕ where ω 2 gk ε ε ω one may observe from eq 27 that the complex time harmonic term can be cancelled out from both sides of the equation for use in frequency domain potential flow models for the time domain potential flow code presented in the earlier sections time stepping of the solution is carried out using the dynamic and kinematic free surface boundary conditions instead of the combined free surface boundary conditions eq 27 it is thus necessary to allocate the damping term of eq 27 to one of these boundary conditions to facilitate numerical implementation by observation the modified dynamic free surface boundary condition can be re expressed with the damping term ε as follows 28 ϕ t g ζ ε ϕ 3 3 2 expression to calculate the free surface damping coefficient ε in lu et al 2012 an expression is derived to calculate the potential flow free surface boundary condition damping term from the results of two dimensional viscous simulations by assuming that the additional dissipation in the gap can be expressed as an additional hydrostatic pressure acting on the gap free surface the authors assumed that this additional hydrostatic pressure is proportional to the decrease in free surface response due to viscous dissipation for this research a similar expression to calculate ε is obtained by considering the rate at which energy is being dissipated in the gap using the modified dynamic free surface boundary condition eq 28 the rate of energy dissipation can be obtained by multiplying both sides of eq 28 with the vertical velocity at which the gap free surface is moving i e as a product of the dynamic pressure and velocity in the following manner 29 ρ ζ t ϕ t ζ t ρ g ζ ζ t ρ ε ϕ physically this implies that the gap water volume dissipates energy at a rate that is equal to the sum of work done against gravity in moving the free surface first term on right hand side and the work done against vortex shedding second term on the right hand side for a given transverse slice across the control volume the time averaged amount of work done against vortex shedding can be calculated by integrating the second term on the right hand side across the gap over a pre specified duration as follows 30 dwd gap 1 t τ τ t b g 2 b g 2 ζ t ρ ε ϕ dy dt where wd gap is the work done against vortex shedding τ is the nominal start time for time integration and b g is the gap width interestingly eq 30 above derived based on work done by dynamic pressure at the gap free surface has the same form as eq 22 in lu et al 2012 which relates the total amount of energy dissipated through viscosity with the work done against an additional hydrostatic pressure the integral of eq 30 has been derived in lu et al 2012 and is shown in the following expression 31 dwd gap 1 2 ρ gb g ε ω 2 ω 2 ε 2 ζ 0 2 where ζ 0 is the free surface response amplitude note that in eq 31 ζ 0 is a single value implying an assumption that the free surface response across the gap is piston mode for a given transverse slice since results from viscous simulations of fixed floating vessels showed only a small amount of variations in free surface elevation across the gap this assumption is a reasonable approximation for the work done at each transverse slice the response along the gap however cannot be assumed to be piston mode due to the openings at both ends of the gap where influence of the background incident waves and the scattering of waves around the exterior of the adjacent vessels cannot be neglected it may be recalled that in the previous section it was assumed that the velocity gradients in the cartesian directions 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 can be expressed as a time and space averaged constant this assumption is extended to the gap free surface elevation ζ so that the three dimensional rate of work done can be calculated using a value that has been spatially averaged in both transverse and longitudinal directions ζ this can be thought of as smearing the vortex shedding dissipation along and across the gap the average three dimensional rate of work done by the gap free surface wd gap due to the additional dynamic pressure arising from vortex shedding at the bilge corners can be thus calculated using the following expression 32 wd gap x l 2 x l 2 dw gap dx 1 2 ρ gb g l ε ω 2 ω 2 ε 2 ζ 2 the rate of work done against vortex shedding effects can be equated to the energy dissipation rate obtained by applying the energy decomposition method proposed in section 2 3 4 to the results of the viscous simulations by expressing the energy dissipation rate due to vortex shedding effects obtained from viscous simulations as wd gap visc an appropriate value of free surface damping term ε can be obtained using the following expression 33 wd gap visc wd gap ρ gb g l ε ω 2 ζ 2 2 ω 2 ε 2 leading to ε ω 2 ε 2 2 wd gap visc ρ gb g l ω 2 ζ 2 the calculated value of ε is subsequently used in the modified free surface boundary condition as part of the time domain potential flow solver to model energy loss through vortex shedding action 3 3 3 body boundary condition with dissipation an impedance boundary condition obtained by adding an impedance term to the body boundary condition is used to model skin friction dissipation by the wetted hull surfaces in this research however changes in amount of dissipation due to variations in wetted surface area are not modelled this is because the present method is based on a linear potential flow model that relies on a taylor s series expansion of flow variables about the time invariant mean water level which subsequently is represented numerically as a time constant mesh nonetheless for more sophisticated nonlinear potential flow models variations in skin friction losses due to changes in wetted hull surface area arising from body motions could be automatically accounted for using the impedance boundary condition proposed in this research this may be worth investigation in future work dalrymple 1992 used an impedance boundary condition to model the dissipative effects of jetties on waves propagating along a channel as follows 34 ϕ n i γ ϕ where γ is the impedance of the jetties the earlier assumption where the velocity potential ϕ is equal to the product of spatial and complex time harmonic components can be differentiated twice with respect to time and re arranged into the following equation 35 i ϕ 1 ω ϕ t substituting eq 35 into eq 34 the impedance boundary condition for the body surfaces can be expressed in the following form 36 ϕ n γ ω σ ϕ t σ ϕ t where σ is the impedance at the body boundaries due to skin friction by splitting the velocity potential ϕ into scattered and incident components on the left hand side and re arranging the following equation can be obtained 37 ϕ s n ϕ w n σ ϕ t it can be observed from eq 37 that skin friction effects in the form of a mechanical impedance reduce the magnitude of the scattered velocity potential normal derivatives from boundary layer theory the slowing of flow near body boundaries due to fluid shear stresses will result in a normal flux away from those boundaries due to continuity this can be thought of as an effect that displaces the inviscid flow outside of the boundary layer away from the solid surface to make space for the slower shearing fluid layers the extent of displacement is the boundary layer displacement thickness and this normal flux correction is balanced by the inviscid pressure and velocities at the edge of the boundary layer for oscillatory flows the magnitude of normal flux will vary inducing an inwards and outwards movement of the boundary layer edge kristiansen 2009 from the view point of the surrounding inviscid flow part of the incident wave energy will be expended in the form of work done by the dynamic pressure and associated flow velocities at the boundary layer edges this energy is subsequently cascaded into the boundary layers at the respective side shells and used to overcome the local viscous shear stresses via the imaginary interface between the boundary layer and the surrounding inviscid flow field thus a simplifying assumption is made in the present work to directly link the viscous frictional losses within the boundary layer in the form of an impedance term as a linear function of inviscid dynamic pressure acting at the boundary layer s edge via a skin friction coefficient term 3 3 4 expression to calculate body boundary damping coefficient σ in order to quantify the body boundary damping coefficient σ of eq 37 it is necessary to re express the body boundary condition in terms of work done since the rate at which work is done by a fluid can be expressed as a product of velocity and dynamic pressure the work done by the body boundary can be calculated by multiplying both sides of eq 36 with the dynamic pressure ϕ t physically this means that the inviscid gap water volume needs to do work against a time varying pressure exerted by the boundary layers on the relatively inviscid flow outside of the layers this can be expressed in the following manner 38 rate of work done ϕ t ϕ n σ ϕ t 2 the time averaged work done by a given body against skin friction can be calculated by first integrating the rate of work done over the wetted hull surfaces under consideration and across a few cycles of total duration t seconds and subsequently taking the mean work done value over that duration this is shown in the following expression 39 wd skin fric 1 t s bodies τ τ t ϕ t ϕ n dt ds bodies σ t s bodies τ τ t ϕ t 2 dt ds bodies where wd skin fric represents the time averaged skin friction losses obtained from viscous simulations using the component energy approach described in the earlier sections and s bodies represent the hull surfaces where the integration would be carried out eq 39 can be re arranged to obtain the following equation for calculating the value of σ 40 σ t wd skin fric s τ τ t ϕ t 2 dt ds furthermore since eq 37 includes the effects of viscosity in the form of a skin friction impedance term the modified dissipative potential flow dynamic pressure ϕ t can be assumed to be equal to the dynamic pressure field obtained from fully viscous simulations p d for side by side hydrodynamic interactions the dynamic pressure will be equivalent to the excess pressure above hydrostatic i e p of eq 1 it is therefore reasonable to use the latter as an approximation for the former in eq 37 σ can thus be expressed in a discretised form using parameters of the three dimensional fully viscous simulations for the hull surfaces inside the control volume defined in sub section 2 3 2 in the following manner 41 σ t wd skin fric s ns h t nt s c nc f p d c t s 2 area c s where ns h is the number of hull surfaces enclosed within the control volume for calculation of energy dissipation between side by side vessels i e gap facing side shells and hull bottoms s is the hull surface index nt s is the number of time steps in a duration of t seconds t is the time step index nc f is the number of cell faces on the respective hull surfaces c is the cell face index and area is the area of a cell face by using eq 41 values for the body boundary dissipation coefficient σ can be calculated from outputs of fully viscous simulations which can subsequently be used in the modified time domain potential flow solver to account for skin friction energy losses 3 4 modifications to time domain potential flow solver in the preceding sections expressions to calculate time and space averaged gap free surface damping and skin friction impedance damping coefficients have been developed while other forms of damping coefficients that may vary with spatial locations would be possible consideration should be given to whether the added complexity of varying coefficients provides meaningful physical representation of the cross interacting nature of viscous losses furthermore the added complexity should also be weighed against the following points ease of implementation of constant coefficients and reviewed literature e g dalrymple 1992 for dissipation of waves due to jetties lu and chen 2012 for gap response between side by side boxes hong et al 2013 for roll damping of semi submersibles showed good estimates of the behaviour of physical systems can be obtained from constant coefficients given the above considerations it was decided that this research would focus on the development of damping coefficients that are constant for a given incident wave frequency and gap width from a defined control volume using such an approach one would be able to investigate the influence of incident wave frequencies and or gap widths on damping coefficients efficiently for example by calculating the coefficient values at the gap resonant frequency as well as at high and low frequencies a relationship e g trend line can be established and subsequently used to obtain the damping coefficients at other frequencies that have not been modelled using viscous simulations moreover the use of a selected set of viscous simulations would also be more cost effective than experiments or running a full matrix of load cases using viscous simulations changes in hull forms can also be easily made in numerical simulations facilitating parametric studies at early stages of the design cycle in order to incorporate the gap free surface damping and skin friction impedance damping coefficients into the time domain potential flow solver it is necessary to modify the fourth order runge kutta time integration scheme described earlier in section 3 2 the need for this modification can be observed by comparing the conventional linear dynamic free surface and body boundary conditions eqs 10 and 12 against the modified damped linear dynamic free surface and body boundary conditions eqs 28 and 37 the respective vortex shedding and skin friction dissipation terms in the latter two equations are in terms of total velocity potential at the free surface ϕ s 0 and dynamic pressure at the body boundaries ϕ t s bodies while the conventional linear potential flow solver presented in section 3 2 calculates only the scattered field variables given that an undisturbed linear wave field is applied at the initial time step values of total velocity potential ϕ s 0 and dynamic pressure ϕ t s bodies can be directly calculated from the incident wave field the latter value is used in the modified body boundary condition eq 37 to provide the initial estimated values of the scattered normal derivative of velocity potential on the body boundaries ϕ s n s bodies thereafter the green s second identity eq 13 is used to compute the estimated values of scattered velocity potential normal derivatives at the free surface ϕ s z s 0 and the scattered velocity potentials on the body boundaries ϕ s s bodies it should be noted at this point that the value of ϕ t s bodies will be calculated using a simple euler backward scheme in the sub steps and time steps following initialisation since its value will be known for the sub step or time step just before the one being calculated the linear kinematic free surface boundary condition eq 9 is used in conjunction with ϕ s z s 0 to calculate the time derivative of the free surface elevation ζ s t which in turn can be used in the second euler implicit sub step of rk4 to calculate the estimated value of the scattered free surface elevation ζ s at this juncture in the calculation the values of the total velocity potential at the free surface ϕ s 0 are required so that the dissipative effects of vortex shedding can be accounted for in the damped linear dynamic free surface boundary condition eq 28 when calculating the total dynamic pressure at the free surface ϕ t s 0 at the first rk4 sub steps of the initial time step ϕ s 0 is assumed to be equal to the undisturbed incident wave field subsequently ϕ s 0 can be reconstructed by summing the last known estimated values of the scattered component ϕ s s 0 obtained at preceding rk4 sub steps or time steps and the known incident values ϕ w s 0 at the corresponding time steps the initial estimated values of ϕ t s 0 calculated from the previous paragraph is used to update ϕ s 0 by subtracting away the known incident component ϕ w s 0 the updated value of ϕ s s 0 can be obtained which can be used together with ϕ s n s bodies once again in the green s second identity to give corresponding updated values of ϕ s z s 0 and ϕ s s bodies this process is repeated for two more times so that four sets of estimated ϕ s z s 0 and ϕ s s bodies are obtained the final values of these variables are obtained using a weighted sum in the final rk4 sub step the flow solution is marched forward in time in the manner described above until the end of the simulation duration 4 concluding remarks an analysis framework for quantifying the amount of viscous dissipation and thereafter incorporating those dissipation effects into a modified linear potential flow model is developed the framework facilitates modelling of flow interaction between side by side vessels in the early part of a design cycle before model tests are conducted and uses viscous simulations to provide flow field data for quantifying the amount of energy loss through viscous flow processes of vortex shedding and skin friction effects the energy loss components are subsequently applied as dissipative terms in a modified potential flow model these modifications including the associated expressions for calculating the coefficient values of the dissipative terms are presented applications of this new approach are described in detail in part ii chua et al 2017 together with a discussion on the relative efficiency of using this approach compared with the use of viscous cfd simulations to analyse a full load case matrix of side by side configurations acknowledgements this work has been

23133,recently predicting accurately the impact of submarine debris flows on pipelines has attracted much attention in ocean engineering to address this problem a small scale model test based on analysis of the reynolds number is usually employed however in the design of the test model researchers have seldom considered the applicability of the reynolds number and the rheological model of the debris flow which had led to the following problems 1 a large difference in the reynolds number occurs between the test model and the engineering prototype and 2 the shear rate of the rheological model exceeds the applicable scope hence a methodology to determine the model dimension to satisfy both the rheological model and reynolds criterion is proposed in which two formulations expressing the design size of the test model and the design impact velocity of debris flow are established respectively further the influence of the rheological model on the design test model of the interaction between submarine debris flows and pipelines is briefly discussed finally the optimal design value of the model size and impact velocity of debris flow is achieved and recommended to the models in the laboratory test and the numerical computation keywords submarine debris flow impact reynolds criteria rheological model model design 1 introduction in recent years abundant seabed geological resources have been discovered around the world according to statistics the newly discovered reserves in the sea account for approximately 80 of the total discoveries in the recent 5 years of major world oil and gas discoveries zhang et al 2018 this discovery has greatly promoted the global development and utilization of marine oil and gas resources the main methods of transporting fluid and gas media are via submarine oil and gas pipelines which present many advantages such as continuous transport high efficiency and throughput and low costs however the natural environment of the seafloor is complicated natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis volcanic eruptions and submarine landslides frequently occur and inevitably affect the safe operation of pipelines macpherson 1978 locat and lee 2002 when pipelines are subjected to impact failure caused by submarine landslides incalculable losses can occur mosher et al 2010 kim et al 2011 unlike mountain landslides submarine landslides are a common marine geohazard in coastal deltas and on continental slopes submarine landslides can occur even on extremely gentle slopes 0 5 3 locat and lee 2002 the characteristics of such landslides are shown in table 1 hance 2003 after long distance migration a submarine landslide gradually evolves into a large scale debris flow with the characteristics of a fluid when the landslide further develops into a turbidity current the unit volume density and shear strength of the turbidity current are much lower than those of the debris flow hence bruschi et al 2006 noted that the damage to pipelines caused by a submarine landslide is mainly concentrated in the debris flow stage therefore precisely predicting the effect of submarine debris flows on pipelines is a key issue in ocean engineering jeanjean et al 2005 randolph et al 2010 yuan et al 2014 table 1 summary of the characteristics of seafloor slope failures in the database hance 2003 analyses of the impact of a submarine landslide on a pipeline are primarily based on soil mechanics and fluid mechanics randolph et al 2012 zakeri et al 2008 2009 analyses based on fluid mechanics are more suitable for predicting the effect of a submarine landslide on a pipeline after the landslide evolves into a debris flow zhu and randolph 2011 because the impact of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline cannot be determined using basic equations it is necessary to apply fluid mechanics theory to conduct indoor model testing and three dimensional numerical testing the two methods are then combined to analyze the problem as demonstrated in eq 1 zakeri et al 2008 based on associated theory realistic conditions are predicted and references for engineering design are provided restricted by the research environment test conditions and calculation ability zakeri et al 2008 conducted tests using only small scale models to establish the functional relationship between the drag coefficient c d and the reynolds number re see eqs 2 and 3 based on these findings a great deal of work has been performed by researchers and the relationship between re and c d has been fitted based on different engineering conditions zakeri et al 2009 liu et al 2014 tian 2014 wang 2016 fan et al 2017 1 f d 1 2 ρ c d u 2 a d 2 c d f re non newtonian 3 re non newtonian f ρ u μ app γ ρ u 2 μ app γ where ρ is the density of the submarine debris flow kg m3 c d is the drag force coefficient which is a dimensionless parameter u is the velocity of the submarine debris flow m s a d is the normal projected frontal area of the pipeline m2 renon newtonian is the reynolds number of the submarine debris flow impact on pipelines which is also a dimensionless parameter μ app is the apparent viscosity of the submarine debris flow pa s and γ is the shear rate of the submarine debris flow s 1 in practice zakeri et al 2008 noted the engineering background including the diameter of the submarine pipeline the velocity of the debris flow the shear rate of the debris flow impact on the pipeline and the reynolds number however researchers have rarely considered the applicable scope of the rheological model of submarine debris flows which had led to the phenomenon of the shear rate of the rheological model exceeding the applicable range in the test and analysis as shown in table 2 some researchers have encountered the above problems during the research process resulting in a less rigorous prediction formula and making it difficult to trust the accuracy of the formula in addition when zakeri et al 2008 used a 25 mm diameter pipeline to conduct a flume model test only approximately half of the reynolds number range of engineering was reached thus a large gap remains between the test models and the engineering prototypes and the model tests must consider the applicable and real ranges of physical quantities and properly coordinate the relationship between these factors to obtain an effective prediction conclusion to solve the above problems we introduce the reynolds criterion the reynolds number of the model is equivalent to that of the prototype based on previous studies then the applicability of the rheological model of a submarine debris flow is considered the formulas expressing the design size of the test model and the design impact velocity of debris flow in the model are derived providing a scientific basis for the design of the test model moreover the real effect is reproduced in the model test furthermore the scale and cost of the test can be reduced and the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation can be improved with this approach 2 basic theory 2 1 reynolds criterion the test model usually refers to a shrinking expanding object with the same motion behavior as the prototype engineering object and each parameter accounts for a fixed proportion of the relationship similarity theory is indispensable for applying the results of the model into the prototype it is difficult or even impossible to let all of the physical quantities satisfy the similarity theory so only the approximate similarity theory can generally be satisfied conversely if flows of different size are similar the corresponding dimensionless numbers are the same thus in the model test the same dimensionless number is often used as the criterion of similarity between the model and prototype in predictions of the effect of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline the main force of the pipeline is the viscous force of the debris flow which is used to establish the functional relationship between c d and re kundu and cohen 2008 zakeri et al 2008 therefore the reynolds criterion viscous force similarity criterion is chosen as the bridge between the model and the prototype and this metric is very reliable moreover both re and c d are dimensionless quantities so their values are not related to the unit of measurement or the scale of movement in summary the model and prototype should be satisfied based on the reynolds criterion of the model being equal to the reynolds number of the prototype thus the flows of the model and prototype will be equivalent the classical reynolds number for a newtonian fluid can be defined as follows zakeri et al 2008 4 re newtonian ρ u d μ where μ is the absolute viscosity pa s and d is the characteristic length scale which is the pipeline diameter m to ensure that the reynolds number of the prototype is equal to that of the model the mathematical expression is shown in eq 5 5 re newtonian p ρ p u p d p μ p re newtonian m ρ m u m d m μ m equation 5 can be rearranged and simplified to obtain eq 6 6 ρ p u p d p μ p ρ m u m d m μ m where the subscript p represents the prototype and the subscript m represents the model 2 2 rheological model of submarine debris flow a submarine debris flow is usually considered as a non newtonian fluid zakeri et al 2008 boukpeti et al 2012 it can be described by the power law rheological model or the herschel bulkley rheological model si 2007 zakeri et al 2008 si 2007 established a rheological model of debris flow equivalent materials different proportions of kaolin silica sand and water further the rheological model was improved by zakeri et al 2008 and the improved model was widely used in physical model tests and numerical simulation tests as shown in table 3 more importantly a submarine debris flow is different from a newtonian fluid which is based on the apparent viscosity rather than the absolute viscosity the apparent viscosity is defined as the ratio of the shear stress to the shear rate of the non newtonian fluid see eq 7 zakeri et al 2008 7 μ app τ γ where τ is the shear stress of the submarine debris flow pa the apparent viscosity varies with the changes in the shear rate and temperature the values of the shear rate and temperature must be provided to determine the apparent viscosity of the submarine debris flow in this state zakeri et al 2008 because of the extremely short test time and constant temperature the temperature change can be neglected in the test process thus the shear rate is the only important factor that affects the apparent viscosity the shear rate immediately outside the boundary layer is defined by zakeri et al 2008 as follows 8 γ u d in addition the power law rheological model of a submarine debris flow is given by the following equation 9 τ k γ n thus the apparent viscosity of the power law rheological model can be derived as follows 10 μ app k γ n 1 additionally the herschel bulkley rheological model of a submarine debris flow is defined as follows 11 τ τ y k γ n therefore the apparent viscosity of the herschel bulkley rheological model can be easily expressed as follows 12 μ app τ y γ k γ n 1 where τ y is the yield stress pa k is the consistency coefficient pa s n and n is the fluidity index which ranges from 0 to 1 2 3 reynolds number of submarine debris flows based on the definition of the reynolds number in eq 4 the reynolds number does not apply directly to non newtonian fluids such as submarine debris flows hence a special reynolds number renon newtonian was proposed by zakeri et al 2008 the reynolds number of the submarine debris flow renon newtonian is obtained by combining eq 8 and eq 4 as follows 13 re non newtonian ρ u 2 μ app γ most of the models use the same test material as the prototype i e ρ p ρ m ρ thus the equivalence of the reynolds numbers of the test model and the engineering prototype can be written as follows 14 re non newtonian p re non newtonian m ρ u p 2 μ app p γ p ρ u m 2 μ app m γ m in the above relation the similar conditions of the engineering prototype and test model should meet the reynolds criterion in other words it should be ensured that eq 14 is can be considered valid a limiting constraint includes guaranteeing that re of the rheological model of the submarine debris flow in the model test is within the applicable range additionally the range of the reynolds number in the test model should be the real range of the engineering prototype for example zakeri et al 2008 suggested that the corresponding reynolds number should be between 0 6 and 240 3 formula derivation according to the basic theory presented in section 2 the rheological model of a submarine debris flow reflects its real motion and impact characteristics material selection for the model is the same as that for the prototype so both must meet the applicable requirements of the shear rate of the debris flow to reduce the size of the model under the condition that the reynolds number of the model is equal to that of the prototype the impact velocity can only be increased according to eq 6 however when the impact velocity is improved the shear rate is greatly improved based on eq 8 and the result exceeds the applicable limits of the shear rate of the rheological model of a submarine debris flow however if the impact velocity is not increased it is difficult to satisfy the required conditions in summary it is necessary to rigorously calculate the size of the model and the impact velocity of the submarine debris flow according to the applicable range of the rheological model and the real process whereby the submarine debris flow impacts the pipeline can then be reflected by the model test taking the power law rheological model of a submarine debris flow mentioned in section 2 2 as an example the formulas for determining the diameter of the pipeline and the impact velocity of the debris flow are derived and established the reynolds number expressions of the prototype and model can be obtained by introducing eq 10 into eq 14 as shown in eq 15 and eq 16 15 re non newtonian p ρ u p 2 μ app p γ p ρ u p 2 τ p ρ u p 2 k γ n ρ u p 2 k u p d p n 16 re non newtonian m ρ u m 2 μ app m γ m ρ u m 2 τ m ρ u m 2 k γ n ρ u m 2 k u m d m n equation 16 can be simplified as follows 17 re non newtonian m ρ u m 2 n k d m n according to the rheological model of a submarine debris flow the impact velocity and the diameter in actual engineering the real range of renon newtonian p can be calculated by introducing these parameters into eq 15 based on the reynolds criterion the reynolds number of the prototype and model should be equal throughout the defined domain briefly the reynolds number of the model renon newtonian m must be continuous in re non newtonian p min re non newtonian p max and the maximum value and minimum values can be obtained as follows 18 re non newtonian p min re non newtonian m ρ u m 2 n k d m n re non newtonian p max renon newtonian m in eq 18 is obviously a continuous function and renon newtonian m can take the maximum or minimum value when one of the diameters or impact velocities is determined more importantly the determination of the impact velocity and diameter in the above analysis is restricted by the shear rate of the rheological model of the submarine debris flow as follows 19 0 u m d m γ max when the diameter of the test model is determined d m is a fixed value because the fluidity index of the rheological model of the submarine debris flow is n 1 it is evident that 2 n 1 equation 17 shows that the function renon newtonian m increases with the improvement of u m the value of u m is assumed to be arbitrary so the reynolds number of the model renon newtonian m should always satisfy the reynolds number of the engineering prototype renon newtonian p however the value of u m will be limited by the applicability of the rheological model of a debris flow the maximum value can be obtained by the following equation 20 u m max γ max d m the maximum equation for re non newtonian m is derived by substituting eq 20 into eq 17 21 re non newtonian m max ρ γ max 2 n k d m 2 the maximum value of renon newtonian m increases as the pipeline diameter increases when the rheological model of the submarine debris flow is determined if the value of renon newtonian m is the maximum value of the engineering prototype by introducing this value into eq 21 and simplifying the equation the minimum value of the diameter of the model can be obtained as shown in eq 22 as the critical value of the diameter of the model the minimum value not only satisfies the applicable range requirements of the rheological model but also encompasses the limits of the reynolds number for the engineering prototype 22 d m min k re non newtonian m max ρ γ max 2 n when the pipeline diameter is greater than the critical value the minimum value the above set of conditions can always be satisfied in theory however as the pipeline diameter increases the size of the model and the cost of the test will increase additionally the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical calculation will decrease in extreme cases the ratio of the model to the prototype is equal to 1 when the model is the same size as the prototype therefore the recommended diameter is given by eq 22 notably the impact velocity can be calculated according to inequality 18 and is therefore given by the following equation 23 k d m n re non newtonian p min ρ 2 n u m k d m n re non newtonian p max ρ 2 n similarly when the submarine debris flow is described using the herschel bulkley rheological model the recommended diameter can be expressed as follows 24 d m min τ y k γ max n re non newtonian m max ρ γ max 2 4 application and discussion 4 1 application through determination of the formulas for the size of the model and the impact velocity of debris flow established in section 3 the model can be designed according to the rheological model of a submarine debris flow zakeri et al 2008 referred to the following actual prototype conditions a submarine pipeline diameter ranging from 0 1 m to 1 0 m a debris flow velocity between 1 m s and 10 m s a shear rate of impact on the pipeline in the range of 1 s 1 to 100 s 1 and a reynolds number of approximately 0 6 240 the rheological model of a submarine debris flow is shown in table 2 and this model is widely used in current research thus the test model is designed using six different types of submarine debris flows described by the power law model taking the 25 clay power law model as an example the minimum pipeline diameter can be obtained by introducing each parameter into eq 22 as shown in eq 25 according to eq 23 the range of the impact velocity of the debris flow in the model test can be calculated see eq 26 finally all the results are shown in table 4 in general the design of the model including the model size and the impact velocity using the above method can be adopted under the condition that the reynolds number of the prototype is equivalent to that of the model in addition this model design is consistent with the applicability of the rheological model of submarine debris flows impact on pipelines 25 d m min k re non newtonian m max ρ γ max 2 n 91 5 240 1689 6 50 2 0 11 89 41 mm 26 91 5 0 08941 0 11 0 6 1689 6 2 0 11 u m 91 5 0 08941 0 11 240 1689 6 2 0 11 4 2 discussion the maximum shear rate of the impact of the submarine debris flow on the pipeline is less than 100 s 1 the maximum shear rate of the rheological model based on the test zakeri et al 2008 is assumed to be a variable and ranges between 50 s 1 and 100 s 1 according to the design method of the examples in section 4 1 the model design parameters for six types of debris flows under a varying range of shear rates are also calculated as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 because of the difference between the type of rheological model and the applicable range of the rheological model the design of the test model considerably varies as seen from fig 1 as the maximum shear rate increases the minimum diameter of the model gradually decreases additionally as the strength of the debris flows different types increases the minimum diameter of the model gradually increases when the minimum diameter is determined the impact velocity can be designed according to the reynolds criterion fig 2 shows that the maximum and minimum impact velocities vary little with changes in the maximum shear rate because the impact velocity and the diameter are limited and are controlled together by the shear rate the effect of the impact velocity is considered when the minimum pipeline diameter is determined in summary the design of the model must consider the influence of the rheological model of a submarine debris flow 5 conclusions through briefly describing studies and prediction methods for the impact of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline the shortcomings of the current design of the model test are noted then based on the reynolds criterion and considering the applicable range of the rheological model of a submarine debris flow the design formulas of the model of the impact of a debris flow on a pipeline are derived and established the conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the rheological model of a debris flow plays a crucial role in studying the impact of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline therefore it is necessary to ensure that the rheological model of a debris flow can reflect the actual situation and that the shear rate of the rheological model cannot exceed its applicable range 2 to apply the prediction formula from the model test to a real prototype under various working conditions it must be ensured that the test models contain the same range of reynolds numbers as the engineering prototypes 3 using the design formulas of the test model for the impact of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline established via formula derivation the size of the pipeline and the impact velocity can be determined to reduce the size and cost of the test and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation we recommend using the critical value

shear rate of the debris flow impact on the pipeline and the reynolds number however researchers have rarely considered the applicable scope of the rheological model of submarine debris flows which had led to the phenomenon of the shear rate of the rheological model exceeding the applicable range in the test and analysis as shown in table 2 some researchers have encountered the above problems during the research process resulting in a less rigorous prediction formula and making it difficult to trust the accuracy of the formula in addition when zakeri et al 2008 used a 25 mm diameter pipeline to conduct a flume model test only approximately half of the reynolds number range of engineering was reached thus a large gap remains between the test models and the engineering prototypes and the model tests must consider the applicable and real ranges of physical quantities and properly coordinate the relationship between these factors to obtain an effective prediction conclusion to solve the above problems we introduce the reynolds criterion the reynolds number of the model is equivalent to that of the prototype based on previous studies then the applicability of the rheological model of a submarine debris flow is considered the formulas expressing the design size of the test model and the design impact velocity of debris flow in the model are derived providing a scientific basis for the design of the test model moreover the real effect is reproduced in the model test furthermore the scale and cost of the test can be reduced and the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation can be improved with this approach 2 basic theory 2 1 reynolds criterion the test model usually refers to a shrinking expanding object with the same motion behavior as the prototype engineering object and each parameter accounts for a fixed proportion of the relationship similarity theory is indispensable for applying the results of the model into the prototype it is difficult or even impossible to let all of the physical quantities satisfy the similarity theory so only the approximate similarity theory can generally be satisfied conversely if flows of different size are similar the corresponding dimensionless numbers are the same thus in the model test the same dimensionless number is often used as the criterion of similarity between the model and prototype in predictions of the effect of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline the main force of the pipeline is the viscous force of the debris flow which is used to establish the functional relationship between c d and re kundu and cohen 2008 zakeri et al 2008 therefore the reynolds criterion viscous force similarity criterion is chosen as the bridge between the model and the prototype and this metric is very reliable moreover both re and c d are dimensionless quantities so their values are not related to the unit of measurement or the scale of movement in summary the model and prototype should be satisfied based on the reynolds criterion of the model being equal to the reynolds number of the prototype thus the flows of the model and prototype will be equivalent the classical reynolds number for a newtonian fluid can be defined as follows zakeri et al 2008 4 re newtonian ρ u d μ where μ is the absolute viscosity pa s and d is the characteristic length scale which is the pipeline diameter m to ensure that the reynolds number of the prototype is equal to that of the model the mathematical expression is shown in eq 5 5 re newtonian p ρ p u p d p μ p re newtonian m ρ m u m d m μ m equation 5 can be rearranged and simplified to obtain eq 6 6 ρ p u p d p μ p ρ m u m d m μ m where the subscript p represents the prototype and the subscript m represents the model 2 2 rheological model of submarine debris flow a submarine debris flow is usually considered as a non newtonian fluid zakeri et al 2008 boukpeti et al 2012 it can be described by the power law rheological model or the herschel bulkley rheological model si 2007 zakeri et al 2008 si 2007 established a rheological model of debris flow equivalent materials different proportions of kaolin silica sand and water further the rheological model was improved by zakeri et al 2008 and the improved model was widely used in physical model tests and numerical simulation tests as shown in table 3 more importantly a submarine debris flow is different from a newtonian fluid which is based on the apparent viscosity rather than the absolute viscosity the apparent viscosity is defined as the ratio of the shear stress to the shear rate of the non newtonian fluid see eq 7 zakeri et al 2008 7 μ app τ γ where τ is the shear stress of the submarine debris flow pa the apparent viscosity varies with the changes in the shear rate and temperature the values of the shear rate and temperature must be provided to determine the apparent viscosity of the submarine debris flow in this state zakeri et al 2008 because of the extremely short test time and constant temperature the temperature change can be neglected in the test process thus the shear rate is the only important factor that affects the apparent viscosity the shear rate immediately outside the boundary layer is defined by zakeri et al 2008 as follows 8 γ u d in addition the power law rheological model of a submarine debris flow is given by the following equation 9 τ k γ n thus the apparent viscosity of the power law rheological model can be derived as follows 10 μ app k γ n 1 additionally the herschel bulkley rheological model of a submarine debris flow is defined as follows 11 τ τ y k γ n therefore the apparent viscosity of the herschel bulkley rheological model can be easily expressed as follows 12 μ app τ y γ k γ n 1 where τ y is the yield stress pa k is the consistency coefficient pa s n and n is the fluidity index which ranges from 0 to 1 2 3 reynolds number of submarine debris flows based on the definition of the reynolds number in eq 4 the reynolds number does not apply directly to non newtonian fluids such as submarine debris flows hence a special reynolds number renon newtonian was proposed by zakeri et al 2008 the reynolds number of the submarine debris flow renon newtonian is obtained by combining eq 8 and eq 4 as follows 13 re non newtonian ρ u 2 μ app γ most of the models use the same test material as the prototype i e ρ p ρ m ρ thus the equivalence of the reynolds numbers of the test model and the engineering prototype can be written as follows 14 re non newtonian p re non newtonian m ρ u p 2 μ app p γ p ρ u m 2 μ app m γ m in the above relation the similar conditions of the engineering prototype and test model should meet the reynolds criterion in other words it should be ensured that eq 14 is can be considered valid a limiting constraint includes guaranteeing that re of the rheological model of the submarine debris flow in the model test is within the applicable range additionally the range of the reynolds number in the test model should be the real range of the engineering prototype for example zakeri et al 2008 suggested that the corresponding reynolds number should be between 0 6 and 240 3 formula derivation according to the basic theory presented in section 2 the rheological model of a submarine debris flow reflects its real motion and impact characteristics material selection for the model is the same as that for the prototype so both must meet the applicable requirements of the shear rate of the debris flow to reduce the size of the model under the condition that the reynolds number of the model is equal to that of the prototype the impact velocity can only be increased according to eq 6 however when the impact velocity is improved the shear rate is greatly improved based on eq 8 and the result exceeds the applicable limits of the shear rate of the rheological model of a submarine debris flow however if the impact velocity is not increased it is difficult to satisfy the required conditions in summary it is necessary to rigorously calculate the size of the model and the impact velocity of the submarine debris flow according to the applicable range of the rheological model and the real process whereby the submarine debris flow impacts the pipeline can then be reflected by the model test taking the power law rheological model of a submarine debris flow mentioned in section 2 2 as an example the formulas for determining the diameter of the pipeline and the impact velocity of the debris flow are derived and established the reynolds number expressions of the prototype and model can be obtained by introducing eq 10 into eq 14 as shown in eq 15 and eq 16 15 re non newtonian p ρ u p 2 μ app p γ p ρ u p 2 τ p ρ u p 2 k γ n ρ u p 2 k u p d p n 16 re non newtonian m ρ u m 2 μ app m γ m ρ u m 2 τ m ρ u m 2 k γ n ρ u m 2 k u m d m n equation 16 can be simplified as follows 17 re non newtonian m ρ u m 2 n k d m n according to the rheological model of a submarine debris flow the impact velocity and the diameter in actual engineering the real range of renon newtonian p can be calculated by introducing these parameters into eq 15 based on the reynolds criterion the reynolds number of the prototype and model should be equal throughout the defined domain briefly the reynolds number of the model renon newtonian m must be continuous in re non newtonian p min re non newtonian p max and the maximum value and minimum values can be obtained as follows 18 re non newtonian p min re non newtonian m ρ u m 2 n k d m n re non newtonian p max renon newtonian m in eq 18 is obviously a continuous function and renon newtonian m can take the maximum or minimum value when one of the diameters or impact velocities is determined more importantly the determination of the impact velocity and diameter in the above analysis is restricted by the shear rate of the rheological model of the submarine debris flow as follows 19 0 u m d m γ max when the diameter of the test model is determined d m is a fixed value because the fluidity index of the rheological model of the submarine debris flow is n 1 it is evident that 2 n 1 equation 17 shows that the function renon newtonian m increases with the improvement of u m the value of u m is assumed to be arbitrary so the reynolds number of the model renon newtonian m should always satisfy the reynolds number of the engineering prototype renon newtonian p however the value of u m will be limited by the applicability of the rheological model of a debris flow the maximum value can be obtained by the following equation 20 u m max γ max d m the maximum equation for re non newtonian m is derived by substituting eq 20 into eq 17 21 re non newtonian m max ρ γ max 2 n k d m 2 the maximum value of renon newtonian m increases as the pipeline diameter increases when the rheological model of the submarine debris flow is determined if the value of renon newtonian m is the maximum value of the engineering prototype by introducing this value into eq 21 and simplifying the equation the minimum value of the diameter of the model can be obtained as shown in eq 22 as the critical value of the diameter of the model the minimum value not only satisfies the applicable range requirements of the rheological model but also encompasses the limits of the reynolds number for the engineering prototype 22 d m min k re non newtonian m max ρ γ max 2 n when the pipeline diameter is greater than the critical value the minimum value the above set of conditions can always be satisfied in theory however as the pipeline diameter increases the size of the model and the cost of the test will increase additionally the accuracy and efficiency of the numerical calculation will decrease in extreme cases the ratio of the model to the prototype is equal to 1 when the model is the same size as the prototype therefore the recommended diameter is given by eq 22 notably the impact velocity can be calculated according to inequality 18 and is therefore given by the following equation 23 k d m n re non newtonian p min ρ 2 n u m k d m n re non newtonian p max ρ 2 n similarly when the submarine debris flow is described using the herschel bulkley rheological model the recommended diameter can be expressed as follows 24 d m min τ y k γ max n re non newtonian m max ρ γ max 2 4 application and discussion 4 1 application through determination of the formulas for the size of the model and the impact velocity of debris flow established in section 3 the model can be designed according to the rheological model of a submarine debris flow zakeri et al 2008 referred to the following actual prototype conditions a submarine pipeline diameter ranging from 0 1 m to 1 0 m a debris flow velocity between 1 m s and 10 m s a shear rate of impact on the pipeline in the range of 1 s 1 to 100 s 1 and a reynolds number of approximately 0 6 240 the rheological model of a submarine debris flow is shown in table 2 and this model is widely used in current research thus the test model is designed using six different types of submarine debris flows described by the power law model taking the 25 clay power law model as an example the minimum pipeline diameter can be obtained by introducing each parameter into eq 22 as shown in eq 25 according to eq 23 the range of the impact velocity of the debris flow in the model test can be calculated see eq 26 finally all the results are shown in table 4 in general the design of the model including the model size and the impact velocity using the above method can be adopted under the condition that the reynolds number of the prototype is equivalent to that of the model in addition this model design is consistent with the applicability of the rheological model of submarine debris flows impact on pipelines 25 d m min k re non newtonian m max ρ γ max 2 n 91 5 240 1689 6 50 2 0 11 89 41 mm 26 91 5 0 08941 0 11 0 6 1689 6 2 0 11 u m 91 5 0 08941 0 11 240 1689 6 2 0 11 4 2 discussion the maximum shear rate of the impact of the submarine debris flow on the pipeline is less than 100 s 1 the maximum shear rate of the rheological model based on the test zakeri et al 2008 is assumed to be a variable and ranges between 50 s 1 and 100 s 1 according to the design method of the examples in section 4 1 the model design parameters for six types of debris flows under a varying range of shear rates are also calculated as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 because of the difference between the type of rheological model and the applicable range of the rheological model the design of the test model considerably varies as seen from fig 1 as the maximum shear rate increases the minimum diameter of the model gradually decreases additionally as the strength of the debris flows different types increases the minimum diameter of the model gradually increases when the minimum diameter is determined the impact velocity can be designed according to the reynolds criterion fig 2 shows that the maximum and minimum impact velocities vary little with changes in the maximum shear rate because the impact velocity and the diameter are limited and are controlled together by the shear rate the effect of the impact velocity is considered when the minimum pipeline diameter is determined in summary the design of the model must consider the influence of the rheological model of a submarine debris flow 5 conclusions through briefly describing studies and prediction methods for the impact of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline the shortcomings of the current design of the model test are noted then based on the reynolds criterion and considering the applicable range of the rheological model of a submarine debris flow the design formulas of the model of the impact of a debris flow on a pipeline are derived and established the conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 the rheological model of a debris flow plays a crucial role in studying the impact of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline therefore it is necessary to ensure that the rheological model of a debris flow can reflect the actual situation and that the shear rate of the rheological model cannot exceed its applicable range 2 to apply the prediction formula from the model test to a real prototype under various working conditions it must be ensured that the test models contain the same range of reynolds numbers as the engineering prototypes 3 using the design formulas of the test model for the impact of a submarine debris flow on a pipeline established via formula derivation the size of the pipeline and the impact velocity can be determined to reduce the size and cost of the test and improve the accuracy and efficiency of the calculation we recommend using the critical value

23134,a new experimental device designed and built at technische universität berlin for measuring forces and moments on a ship in waves is described and results of a comprehensive test campaign with the model of cruise ship are discussed forces moments and motions on of the model have been obtained during tests at forward speed in head waves and at zero speed in oblique incoming waves single motions have been restrained during these tests in order to analyse their influence on the mean forces and on other motions the device allows for extracting non hydrodynamic inertial force contributions from the measured signals the mean values of these inertial forces are not always zero but often very significant and must therefore be subtracted for a reliable comparison with mean wave forces and moments predicted by numerical simulations keywords wave forces added resistance seakeeping experimental fluid dynamics ship motions inertial forces 1 introduction a ship is exposed to waves across its entire service life the prediction of wave forces and moments acting on the ship and thereby of ship motions is still a challenge in naval architecture determining these forces for a ship at forward speed provides knowledge about the resistance increase in waves permits identifying limiting wave heights for safe operation and allows for predicting rudder manoeuvres in waves when appropriately implemented into a simulator tool when designing a new ship mainly the added resistance in head seas is investigated by means of model tests or numerical calculations in order to estimate the increase in engine power needed in a given scenario moreover if the mean forces and moments due to waves at a desired mean forward speed for several wave lengths and encountering angles are known it is possible to use them for numerical manoeuvring prediction in waves as shown by yasukawa and nakayama 2009 or by cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 for a thorough experimental prediction of wave forces an adequate set up and knowledge about its peculiarities is essential especially the influence of the measurement method on the resulting motions and hence forces is of importance such information about implemented test set ups is difficult to obtain and rarely found in available publications early experimental research activities on added resistance were performed by sibul 1971 where different series 60 ships were investigated in long waves compared to the ship length at different froude numbers the measurements were performed letting the model free to surge heave and pitch and repeated with restricted surge motion yielding the same mean forces a similar study was performed by gerritsma and beukelman 1972 for a fast general cargo ship at different speeds wave lengths and amplitudes a very comprehensive experimental study on added resistance was performed by strom tejsen et al 1973 for a destroyer a high speed vessel and five series 60 shapes tested at different speeds in regular waves of different lengths and also in long crested seaways of given sea spectra extensive campaigns on mean wave forces at zero speed were performed by pinkster 1980 for a tanker and other floating structures and by huijsmans 1996 for a tanker at different loading conditions both authors used basic active and passive restraints to keep the ship in a mean position in order to validate numerical predictions models in both works a set up with passive restraints was chosen where the springs are directly connected to the model to keep it in a mean position it was stated that in this case the system resonance frequency should be at least five times lower than the wave encounter frequency a different approach for measuring mean wave forces was presented by kashiwagi 2013 where forces are measured directly as well as by deriving them from the energy of the wave system generated by the ship for two modified wigley hull models sailing in waves in fixed and free condition the experiments were able to quantify the diffraction and radiation wave resistance components of the ship by assigning them to the different ship generated wave systems tello ruiz et al 2016 performed model tests at small forward speed in the shallow water seakeeping basin of flanders hydraulics research measuring mean forces in a horizontal reference frame tested situations were head and oblique regular waves at small angles of incidence using a test setup fixed in surge sway and yaw but free in heave pitch and roll a soft mooring arrangement described in sprenger et al 2016 was used at marintek and cehipar to determine wave added resistance and mean forces at zero speed during the european research project shopera they measured the forces in a ship fixed manner and the spring stiffness was varied as can be seen many different test set ups have been used for force measurements in waves so far but little to none information is available on their peculiarities and the influence of the devices on the measured quantities therefore it was targeted to develop a measuring device capable of quantifying the effects of the device on the model motions and measured forces furthermore it should be possible to restrain single motions and parameters of influence should be variable by the experimenter due to the absence of an adequate and precise motion measurement equipment a reliable mechanism for motion capturing has to be included in the device allowing to subtract non hydrodynamic inertial forces and moments from the measurements whenever required thus a system of slides that can be fixed if desired was considered to be the best option the ship model can be attached to these slides via vertical towing connectors allowing a ship fixed force measurement some devices satisfying the described requirements have been built and used for tank tests however it is not clear if and how measurements are influenced by the used set up fujii and takahashi 1975 showed a new measuring apparatus called resistance dynamometer which consisted of a vertical towing rod connected to the model and supported by carriages capable of surging and swaying simultaneously with this set up it was possible to measure at several incident wave angles an uncertainty analysis of measured mean wave forces was performed by park et al 2014 for a vlcc in head seas the experimental set up has a sub carriage with springs for a surge motion relative to the towing carriage and the model is free to heave and pitch by means of a heave rod with a pitch gimbal at the end placed in the centre of gravity of the model the spring stiffness is chosen carefully but the influence of the additional carriage mass in longitudinal direction and it s influence on the models surge motion is not discussed this set up meets many of the criteria described above but is only suitable for head waves another innovative approach stems from xu et al 2007 who presented an alternative pmm for waves here two slides carriages supported by springs allow for surge and sway motions while the device is connected to a classical pmm heave and pitch motions are free by means of heave rods and pitch gimbals the set up is used for dynamic pure sway tests in waves and mean forces are evaluated for different sway periods and wave amplitudes during the german research project persee the hsva developed a similar device than described in the present work see valanto and hong 2015 the measurement device consists of slides supported by springs allowing surge sway and yaw motions the connection of the device with the model allows for free heave pitch and roll motions at hsva oblique waves can be generated in the towing tank by means of a 40 m long side wave generator during the test campaign mean forces and yaw moments on a ship model in waves at various encounter angles were measured at relatively high forward speed a discussion on the influence of the used experimental set up on the measured quantities is not found in any publication known to the authors moreover non hydrodynamic inertial effects stemming from model motions are not mentioned in any publication on wave force measurement cfd based methods and panel code predictions have improved greatly in the past two decades and it is important to correctly compare results when using experimental data for validation purposes during force measurements of a ship model moving in waves inertial forces are included in the measurements they consist of an oscillating and a mean non zero part the mean value mainly results from superposed motions being at least partially in phase this aspect of measuring forces in a body fixed frame will be discussed thoroughly in section 3 3 after a brief outline of the theoretical background the new measurement device for mean forces on ships in waves and the involved measurement technique is presented finally the results of a measuring campaign with a cruise ship model are presented discussed and some conclusions are drawn 2 equations for model test analysis to describe ship motions in waves two coordinate systems are used an earth fixed system considered as an inertial reference system with coordinates ξ η ζ and a ship fixed system with coordinates x y z see fig 1 the ship fixed origin o is at design water line amidships at l p p 2 the x axis is defined positive towards the bow the y axis towards starboard and the z axis positive downwards the wave encounter angle μ is defined between the wave propagation direction and ship fixed x axis therefore μ 180 describes the head sea case and μ 90 corresponds to waves from starboard the drift angle β is defined between the ships velocity vector u and the positive x axis the encounter frequency ω e in waves of length λ is ω e ω k u 0 c o s μ where ω is the wave angular frequency u 0 u cos β is the velocity component in positive x direction and k 2 π λ is the wave number to transform coordinates x y z from the ship fixed system to the inertial system equation 1 is applied the values ξ 0 η 0 ζ 0 are the coordinates of the origin 0 in the inertial frame 1 ξ η ζ ξ 0 η 0 ζ 0 t x y z the transformation matrix t from the ship fixed system to the inertial coordinate system in equation 2 results from the composition of three rotations namely roll about the ship fixed longitudinal axis

measurement device the measurement device is designed to perform added resistance tests at different speeds and mean force moment tests at zero speed for a proper definition of the desired characteristics of the measurement device a set of requirements were specified the motions of the model should be as free as possible passive restriction of the horizontal degrees of freedom with springs of variable stiffness the weight of moving slides should be small compared to the ships weight the slides should move with minimal friction model motions should be measured accurately without the need of an external optical system forces should be measured in ship fixed manner to meet the requirements a device consisting of nested slides seemed the most suitable it allows to restrain the horizontal motions with independent spring retained slides and leaves the heave pitch and roll motions free fixing the slides at a desired position is also possible in order to investigate the influence of restraining individual motions or degrees of freedom a drawback of this concept is the required small weight of the slides and the friction on the rails for an estimation of the influence of the slide mass and the spring stiffness a preliminary study with the code wamit wave analysis at massachusetts institute of technology was performed wamit is a potential theory based code capable of calculating motions and wave loads on structures at zero mean forward speed for details see lee 1995 the raos response amplitude operators in regular waves of all degrees of freedom surge sway and yaw were calculated for the free floating ship the ship with additional masses in the affected directions simulating the slide masses the ship with springs and finally the ship with both spring influence and the slides masses an exemplary result for the surge motion in head waves at model scale can be seen in fig 2 where the black continuous line is the baseline for the free model when adding the mass of the slides of nearly 8 kg the surge motion amplitude decreases in waves longer than λ l p p 0 75 compared to the baseline the opposite happens for a spring stiffness of c x 160 n m where the motion amplitude increases when including slide mass and springs in the same calculation both effects compensate each other for a certain wave lengths range this behaviour suggests that the spring stiffness may be chosen properly to compensate the effect of the unavoidable slide masses for the wave lengths region of interest as can be seen from fig 2 the motion amplitude changes up to 10 between the different setups considered the measurement device was built as follows the platform consists of two δ y slides fore and aft which move independently in horizontal transversal direction using four semi open ball bearings on steel rail guides nested within each slide is a δ x slide that moves in horizontal longitudinal direction the maximum motion amplitude in each direction is 0 2 m by combined linear motions of the slides the model can move in the horizontal plane only restricted by the springs longitudinal ones marked in green and transversal ones in orange attached to each slide see fig 3 both δ x slides are equipped with double linear ball bearings guiding vertical heave rods connected to the model ensuring free heave motions the heave rods are connected to the model through rod ends which allow a free roll and pitch motion the rod end connectors elevate over the bottom of the model using adjustable aluminium cylinders at a height close to the centre of gravity see fig 4 below this rotatable connector a six component force gauge is fixed on a stiff bottom plate screwed to the ship model the base frame carrying the slides consists of stiff aluminium profiles held together with connector pieces and stiff angle brackets as mentioned above the weight of the slides should be kept as small as possible thus the longitudinal slides consist of ultra light aluminium profiles and lightweight rail bearings the weight of all slides is summarized in table 1 the springs have to be chosen with special care springs with different stiffness but the same given extension range have different winding lengths therefore the slides possess adjustable spring connection points parallel to each rail guide to allow usage of a variety of springs the maximum non exceedable motion amplitudes are restricted by buffer stoppers on the rail guides as well as adjustable bumpers beside the model for variation of spring stiffness in a wide range a set of specially made springs was purchased the springs were used in suitable combinations so that the total stiffness increases in desired spans the total directional stiffness of the chosen spring combinations is summarized in table 2 in order to incorporate the measurement device into the existing towing tank layout a trailer was built that carries the device behind the towing carriage the connection between trailer and carriage is a rubber connector setup in order to damp vibrations excited by the towing carriage in the last step of the development of the device the influence of the ball bearing friction of the horizontal slides was reduced as much as possible the friction force was measured repeatedly at different velocities for each slide using a motor and a small force gauge attached to the slide the measured friction is of coulomb type μ c times weight and therefore independent of the slides velocity the mean measured force was close to 2 n and the mean corresponding coulomb coefficient for the δ x slides was μ c x 0 042 for the δ y slides the mean force was close to 4 n corresponding to μ c y 0 027 these friction forces are overall small compared to the first order exciting forces of the waves on the model hence their influence on the horizontal motions is insignificant 3 1 measurement of forces the mean measured forces at zero forward speed are expected to be very small compared to the first order wave force amplitudes during added resistance tests at forward speed the force amplitudes are even larger and in addition acceleration forces arise during the acceleration phase previous to the actual measurement interval therefore the force gauges were chosen carefully as a compromise between maximum permitted range and accuracy the used force gauges are of 6 dof type with a maximum force range of 500 n each the gauges are fixed to the model floor allowing a measurement in the ship coordinate system when measurements are performed with the free model held by springs only longitudinal and side forces are evaluated from the fore f f and the aft f a force gauge in order to obtain the ship fixed forces f x m e a s f y m e a s and yaw moment m z m e a s as shown in equation 6 both force gauges are placed in the midship plane at a distance of l f g 1 25 m from each other note that f x f is small but not exactly zero due to the inertia of the forward δ x slide 6 f x m e a s f x a f x f f y m e a s f y a f y f m z m e a s f y f x f g f f y a x f g a the illustrated force moment calculation is implemented into the measuring software when measuring in a completely fixed condition it is also possible to evaluate the six force signals and obtain all hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the ship the position of the force gauges and the rod end connections relative to the ship fixed origin is given in table 3 3 2 measurement of model motions the motions of the model are determined by a set of cable actuated distance sensors although only the signals of six distance sensors are necessary to calculate all motions of the model a total number of ten distance sensors w1 to w10 is installed on the measurement platform as depicted in fig 5 the used distance sensors have low pull in force and are placed in a symmetrical arrangement in order to minimize their influence on the slides and on the model motions moreover this arrangement allows for error control using redundant sensors thus ensuring reliable measurements the friction of the cable actuator sensors is certainly not negligible but do only affect roll considerably the determination of the ship motions is performed in two steps at first the three rotations φ ϑ ψ and the three displacements ξ p η p ζ p of a point p are determined located in the middle of the aft rod end see fig 6 the three motions parameters ξ p η p ψ can be directly measured the displacements of the aft δ x and δ y slides are directly obtained by the connected distance sensors the heave rod connected to the model can only perform vertical motions therefore the horizontal displacements of p are known with the measured displacements of the fore and aft δy slides and the known distance between force gauges l f g the yaw angle ψ can be determined with equation 7 note that if the measuring frame is rotated in its initial position a static yaw angle has to be added to equation 7 7 ψ arcsin δ y f δ y a l f g the remaining three unknowns ζ p φ ϑ can be determined from the signals of three out of four vertical distance sensors using the transformation matrix t equation 2 and the three signals it is possible to define a system of equations whose solution yields the three sought quantities for this purpose a towing carriage fixed coordinate system ξ η ζ is placed as depicted in fig 6 the ship fixed coordinate system x y z remains as described above the measured elongation δ s i of each used vertical distance sensor i yields the total length of the sensor cable s i s 0 i δ s i the initial cable length s 0 i has been measured in advance the length of each sensor cable is equal to the magnitude of the vector from the endpoint of the distance sensor cable ξ e η e ζ e to its starting point ξ s η s ζ s see equation 8 8 s i 2 ξ e i ξ s i 2 η e i η s i 2 ζ e i ζ s i 2 the coordinates of the distance sensor starting points attached to the slides are known at all times from the measured horizontal displacements of the slides the coordinates of the distance sensor end points are known and constant in the ship fixed system and can be transformed using the point p as reference see

solved with an iterative method in the implemented measurement software the multidimensional newton raphson method was used the initial value of the method can be just zero but it is more efficient to take the values from the last point of time after solving this problem all rotatory degrees of freedom and the displacements of the model point p are known to obtain the translatory motions of the ships origin o their earth fixed coordinates are calculated with equation 10 where everything is known from the right hand side in this manner all degrees of freedom are determined in real time during the measurement 10 ξ o η o ζ o ξ p η p ζ p t x p y p z p the measurement software is coded using the commercial programming environment labview from national instruments for solving the stated system of equations a fortran subroutine was written that is called by the main programme in a dll format in every time step during a measurement this procedure does not lead to delays of any kind at a measurement frequency of 200 hz using a normal notebook with such implementation the motion parameters are available at the same frequency as the force gauge data wave gauge data and all other information the presence of the cable actuated distance sensors on all ship motions other than roll has shown to be negligible the influence on the roll motion was quantified by a roll decay test the test was at first performed with the model floating completely free and then repeated with the model connected to the device with and without distance sensors the tests showed that the natural roll frequency is not affected by the sensors however the roll damping is increased significantly by the presence of the sensors although in the present case the influence of the roll motion on the forces is expected to be small due to the high gm this should be improved in a future step 3 3 mean hydrodynamic forces and inertial correction when measuring the forces on a freely moving model only restrained by horizontal springs the obtained mean force and moment displace the model from the original position there are no significant reynolds number dependent effects expected on mean wave forces therefore they can be directly transformed to full scale with the froude law they are valid for the chosen mass distribution during the tests and can be used as input for a powering layout or for simulating manoeuvres in waves the time traces of the ship fixed components of the measured force are composed of a hydrodynamic gravitational and inertial part when comparing the measured values with numerical calculations where only the total stresses on the hull are integrated it is important to take this into account this means either to subtract mean non hydrodynamic contributions from the measurement or otherwise add them to the numerical values the inertial force contributions expressed in the ship fixed coordinate system result from the terms on the left hand side in equation 3 they are naturally not zero and some components can yield a mean value because they originate from multiplication of two oscillatory motions the following case can be considered as an example a ship is excited by regular waves with amplitude ζ w in regular waves from ahead μ 180 with the wave encounter frequency ω e the ship will only perform heave pitch and surge motions to simplify the problem the centre of gravity is assumed to coincide with the origin of the ship fixed coordinate system taking all this into account equation 3 for the longitudinal force component i 1 reduces to equation 11 11 m u ω 2 w f x the incident waves will cause ship motions and velocities according to the linear wave theory valid for small wave steepness the resulting ship velocities will be harmonic oscillations in the encounter frequency ω e with a certain phase shift regarding the exciting wave 12 u u ˆ cos ω e t α u w w ˆ cos ω e t α w q q ˆ cos ω e t α q in equation 12 u and w are ship fixed velocity components q the pitch rate which is equal to ω 2 in the present case and α u α w α q the phase shift u ˆ w ˆ and q ˆ are the corresponding velocity amplitudes inserting these approaches into equation 11 and applying some trigonometric transformation equation 13 results 13 m u ˆ ω e cos ω e t α u w ˆ q ˆ 1 2 cos 2 ω e t α w α q cos α w α q f x when taking the average over one period t e 2 π ω e the constant last summand on the left side of equation 13 yields the following mean value 14 f x i n e r t 1 2 m w ˆ q ˆ cos α w α q 0 for α w α q 2 n 1 π 2 n 0 1 2 the example above shows that inertial forces have a non zero mean value even when assuming a simplified case with completely linear conditions whenever the phases are not shifted exactly by 90 in this example the mean inertial force depends on the ship mass m the velocity amplitudes w ˆ and q ˆ and on the phase shift between heave and pitch velocity if pitch and heave are completely in phase the mean value would be largest but this is not a realistic scenario a phase shift of 90 may be expected for very long wave to ship length ratios however for normal waves a phase shift different than 90 is expected the measured forces in the ship fixed system are composed of inertial hydrodynamic and gravitational forces this is shown in equations 15 17 where the inertial contributions are labelled with a x a y and m z here m is the suspended mass of the model including all mass below the force gauges the hydrodynamic force moment is labelled with the superscript hydro and the measured force moment with the superscript meas the weight contribution m g t i j γ j results from transforming the gravitational direction to the ship fixed system when the ship pitches and rolls here t i j is the transformation matrix and γ j the three directional cosines for the present investigation the gravitational contributions to the mean forces will be defined to zero because e g for the longitudinal force already a very small mean pitch angle stemming from measuring uncertainties can cause a significant force 15 m u a x 1 ω 2 w a x 2 ω 3 v a x 3 x g ω 2 2 ω 3 2 a x 4 y g ω 3 ω 1 ω 2 a x 5 z g ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 a x 6 f x h y d r

mean forces e g added resistance only contributions with non zero mean values are of importance all inertial contributions from the equations above are analysed and assumptions are made about weather they yield a mean contribution in a harmonically oscillating case with linear waves and averaging over full periods the following mean values are zero u i 0 u i 0 ω i 0 ω i 0 due to symmetry the centre of gravity is on the centreline plane y g 0 the following products of inertia are theoretically zero and vanishing values have been measured i x y 0 i y z 0 the product of inertia i x z is in fact not zero but the measured value 0 238 kgm 2 is not relevant for the present purpose i x z 0 3 3 1 inertial contributions in x direction the inertial force components in ship fixed x direction results from a multiplication of the acceleration terms a x in equation 15 and the oscillating mass m with the assumptions taken above only the following terms have non zero mean values and are

it was confirmed that the omitted terms really yield a zero mean value in case of harmonic motion responses the stated procedure to only consider expected non zero mean contributions yields more reliable results than subtracting all inertial terms from the measured time traces this is due to spurious accelerations resulting from the double derivation of measured motion time traces note that it is of course possible to purge the time traces considering all inertial contributions in order to obtain hydrodynamic time traces but this is only recommended when considering transient processes 4 experimental facility ship model and test campaign the model tests were carried out in the seakeeping basin at technische universität berlin the basin is 120 m long with a maximum test section length of 90 m the width of the basin is 8 m and the water depth was adjusted to 1 m the installed electrical wave generator can be fully controlled from the towing carriage by computer with the installed software long crested regular waves and irregular sea states with defined characteristics can be modelled generated and reproduced the wave generator can be operated in flap type or in piston type mode the latter has been used for all present experiments the towing carriage allows a maximum speed of 4 m s and is equipped with the new measurement device the investigated ship model is a cruise ship designed by meyer werft it is a twin screw twin rudder vessel with classical propulsion arrangement a central skeg bilge keels and a bulbous bow the body plan is depicted in fig 7 the main parameters of the cruise ship are listed in table 4 for a precise calculation of the described mean inertial forces and moments all inertia data of the ship needs to be accurately determined this was achieved using a special measurement device developed by the company resonic the model is mounted on a spring loaded platform and linear motions in various degrees of freedom are excited a complex regression analysis is used to compute the position of the centre of gravity cog and the moments and products of inertia of the empty model in a very short time the function of this device and the procedure to obtain a complete inertial data set is explained in klöpper et al 2013 the waves used for the model tests were chosen in a reasonable range of wave length to ship length ratio five wave lengths from λ l p p 0 5 to λ l p p 1 36 with almost constant wave steepness were chosen due to the maximum water depth in the seakeeping basin of tub 1 m waves longer than 2 m will have a certain shallow water influence two additional wave heights for the intermediate wave lengths were considered in order to investigate the effect of the wave steepness h w λ details of the used wave set are shown in table 5 since for low forward speed more strictly speaking τ u ω e g 0 25 yasukawa et al 2018 the incoming wave is influenced by the waves radiated by the ship the waves were measured in advance without the ship model to check the wave quality the deviations of the measured wave period from the target values were smaller than 1 while the deviations of the wave amplitude were between 3 and 6 the performed tests comprised added resistance tests in head waves at 21kn and two additional velocities the influence of the longitudinal spring stiffness and of a complete suppression of surge motion was tested as well as the influence of the wave height in addition the fully fixed model all dof inhibited was investigated in selected conditions at zero forward speed the tests comprised a large set of encounter wave angles also fixed model tests and stiffness variations tests were performed 5 results of model tests an extract of the performed model tests is presented here the results are structured in topics of interest fig 8 shows the measurement device during head wave tests at zero forward speed the repeatedly measured calm water resistance amounts to r 0 5 8 n in free sinkage and trim condition and to r 0 f 5 65 n in completely fixed condition for evaluating the tests the mean forces and moments are made non dimensional as stated in equation 28 here the force and moment sign is in accordance with the ship fixed coordinate system directions a positive longitudinal force would therefore push the model forward 28 f f ρ g l p p ζ w 2 m m ρ g l p p 2 ζ w 2 the added resistance coefficient however is calculated so that the values are always positive 29 f a d d f x r 0 ρ g l p p ζ w 2 all tests in the subsequent paragraphs are performed for the freely moving ship at 21 kn full scale and the spring setup 3 unless stated otherwise 5 1 added resistance in waves the measured added resistance at 21 kn in head and following waves for the freely moving ship and the fixed ship configuration is shown in fig 9 as dashed lines the added resistance is obtained by averaging the longitudinal force over a sufficient number of periods at least five attention was paid to the fact that the model has already entered a harmonic motion in head waves a pronounced maximum can be seen close to λ 1 in following waves μ 0 the added resistance is rather small and becomes negative pushing the ship forward for waves longer than λ 1 1 the solid line represents the pure hydrodynamic wave force where mean inertial force contributions have been subtracted as indicated in section 3 3 the pure hydrodynamic force in relatively long head waves where motions become significant is about 20 larger compared to the measured force without subtracting inertial forces in following waves the mean inertial forces are almost zero for all wave lengths the added resistance of the completely fixed model is also shown in fig 9 in head seas the added resistance is almost constant in following waves it slightly decreases towards long waves but does not become negative as for the free model during these fixed model tests very large force amplitudes were measured arising from the wave exciting force but also inertial forces during the acceleration and deceleration phase of the towing carriage justifying the necessity of the chosen force gauge range a comparison of added resistance predictions for the free model at 21 kn with other experiments and cfd calculations can be seen in fig 10 the measured mean forces can be directly compared to the ones from hsva valanto and hong 2015 the dotted lines show very similar values except for the shortest wave length λ 0 5 the cfd calculation from ude sigmund and el moctar 2016 and the tub calculations with the rans code neptuno are close to each other disregarding the shorter waves where the results from neptuno are probably less accurate due to insufficient resolution in the discretisation of the computational domain for waves larger than λ 0 75 the calculated forces are larger than the measured mean forces because inertial effects are not taken into account in the code however when compared with the experimental pure hydrodynamic force the values agree well for long waves this shows that for comparing results from experiment and cfd simulations it is crucial to compare equivalent data identifying distinct contributions the total longitudinal force on the model towed in fixed condition compared to the data obtained with neptuno is plotted in fig 11 when the model is fixed the measured forces are purely hydrodynamic and more precisely just wave exciting forces made up of a diffraction and the froude krylov force and can therefore directly be compared to the numerical calculation both data sets agree fairly for most wave lengths showing that the tests in fixed conditions are adequately captured with a rans code without any post processing of forces particulars on the cfd calculations can be found in part b of this paper uharek and cura hochbaum 2018 5 2 influence of motion restraints the stiffness constants of the used spring constellations are listed above in table 2 during the fixed surge condition only the rear δ x slide was fixed so that the heave and pitch motion was not restrained the resulting added resistance coefficients are shown in fig 12 at wave length λ l p p 1 the mean forces for all stiffness s are of same magnitude for λ l p p 0 75 only the fixed surge condition has a slightly smaller mean measured value note that the spring combination 1 was not suitable for added resistance tests due to the large spring elongation caused by the calm water resistance the present measurements confirm the behaviour stated by other researchers in previous studies during added resistance tests in head waves the model can be fixed in surge and the measured mean forces will not be affected as stated in section 3 a different surge amplitude is expected for each spring stiffness however the surge motion in head seas at this high forward speed is rather small for the investigated waves therefore a restriction of this small motion does not affect the measured mean forces when looking at the surge motion rao in fig 13 all three stiffness constants yield almost the same amplitudes especially for λ l p p 0 75 as expected the highest surge amplitude results for the highest stiffness in the longer waves interestingly the lowest stiffness does not yield the smallest amplitude but the medium one does this occurrence could not be explained yet and should be further investigated note that the surge fixed case does also have a small non zero surge motion amplitude this is because the model is fixed at the point p being at a different height then the origin o of the ship fixed coordinate system while o experiences a small surge motion due to the pitch motion a series of tests was performed to gain knowledge about the influence of restraining single motions on the resulting added resistance in head wave conditions first the surge and sway motion was suppressed then the heave and pitch motion due to the measurement device design it was not possible to restrain heave or pitch separately the results are shown in fig 14 as stated above fixing the surge motion did not change the mean forces significantly compared to the surge free reference case when only fixing the heave and pitch motion the added resistance dropped significantly for the three tested waves and the values almost coincide with the tests for the fully fixed model this behaviour implies that the energy loss due to wave radiation stems completely from heave and pitch motions and the wave diffraction is nearly independent of a small surge motion 5 3 influence of wave steepness the influence of the wave steepness on the added resistance coefficient f a d d for the free model at 21 kn is shown in fig 15 the largest wave height leads to the smallest added resistance value and vice versa it seems that the assumption of a quadratic dependence of mean wave forces on the wave amplitude is not applicable for at least two of the investigated waves for this hull form especially the lowest and almost linear steepness leads to a clearly higher coefficient pinkster 1980 found a similar behaviour when he investigated this dependence for a tanker at zero speed sibul 1971 also varied the wave steepness during tests with a fast series 60 vessel and found that the wave amplitude squared dependence of forces near the added resistance rao peak only applies for high wave steepness for low steepness he found the dependence being of a power higher than two these observations made in the past also match the findings of the present campaign looking at the hydrodynamic force in fig 15 it seems that the mean non dimensional inertial force does not change much with the wave amplitude the offset between measured and hydrodynamic force is almost the same except for the smallest wave steepness where the model motions are smaller altogether 5 4 static drift tests tests with a static drift angle are a possibility to superpose oblique wave forces and forces due to a drift motion although the situation same drift and encounter angle is not realistic these tests are of interest to validate a mathematical model for the hydrodynamic forces which is used for predicting manoeuvres in waves see uharek and cura hochbaum 2015 and cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 the spring stiffness was chosen as high as possible constellation 4 for these tests in order to minimize the effect of an additional yaw angle due to the wave induced yaw moment the initial drift angle β was set in a way that during the tests for 21 kn full scale the desired angle of 10 15 and 20 was reached the results for the longitudinal force can be seen in fig 16 the calm water results are represented by the solid black line the force is highest near 10 and decreases towards larger drift angles at the shortest wave of λ l p p 0 5 the longitudinal force is almost the same as in calm water the longer waves not only increase the resistance significantly but they also invert the tendency of the declining calm water forces towards larger drift angles this behaviour is consistent with the fact that the added resistance is largest at an encounter angle of roughly μ 210 for waves of medium length the side force is shown in fig 17 where the solid black line is the calm water reference it is very interesting that the side force does not increase in the considered oblique waves but even slightly decreases for small angles e g 10 compared to the calm water mean force especially the wave of length λ l p p 0 97 causes a smaller total mean side force at low drift angles similar to the side force the measured yaw moment with drift in waves are very close to the calm water values see fig 18 this indicates that for the considered combinations of β and μ the side force and yaw moment due to drift in calm water are highly dominant compared to the wave induced mean force and moment similar results were obtained by tello ruiz et al 2016 for a container ship in shallow water 5 5 zero speed mean wave forces at zero speed the mean forces due to waves at different encounter angles can be measured the measurement device with the current set up can easily vary the wave encounter angle from μ 180 to μ 0 for the present purposes in 30 steps the measured results for the longitudinal force coefficient are shown in fig 19 the largest coefficients are caused by the shortest waves the force coefficients decrease for longer waves but do not become nearly zero as expected from theory this may be due to the friction of the slides leading to slightly different stopping positions at maximum displacement in combination with a somewhat low sensitivity of the force gauges in this scenario the mean forces are very small the side force coefficients f y are shown in fig 20 the shortest waves again lead to the largest values especially for short waves the maximum force is not at μ 90 but shifted towards larger and smaller angles the side force coefficient decreases quickly for longer waves the yaw moment coefficient is shown in fig 21 for the encounter angles μ 60 and 120 the shortest wave yields the largest moment however for other encounter angles longer waves yield larger moment coefficients it is also observable that the yaw moment does not decrease significantly for longer waves leading to the conclusion that long waves may also cause large yaw moments in contrast to the side force behaviour 6 conclusions a new measurement device for seakeeping tests has been designed built tested and used for a measurement campaign at technische universität berlin forces moments and motions on of the ship model in waves are obtained accurately with the implemented experimental setup consisting of nested slides held by linear springs single motions can be restrained to analyse their influence on the mean forces and on other motions disregarding suppressing surge motions for instance does not affect the added resistance in head sea condition but this cannot be extrapolated for other encounter angles and motions do in general have a large influence on mean forces the friction of the used ball bearings at the rails may have a small effect on the maximum motion amplitudes but does not affect the measurements considerably it has been shown that the contribution of non hydrodynamic inertial forces to the total forces and moments may be considerable this it is essential to subtract them from the measurements in order to get pure hydrodynamic forces on the ship in waves e g for the comparison with cfd resutls acknowledgements the authors would like to express their gratitude towards the german ministry of economic affairs and energy as well as the european commission for supporting this work through the projects persee and shopera we also thank sebastian uharek for providing cfd results obtained with the rans code neptuno for comparison purposes 
23134,a new experimental device designed and built at technische universität berlin for measuring forces and moments on a ship in waves is described and results of a comprehensive test campaign with the model of cruise ship are discussed forces moments and motions on of the model have been obtained during tests at forward speed in head waves and at zero speed in oblique incoming waves single motions have been restrained during these tests in order to analyse their influence on the mean forces and on other motions the device allows for extracting non hydrodynamic inertial force contributions from the measured signals the mean values of these inertial forces are not always zero but often very significant and must therefore be subtracted for a reliable comparison with mean wave forces and moments predicted by numerical simulations keywords wave forces added resistance seakeeping experimental fluid dynamics ship motions inertial forces 1 introduction a ship is exposed to waves across its entire service life the prediction of wave forces and moments acting on the ship and thereby of ship motions is still a challenge in naval architecture determining these forces for a ship at forward speed provides knowledge about the resistance increase in waves permits identifying limiting wave heights for safe operation and allows for predicting rudder manoeuvres in waves when appropriately implemented into a simulator tool when designing a new ship mainly the added resistance in head seas is investigated by means of model tests or numerical calculations in order to estimate the increase in engine power needed in a given scenario moreover if the mean forces and moments due to waves at a desired mean forward speed for several wave lengths and encountering angles are known it is possible to use them for numerical manoeuvring prediction in waves as shown by yasukawa and nakayama 2009 or by cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 for a thorough experimental prediction of wave forces an adequate set up and knowledge about its peculiarities is essential especially the influence of the measurement method on the resulting motions and hence forces is of importance such information about implemented test set ups is difficult to obtain and rarely found in available publications early experimental research activities on added resistance were performed by sibul 1971 where different series 60 ships were investigated in long waves compared to the ship length at different froude numbers the measurements were performed letting the model free to surge heave and pitch and repeated with restricted surge motion yielding the same mean forces a similar study was performed by gerritsma and beukelman 1972 for a fast general cargo ship at different speeds wave lengths and amplitudes a very comprehensive experimental study on added resistance was performed by strom tejsen et al 1973 for a destroyer a high speed vessel and five series 60 shapes tested at different speeds in regular waves of different lengths and also in long crested seaways of given sea spectra extensive campaigns on mean wave forces at zero speed were performed by pinkster 1980 for a tanker and other floating structures and by huijsmans 1996 for a tanker at different loading conditions both authors used basic active and passive restraints to keep the ship in a mean position in order to validate numerical predictions models in both works a set up with passive restraints was chosen where the springs are directly connected to the model to keep it in a mean position it was stated that in this case the system resonance frequency should be at least five times lower than the wave encounter frequency a different approach for measuring mean wave forces was presented by kashiwagi 2013 where forces are measured directly as well as by deriving them from the energy of the wave system generated by the ship for two modified wigley hull models sailing in waves in fixed and free condition the experiments were able to quantify the diffraction and radiation wave resistance components of the ship by assigning them to the different ship generated wave systems tello ruiz et al 2016 performed model tests at small forward speed in the shallow water seakeeping basin of flanders hydraulics research measuring mean forces in a horizontal reference frame tested situations were head and oblique regular waves at small angles of incidence using a test setup fixed in surge sway and yaw but free in heave pitch and roll a soft mooring arrangement described in sprenger et al 2016 was used at marintek and cehipar to determine wave added resistance and mean forces at zero speed during the european research project shopera they measured the forces in a ship fixed manner and the spring stiffness was varied as can be seen many different test set ups have been used for force measurements in waves so far but little to none information is available on their peculiarities and the influence of the devices on the measured quantities therefore it was targeted to develop a measuring device capable of quantifying the effects of the device on the model motions and measured forces furthermore it should be possible to restrain single motions and parameters of influence should be variable by the experimenter due to the absence of an adequate and precise motion measurement equipment a reliable mechanism for motion capturing has to be included in the device allowing to subtract non hydrodynamic inertial forces and moments from the measurements whenever required thus a system of slides that can be fixed if desired was considered to be the best option the ship model can be attached to these slides via vertical towing connectors allowing a ship fixed force measurement some devices satisfying the described requirements have been built and used for tank tests however it is not clear if and how measurements are influenced by the used set up fujii and takahashi 1975 showed a new measuring apparatus called resistance dynamometer which consisted of a vertical towing rod connected to the model and supported by carriages capable of surging and swaying simultaneously with this set up it was possible to measure at several incident wave angles an uncertainty analysis of measured mean wave forces was performed by park et al 2014 for a vlcc in head seas the experimental set up has a sub carriage with springs for a surge motion relative to the towing carriage and the model is free to heave and pitch by means of a heave rod with a pitch gimbal at the end placed in the centre of gravity of the model the spring stiffness is chosen carefully but the influence of the additional carriage mass in longitudinal direction and it s influence on the models surge motion is not discussed this set up meets many of the criteria described above but is only suitable for head waves another innovative approach stems from xu et al 2007 who presented an alternative pmm for waves here two slides carriages supported by springs allow for surge and sway motions while the device is connected to a classical pmm heave and pitch motions are free by means of heave rods and pitch gimbals the set up is used for dynamic pure sway tests in waves and mean forces are evaluated for different sway periods and wave amplitudes during the german research project persee the hsva developed a similar device than described in the present work see valanto and hong 2015 the measurement device consists of slides supported by springs allowing surge sway and yaw motions the connection of the device with the model allows for free heave pitch and roll motions at hsva oblique waves can be generated in the towing tank by means of a 40 m long side wave generator during the test campaign mean forces and yaw moments on a ship model in waves at various encounter angles were measured at relatively high forward speed a discussion on the influence of the used experimental set up on the measured quantities is not found in any publication known to the authors moreover non hydrodynamic inertial effects stemming from model motions are not mentioned in any publication on wave force measurement cfd based methods and panel code predictions have improved greatly in the past two decades and it is important to correctly compare results when using experimental data for validation purposes during force measurements of a ship model moving in waves inertial forces are included in the measurements they consist of an oscillating and a mean non zero part the mean value mainly results from superposed motions being at least partially in phase this aspect of measuring forces in a body fixed frame will be discussed thoroughly in section 3 3 after a brief outline of the theoretical background the new measurement device for mean forces on ships in waves and the involved measurement technique is presented finally the results of a measuring campaign with a cruise ship model are presented discussed and some conclusions are drawn 2 equations for model test analysis to describe ship motions in waves two coordinate systems are used an earth fixed system considered as an inertial reference system with coordinates ξ η ζ and a ship fixed system with coordinates x y z see fig 1 the ship fixed origin o is at design water line amidships at l p p 2 the x axis is defined positive towards the bow the y axis towards starboard and the z axis positive downwards the wave encounter angle μ is defined between the wave propagation direction and ship fixed x axis therefore μ 180 describes the head sea case and μ 90 corresponds to waves from starboard the drift angle β is defined between the ships velocity vector u and the positive x axis the encounter frequency ω e in waves of length λ is ω e ω k u 0 c o s μ where ω is the wave angular frequency u 0 u cos β is the velocity component in positive x direction and k 2 π λ is the wave number to transform coordinates x y

transformation matrix t from the ship fixed system to the inertial coordinate system in equation 2 results from the composition of three rotations namely roll about the ship fixed longitudinal axis

measurement device the measurement device is designed to perform added resistance tests at different speeds and mean force moment tests at zero speed for a proper definition of the desired characteristics of the measurement device a set of requirements were specified the motions of the model should be as free as possible passive restriction of the horizontal degrees of freedom with springs of variable stiffness the weight of moving slides should be small compared to the ships weight the slides should move with minimal friction model motions should be measured accurately without the need of an external optical system forces should be measured in ship fixed manner to meet the requirements a device consisting of nested slides seemed the most suitable it allows to restrain the horizontal motions with independent spring retained slides and leaves the heave pitch and roll motions free fixing the slides at a desired position is also possible in order to investigate the influence of restraining individual motions or degrees of freedom a drawback of this concept is the required small weight of the slides and the friction on the rails for an estimation of the influence of the slide mass and the spring stiffness a preliminary study with the code wamit wave analysis at massachusetts institute of technology was performed wamit is a potential theory based code capable of calculating motions and wave loads on structures at zero mean forward speed for details see lee 1995 the raos response amplitude operators in regular waves of all degrees of freedom surge sway and yaw were calculated for the free floating ship the ship with additional masses in the affected directions simulating the slide masses the ship with springs and finally the ship with both spring influence and the slides masses an exemplary result for the surge motion in head waves at model scale can be seen in fig 2 where the black continuous line is the baseline for the free model when adding the mass of the slides of nearly 8 kg the surge motion amplitude decreases in waves longer than λ l p p 0 75 compared to the baseline the opposite happens for a spring stiffness of c x 160 n m where the motion amplitude increases when including slide mass and springs in the same calculation both effects compensate each other for a certain wave lengths range this behaviour suggests that the spring stiffness may be chosen properly to compensate the effect of the unavoidable slide masses for the wave lengths region of interest as can be seen from fig 2 the motion amplitude changes up to 10 between the different setups considered the measurement device was built as follows the platform consists of two δ y slides fore and aft which move independently in horizontal transversal direction using four semi open ball bearings on steel rail guides nested within each slide is a δ x slide that moves in horizontal longitudinal direction the maximum motion amplitude in each direction is 0 2 m by combined linear motions of the slides the model can move in the horizontal plane only restricted by the springs longitudinal ones marked in green and transversal ones in orange attached to each slide see fig 3 both δ x slides are equipped with double linear ball bearings guiding vertical heave rods connected to the model ensuring free heave motions the heave rods are connected to the model through rod ends which allow a free roll and pitch motion the rod end connectors elevate over the bottom of the model using adjustable aluminium cylinders at a height close to the centre of gravity see fig 4 below this rotatable connector a six component force gauge is fixed on a stiff bottom plate screwed to the ship model the base frame carrying the slides consists of stiff aluminium profiles held together with connector pieces and stiff angle brackets as mentioned above the weight of the slides should be kept as small as possible thus the longitudinal slides consist of ultra light aluminium profiles and lightweight rail bearings the weight of all slides is summarized in table 1 the springs have to be chosen with special care springs with different stiffness but the same given extension range have different winding lengths therefore the slides possess adjustable spring connection points parallel to each rail guide to allow usage of a variety of springs the maximum non exceedable motion amplitudes are restricted by buffer stoppers on the rail guides as well as adjustable bumpers beside the model for variation of spring stiffness in a wide range a set of specially made springs was purchased the springs were used in suitable combinations so that the total stiffness increases in desired spans the total directional stiffness of the chosen spring combinations is summarized in table 2 in order to incorporate the measurement device into the existing towing tank layout a trailer was built that carries the device behind the towing carriage the connection between trailer and carriage is a rubber connector setup in order to damp vibrations excited by the towing carriage in the last step of the development of the device the influence of the ball bearing friction of the horizontal slides was reduced as much as possible the friction force was measured repeatedly at different velocities for each slide using a motor and a small force gauge attached to the slide the measured friction is of coulomb type μ c times weight and therefore independent of the slides velocity the mean measured force was close to 2 n and the mean corresponding coulomb coefficient for the δ x slides was μ c x 0 042 for the δ y slides the mean force was close to 4 n corresponding to μ c y 0 027 these friction forces are overall small compared to the first order exciting forces of the waves on the model hence their influence on the horizontal motions is insignificant 3 1 measurement of forces the mean measured forces at zero forward speed are expected to be very small compared to the first order wave force amplitudes during added resistance tests at forward speed the force amplitudes are even larger and in addition acceleration forces arise during the acceleration phase previous to the actual measurement interval therefore the force gauges were chosen carefully as a compromise between maximum permitted range and accuracy the used force gauges are of 6 dof type with a maximum force range of 500 n each the gauges are fixed to the model floor allowing a measurement in the ship coordinate system when measurements are performed with the free model held by springs only longitudinal and side forces are evaluated from the fore f f and the aft f a force gauge in order to obtain the ship fixed forces f x m e a s f y m e a s and yaw moment m z m e a s as shown in equation 6 both force gauges are placed in the midship plane at a distance of l f g 1 25 m from each other note that f x f is small but not exactly zero due to the inertia of the forward δ x slide 6 f x m e a s f x a f x f f y m e a s f y a f y f m z m e a s f y f x f g f f y a x f g a the illustrated force moment calculation is implemented into the measuring software when measuring in a completely fixed condition it is also possible to evaluate the six force signals and obtain all hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the ship the position of the force gauges and the rod end connections relative to the ship fixed origin is given in table 3 3 2 measurement of model motions the motions of the model are determined by a set of cable actuated distance sensors although only the signals of six distance sensors are necessary to calculate all motions of the model a total number of ten distance sensors w1 to w10 is installed on the measurement platform as depicted in fig 5 the used distance sensors have low pull in force and are placed in a symmetrical arrangement in order to minimize their influence on the slides and on the model motions moreover this arrangement allows for error control using redundant sensors thus ensuring reliable measurements the friction of the cable actuator sensors is certainly not negligible but do only affect roll considerably the determination of the ship motions is performed in two steps at first the three rotations φ ϑ ψ and the three displacements ξ p η p ζ p of a point p are determined located in the middle of the aft rod end see fig 6 the three motions parameters ξ p η p ψ can be directly measured the displacements of the aft δ x and δ y slides are directly obtained by the connected distance sensors the heave rod connected to the model can only perform vertical motions therefore the horizontal displacements of p are known with the measured displacements of the fore and aft δy slides and the known distance between force gauges l f g the yaw angle ψ can be determined with equation 7 note that if the measuring frame is rotated in its initial position a static yaw angle has to be added to equation 7 7 ψ arcsin δ y f δ y a l f g the remaining three unknowns ζ p φ ϑ can be determined from the signals of three out of four vertical distance sensors using the transformation matrix t equation 2 and the three signals it is possible to define a system of equations whose solution yields the three sought quantities for this purpose a towing carriage fixed coordinate system ξ η ζ is placed as depicted in fig 6 the ship fixed coordinate system x y z remains as described above the measured elongation δ s i of each used vertical distance sensor i yields the total length of the sensor cable s i s 0 i δ s i the initial cable length s 0 i has been measured in advance the length of each sensor cable is equal to the magnitude of the vector from the endpoint of the distance sensor cable ξ e η e ζ e to its starting point ξ s η s ζ s see equation 8 8 s i 2 ξ e i ξ s i 2 η e i η s i 2 ζ e i ζ s i 2 the coordinates of the distance sensor starting points attached to the slides are known at all times from the measured horizontal displacements of the slides the coordinates of the distance sensor end points are known and constant in the ship fixed system and can be transformed using the point p as reference see equation 9 note that at this point t contains the unknown entries φ and ϑ and that ζ p is unknown as well 9 ξ e i η e i ζ e i ξ p η p ζ p t φ ϑ ψ x e i x p y e i y p z e i z p when inserting equation 9 into equation 8 for the three selected vertical distance sensors a system of three non linear coupled differential equations in the three unknowns ζ p φ ϑ results this system of equations can be solved with an iterative method in the implemented measurement software the multidimensional newton raphson method was used the initial value of the method can be just zero but it is more efficient to take the values from the last point of time after solving this problem all rotatory degrees of freedom and the displacements of the model point p are known to obtain the translatory motions of the ships origin o their earth fixed coordinates are calculated with equation 10 where everything is known from the right hand side in this manner all degrees of freedom are determined in real time during the measurement 10 ξ o η o ζ o ξ p η p ζ p t x p y p z p the measurement software is coded using the commercial programming environment labview from national instruments for solving the stated system of equations a fortran subroutine was written that is called by the main programme in a dll format in every time step during a measurement this procedure does not lead to delays of any kind at a measurement frequency of 200 hz using a normal notebook with such implementation the motion parameters are available at the same frequency as the force gauge data wave gauge data and all other information the presence of the cable actuated distance sensors on all ship motions other than roll has shown to be negligible the influence on the roll motion was quantified by a roll decay test the test was at first performed with the model floating completely free and then repeated with the model connected to the device with and without distance sensors the tests showed that the natural roll frequency is not affected by the sensors however the roll damping is increased significantly by the presence of the sensors although in the present case the influence of the roll motion on the forces is expected to be small due to the high gm this should be improved in a future step 3 3 mean hydrodynamic forces and inertial correction when measuring the forces on a freely moving model only restrained by horizontal springs the obtained mean force and moment displace the model from the original position there are no significant reynolds number dependent effects expected on mean wave forces therefore they can be directly transformed to full scale with the froude law they are valid for the chosen mass distribution during the tests and can be used as input for a powering layout or for simulating manoeuvres in waves the time traces of the ship fixed components of the measured force are composed of a hydrodynamic gravitational and inertial part when comparing the measured values with numerical calculations where only the total stresses on the hull are integrated it is important to take this into account this means either to subtract mean non hydrodynamic contributions from the measurement or otherwise add them to the numerical values the inertial force contributions expressed in the ship fixed coordinate system result from the terms on the left hand side in equation 3 they are naturally not zero and some components can yield a mean value because they originate from multiplication of two oscillatory motions the following case can be considered as an example a ship is excited by regular waves with amplitude ζ w in regular waves from ahead μ 180 with the wave encounter frequency ω e the ship will only perform heave pitch and surge motions to simplify the problem the centre of gravity is assumed to coincide with the origin of the ship fixed coordinate system taking all this into account equation 3 for the longitudinal force component i 1 reduces to equation 11 11 m u ω 2 w f x the incident waves will cause ship motions and velocities according to the linear wave theory valid for small wave steepness the resulting ship velocities will be harmonic oscillations in the encounter frequency ω e with a certain phase shift regarding the exciting wave 12 u u ˆ cos ω e t α u w w ˆ cos ω e t α w q q ˆ cos ω e t α q in equation 12 u and w are ship fixed velocity components q the pitch rate which is equal to ω 2 in the present case and α u α w α q the phase shift u ˆ w ˆ and q ˆ are the corresponding velocity amplitudes inserting these approaches into equation 11 and applying some trigonometric transformation equation 13 results 13 m u ˆ ω e cos ω e t α u w ˆ q ˆ 1 2 cos 2 ω e t α w α q cos α w α q f x when taking the average over one period t e 2 π ω e the constant last summand on the left side of equation 13 yields the following mean value 14 f x i n e r t 1 2 m w ˆ q ˆ cos α w α q 0 for α w α q 2 n 1 π 2 n 0 1 2 the example above shows that inertial forces have a non zero mean value even when assuming a simplified case with completely linear conditions whenever the phases are not shifted exactly by 90 in this example the mean inertial force depends on the ship mass m the velocity amplitudes w ˆ and q ˆ and on the phase shift between heave and pitch velocity if pitch and heave are completely in phase the mean value would be largest but this is not a realistic scenario a phase shift of 90 may be expected for very long wave to ship length ratios however for normal waves a phase shift different than 90 is expected the measured forces in the ship fixed system are composed of inertial hydrodynamic and gravitational forces this is shown in equations 15 17 where the inertial contributions are labelled with a x a y and m z here m is the suspended mass of the model including all mass below the force gauges the hydrodynamic force moment is labelled with the superscript hydro and the measured force moment with the superscript meas the weight contribution m g t i j γ j results from transforming the gravitational direction to the ship fixed system when the ship pitches and rolls here t i j is the transformation matrix and γ j the three directional cosines for the present investigation the gravitational contributions to the mean forces will be defined to zero because e g for the longitudinal force already a very small mean pitch angle stemming from measuring uncertainties can cause a significant force 15 m u a x 1 ω 2 w a x 2 ω 3 v a x 3 x g ω 2 2 ω 3 2 a x 4 y g ω 3 ω 1 ω 2 a x 5 z g ω 2 ω 1 ω 3 a x 6 f x h y d r

mean forces e g added resistance only contributions with non zero mean values are of importance all inertial contributions from the equations above are analysed and assumptions are made about weather they yield a mean contribution in a harmonically oscillating case with linear waves and averaging over full periods the following mean values are zero u i 0 u i 0 ω i 0 ω i 0 due to symmetry the centre of gravity is on the centreline plane y g 0 the following products of inertia are theoretically zero and vanishing values have been measured i x y 0 i y z 0 the product of inertia i x z is in fact not zero but the measured value 0 238 kgm 2 is not relevant for the present purpose i x z 0 3 3 1 inertial contributions in x direction the inertial force components in ship fixed x direction results from a multiplication of the acceleration terms a x in equation 15 and the oscillating mass m with the assumptions taken above only the following terms have non zero mean values and are evaluated for calculating the mean hydrodynamic force 18 f x 2 m w ω 2 19 f x 3 m v ω 3 20 f x 4 m x g ω 2 2 ω 3 2 21 f x 62 m z g ω 1 ω 3 3 3 2 inertial contributions in y direction in the same

it was confirmed that the omitted terms really yield a zero mean value in case of harmonic motion responses the stated procedure to only consider expected non zero mean contributions yields more reliable results than subtracting all inertial terms from the measured time traces this is due to spurious accelerations resulting from the double derivation of measured motion time traces note that it is of course possible to purge the time traces considering all inertial contributions in order to obtain hydrodynamic time traces but this is only recommended when considering transient processes 4 experimental facility ship model and test campaign the model tests were carried out in the seakeeping basin at technische universität berlin the basin is 120 m long with a maximum test section length of 90 m the width of the basin is 8 m and the water depth was adjusted to 1 m the installed electrical wave generator can be fully controlled from the towing carriage by computer with the installed software long crested regular waves and irregular sea states with defined characteristics can be modelled generated and reproduced the wave generator can be operated in flap type or in piston type mode the latter has been used for all present experiments the towing carriage allows a maximum speed of 4 m s and is equipped with the new measurement device the investigated ship model is a cruise ship designed by meyer werft it is a twin screw twin rudder vessel with classical propulsion arrangement a central skeg bilge keels and a bulbous bow the body plan is depicted in fig 7 the main parameters of the cruise ship are listed in table 4 for a precise calculation of the described mean inertial forces and moments all inertia data of the ship needs to be accurately determined this was achieved using a special measurement device developed by the company resonic the model is mounted on a spring loaded platform and linear motions in various degrees of freedom are excited a complex regression analysis is used to compute the position of the centre of gravity cog and the moments and products of inertia of the empty model in a very short time the function of this device and the procedure to obtain a complete inertial data set is explained in klöpper et al 2013 the waves used for the model tests were chosen in a reasonable range of wave length to ship length ratio five wave lengths from λ l p p 0 5 to λ l p p 1 36 with almost constant wave steepness were chosen due to the maximum water depth in the seakeeping basin of tub 1 m waves longer than 2 m will have a certain shallow water influence two additional wave heights for the intermediate wave lengths were considered in order to investigate the effect of the wave steepness h w λ details of the used wave set are shown in table 5 since for low forward speed more strictly speaking τ u ω e g 0 25 yasukawa et al 2018 the incoming wave is influenced by the waves radiated by the ship the waves were measured in advance without the ship model to check the wave quality the deviations of the measured wave period from the target values were smaller than 1 while the deviations of the wave amplitude were between 3 and 6 the performed tests comprised added resistance tests in head waves at 21kn and two additional velocities the influence of the longitudinal spring stiffness and of a complete suppression of surge motion was tested as well as the influence of the wave height in addition the fully fixed model all dof inhibited was investigated in selected conditions at zero forward speed the tests comprised a large set of encounter wave angles also fixed model tests and stiffness variations tests were performed 5 results of model tests an extract of the performed model tests is presented here the results are structured in topics of interest fig 8 shows the measurement device during head wave tests at zero forward speed the repeatedly measured calm water resistance amounts to r 0 5 8 n in free sinkage and trim condition and to r 0 f 5 65 n in completely fixed condition for evaluating the tests the mean forces and moments are made non dimensional as stated in equation 28 here the force and moment sign is in accordance with the ship fixed coordinate system directions a positive longitudinal force would therefore push the model forward 28 f f ρ g l p p ζ w 2 m m ρ g l p p 2 ζ w 2 the added resistance coefficient however is calculated so that the values are always positive 29 f a d d f x r 0 ρ g l p p ζ w 2 all tests in the subsequent paragraphs are performed for the freely moving ship at 21 kn full scale and the spring setup 3 unless stated otherwise 5 1 added resistance in waves the measured added resistance at 21 kn in head and following waves for the freely moving ship and the fixed ship configuration is shown in fig 9 as dashed lines the added resistance is obtained by averaging the longitudinal force over a sufficient number of periods at least five attention was paid to the fact that the model has already entered a harmonic motion in head waves a pronounced maximum can be seen close to λ 1 in following waves μ 0 the added resistance is rather small and becomes negative pushing the ship forward for waves longer than λ 1 1 the solid line represents the pure hydrodynamic wave force where mean inertial force contributions have been subtracted as indicated in section 3 3 the pure hydrodynamic force in relatively long head waves where motions become significant is about 20 larger compared to the measured force without subtracting inertial forces in following waves the mean inertial forces are almost zero for all wave lengths the added resistance of the completely fixed model is also shown in fig 9 in head seas the added resistance is almost constant in following waves it slightly decreases towards long waves but does not become negative as for the free model during these fixed model tests very large force amplitudes were measured arising from the wave exciting force but also inertial forces during the acceleration and deceleration phase of the towing carriage justifying the necessity of the chosen force gauge range a comparison of added resistance predictions for the free model at 21 kn with other experiments and cfd calculations can be seen in fig 10 the measured mean forces can be directly compared to the ones from hsva valanto and hong 2015 the dotted lines show very similar values except for the shortest wave length λ 0 5 the cfd calculation from ude sigmund and el moctar 2016 and the tub calculations with the rans code neptuno are close to each other disregarding the shorter waves where the results from neptuno are probably less accurate due to insufficient resolution in the discretisation of the computational domain for waves larger than λ 0 75 the calculated forces are larger than the measured mean forces because inertial effects are not taken into account in the code however when compared with the experimental pure hydrodynamic force the values agree well for long waves this shows that for comparing results from experiment and cfd simulations it is crucial to compare equivalent data identifying distinct contributions the total longitudinal force on the model towed in fixed condition compared to the data obtained with neptuno is plotted in fig 11 when the model is fixed the measured forces are purely hydrodynamic and more precisely just wave exciting forces made up of a diffraction and the froude krylov force and can therefore directly be compared to the numerical calculation both data sets agree fairly for most wave lengths showing that the tests in fixed conditions are adequately captured with a rans code without any post processing of forces particulars on the cfd calculations can be found in part b of this paper uharek and cura hochbaum 2018 5 2 influence of motion restraints the stiffness constants of the used spring constellations are listed above in table 2 during the fixed surge condition only the rear δ x slide was fixed so that the heave and pitch motion was not restrained the resulting added resistance coefficients are shown in fig 12 at wave length λ l p p 1 the mean forces for all stiffness s are of same magnitude for λ l p p 0 75 only the fixed surge condition has a slightly smaller mean measured value note that the spring combination 1 was not suitable for added resistance tests due to the large spring elongation caused by the calm water resistance the present measurements confirm the behaviour stated by other researchers in previous studies during added resistance tests in head waves the model can be fixed in surge and the measured mean forces will not be affected as stated in section 3 a different surge amplitude is expected for each spring stiffness however the surge motion in head seas at this high forward speed is rather small for the investigated waves therefore a restriction of this small motion does not affect the measured mean forces when looking at the surge motion rao in fig 13 all three stiffness constants yield almost the same amplitudes especially for λ l p p 0 75 as expected the highest surge amplitude results for the highest stiffness in the longer waves interestingly the lowest stiffness does not yield the smallest amplitude but the medium one does this occurrence could not be explained yet and should be further investigated note that the surge fixed case does also have a small non zero surge motion amplitude this is because the model is fixed at the point p being at a different height then the origin o of the ship fixed coordinate system while o experiences a small surge motion due to the pitch motion a series of tests was performed to gain knowledge about the influence of restraining single motions on the resulting added resistance in head wave conditions first the surge and sway motion was suppressed then the heave and pitch motion due to the measurement device design it was not possible to restrain heave or pitch separately the results are shown in fig 14 as stated above fixing the surge motion did not change the mean forces significantly compared to the surge free reference case when only fixing the heave and pitch motion the added resistance dropped significantly for the three tested waves and the values almost coincide with the tests for the fully fixed model this behaviour implies that the energy loss due to wave radiation stems completely from heave and pitch motions and the wave diffraction is nearly independent of a small surge motion 5 3 influence of wave steepness the influence of the wave steepness on the added resistance coefficient f a d d for the free model at 21 kn is shown in fig 15 the largest wave height leads to the smallest added resistance value and vice versa it seems that the assumption of a quadratic dependence of mean wave forces on the wave amplitude is not applicable for at least two of the investigated waves for this hull form especially the lowest and almost linear steepness leads to a clearly higher coefficient pinkster 1980 found a similar behaviour when he investigated this dependence for a tanker at zero speed sibul 1971 also varied the wave steepness during tests with a fast series 60 vessel and found that the wave amplitude squared dependence of forces near the added resistance rao peak only applies for high wave steepness for low steepness he found the dependence being of a power higher than two these observations made in the past also match the findings of the present campaign looking at the hydrodynamic force in fig 15 it seems that the mean non dimensional inertial force does not change much with the wave amplitude the offset between measured and hydrodynamic force is almost the same except for the smallest wave steepness where the model motions are smaller altogether 5 4 static drift tests tests with a static drift angle are a possibility to superpose oblique wave forces and forces due to a drift motion although the situation same drift and encounter angle is not realistic these tests are of interest to validate a mathematical model for the hydrodynamic forces which is used for predicting manoeuvres in waves see uharek and cura hochbaum 2015 and cura hochbaum and uharek 2016 the spring stiffness was chosen as high as possible constellation 4 for these tests in order to minimize the effect of an additional yaw angle due to the wave induced yaw moment the initial drift angle β was set in a way that during the tests for 21 kn full scale the desired angle of 10 15 and 20 was reached the results for the longitudinal force can be seen in fig 16 the calm water results are represented by the solid black line the force is highest near 10 and decreases towards larger drift angles at the shortest wave of λ l p p 0 5 the longitudinal force is almost the same as in calm water the longer waves not only increase the resistance significantly but they also invert the tendency of the declining calm water forces towards larger drift angles this behaviour is consistent with the fact that the added resistance is largest at an encounter angle of roughly μ 210 for waves of medium length the side force is shown in fig 17 where the solid black line is the calm water reference it is very interesting that the side force does not increase in the considered oblique waves but even slightly decreases for small angles e g 10 compared to the calm water mean force especially the wave of length λ l p p 0 97 causes a smaller total mean side force at low drift angles similar to the side force the measured yaw moment with drift in waves are very close to the calm water values see fig 18 this indicates that for the considered combinations of β and μ the side force and yaw moment due to drift in calm water are highly dominant compared to the wave induced mean force and moment similar results were obtained by tello ruiz et al 2016 for a container ship in shallow water 5 5 zero speed mean wave forces at zero speed the mean forces due to waves at different encounter angles can be measured the measurement device with the current set up can easily vary the wave encounter angle from μ 180 to μ 0 for the present purposes in 30 steps the measured results for the longitudinal force coefficient are shown in fig 19 the largest coefficients are caused by the shortest waves the force coefficients decrease for longer waves but do not become nearly zero as expected from theory this may be due to the friction of the slides leading to slightly different stopping positions at maximum displacement in combination with a somewhat low sensitivity of the force gauges in this scenario the mean forces are very small the side force coefficients f y are shown in fig 20 the shortest waves again lead to the largest values especially for short waves the maximum force is not at μ 90 but shifted towards larger and smaller angles the side force coefficient decreases quickly for longer waves the yaw moment coefficient is shown in fig 21 for the encounter angles μ 60 and 120 the shortest wave yields the largest moment however for other encounter angles longer waves yield larger moment coefficients it is also observable that the yaw moment does not decrease significantly for longer waves leading to the conclusion that long waves may also cause large yaw moments in contrast to the side force behaviour 6 conclusions a new measurement device for seakeeping tests has been designed built tested and used for a measurement campaign at technische universität berlin forces moments and motions on of the ship model in waves are obtained accurately with the implemented experimental setup consisting of nested slides held by linear springs single motions can be restrained to analyse their influence on the mean forces and on other motions disregarding suppressing surge motions for instance does not affect the added resistance in head sea condition but this cannot be extrapolated for other encounter angles and motions do in general have a large influence on mean forces the friction of the used ball bearings at the rails may have a small effect on the maximum motion amplitudes but does not affect the measurements considerably it has been shown that the contribution of non hydrodynamic inertial forces to the total forces and moments may be considerable this it is essential to subtract them from the measurements in order to get pure hydrodynamic forces on the ship in waves e g for the comparison with cfd resutls acknowledgements the authors would like to express their gratitude towards the german ministry of economic affairs and energy as well as the european commission for supporting this work through the projects persee and shopera we also thank sebastian uharek
